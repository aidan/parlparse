<H4><center>[Mr. John McWilliam in the Chair]</center></H4>
<H3><center><a href="/pa/cm199798/cmbills/095/1997095.htm">School Standards and Framework Bill</a></center></H3>
<H4><center>Clause 43</center></H4>
<H4><center>Maintained schools to have budget shares</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed [10 February], That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Question again proposed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stephen Dorrell (Charnwood):</B> I begin my speech in slightly unusual circumstances in that I had hoped to have tabled an amendment to clause 43. However, that was rendered impossible because we reached the clause stand part debate at the end of our previous sitting more quickly than I had anticipated. [Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Members of the Committee seem to have trouble settling down this morning.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> The amendment would have given me the opportunity to probe the Government's reaction to certain principles. What do the Government think should determine the horizontal distribution of resources within the schools system? We shall discuss vertical distribution later for example, how much should go to the schools and how much should go to the LEAs?
<P>
How should the schools system relate the resources allocated to a particular school to the needs, background and specific costs associated with providing education for that group of children? One of the characteristics of our school funding system is that two schools can have remarkably similar catchments in terms of the social background of the children and the level of attainment of individual children, but have markedly different resource levels per pupil.
<P>
Even if the Government had been attracted by the amendment that I had wanted to table to clause 43, which is the main introductory clause to the budgeting provisions, I am sure that they would have found flaws in its drafting. Its principles would have required that the allocation of resources into a school's budget share should be calculated to reflect, first, the number of children in the school, secondly, their general education needs and, thirdly, any special costs associated with the area where the school was based.
<P>
The key principle to consider is whether, in allocating budgets between individual schools, we are funding the needs of the institution and the costs associated with its particular structure, or whether we should be looking behind the institution and linking the resources to the specific needs of the children. The Government should be seeking to relate the resources going into an individual school to factors such as whether the school has a substantial number of children for whom English is not their first language or whether it gives support to children doing homework at home.
<P>
<B>Dr. George Turner </B>(North-West Norfolk): Will the right hon. Gentleman take the opportunity to welcome the news about the &#163;300,000 that was heralded in clause 3? My constituents will be rejoicing this morning that schools with five, six and seven-year-olds in classes of more than 30 will have the money to bring that situation to a speedy end.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> The Committee has already debated clause 3. We can return to those arguments if the hon. Gentleman wishes, but I would prefer to hear the Minister's response to the more fundamental question: is he interested in relating resources more closely to the resident population of a local authority area rather than to the cost structure of a particular school?
<P>
Those ideas were developed by the Funding Agency for Schools. The Minister has repeatedly told the Committee that he is keen that the Government should learn from ideas developed under the previous Administration, although they may not always accept them. I hope that the Minister will acknowledge the work done by the funding agency in developing the common funding formula, and that that is reflected in the future distribution of resources between schools.
<P>
In this new world, when determining a standard spending assessment for a local education authority, and also when determining its function, we should give more consideration to the background of the children, and their identified needs. The resources directed towards the education of those children should be related more specifically to their individual needs.
<P>
The matter is brought to a head in paragraph 11 of the Minister's guidance note on the local management of schools. On the subject of the allocation of funds, it states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The existing rules governing the allocation of funds by LEAs to schools are well established. They are: that the majority of the available funding should be allocated on a pupil-led basis and that the remainder should be allocated on the basis of objective factors or criteria."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
What does the Minister mean by objective factors or criteria? For instance, would they include the fact that the teaching force of a school was experienced and therefore relatively expensive as a result of the teachers' pay scales? Or should we look past the teachers and the costs of the school to the needs of the children, recognising that the needs of some children will be more expensive to meet than the needs of others and that the needs of the resident population should determine the allocation of funds?
<P>
The Funding Agency for Schools was seeking to develop such ideas in the GM sector. It is a relatively new development, but it is familiar to me because it is the basis on which the national health service weighted capitation formula works. That is not subject to party-political controversy; it has always had bi-partisan agreement.
<P>
What we seek to achieve in the national health service a universal service is to relate the flow of resources to the needs of resident populations. My purpose this morning is to encourage the Minister to develop that idea for education, so that the flow of[Mr. Dorrell]
 resources for schools should, in the same way, be related to the needs of the resident population. Thus, when the parents of a child choose a school, the resources that flow into that school should relate more to the child's needs and background and less to the school's history.
<P>
I shall be interested to hear the Minister's response to that train of thought.
<P>
<B>Mr. Phil Willis </B>(Harrogate and Knaresborough): It would have helped if an amendment had been tabled, because the right hon. Member for Charnwood (Mr. Dorrell) now says the opposite of what the Tory party said when in office. The current policy has created a rigidity of funding through the formula system. That does not allow what the right hon. Gentleman is now arguing for, which we would support.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I apologise to the hon. Gentleman for intervening so early in his speech. He might like to relate that proposition to the fact that it was under the previous Government that the Funding Agency for Schools was developing the common funding formula.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Jamieson </B>(Plymouth, Devonport): It has taken a long time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> The Government Whip says from a sedentary position that it has taken a long time, which is the case. The formula system that was developed under the previous Government put a straitjacket on the ability of LEAs to allocate resources to particular areas or children, especially those who were not statemented or those who had no problem with English.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Charnwood will recall that, in their latter days, the previous Government axed the additional funding that went to schools to support children who had problems because English was their second language. It is increasingly obvious that the previous Government's policy is being turned on its head and, frankly, we welcome the right hon. Gentleman's new approach.
<P>
We would like to support the right hon. Member for Charnwood on one point, which we would expect the Minister to clarify. It is obvious that in urban areas with similar catchments, similar numbers of children attending schools, similar building costs and so on, you will find that the needs of one school will be significantly different from another. Frankly, I do not know how the Minister will resolve that problem, unless he gives LEAs greater discretion in allocating resources. Yet the right hon. Member for Charnwood and the Minister are determined that there must be a rigid break between the general schools budget and the aggregated schools budget to make clear what will be delegated to schools and what will be dealt with centrally by the LEA, but you cannot have it both ways.
<P>
We would argue for greater flexibility and for LEAs to be able to recognise particular needs, even those that might be transient. It is essential that they are able to allocate those resources. We hope that the Minister responds positively.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before I call the hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West (Mr. Brady), I remind hon. Members that they are addressing the Chairman and, therefore, when the say, "You", they mean me.
<P>
<B>Mr. Graham Brady </B>(Altrincham and Sale, West): Thank you, Mr. McWilliam. I shall try not to deviate from that instruction.
<P>
I support the speech of my right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood. The principles that underlie his speech are those of fairness and clarity. I am sure that all hon. Members would endorse those virtues.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster </B>(Bath): If the hon. Gentleman is entirely supporting the speech of the right hon. Member for Charnwood, is he therefore supporting the notion that, if an LEA receives a child from outside its area, it should receive the sum that would have been attached to the child had he or she gone to school outside that LEA?
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on his fairness and clarity in expressing his point. I have no difficulty with that proposition.
<P>
Resources should relate to the children in question, not to the institution. That is central to our case. Two benefits would arise from that approach. First, there would be an incentive for schools to maximise the benefit that they can derive from the resources that follow the children. Secondly but significantly, given that the Bill will greatly change the structure of schools it would guarantee fairness in the allocation of funds between schools as those changes come into effect.
<P>
Given the shift away from grant-maintained schools, such a formula, ensuring that money followed the children, not the institution, would encourage local authorities to take a fair, even-handed approach to all the schools in their area.

<P>

<B>The Minister for School Standards (Mr. Stephen Byers):</B> The right hon. Member for Charnwood has addressed an important and interesting issue: how, once the size of the cake has been agreed, an LEA allocates it to schools in its area. We should address that horizontal issue. I had thought that the right hon. Gentleman was going to congratulate the Government on the fact that we are this morning allocating &#163;291,000 to Leicestershire where his constituency is located which will help 1,800 five, six and seven-year-olds who would otherwise have been in classes of more than 30 pupils this September, to be in classes of 30 or fewer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> On that point, does the Minister think it appropriate that members of the Labour party received advance notification of the announcement that was made at 9 am today and were also given a draft press release that they could send out in advance of that announcement?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before I call the Minister, I remind the Committee that we are dealing with clause 43, not the standing orders of the parliamentary Labour party.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I am pleased to draw a distinction between the actions of the parliamentary Labour party and campaigners within it who have nothing to do with the Government or Ministers. If Liberal Democrats had greater experience of office, they too would understand the difference. However, we have sympathy for the fact that they have been out of office for generations and do not have such experience. [Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) should not heckle.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> Why not?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I shall tell the hon. Gentleman why not: because if he persists in doing so, I shall have no alternative but to suspend the Committee and report the matter on the Floor of the House, giving the names of offenders.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> We were talking about the allocation of the cake not the &#163;22 million cake for reducing class sizes, but that of individual LEAs. A debate has gone on for some years about whether there should be a national funding formula. Now that we have a national curriculum, it would be logical to have a curriculum-led amount of funding for each child, whether in key stage 1, 2, 3 or 4. The Government are considering that form of funding, as did the previous Government; it would be wrong for any Government to refuse to consider it in appropriate circumstances. Our difficulty is that, under the present arrangements, the level of funding for schools is helped enormously by individual local authorities deciding to top up the amounts of money that central Government make available. I commend the two thirds of LEAs that receive extra money from their local authority to enable them to improve the quality of education. Many of us are worried that moving to a national funding formula would act as a disincentive to local authorities to provide such additional resources to help schools meet the challenges in their communities.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I am grateful to the Minister and I understand that argument. Another decision has to be made: whether we want the total level of resources committed to the school system to be finally decided at local authority or national level. Whichever decision one makes does not necessarily affect the decision about whether it is desirable to have national principles that determine the distribution within an LEA area of the sum allocated to the schools budget by the local authority.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I was about to come to that. Allocation is an issue when deciding the level of the aggregated schools budget, plus the element of the potential schools budget, which will be included within it. The Government's view is that the majority of funding should be allocated on a pupil-led basis. There is a curriculum need for every child that must be accommodated within the funding on a pupil-led basis. However, discretion will be necessary to meet the particular circumstances of individual pupils, including social background, poverty levels and so on.
<P>
We must try to get the balance right. I know that many schools may feel that they are being discriminated against because they see neighbouring schools a couple of miles down the road getting &#163;150 per pupil more under the delegated scheme. We must have clarity in the local authority scheme, so that schools know precisely why there is a difference in the allocation of funding. The local authority should be able to defend publicly the reasoning behind its exercise of power and the flexibility that we intend to give it.
<P>
Even under the existing arrangements that we inherited, we have given local authorities greater flexibility. We did not make much of a song and dance about it, but just before Christmas, on 22 December, we informed local education authorities that they would now have the freedom in their local management schemes not to treat teachers' salaries on an average basis across the whole authority, which was the regime that we inherited. We allowed them the discretion to operate a local management scheme on the basis of actual teacher salary costs. That is a matter that people have been arguing over for years. As a result of our guidance on local authorities' local management schemes for the year starting this April, we have given local authorities the flexibility to allocate on the basis of actual, rather than average, salaries across the whole authority.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I very much welcome the Government's plans and should be interested to hear the response that they have received around the country. Will the Minister confirm that, before changes can be made to the next financial year's budget, there will be a requirement for consultation? Clearly, that could have an impact on the timing of any changes that may take place. Will the Minister bring us up to date on what is happening?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> As the hon. Gentleman rightly said, there is a requirement under the existing arrangements, which were introduced by the previous Administration, and there will be a clear requirement under this Bill, for full consultation to take place about local management schemes. Local authorities have to submit their schemes to the Secretary of State for approval, which they are in the process of doing. I shall be more than happy to let the hon. Gentleman know exactly what local authorities have applied to do with regard to the relationship between average and actual. My own view is that they may not go for it in a big way this year, but when they think it through properly, they may embrace that flexibility in subsequent years. Time will tell.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> Does the Minister accept that his remarks about actual and average teacher salary costs highlight the issue that I am trying to draw out? If you have a local management system that simply tells a school, "You have an above-average teacher cost" because it has a stable and experienced teacher force, so more money flows to it rather than to another school, which has difficulty holding on to its teachers because it is in a less attractive area to live and work, you would end up with a perverse result. Schools in relatively stable, attractive areas would attract resources because that is where teachers prefer to stay. The schools with difficult children will be given fewer resources because their teacher force turns over much more quickly. That would be a perverse consequence of focusing on the actual, as opposed to average, teacher cost rather than on the needs of the pupils.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The right hon. Gentleman should not lead members of the Committee into bad habits: he repeatedly said "you".
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> Many people think that it is true that Leafy Lane high school has stable staff who are inclined to remain for several years, whereas Gas Works primary school has a dramatic staff turnover presumably because they do not like looking at the gas works. That was also my view; however, having studied in detail the location of the long-serving teachers, I now know that it is not always the case. Leafy Lane high school is likely to have quite a high turnover, through staff doing well and moving on, and many inner city schools, particularly secondary schools, have a low staff turnover, with staff who have moved up the incremental scale and are on higher than average salaries. It is a complicated situation, which makes life more difficult but so be it.
<P>
If a local authority has many teachers who remain loyal to it and its schools, and who are therefore on higher than average salaries, that is a strong argument for the local authority to provide a bigger cake of resources to schools, which will then be able to meet the needs of those teachers. Everyone knows that one reason schools begin to fail is because they have a high staff turnover and little stability. There is no easy answer to the problem, but local politicians who are concerned about education should be able to make the case for more funding to meet those requirements.
<P>
We must have enough flexibility within the local scheme to allow local authorities to respond judiciously to the needs of individual pupils; by judiciously, I mean in a way that will not be offensive or perceived as unfair to neighbouring schools. It is difficult to get the balance right. The Government believe that not only the individual local authority has a role here, but central Government, particularly through our new standards fund. There is an argument that funds, especially in areas such as literacy, numeracy and head teacher training, should be targeted to help the pupils that the right hon. Member for Charnwood mentioned. We might be able to have it both ways: greater recognition within a local authority scheme of the needs of individual pupils, without causing problems for the majority of pupils. If individual pupils receive additional help for specific needs from central Government, through the standards fund, we may be able to overcome the problems of, for example, a child whose first language is not English.

<P>

<B>Mr. Brady:</B> Does the Minister have any thoughts about whether the measures used to assess social deprivation in regard to schools and pupils could be more sophisticated? Could there be better methods of assessment?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> We are reviewing the additional education needs allowance within the standard spending assessment, with the intention of consulting during the late summer and autumn on whether we can introduce changes to that element for April of next year. The additional education needs allowance is the index for education that calculates social deprivation and poverty, and a range of factors are built into it. The difficulty to which the hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West referred may have arisen because many local authorities are inclined to use free school meals as the only indicator of poverty. That is a blunt way of measuring poverty; there are far more subtle and appropriate ways. We shall take account of a range of factors in regard to the additional education needs allowance; local authorities may then want to reflect on whether those factors will help them meet their requirements on social needs.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Dr. George Turner:</B> I remind my hon. Friend that local authorities were given no choice. The previous Government made sure that they were not allowed to take certain factors into account. I know of one local authority that was prevented from taking professional advice on how to distribute funds. I welcome my hon. Friend's willingness to allow some decisions to be made locally.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend. The Government seek a balance between two competing views, which is always difficult. One view is that no account should be taken of social needs. I was pleased to hear the right hon. Member for Charnwood express the opposite view, saying on behalf of the Opposition that we need to reflect on social need. We do not often hear Conservative party education spokesmen say that.
<P>
The Government believe that account can be taken of social needs in two ways by giving local education authorities flexibility, and by providing money from the standards fund to help in specific areas. We hope that the combination will meet the needs of individual pupils and not cause potential resentment between neighbouring schools.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Theresa May </B>(Maidenhead): I wish to pursue the problem of free school meals. The free school meals measure was often used in the LMS formula and freely chosen by local authorities as a measure of special needs. Much debate took place on what other measures could be used in allocating funds for special needs, much work was done by local education authorities, but the number of free school meals seemed to be the best measure. Many authorities adopted that reluctantly because they felt that a better means of identifying special needs could be found; some authorities developed their own formula. I hope that the Government will address the long-standing problem of the number of free school meals being used to identify extra funding required for special educational needs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I know from my own experience that special educational needs can, under present arrangements, be taken into account when allocating money separately from pupil-led funding. Many authorities take that into account as well as considering eligibility for free school meals. It is one of a range of factors that can be taken into account.
<P>
I hope that I have been able to reassure the right hon. Member for Charnwood that we are conscious of the broader question of national funding. We are not minded presently to go down that road, although we will keep the matter under review. People are putting forward strong arguments, to which we should listen. However, because local authorities generally are supportive of their school system, additional money is being put in.
<P>
We believe that local flexibility to meet local demands, coupled with greater support from central Government through the standard spending assessment, strikes the right balance. That balance is reflected in clause 43, which is why I urge hon. Members to ensure that it stands part of the Bill.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 43 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 44</center></H4>
<H4><center>Determination of LEA's general schools budget and aggregated schools budget</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 257, in page 34, line 7, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(c) provide that the aggregated schools budget determined by a local education authority for any financial year must exceed such proportion of its general schools budget as may from time to time be determined by the Secretary of State.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In developing my argument, Mr. McWilliam, I shall try to say "one" when appropriate and not to lapse into the vernacular and say "you". I shall seek to employ the royal "one".
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Perhaps I can assist the right hon. Gentleman. I do not mind. I understand that the Modernisation Committee is considering the matter, but that is what is required at present.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I seek to develop the thinking that is implicit in clause 44. The amendment would give the Secretary of State power to determine a minimum level of delegation from the general schools budget for an LEA into its aggregated schools budget. As the Minister has said, that is because he wants decisions on resources to be delegated to schools as far as possible. He has also said that the gold standard the yardstick by which the success of meeting the objective should be measured should be the system that was established for grant-maintained schools and that that level delegation should be sought across the maintained school system. I hope that that remains his view.
<P>
We want that system to apply not only to the money that is available to buy in advisory services and so forth, but to some of the more basic administrative costs, which some schools think they can deliver more effectively themselves. We should always seek to press money down from LEA level into schools. That is an essential discipline to impose on any large organisation the maintained school system is a huge series of organisations.
<P>
There is a tendency for bodies halfway down the system that are responsible for distributing cash to convince themselves that their institutional needs are more pressing and that they deliver a better service than those at the front line. Those at the front line do not always find that argument persuasive. Money should be driven as far as possible down into the system.
<P>
Under clause 44(3)(b), limits for certain services that LEAs deliver are specified so that an LEA cannot determine that it needs resources above a certain limit to retain a specific service. In addition to those specific limits, amendment No. 257 would put an overall limit on how much of a general schools budget an LEA can retain. That would ensure that, although individual limits were met, a substantial amount of money could not stick at an essentially bureaucratic level, rather than at the front line of the service.
<P>
In the paper that the Minister sent around on Monday, he thoughtfully provided a table on the variation in delegation performance in the system. The table shows that Bournemouth delegtes only 85 per cent. of its budget, but that Dudley delegates 96.3 per cent. of its budget. The Minister also provided a figure for the extra spend per pupil that would occur if every LEA delegated to the same extent as Dudley If those figures are to be meaningful, a definition of general schools budget and aggregated schools budget is a prerequisite. That would mean that we were comparing apples with apples, not apples with oranges.
<P>
In defining those two budgets, the Government should set themselves a reasonably ambitious objective for the proportion of money that they expect LEAs to delegate. If the Government want to ensure that objectives for maximum delegation are met, there should at least be a reserve power to set a minimum delegation limit. That would represent an important strengthening of discipline. I hope that the Minister will respond favourably to that proposal.
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> I wholeheartedly support the amendment moved by right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood. Members of the Committee will recall that we touched on the issue in an earlier debate thanks to your indulgence, Mr. McWilliam. The Minister said at that time that it was his hope and expectation that the system would be simplified and would allow greater delegation of funds from local education authorities to schools. That was how I interpreted his remarks, and that is the implication of the paper that he circulated, referring to the delegation of schools being
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"as close as we can get to the level of budget management currently applying in the GM sector".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That paper makes various other references to the need to ensure that as much money as possible is delegated to schools. The table at the end is very helpful in showing the extreme variation between local authorities, even with the current requirements, and the percentage of budget that is delegated down to schools. I assume that the table either draws on or expands work that has been published by the Centre for British Teachers, an organisation to which I have referred before. I apologise for referring to it again, but I think that I got the name wrong before, so I trust that I have rectified that by referring to it correctly this time.
<P>
That organisation has done some interesting work in examining the extent to which local authorities retain funds back at the centre and the extent to which the percentage delegation figures can sometimes give a misleading picture of exactly what is being done in local authorities. It is important for the Secretary of State to have the power, as proposed in the amendment,[Mrs. May]
to ensure that significant amounts of money will be delegated to the schools.
<P>
The paper that was circulated referred to the new structure being simpler than the existing one, which I found a little difficult to see, but I trust that there will be clarification of exactly what should be delegated to schools and what local authorities can retain at the centre. Having said that, I am disappointed in the clause. Although it appears to support maximum amounts of money being delegated to schools, it does not give the Secretary of State the power to enable him to set a minimum.
<P>
I support the amendment, especially because of clause 44(1). As my right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood said, it is slightly difficult to assess until we see the specific regulations, which I understand are being considered by the working party referred to in the Minister's paper. The amendment would tighten up the language. I believe that as much money as possible should be delegated to schools. The emphasis should be on schools initially having all the money, then deciding what it is essential for the local education authority to have, rather than deciding, as currently happens, what a local authority needs to keep before sending the rest to the schools. Although I accept the practical problem raised in the Minister's paper about the bureaucracy involved in schools buying back services from the local authority, it is important for schools to have the flexibility to choose whether to do that or whether to buy services from elsewhere. Schools must have the maximum amount of budget delegated to them so that they can make decisions about what works for them, such as the best service or professional advice to suit their needs. It should not be a matter of the local authority saying that such services will be provided from the centre, so money will be held back at the start.
<P>
It is important to give encouragement for the maximum amount of money to be delegated to schools, which is why I support the amendment. It would be a further belt-and-braces approach and give power to the Secretary of State to set the minimum figure and to say that schools must delegate a certain amount of their budget. That is important if we are to achieve what we want, which is maximum flexibility at schools level.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I do not think that there is a problem and I am not sure that the amendment would achieve the objective that most of us seek. We want to delegate money from the general schools budget to individual schools, whenever possible and wherever value for money will be achieved.
<P>
The amendment is using the yardstick of the general schools budget on which to base the amount, which then flows down to the aggregated schools budget. The problem that applies to authorities as a whole is that, by its nature, the general schools budget, unless prescriptively defined, will include matters such as home-support transport, which is appropriately held back by local education authorities and varies enormously from one local authority to another. There is concern about using the general schools budget as the benchmark.
<P>
There must be clarity in defining exactly what functions are local authority functions and what will be delegated to individual schools. There must be a power to decide how much can be spent locally on those functions that could be a percentage or an actual financial amount. Clause 44(3)(b) allows us to exercise those powers in terms of individual functions as well as all the functions in total. We intend to use that power to say precisely how much a local authority school be spending on a particular service or how much it should be spending on the totality of those services.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> Does the Minister believe that the clause allows him to define an exhaustive list of functions for which an LEA is responsible so that anything else that the LEA did would be ultra vires? Is he saying that he can impose a limit on every activity under the exhaustive list that the LEA can undertake?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I am not sure that ultra vires is the correct expression to use; such action may be within the LEA's powers elsewhere in discharging its statutory functions.
<P>
The clause deals with local management. The working group to which the hon. Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May) referred is considering what functions should be the responsibility of local education authorities and what functions need to be delegated to individual schools. When that has been determined, the power under clause 44(3)(b) will allow the Secretary of State to prescribe for each of those functions an amount or a percentage that can be accounted for. We will also have the power to prescribe the total amount or a percentage for the overall spend that does not go to schools.
<P>
The amendment deals with when there might be difficulties because of variations between authorities, but we would much rather have the power under clause 44(3)(b), which will allow the Secretary of State to exercise that power either precisely or generally. We agree with the principle behind the amendment, but power exists in the clause to ensure that the sort of abuse, which Opposition Members are concerned about, will not occur.
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> Will the Minister elaborate on the issue of the working group? Its results are tied into his argument because they will decide what functions the LEA should provide. How much flexibility will the regulations offer where it is agreed that it is not appropriate for an LEA to provide a function laid down in the regulations?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> The working group, which is made up of all interested parties, is trying to achieve a consensus on those matters, and I wish it well in that objective. Ultimately, the Secretary of State will have a clear list of the functions that he believes are the statutory responsibility of the LEA and which should be funded; everything else will be delegated down to school level, and it will be for an individual school to say whether it wants a function. School meals are a good example.
<P>
There is an argument about whether responsibility for school meals should be dealt with by individual schools or by the centre. Let us say that a decision is taken that responsibility for school meals should be delegated to individual schools. A school may feel, legitimately, that it does not want the burden of operating a school meal service, and may therefore decide that it would prefer the local authority to continue to do so. Rather than going through the procedure of delegating the money to the school, and the school handing it back to the LEA, the school could formally notify the LEA that responsibility for its school meals would be retained centrally and the service provided in that way. It would be for the school to determine whether it wanted to operate in such a way.
<P>
We seek to overcome the confusion at present, by replacing aggregated school budgets, potential schools budgets, discretionary exceptions, mandatory exceptions and general schools budgets which I think I now understand, having spent two hours this morning going through them with a simple system based on a list of LEA responsibilities and nothing else. There will be transparency and clarity; schools will know their position exactly, and that will help enormously in terms of local management.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> The Minister has not entirely persuaded me that his system will be hugely simplified compared with the prevailing system of mandatory and discretionary exceptions, although I wish him well in that endeavour. Under the clause, he still ends up with authorised and required expenditure: two classes of expenditure. I am not sure whether we have taken a huge step forward.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> There are two categories of discretionary exceptions: those that fall within the potential school budget and those that fall outside it, part of which makes up the aggregated schools budget and part of which does not.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I am pleased to have provided the Minister with the opportunity to show off the results of his two hours of preparation.
<P>
Although what the Minister has said is fairly reassuring, I hope that he can assent to my description of the purpose of the clause. Clause 44(3)(a) allows the Secretary of State to prescribe expenditure that is authorised or required so some is compulsory and some is discretionary and under clause 44(3)(b) he is allowed to set a limit for that expenditure. So expenditure that is not classed as authorised or required would be ultra vires, because it would fall outside the regulations that define the powers of the LEA, and all expenditure, discretionary and required, could be subject to a limit. I hope that that is an accurate description of the provisions. On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I warn the right hon. Member for Charnwood that the clause has been debated widely; I am being tolerant in allowing this debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> Once again, I am grateful to you, Mr. McWilliam, for your tolerance. I simply want to ask whether the Minister can explain how he intends to meet the objective of greater simplicity. No one denies that the present rules are complex, and the Minister described some of the inherent complexity of the different budgets. How quickly will we see the regulations provided for under clause 44(3)(a)? Does the Minister envisage that they will restrict LEAs' options for the services that they want to provide. Can he give some examples of where he expects the simplicity to manifest itself?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> A working group of interested organisations is looking carefully at where the line should be drawn. I do not want to pre-empt the outcome of those discussions. It would not be helpful if I were to list the functions and services that should be one thing or the other. I am informed that the working group is making good progress. I meet members of the working group and hear their concerns. We are having a dialogue with all groups, and we are listening carefully to what they say.
<P>
I understand the difficulty of members of the Committee. It was a difficult decision for the Government to take. We had to decide whether to form our own view of whether LEAs or schools should be responsible for the functions, or whether we should try to achieve a consensus involving all the relevant parties. We decided to try to achieve a consensus, recognising that, over the years, there had been animosity between the various groups for a variety of reasons.
<P>
We now want those groups to work together in the new framework under the Bill. One way of doing so is by their being members of the working group and of the earlier group that considered the technical consultation paper. They should be allowed to get on with their work. It would not be helpful if I were to be pressed into naming particular services today. I hope that the right hon. Member for Charnwood will understand the reasons why.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> The Government are adopting a sensible approach. It would be inappropriate to attempt to debate whether LEAs or schools should be responsible for school meals or other difficult issues, such as school transport or music services, until there has been proper consultation. However, the Minister might be placing an additional difficulty on the Committee, about which he might wish to comment. When we debate the code of practice, we must have some indication of the working party's thinking, because whether LEAs are involved in certain functions might have an impact on that code of practice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> May I reflect on that matter and see what progress the working group has made in a week or two's time when we debate the code of practice? The working group is meeting and might have made progress, or it might have been unable to reach an agreement, in which case we might say, "These are the issues, there is no agreement, so the Government are minded to divide the responsibilities in this way."
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> What is the working party's time scale? To set up a working party to seek consensus is to run the risk that it goes on seeking but failing to find. When will the Government conclude that the working party is seeking but not making good enough progress?

<P>

<B>Mr. Byers:</B> The working party has met on several occasions. It met last Friday, and it will continue to do so. It is going through the principles and is addressing the detail. I think that there is a constructive atmosphere, but whether there can be agreement, time will tell.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> Weeks or months?
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> It needs to be sooner rather than later. I want to be able to tell the Committee or to tell the House on Report the stage that we have reached. Hon. Members are rightly concerned, and we want to be open about the allocation of responsibilities and so on. I hope to let hon. Members know myself. If I am unable to do so, we shall give the answer in another place.
<P>
I do not want to be prescriptive. I assure the Committee that we shall give a clear timetable either when we come to debate the code of practice, or on Report. The working group is considering a range of matters, but we could let it know that the Committee wanted it to give the matter priority. I am more than happy to do that, when we come to the code or practice, to say exactly how far the working group has got.
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> The paper circulated on the matter indicated that the working group would consult next month with local education authorities, which would allow decisions to be made in June. That would then be translated into the appropriate legal language for the regulations. I am not sure when that will be. I think that we may be finished before the consultation paper comes out, but a draft timetable has been issued. Will the Minister say whether the working group is still on track for that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> Yes, but we may be able to pull forward its consideration of the responsibilities of local authorities and schools in the context of delegated budgets. The consulation document will be wide ranging and cover a number of questions, including individual bank accounts, carry-forward deficits and surpluses, and son on. [Interruption.]
<P>
However, in relation to clause 44, the working group may be able to give the Committee an indication of its progress sooner rather than later. We shall probably reach the code of practice in about two weeks' time, which will be towards the end of February. It may be able to say then; if not, the Bill is likely to have reached Report stage by the middle of March, when the working group should have something firm to tell the House.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 44 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before we move on to clause 45, I apologise to hon. Members for the extraneous noise earlier. I understand that the phantom clog dancer's clogs have been removed.
<H4><center>Clause 45</center></H4>
<H4><center>Determination of school's budget share</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 260, in page 34, line 11, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(1A) In determining the amount to be allocated to a school defined in section 20(3)(b) which is situated within its area, a local education authority shall not fix a share which represents a lower amount per pupil than was paid to the school in the immediately preceding year.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The purpose of the amendment is straightforward: a local education authority should not fix a school budget share that is less per pupil than the school received in the immediately preceding year. The amendment is designed to assure schools that their resources will not oscillate artificially as a result of the scheme's operation. It also seeks to provide a stable background for schools so that they can continue to recruit the same number of pupils and to meet the same level of need.
<P>
The Government have said much about the priority that they attach to education spending. The delivery of the education service is to be given a higher priority, and we are told that the education spending share is to rise as a share of national income year by year. The amendment would allow the Minister to offer an extremely modest safeguard to schools.
<P>
Draft budgets are currently being circulated by some LEAs. Some schools will find the amendment extremely reassuring because it could lead to an increase in the budgets that they currently anticipate. The Government say that education is their number one priority and that they are determined to raise the share of spending provided for the school service as a share of national income. There is a sharp disparity between that determination and LEAs anticipating cash cuts in the budgets being voted to individual schools.
<P>
The amendment is a test of the Government's seriousness of purpose. Are they willing to give a school the assurance that year by year at lest, in that particular school any reduction in the real resource available to the school to support each child's education would be limited to the rate of inflation? That would be the effect of the amendment. It is an extremely modest reassurance, but it is the type of minimal reassurance that the Government should give to each school, even though they are not currently giving it to some.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> The right hon. Gentleman puts an interesting case, but we want to know what is really behind it. Will he explain when, for example, he imagines the proposal coming into force? Would it be almost immediately if so, it seems that it is designed as a protection for former grant-maintained schools or would it be at a later date, when all schools are operating under an agreed and common-budget regime?
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I am challenging the Government to extend the principle to all schools. Clearly, if it is a principle that would be right tomorrow, it would be hard to argue that it is wrong today.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> Will the right hon. Gentleman confirm that his amendment applies only to schools defined in section 20(3)(b), which is restricted to grant-maintained schools?
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I confirm that that interpretation is correct. The purpose of the amendment is to give effect to the assurance that the Minister has given to schools defined in section 20(3)(b), which was that he wants to raise other schools to that level. If he is not prepared to give his blessing to the amendment, he is saying that, although it is his ambition to raise other schools to the levels of grant-maintained schools, such a desirable objective would have to be taken in good faith. He is saying that, some time in the future, he hopes that he will meet the objective, but that he is not prepared to put a yardstick in the sand to deliver that principle.
<P>
By pointing out that aspect of the amendment, the Minister has moved the argument on to his own words. He told the GM Heads Association that his objective was to raise the standards of other schools to the standard achieved by grant-maintained schools. The hon. Gentleman must demonstrate that he is willing to write the terms of that commitment into the legislation. If he does not accept the amendment, he is saying that it is an aspiration, a nice objective, an ambition one day to raise schools to the levels of GM schools. He is saying that, in the meantime, however, we shall have to accept a diminution of what is provided in grant-maintained schools and an averaging down of those levels, rather than the objective which he plausibly argued to the GM heads would be attractive.
<P>
I am challenging the Government to turn the statement of their policy, which the Minister set out to the GM heads, into something concrete, rather than leaving it an aspiration to be delivered one day. Is the Minister prepared to put his words into actions?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> Yes I am, but not for the reasons that the right hon. Gentleman put forward. It is not appropriate to give protection to one category of school as in the amendment. The amendment says that grant-maintained special schools will be protected in the way in which the right hon. Gentleman has argued, but says nothing about all the other schools and the funding that they might receive. They may be subject to substantial cuts and would not be protected by the amendment. The Government have repeatedly said that, in accordance with the finding of the Public Accounts Committee, many GM schools received funding over and above that received by local authority schools. It is a question not only of delegated budgets, but of additional support. As a result, the pupil unit costs in local authorities are often far higher for GM schools than for the local authority maintained school. We have said that our objective is not to cut the amount being spent on pupils in GM schools, but to increase the funding for pupils in other schools. We are therefore levelling up.
<P>
We believe that it is inappropriate to incorporate in primary legislation a safeguard for one category of school because that would reinforce the divisions created by the establishment of GM schools and would not be helpful in the context of the new framework. However, we recognise that funding for pupils in GM schools is an issue. In line with our commitments, we have put in place protection for pupils at GM schools for 1998-99; that will ensure that the provision in the amendment for no reduction in funding per pupil will be in place in the financial year 1998-99. That guarantee will ensure protection. We are committed to safeguarding existing levels in the grant-maintained sector and to using the additional funding of the &#163;835 million to schools in England to begin to level up schools that are not part of that sector.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> Will the Minister clarify a point? The funds may have been guaranteed for 1998-99; would the Minister also give an assurance about special purpose grants for restructuring in schools that have perhaps only recently become grant maintained? I am thinking particularly of schools that may have a programme of staff changes that would ordinarily take place over a period of three years. Some schools that have recently become grant maintained are now concerned that they may have the funding to carry out those changes only if they all take place in one year.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I was addressing the issues of pupil unit costs and the funding per pupil. I can guarantee that safeguards have been put in place to ensure that there will be no reduction in the cash amount being spent per pupil.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I do not understand the Minister's argument. On the one hand, he appeared not to like the terms of the amendment because it introduced protection 
<P>
<B>Ms Rachel Squire </B>(Dunfermline, West): Two tier.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> On the contrary, the amendment was designed to give effect to the policy that the Minister outlined: that we guarantee no cash cuts and seek to level up. I have no difficulty with the principle of levelling up; I have difficulty with the principle of the Minister giving an assurance, but not being prepared to write it into law. That seems to create the immediate suspicion that the Government want the freedom to resile from it one day. What is the point of giving a reassurance, but resisting writing it into statute?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> The right hon. Gentleman knows full well the point of that. It is exactly the sort of provision that does not appear in primary legislation. One does not include in legislation a measure that protects one group of individuals in terms of funding. If the right hon. Gentleman can refer to an Act of Parliament that does so, I should be grateful if he would draw the Committee's attention to it; I should be surprised if he could find a single instance of such a proposal being written into statute. When the right hon. Gentleman reflects on the matter, I am sure that he will understand why.
<P>
I hope that I have addressed the concerns expressed about restructuring grants. I am sure that the right hon. Gentleman will be pleased to hear that the Funding Agency for Schools, which still has responsibility for such matters, is continuing to make restructuring grants available for the financial year 1998-99.
<P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I am grateful for the Minister's restatement of the principle to level up and the guarantee that pupil funding distributions to GM schools will not mean a cash cut next year. I welcome that, but I do not understand why he is not prepared to write that reassurance into law, so I invite my hon. Friends to use this opportunity to try to do so.

Question accordingly negatived.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 108, in page 34, line 39, after "authorities", insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"with governing bodies, head teachers and otherwise as specified in the regulations".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, it will be convenient to take amendment No. 109, in schedule 14, page 146, line 39, after "authority", insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>", relevant governing bodies and head teachers".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> The amendments are simple and would bring some commonality to the Bill. The Committee will be aware that under clause 45, there is a clear requirement for the local education authority to determine the allocation of a school's budget share in a particular financial year. Clause 45(2)(f) requires
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"consultation to be carried out by such authorities in relation to the factors or criteria which are to be taken into account in determining such shares".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Clause 46 refers to the LEA's schemes on financial matters, and reference is made to schedule 14. Paragraph 1(3)(a)(i) of that schedule states that consultation will be with
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the governing body and the head teacher of every school maintained by the authority as a county, voluntary or maintained special schools".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Later in the schedule, the Secretary of State is given the power to change significantly or impose a completely new scheme. Paragraph 1(5) states that the Secretary of State will consult.
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the authority and such other persons as he thinks fit".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In all three cases, there is a need for consultation. In the first one, it means consultation with whoever it is decided to consult; in the second, head teachers and governing bodies are specified; and in the third, the LEA and others whom the Secretary of State thinks fit will be consulted.
<P>
My two simple amendments would ensure that commonality in the Bill and that consultation takes place with, among others, head teachers and the governing bodies of all the schools concerned.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I shall try to be positive because the Government fully agree with the hon. Gentleman's points about the importance of consultation. It is true to say, especially in the context of amendment No. 108, that we envisage consultation as being a vital part of the regulations that we shall draft under clause 45. We would not support any proposal about which it could not be shown that head teachers and governing bodies had been consulted. Given that assurance, I hope that the hon. Member for Bath will agree that amendment No. 108 is unnecessary.
<P>
It would be difficult to define the word "relevant" in amendment No. 109. We have gone for the blanket approach, which is to apply the provisions to all schools; it is better that all are included. It would be difficult to decide which bodies are relevant in the circumstances. There could be long, drawn-out arguments and disputes about which school is relevant. Our broader approach will be better in the circumstances. Given that the word "relevant" is hard to define, especially if a matter is contentious, the Government's view is that it is far better to be inclusive than exclusive.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his positive comments. The Committee is well aware that the fact that they are on the record will ensure that consultation takes place. I was confident that he would give those assurances because I had looked at the note that was issued to us before the sitting. Paragraph 19 of the note refers to a
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"rigorous consultation requirement".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Paragraph 20 states that that requirement
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"must extend to all maintained schools in the area of the authority".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Given the assurances that the Minister has put on record, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I should like to ask the Minister a specific question on the uncertainty resulting from what he said during the previous sitting about the date on which the new regime for grant-maintained schools will come into effect. During the previous sitting, I think that he said that the new school framework would come into effect in September 1999. When I asked him about the opportunity for schools to change from one type to another in the new framework, he responded by saying that he expected schools to be able to opt to change status a year after the new framework comes into effect. Therefore, a school will be committed to its new place in the framework for a year from September 1999.
<P>
The operative date of September 1999 has raised questions in the minds of some of those in the GM world. If a GM school becomes a foundation school on 30 September 1999, how will its budget be determined for the financial year 1999-2000? In principle, it will be a GM school from 1 April 1999 to the date on which the new framework comes into effect, after which it will be a foundation school in the new world.
<P>
Will the Minister tell us how the budgets of GM schools that change their status halfway through that financial year will be dealt with? What reassurance can he give those schools, other than that which he gave in the previous debate that there would be no cash cut in 1998-99? What will the position be in 1999-2000?
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> I should like to ask the Minister for clarification of clause 45(2)(a), which states that regulations may make provision
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"as to the time when schools' budget shares are to be initially determined by the local education authorities".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I assume that that will set a model for when, during the financial year, schools will learn what their indicative budgets are to be.
<P>
The timetable for making budgets has long been a problem for many schools. The determination of indicative budgets, sending that information to schools and, of course, the determination of final budgets in the local authority's council tax determination process, means that schools often find themselves up against the buffers. I trust that my reading of the clause is correct, and that it will help with that problem. Will the Minister share the Government's thinking on how the regulations might address that particular issue and how subsection (2)(a) might be phrased in the regulations?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I shall deal first with the hon. Lady's question. She is absolutely right to be concerned about information being provided to schools quite late in the day, causing them great difficulty in the budget-making process. In the regulations, we shall seek to bring forward the date by which those provisional allocations should be notified. That is obviously connected with the local government grant settlement and public expenditure generally.
<P>
Perhaps the Government have a lesson to learn and should try to do that sooner, so that local government and schools have time to deal with the consequences of the overall settlement. The intention of clause 45(2)(a) is to ensure that a time is specified so that schools know precisely when they will be notified of that allocation.
<P>
On the point raised by the right hon. Member for Charnwood, I am not sure whether I spoke on Tuesday about the arrangements for the new framework and when we expect the financial arrangements to be introduced. Those arrangements will be introduced separately. The financial arrangements and the new scheme for local management will be introduced at the beginning of the new financial year April 1999. The framework will begin in September 1999. That will obviously create some difficulties, because schools' status will change during the financial year.
<P>
We shall need to ensure that money can continue to be allocated, for instance to grant-maintained schools, for the five months between April and September. We shall table an amendment to ensure that we can continue to fund GM schools for that period. At the moment we shall not be able to do so. It is merely a technical device; the budget will remain the same.
<P>
The budget can be indicated to each grant-maintained school in the spring of 1999. They will then know exactly how much they are to receive, but it will be under the new local management regime introduced by the Bill. During those five months, they will receive that money through a device that we have yet to include in the Bill. Thereafter, they will receive the money through the local education authority, as we discussed earlier.
<P>
I understand that it will not be the most convenient division of responsibilities for some. Most schools welcome the fact that the new framework will not be established until the new school year. They were worried about the possible consequences of having to move to a new category at Easter 1999, when they should be concentrating on examinations and so on. The Government thought it appropriate to begin the school framework in September 1999 and that the new financial arrangements should coincide with the new financial year in April 1999.

<P>

<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> Has the Minister thought about the changes in the responsibilities and liabilities for the buildings when GM schools become foundation schools? I am speaking off the cuff, but are not there changes in the responsibility, and therefore the costs, that schools will have to meet? Is it true that foundation schools will not have to meet costs that they had to meet as GM schools? How will their budgets reflect the fact that a year will begin under one system and continue under the new one?
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> We will need to ensure that the liabilities and responsibilities that remain with the schools concerned will be accommodated during the relevant five-month period. There will be an opportunity for the right hon. Gentleman to raise the issue again when we table the amendment. However, there is no question of the Government walking away from their responsibilities with respect to those liabilities. I assure the right hon. Gentleman that they will be accommodated.
<P>
I want to be open with the Committee. The reason for the present slight difficulty is that we listened to schools, and were told that they would much rather the framework started in September. Originally, we intended it to commence in April 1999, but we tended to the view that that would not help individual schools. We shall introduce it in September and will need to amend the Bill accordingly. We have no problem with that and feel that the Bill will be better as a result.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 45 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 46</center></H4>
<H4><center>LEAs' financial schemes</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 258, in page 35, leave out lines 15 and 16 and insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(a) the implementation of a model scheme prescribed by the Secretary of State permitting the carrying forward from one financial year to another of surpluses and deficits in relation to schools' budget shares.".
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 259, in page 35, leave out lines 25 and 26.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> The amendments deal with details of local authority schemes. The first would replace the current wording in relation to what I believe is called, in central Government parlance at least, end-year flexibility the capacity of a school to carry forward a surplus or deficit from one year to the next. It appears to me impossible that any meaningful local management scheme should not provide for end-year flexibility. I was staggered to hear this week of a school in north Yorkshire where it was believed although I do not[Mr. Dorrell]
confidently assert that I know this belief to be true that there was a constraint on its capacity to use money that it did not want to spend in the current year to meet a liability that would arise the following year. That is very basic stuff, reminiscent of the most absurd rigidities of traditional public sector budgeting processes and, indeed, some private sector budgeting processes of some years ago. Those are widely recognised as having a perverse practical consequence the requirement to spend money before the end of the year, because otherwise you lose it not just for the year in question but probably for the following year too.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. As a former city treasurer, I know what the right hon. Gentleman means, but he was referring to me.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> One loses the money not just for the year in question but for the following year. That remark was a particularly appropriate one to address to you, Mr. McWilliam, given your previous position.
<P>
I do not believe that Conservative Members and the Government differ on this matter in principle, but I hope that the Government will make it clear that it is virtually meaningless to establish a local management scheme without provisions for carrying surpluses and deficits forward. Amendment No. 258 is intended to remove the statement that the regulations may require a carrying-forward from one year to the next and insert a reference to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the implementation of a model scheme"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
setting out basic principles that should be universal in all local authority areas. I accept that there will be variation in schemes according to different circumstances and localities, but the principles of end-year flexibility are virtually universal. I hope that the Minister will give the Committee an assurance, first, that the Government regard EYF provisions as essential to any local management scheme and, secondly, that they will set out precisely what that means so that we avoid having a series of rules arising locally that, either by accident or design, will have the perverse effect that the absence of EYF provision has traditionally had.
<P>
We have all heard the stories, Mr. McWilliam, from your previous world, of local authorities digging up pavements and maintaining kerbstones to ensure that money is spent. No member of the Committee would want to be party to any system that returned to such incentives.
<P>
The purpose of amendment No. 259 is to test the meaning of subsection (2)(e), which requires a scheme to deal with
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"terms on which services and facilities are provided by the authority for schools maintained by them."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I fear that an LEA may set down an arrangement that is offered not on a "take it or leave it" basis, but more on a "thou shalt take it on these terms" basis, stating exactly what services the LEA will provide to a school and the precise terms on which they will be provided.
<P>
That would make a nonsense of local management of schools. The purpose should be to give a school the money and allow it to determine the services on which that money can best be spent to serve the interests of children. Allowing and LEA to determine the services that the school shall secure and to specify the terms on which they shall be provided essentially an imposed contract underwhich the school has no voice is not consistent with the principles of local management of schools.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will reassure us that that is not the intention and, if that will be the effect of the provision, to propose alternative wording to uphold the principle of delegating money to schools and allowing them the freedom to determine their priorities and to assess what services they need and from whom they intend to buy them. The amendments would reinforce the effectiveness of local management of schools.
<P>
This would be an opportune moment to reflect on how the argument has progressed over the past few years. We have come a long way from the educational world of 15 years ago, when the LEA was held responsible for maintaining broken window panes and so forth. I welcome how far we have progressed but, as we argued in earlier sittings, we have further progress to make and I intend to push Ministers still further.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> May I take the right hon. Gentleman back to the model scheme and ask him exactly what he means by it? What powers should the Secretary of State have to impose a model scheme on local authorities? The amendments would give additional powers to the Secretary of State, which obviously goes against the thrust of his argument.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I entirely accept that a centralised standard is intended. I acknowledged that there was scope for local confusions about different aspects of local management schemes. However, the principle of EYF is universal between Departments of central Government, between central and local government and between the public and private sector.
<P>
If the aim is to make institutions accountable for the delivery of a service within a budget, money that has been saved because it was not needed to achieve an objective in one year should be available for the management team to spend in the following year. Otherwise, a school will have no incentive to save and seek better-value solutions. At present, the money that a school cannot spend in a specific financial year is lost, and does not benefit the institution or the children.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I do not dispute the right hon. Gentleman's point. From my local authority experience, I know that getting rid of that culture is important. But neither the Bill nor the regulations under previous Acts of Parliament, remove the basic principle of allowing schools in the delegated schemes to carry over surpluses or deficits.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I thought that I had made it clear that I tabled the amendment because schools told me that their specific local management schemes constrained them. Therefore, I support centralised principles, which set out our expectations for the end of the year. I hope that the Minister will respond favourably to that simple proposition.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick St. Aubyn </B>(Guildford): I was taken to task by the hon. Member for Neath (Mr. Hain) in a previous sitting for suggesting that the Conservative party was in favour of devolving power. However, local management of schools, a system that the previous Government established, is an excellent example of devolution.
<P>
The clause reveals the Government's Jekyll and Hyde nature. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood pointed out, the clause can be interpreted in two ways. It could be read as aiming to continue the process of giving schools more power. The letter from the Department for Education and Employment implies that that is the Minister's aim. However, the clause could also be interpreted differently. Therefore, the amendments, especially amendment No. 259, which would remove subsection (2)(e), should be accepted.
<H4><center>[Mr. Tony McNulty in the Chair]</center></H4>
<P>
I am indebted to the Institute of Economic Affairs, which published an interesting paper by Mr. Dick Atkinson at the end of last year. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"LEAs have `effectively prevented a mixed economy of service provision from developing. Schools have had little purchasing power and the associated opportunities have never been opened up to other providers'."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We should encourage schools to explore other service providers in the private sector. As the report suggests, we should consider ways in which schools can pool resources and act independently of the LEA. At present, schools pool resources to a limited extent, and there is great scope for further development. For example, less than 25 per cent. of schools share finance and audit, or music facilities. Less than 10 per cent. share the use of a minibus. In all those areas, schools could make economies if they were encouraged to make up their own minds about how to spend their money.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Other hon. Members have mentioned issues such as special educational needs and school meals, as well as transport. However, an important matter, which has not been mentioned, deserves to be considered. A recent Select Committee publication on teacher supply referred to the conditions in which teachers have to work, which should be highlighted. The unions and other bodies giving evidence said that not only salaries but the conditions under which teachers have to work can make a difference to the ability of some schools to attract the best possible teachers.
<P>
Above the basic element of teacher salary, schools should have more discretion over the amount that they spend on salaries, on incentives and on improving the conditions under which teachers operate. Amendment No 258 is important in the context of how schools manage their surpluses. They must not feel that if they build up a surplus for a project, it will be at risk and will somehow be purloined by the local education authority or be regarded as a means of putting pressure on a school to force it to spend its surplus as the LEA thinks appropriate, rather than how the school planned to spend it.
<H4><center>[Mr. John McWilliam in the Chair]</center></H4>
<P>
The wording of clause 46(2)(a) is unwise. While it could be argued that the amendment would give further power upstream to the Secretary of State, we assume that he would be wearing the hat of Dr. Jekyll rather than Mr. Hyde and would introduce model rules that would benefit indidvidual schools. We should make it clear that schools are to have control over the planning and use of surpluses, if they are successful in building them up.
<P>
Our concern is not confined merely to clause 46. Given how the Secretary of State can impose a scheme under schedule 14, it seems that clause 46 is advocating a top-down approach rather than devolving more power to the school level, which is the Minister's professed aim. He should, therefore, have no problem in accepting the amendments.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mrs. May:</B> I shall endeavour not to use incorrect language, although the rule that you have been so correctly imposing, Mr. McWilliam, has proved useful, if only to show the fallability of Front Benchers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> On both sides.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Did I hear "on both sides"?
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> The principle behind amendent No. 258 is supported by hon. Members on both sides of the Committee at least I hope that it is. Many schools already carry forward surpluses or deficits. The purpose of the amendment, as was so well put by my right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood, is to ensure that that facility is available to schools, for reasons amplified by my hon. Friend the Member for Guildford (Mr. St. Aubyn). There must be no possibility that schools will be prevented from doing that. It is essential that schools have that flexibility, especially for their longer-term planning, so that they can set out projects that may take a number of years and need money to be carried forward.
<P>
Of course, we should recognise that there is a danger inherent in such flexibility. I know of a Labour-led education authority that looked at the surpluses that schools in its area were carrying forward. Not all schools had surpluses, but it totalled them, and proceeded to cut its education budget by that sum. That had a very deleterious effect on the schools which did not have surpluses. I hope that the Minister will tell us that the Government would find such actions unacceptable. I hope that that flexibility is generally accepted by the Committee. It is reinforced by the amendment, which ensures that it is provided for schools rather than leaving any room for doubt.
<P>
Amendment No. 259 is an important amendment. Clause 46(2)(e) runs contrary to all the comments that we have heard from the Minister and have read in the documents about the need to provide the maximum amount of money to schools to give them the maximum flexibility to make decisions about which services they wish to provide and which services they wish to purchase. It prescribes terms and conditions on which services and facilities will be provided by the LEA.
<P>
In line with the arguments that my colleagues and I advanced earlier, it is important to remove that subsection 2(c) to ensure that schools are given maximum flexibility and are not forced to take on services provided by an education authority on[Mrs. May]
particular terms and conditions. They should be able to decide not to take a function or service from the education authority, but to buy it in from elsewhere on different terms, or indeed to negotiate different terms with the local education authority.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Lady is entitled to be listened to. Hon. Members appear to be getting restive about their lunches. I can assure hon. Members that I will adjourn the Committee at one o'clock whatever happens.
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> Thank you, Mr. McWilliam. I can reassure hon. Members who are concerned about their lunches that I do not have much more to say on the amendment. [Hon. Members: "Hear, hear."]
<P>
<B>Mrs. Angela Browning </B>(Tiverton and Honiton): Keep going.
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> Exactly. Having heard that, I might revise my decision.
<P>
The issue of delegation has not been raised in the debate so far. It may be appropriate to raise it while discussing the part of the clause that defines terms and conditions of local authority services and functions. My reading may be incorrect, but no reference is made to the position of schools that are in an education action zone. The clause refers to terms and conditions of services and facilities provided by a local authority. As I understand it, schools in an education action zone will still have the delegated budget from the LEA, but extra money will come into the education action forums.
<P>
Will there be a scheme regarding the allocation of that money among the schools and how they tie that extra money in with their budgets? I may have misread the balance between this and previous clauses. I hope that the Minister can tell us whether he imagines that terms and conditions would be prescribed by education action forums for the schools in that education action zone in terms of their potential purchase of extra services or facilities from outside.
<P>
Flexibility is the order of the day for those schools. It is essential that they are given the maximum opportunity to decide what is right for them. Each school should be able to determine within its particular circumstances how it wishes to spend its money, whether it wishes to hold money forward for another year and which services it wants to purchase from the local education authority. I hope that the Minister will deal with that specific point.
<P>
I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman's earlier explanation about the regulations concerning the functions of the LEA. I am still worried, however, about the potentially prescriptive nature of the regulations. He referred to the statutory functions of an LEA. There are particular services that a school would wish to buy in but, again, I can think of other services such as educational psychologists and educational welfare officers, which I assume the Minister would expect to be local education authority functions. However, a school may choose to buy certain services from a source other than its local education authority.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Lady is straying a little wide of the amendment, which deals merely with carrying forward surpluses and deficits in relation to school budget shares.
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> Thank you, Mr. McWilliam, for that admonition. I apologise because I thought that I was also speaking to amendment No. 259, which refers to the terms and conditions on which services and facilities are provided by the local authority. In recognition of what you have said, I draw my remarks to a close. I trust that the Minister will address the points that I have raised and will accept the flexibility that we require in the Bill. I am sure that the principle of the amendment is accepted by the Committee and I hope that the Minister will accept the words that will put it into effect.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I hope that I shall make clear the Government's thinking in a way that will satisfy those who tabled the amendments. There is not much between us on the matter. A model scheme should be promoted but, rather than do so under clause 46, we consider that paragraph 1(2) of schedule 14 is the appropriate vehicle. It states that the Secretary of State can provide guidance to local education authorities. Such guidance will be given under the type of model scheme that has been referred to by Opposition Members and will address the two matters outlined in the amendments.
<P>
It would be completely inconsistent with the concept and principle of self-management and budget delegation if schools were not able to maintain a surplus, if that is what they wished to do, or, indeed, retain their responsibility for a liability. It is wholly inappropriate to force schools to spend up by the end of a certain year and we shall be giving clear and specific guidance about that.
<P>
If the right hon. Member for Charnwood lets me know details of the school in north Yorkshire that he mentioned, I am sure that we can take up the matter. It runs in the face of schemes that have been approved by the Secretary of State and we shall want to intervene.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> The Minister said that it would be wholly inappropriate for individual schools to have to spend up by the end of the financial year. Is he aware of the current problems, not least with some of the new money made available to the schools for the purchase of additional books? Is he aware that several schools are in considerable difficulty and are not able to spend the money because the book suppliers do not have the books. They cannot supply them and provide the bills by the end of the financial year? Given the Minister's comments, is he willing to look into that problem?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> It is a reflection of the Government's commitment to spending in schools that book publishers, who have been starved of funding for so long and have surpluses of books, now find that there is so much demand from schools that they are unable to meet it. It says much about the priority that the Government are giving to education that book publishers cannot keep up with the demand that we have now created. I shall investigate the problems that our generosity is causing. I remind the hon. Member for Bath that next time a Liberal Democrat spokesman complains about underfunding in our schools I shall point out, as he did earlier, that we are now providing so much money that book publishers are having difficulty meeting demand.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I hope, in this celebration of high Government spending on schools, that the Minister will remember how hollow the Government's words will sound to schools that are facing severe financial pressures as a result of the current budgeting round. The Minister may like to bathe in the glory of his right hon. Friend the Chancellor, who, whenever he is a mile down the river, makes a virtue of the fact that Government spending plans are entirely in line with those that they inherited.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. May we return to the amendment? I remind members of the Committee of a useful dictum given to me by an old and wise Chairman about 19 years ago: hostages to fortune in Committee generally end up shot.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I shall certainly remember that dictum. As always, it is a matter of priorities. The Government make no apology for redirecting resources to meet our priorities, and education is our top priority.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> Underspending and the ability to carry forward has been discussed at length in our debate on the amendment. Is the Minister aware that the ability to carry forward and not to have to spend up by end of the financial year already exists in regulations, but unfortunately it does not apply in respect of specific grants? I was referring to that problem. Despite improvements, there is still a significant problem in funding for school books and equipment, and I hope that the Minister will not deny that.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I am aware of the problem of specific allocations, which is why I gave the hon. Gentleman a commitment to investigate it.
<P>
As to surpluses, the latest figures show that in 1996-97, around &#163;600 million was held in school balances. That is money which, with a bit of imagination, probably could be used. We have recently written to individual schools and local education authorities asking them to consider what is effectively a loan scheme, under which schools may be prepared to give up their balances for a year so that the money can be used by a neighbouring school which may need those financial resources. The system is already working well in some authorities. It is a good use 
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> It happens in the health service all the time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> That is interesting; the right hon. Gentleman, with his experience, says that it happens in the health service all the time. This will be a voluntary scheme which schools may enter if they wish. We hope that the &#163;600 million will be of benefit.
<P>
We shall address the issue of deficits and surpluses in our model scheme, and the matter of local authority services, to which amendment No. 259 relates. I understand the anxieties that have been expressed; because of the way in which clause 46(2)(e) is drafted, it can be interpreted in one of two ways. It is interesting that Opposition Members interpret the proposal as being in favour of the local education authority. We want to ensure that the terms are in favour of individual schools. For example, the model scheme will not allow local authorities to package together a range of different functions so that the school has to take it or leave it. A school should be able to choose a particular function.
<P>
We are anxious about time limits because sometimes a contract may be offered for three years or five years, which might be a disincentive to a local school to take up that service; the schol may feel that it has to take up the contract if it is to receive the service. For those reasons we will make it clear in the model scheme that we will put the school's interests first. Our guidance will be that if a local authority wants to offer services it must do so in a fair and reasonable way.
<P>
Local management and delegation of budgets will apply to schools in education action zones. The schools involved will retain their delegated budgets as normal. They will receive additional funding as part of the education action zone, but will retain the basis of their delegated budget, as will other local authority schools.
<P>
I am in favour of ensuring that, wherever possible, schools receive funding from central Government. I was interested to hear the right hon. Member for Charnwood mention the days when local authorities would not even allow schools to replace panes of glass, requiring that to be a local authority function it took me back 15 or 16 years to when I was chairing an education committee. In 1983, we had an outbreak of school windows being broken over the weekend and had to wait six or eight weeks for the local authority's direct labour organisation to carry out repairs; we decided that we should delegate &#163;50 to head teachers to enable them to get a local glazier to come and repair the damage on the same day. We had a great political fight against vested interests to get that policy through. Fortunately, we succeeded and the schools greatly appreciated that payment of &#163;50. I am sure that that was what Kenneth Baker was thinking of when he introduced delegation of budgets in the Education Reform Act 1988. We were five years ahead of Lord Baker.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> Cambridgeshire was a long way ahead.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> No, not in that case it introduced the measure about 12 months later, albeit through a far grander scheme.
<P>
I am firmly committed to the principle of devolving power to individual schools. They are in the best position to choose their own priorities and it is wholly appropriate that we should provide them with the opportunity to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I do not want to spoil the Minister's enjoyable trip down memory lane, but, looking to the future, does he envisage that that delegation of power will involve increasing responsibility at school level for the terms and conditions under which teachers operate?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> If I begin to answer that, Mr. McWilliam, you may rule me out of order. We dealt thoroughly with[Mr. Byers]
the issue of teachers' pay and conditions in our debate on education action zones. It is probably best to leave the matter there, tempted as I am to discuss the issue, which is an important one about which I have strong views.
<P>
I hope that I have reassured the right hon. Member for Charnwood that, under the powers in schedule 14, our model scheme will address the issues that have been raised this morning.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> The Minister has been helpful and I accept that all the schemes have to be approved by the Secretary of State under schedule 14. The Minister helpfully detailed some of the principles that the Secretary of State will apply in giving such approval.
<P>
Could the Minister refer back to clause 46(2)(e)? It states that regulations may require a scheme to deal with the
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"terms on which services and facilities are provided"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
to address the division between one service and another. As drafted, it appears to say that the scheme could determine that, for example, a separately identified service will be provided by the local authority on the terms laid down and that schools will accept that service. Is the Minister saying that that would not be acceptable to the Secretary of State that it would be an imposed service on imposed terms that would merely have the appearance of delegation?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I am saying that the Government will develop a model scheme that will address the issue of how local authorities offer their services to individual schools. Let us say that, for example, the school meals service is delegated to a school; the school may decide that it would like the local authority to discharge that function, but the local authority may say that before it accepts that, the school has to agree to buy into the overall package of payroll, personnel advice and so on. We believe that that would be unreasonable. Our purpose in introducing the model scheme is to require local authorities to put together fair and reasonable arrangements for school services. That will probably involve buying them, not on a five-year basis, which would be far too long, and not packing them together so that schools have no choice. That is what we intend to do under the model scheme.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I find the Minister's speech reassuring. However, we must judge the effectiveness of the Minister's assurances when we see the model scheme. As always, he presents his case attractively and seductively. I hope that his model scheme lives up to the assurances that he has given. We have already seen much evidence that not all members of his party share all his aspirations for delegated and diverse education provision. They are certainly not shared deep in the education bureaucracy around the country.
<P>
If the model scheme is to be effective, it must be tightly defined and must state what will happen if the Secretary of State says that a scheme is unacceptable because it does not live up to the principles that the Minister mentions. Given that what the Minister says appears to be reassuring, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

Approval, imposition and revision
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 137, in page 145, line 44, after "body", insert "and the head teacher".
<P>
The Minister has told us that he spent the two hours before this sitting not doing what he normally does learning his multiplication tables but working his way through the intricacies of the local management of schools budgeting formula. I envy him; no doubt, he had the support of his officials. I had to read various briefing notes from the Local Government Association and others, even though I was in a meeting where I should have been attending to another matter. As a result, I failed to take a trip down memory lane to remind myself of precisely when this matter was previously debated. During that debate, the Committee reached a sensible solution we accepted my proposition.
<P>
The Committee will be aware that, in drawing up its financial arrangements under schedule 14, an LEA must consult
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the governing body and the head teacher of every school maintained by the authority".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
However, it continues the list with
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the governing body of every grant-maintained or grant-maintained special school".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It seems appropriate to insert the words "and the head teacher" after the words "governing body" of the grant-maintained school. Although head teachers of GM schools are automatically members of governing bodies, they deserve to be consulted in their own right.

<P>

<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 110, in page 38, line 33 after "body", insert "and head teacher".
<P>
The Minister accepted amendment No. 137 to schedule 14. Amendment No. 110 is based on the same principle.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> The hon. Gentleman may be a new Member of the House, having been here for only nine months, but he should know by now that the fact that one amendment logically follows from another is no guarantee that it will be accepted. I am delighted to say on this occasion, however, that logic prevails. I am pleased to accept the amendment.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Clause 50, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 51</center></H4>
<H4><center>Certification of statements by Audit Commission</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I believe that the Audit Commission makes only one appearance in the Bill. I should be interested to hear the Minister's view of its work in terms of school effectiveness and value for money. The commission does not focus directly on school standards, but on any public service questions that arise on value for money and efficient stewardship.
<P>
The Audit Commission has established an impressive track record in its 15 years of work and on its capacity to analyse the effectiveness with which money is spent in the local authority and the national health service worlds. I hope that the Minister will see the continuing work of the commission as an important reinforcement of the principle of delegating budgets, allowing it to analyse, not only the spending profile of individual authorities but of schools, so that we can compare the value-for-money judgments reached by schools by employing the benchmark principle.
<P>
I should be interested to hear the Minister's reaction to the role of the Audit Commission and the extent to which he believes that the commission's benchmarkingprinciple, developed in the public service, can be applied. The Minister has expressed enthusiasm several times today for delegated budgets and making schools responsible not only for education standards, which are obviously the pre-eminent responsibility of the school, but for efficient stewardship of public funds and the value-for-money questions that arise from it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> It is the Government's view that the Audit Commission plays a valuable role. As the right hon. Gentleman said, it has been in existence for about 15 years. I am sure that many local authorities have benefited from its advice an guidance. The clause states simply that the Audit Commission should have a role in making a certified statement; it is therefore straightforward, but it allows me to respond to the points made by the right hon. Gentleman. He is right to raise the issue of the role that the Audit Commission can play in ensuring that, as we move to ever-greater delegation of public money to schools, the discipline and guidance that the commission has been able to give to LEAs and local authorities assists individual schools.
<P>
In considering issues related to the Bill, I was struck by the extent to which we all believe in the principle that it is right to delegate money down to individual schools. However, we do not yet have the right mechanism to ensure that we are achieving value for money in terms of school spending. As we move towards ever-greater delegation, we need to address that issue urgently. We are already discussing with the Audit Commission how, in the interests of best value, it can develop benchmarking to help schools judge whether they are achieving value for money and give guidance on how schools can arrange their own affairs to achieve greater efficiency and effectiveness in their spending decisions.
<P>
It is important to get the balance right. If a school were to be told that it was to be monitored by the Audit Commission, it would be scared stiff; we would not want to send that message. We should be trying to show individual schools that the Audit Commission's reports and recommendations can benefit them. We should be demonstrating the advantages that the Audit Commission can offer schools so that they see the Audit Commission as a friend rather than as an obstruction.
<P>
I am therefore pleased to endorse the positive comments of the right hon. Member for Charnwood about the work of the Audit Commission. We are already discussing with the commission its role in relation to Ofsted and LEA inspections, but particularly in relation to giving guidance and support to individual schools so that they can achieve value for money. The commission has not been involved in that process to date, but it recognises that in our changing world it needs to address the way in which schools will discharge their new responsibilities that will result from the legislation.
<P>
The Audit Commission is therefore supportive of the approach; it wants to play a positive part and I am confident that it can do so. We shall talk with it in the weeks and months ahead to ensure that it can discharge its responsibilities, in relation not only to LEAs, but to individual schools which will increasingly become responsible for decisions about the use of public money.
