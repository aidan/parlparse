<P>
<H5>9 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Clause 1 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Schedule 1</center></H4>
<H4><center>The Financial Services Authority</center></H4>
<P>
<B>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Ms Patricia Hewitt):</B> I beg to move amendment No. 27, in page 186, line 17, after 'section' insert '67,'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss Government amendment No. 28.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I was not present at the Committee's first sitting so perhaps I could add to the remarks that my colleagues made. I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Atkinson, and look forward to being guided by you.
<P>
We simply propose two minor amendments to the legislative functions of the Financial Services Authority. The authority's legislative functions must be exercised by the board, not delegated to FSA staff. Amendment No. 27 provides that the issuing of a statement in relation to the authority's power to impose financial penalties on approved persons under part V is a legislative function, which must, therefore, be exercised by the FSA board. The issuing of guidance as to the penalties that the authority considers appropriate for employees is already a legislative function under paragraph 1(2)(f).
<P>
That paragraph also provides that the FSA's power to issue guidance under clause 127 is a legislative one. That is inappropriate because FSA staff will give most guidance--whether formally or informally--to authorised persons or consumers. Amendment No. 28 provides that only the FSA's function of giving general guidance will be a legislative one. It will, therefore, be reserved for the board.
<P>
The amendments contain important clarification of the FSA's powers, and I hope that they will be regarded as pretty uncontentious. I therefore commend them to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howard Flight </B>(Arundel and South Downs): I join my colleagues in welcoming your appointment to our Committee, Mr. Atkinson. I apologise for having to leave our first sitting early.
<P>
I want, at beginning of our sitting, to declare an interest that is in the register. I think that everyone knows my career background. The Bill is concerned in the main with the financial services industry generally, but some matters affect the investment management industry and my own company. In those cases, I will, self-evidently, move no motions or amendments. To avoid boring the Committee, I ask that my general declaration of interest is assumed to apply throughout the Committee.
<P>
The amendment is about the FSA's legislative role, although no one seems to have noticed. It corrects some incorrect references. It is quite contrary to our nation's history to have non-elected legislators, such as the FSA. It is also contrary to the structure of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Although the commission is a single and powerful regulator, it is defined by Congress, legislation and the elected representative body in the United States of America. We have taken a different route to create a body that is, in itself, a legislator in an important industry.
<P>
For that foundamental reason, for the preservation of liberties and to avoid the creation of an overbearing leviathan that is not democratically accountable in any meaningful way, the Committee and the House generally must be cautious in giving powers to the body and prudent in maintaining checks on those powers. I rise not to oppose the practical amendments, but to note that they relate to the heart of the concerns that all of us in Committee should have about the legislation.
<P>
Amendment agree to.
{**w8**}Amendment made: No. 28, in page 186, line 19, leave out '127' and insert 'general guidance (as defined by section 128(5))'.--[Ms Hewitt.]
<P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Loughton </B>(East Worthing and Shoreham): I beg to move amendment No. 1, in page 186, line 23, after 'a', insert 'non-executive'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following: Amendment No. 2, in page 186, line 23, at end insert--'(ab) a Chief Executive'.
<P>
Amendment No. 29 in page 187, line 13, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'(d) monitoring whether the legislative and other functions of the Authority are discharged in accordance with the Authority's general duties and internal procedures'.
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I hope that I will not have to repeat the declarations of interest that I made in an earlier sitting--I assume that they may be considered to run for the whole of our proceedings in Committee.
<P>
No personal issue concerning Howard Davies is involved in our moving the amendments, which go to the heart of the structure of the Financial Services Authority. Mr Davies is the supremo of that organisation, for want of a better term. The general assumption is that he has done a good job in bringing together nine different bodies to form a large and powerful organisation in the two years since it was established. None of us would quibble with his 22 per cent. pay rise as given in the report and accounts yesterday. His basic salary has risen from £225,000 to £275,000 without the inclusion of performance-related pay, although that may be added.
<P>
Howard Davies is not the FSA, although I fear that that is in danger of being seen to be the case unless we can separate the functions of the chief executive and chairman. There should be a properly accountable structure at the head of the FSA, as one might assume there to be in almost all other public bodies and major private companies. That  recommendation was made strongly by the Joint Committee of which my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells (Mr. Heatcoat-Amory) and I were proud to have been members.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Kidney </B>(Stafford): Since the hon. Gentleman has suggested that that was a recommendation of the Joint Committee, will he note that the recommendation was for a change in the long term, and not for change within the few weeks of the Committee?
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> Indeed, that is what the report said--we did not put a time scale on the recommendation. That is not to say that the change could not happen next week, next year or in three years' time--in July 2002--when Howard Davies's five-year contract ends.
<P>
Howard Davies will not always be the chairman and chief executive of the FSA. However good and admirable the job that he has done might be, we are not legislating purely for his job; we are legislating for whoever may succeed him in the dim and distant future. We would like to see enshrined from the start the separation of the two roles. Given that it will be some time before the Bill becomes law, it may be convenient for the jobs to be split soon after enactment. That is the parameter that we would wish to set.
<P>
As the hon. Member for Stafford (Mr. Kidney) said, paragraph 113 of the report states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"In the longer term we recommend that the posts of Chairman and Chief Executive should be separated and that a non-executive chairman should be appointed."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is exactly what the amendments would do. The report also states that parallels with other models of corporate governance are not exact in this case. However, it runs against all current thinking on good corporate governance to have those two very powerful roles wrapped up in one person. Paragraph 1.2 of the Cadbury code of best practice clearly states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"There should be a clearly accepted division of responsibilities at the head of a company, which will ensure a balance of power and authority, such that no one individual has unfettered powers of decision."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is slightly ironic that the FSA's first report and accounts, for 1997-98, states, on page 60 that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the Board considers that the FSA complies with the Code of Best Practice of the Cadbury Committee."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am at a loss to see how that statement can tally with the Cadbury code--particularly two years on, now that we can see the details of the vast powers that are to be assigned to the FSA under the sole personage of the combined chairman and chief executive.
<P>
The FSA's response to the Joint Committee report was:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"To split the role between a non-executive Chairman and Chief Executive would complicate accountability and serve no useful purpose."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Again, I am confused. Why would it complicate accountability if a Minister had to deal with two people in different roles rather than one person? That would not be the most enormous intellectual task. As to serving no useful purpose, one useful purpose would relate to people's perceptions. Many of those in the financial services industry are worried about the authority's overriding powers, and they will be even more worried if those powers are seen to be largely under the control of a single person, however good he or she may be at the job. Accountability is not helped by concentrating so much power in the hands of one individual.
<P>
There is, no doubt, a case to be made that in the interim period while the FSA is set up, the existence of such a joint role has been an effective way of establishing the new regime and bringing the self-regulatory organisations together. However, when the Bill has been enacted the FSA will be a fully-fledged organisation with very sharp teeth, and accountability and checks on the executive are absolutely paramount. That is reflected in many of the amendments that Conservative Members have tabled and will table during the Committee's proceedings.
<P>
There are three main reasons why we would like to see the roles divided. First, the situation affects the whole relationship between the head of the FSA board and the non-executive directors. If the non-executive directors are faced with a single head in the person of a combined chairman and chief executive, to whom do they go if they are unhappy with the way in which meetings and proceedings are being run? They will not necessarily have an independent check on the chief executive. Having said that, I realise that the current board of non-executives supports the combination of the roles.
<P>
Secondly, the focus on a single individual is not healthy for the industry. The FSA is becoming very much identified with the single figure of Howard Davies, and may continue to be identified with the single figure of his eventual successor. Perceptions in the industry should be borne in mind.
<P>
Thirdly, the chairman and chief executive would have complete control over the agendas of meetings--the weighty matters that can be discussed by the board of the FSA. There should be a non-executive chairman looking over the shoulder of the chief executive to ensure that the right matters come before the board of the FSA, and that they are put before it in the right way and prioritised accordingly.  That is the obvious role of chairmen in industry.
<P>
<H5>9.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
It was suggested that splitting the roles would weaken the hand of the supremo of the FSA when dealing with other important institutions in the financial world at home and abroad. I do not buy that argument. The Committee should consider another organisation whose construction is different but which is also a powerful regulator--the Environment Agency. The agency is headed by its chairman, Lord de Ramsay, and has a separate chief executive, Ed Gallaher, as well as a recently appointed deputy chairman. No one would suggest that the hand of its chief executive is weakened when he has to negotiate with the Government or with other environmental bodies purely because a chairman is keeping an eye on him and chairing board meetings.
<P>
That thesis can be applied to British industry. All Britain's major companies have a split between the role of chairman and chief executive. I ask the Minister to consider the example of Chris Ginn, chief executive of one of our largest companies, Vodafone.  Is she suggesting that Mr. Ginn's hand was tied behind his back when he recently negotiated what I think was the largest ever telecommunications merger--between Vodafone and Air Touch--because he had a chairman and had to look over his shoulder? I hope that she will be able to refute that, although I do not think that she will be able to do so. Are we being told that the chief executive of Glaxo Wellcome had one hand tied behind his back when he negotiated a large pharmaceutical takeover because a chairman was running the board?
<P>
The example of British Petroleum is rather closer to the hearts of the Government. Its chairman and chief executive jointly negotiated the largest ever oil merger involving a British company, and it was clear that their roles were absolutely split. The same practices apply in the financial services industry, as not many major banks, stockbrokers or other financial services providers have a combined chairman and chief executive. Why apply one set of principles to the FSA and another to British industry? Why is it appropriate for British industry, including the financial services industry, to have an entirely separate set of principles, which came through the Cadbury committee? This Government, like the previous one, rightly want to apply them to industry and to other regulators in the interests of accountability.
<P>
I do not buy the argument that the proposal would weaken the hands of the supremo of the FSA when dealing with outside bodies, and I fear that the Treasury's response to the Joint Committee in that respect was weak. It said merely that the agency needed a strong line of direct accountability to the Treasury. Surely it is not beyond the wit of Treasury Ministers to deal with two people or to realise that one of them speaks on behalf of both, even if only one turns up at a briefing. I am afraid that the Government's argument does not wash.
<P>
We should make it crystal clear at the outset that we need the FSA in practice to be as accountable as possible and to be modelled on other best practice that we are trying to promote in British industry, including the financial services industry. Perhaps even more importantly, the perception that that is the case should be clear in the industry, especially as such an enormously powerful body is being established. Those are the clear and simple reasons why the Opposition support amendments Nos. 1 and 2.
<P>
I shall deal finally with amendment No. 29, although I am not sure why it has been grouped with the others. It seeks to add to the role of the non-executive directors the additional function of the non-executive committee. As it stands, the committee has a monitoring role in respect of whether the FSA is using its resources appropriately and operating cost effectively and of establishing the pay of the executive directors. The amendment would ensure that the non-executive directors have a role in monitoring whether the authority's legislative and other functions are being properly discharged. The reason for having non-executive directors is to provide an added check by people who do not have such a close vested interest in the way in which the FSA is working. It seems right and proper that they have powers to ensure that the FSA directors are carrying out their major functions and using the resources of that big body properly.
<P>
Thus, it is a simple amendment which would beef up the non-executive directorships. Given that the Government acknowledged that non-executive directors are an important part of the FSA--which they did by making them a majority on the main board--it seems only right to enshrine in black and white the principle that they should have greater regard to the FSA's overall work.

<P>

<B>Mr. Kidney:</B> I am pleased to hear the hon. Gentleman acknowledge the importance of the non-executive directors, but why does he not accept the seven arguments that they set out in appendix 2 to the Government's response to the Joint Committee's report, in favour of keeping the chief executive and the chairman of the board as one person for the foreseeable future?
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I think that the hon. Gentleman would acknowledge that I touched on that when I said that the current non-executive directors do not go along with the suggestions in the report. Then again, those non-executive directors will not be there forever. We must consider the perception within the financial community--are we setting up a cosy bunch of people to run the organisation, given that none of us on the Joint Committee had any part in the appointment of the non-executive directors? We need to see that they are appointed in the right way. I freely admit that the amendment is at odds with what the non-executive directors have said, but that is not to say that that will remain so in the future.
<P>
The three amendments go to the heart of FSA structure. They would beef up the non-executive roleand ensure that there is someone at the top who is wholly accountable, not just to outside bodies and to Parliament through the Treasury, but through another powerful figure on the board itself.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I support most strongly the arguments presented by my hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Mr. Loughton).
<P>
The structure of the FSA is crucial for the long term.  We might say that we can get things right in the future, but when setting up what is a Stalinist legislature--[laughter.] hon. Member's may laugh, but the FSA has the type of powers that have existed too frequently in totalitarian countries.  It is crucial to get its constitutional structure right for the long term. Not to put too fine a point on it, Howard Davies has a tremendous reputation with his executives, within the City and, I trust, internationally. Given that he has the task of setting up this body and thus needs to act in a  direct way and get on with it, it is understandable that he feels that a structure whereby a single person combines the roles of chairman and chief executive is correct; nor is it surprising that he has convinced his non-executive directors that they have done well so far, but we must look to--and get it right for--the future.
<P>
I very much hope that this is not going to be simply a party-political Committee. As the Government know, Conservative Members agreed to the carry-over and made it clear that we are not considering this in a party-political context. it is crucial that we all think about what these structures mean for the long term.
<P>
As we all know, the current draft has fudged the issue; it does not say that there will not be a non-executive chairman--It merely says, in a sense to accommodate the niceties of Howard Davies, that there will be a chairman. But is that really the right way in which to structure an organisation as important as this from day one?
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham presented most of the arguments, but let me make some more down-to-earth points. The reason for having a non-executive chairman is so that the chief executive of a large organisation has a wise father figure who does not have power, but can be consulted about difficult decisions. That is one of the main roles of a non-executive chairman. I do not suggest that it will happen, but if a chief executive were suddenly taken ill, suffered a breakdown or went over the top, the non-executive chairman would, immediately have to take up the reins and sort things out. To give that job to the Treasury or the Chancellor is structurally unsound; the Chancellor has masses of other things to do.
<P>
Once the FSA is up and running--as it virtually is--with a substantial empire and a substantial range of functions covering many bodies, it will need a corporate structure, just as GEC does. Indeed, the Bank of England recommended the Cadbury committee, which put in place what I think that we all consider to be the right organisational structure. As well as the formal channels of communication and discussion with the outside world, it is extremely healthy for there to be a non-executive chairman in place, with whom people can raise issues in a less formal fashion. It is part of the democratic accountability of an organisation within the Anglo-Saxon structure to have such a person in place.
<P>
It has been argued that the Bank of England operates with just a governor and a court. However, although the Bank of England has to some extent had the function of regulating the banking system, that function has been infinitely more narrow than that proposed in future. The Bank of England's structure has not always been right; crises have arisen in which the governor has had to use the Chancellor as his chairman. That is appropriate in major crises, but has often not worked well in less crises. Many times during the past 30 years, the governor has been critised for taking the wrong decision. If he had had some form of chairman, that might have helped him to take the right one.
<P>
However, the real point is that we are discussing a different type of organisation. We should note the Joint Committee's arguments. As we would expect, the executive board has been supportive of Howard Davies and tactful, but we should not assume from that that its long-term view is that the present structure should be maintained. If Howard Davies is concerned that, in international forums, not being called chairman will result in miscomprehension of his crucial role and importance, that is easily dealt with by giving him a title such as governor or president, to indicate his key powers.
<P>
On amendment No. 29, I, too, feel that it is slightly unfortunate to bracket the amendments together, because that mixes two different points. It is entirely uncontroversial to say that the non-executive committee should be given the brief to monitor the authority's several duties in internal procedures; that is exactly what a non-executive committee is for. Under the Bill as drafted, its apparent duties are little more than to review the financial remuneration of the chief executive and senior officers. That is nonsense. I do not know if that has occurred by accident or--dare I say--devious design, but in any organisation a non-executive committee's role is to review whether the organisation is operating in accordance with its statutory duty and its internal code of conduct. It is ridiculous that the most powerful body in the land after the Government will be set up with an executive committee that is not properly empowered to fulfil its duties. When we did our homework, we consulted many top lawyers, and that is the point that they made. There is nothing in the slightest bit controversial about amendment No. 29. It should be in the Bill, so that the executive committee is properly empowered.
<P>
<H5>9.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
We believe, as do the Joint Committee and most responsible powers in the land, that we are dealing with two aspects of getting the long-term structure correct. It must be possible to craft the niceties of Howard Davies' task in a tactful fashion that will not upset him.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Two hon. Members have referred to the grouping of amendments. I remind the Committee that the Chairman groups the amendments in a way that is convenient for debate. If Committee members want a Division on one amendment in a group, they may have a separate Division. I hope that that is clear.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nigel Beard </B>(Bexleyheath and Crayford): The deliberations of the Joint Committee were not quite as clear-cut as has been suggested in the speeches so far. There was substantial scepticism about the separation of roles between chairman and chief executive. It was pointed out that there is no strict analogy between the function of the FSA as a company limited by guarantee and the type of company that is dealt with by the Cadbury report. It is superficial to suggest that, because both have the word "company" in the title, they should have the same management structure, but that seems to be the essence of the argument.
<P>
The case for maintaining authority in one person is based on the fact that the authority will have to make rapid and important decisions. When it does, it is vital that people know who has the authority to take them. Splitting the authority at the top will allow infinite scope for lobbying two separate people, and those two people may be in two different places when a crisis arises.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman now saying that the decision of the Joint Committee, in which he took part, was wrong? Does he not agree that the chief executives of any of the three multinational companies that I mentioned also need to act quickly, and perhaps even more quickly when they are involved in big mergers, takeovers or other financial issues? What is the difference in speed between the decisions to be made by the authority and those taken by multinational companies?
<P>
<B>Mr. Beard:</B> There is a great difference in, say, the speed of a takeover or merger, in which one could have days to react properly. Issues are fairly well defined before any action is taken. However, reaction time for the FSA may be hours, and the chief executive and the chairman could be in two different places when a decision is required.
<P>
The most important thing is that people know who is responsible for decisions. Much emphasis has been placed on the Cadbury report and I have an immense amount of respect for it. Every organisation that has to react effectively and immediately tends to concentrate authority in one person. Perhaps we should use a military analogy rather than a strictly commercial one.
<P>
The hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham asked whether I disagreed with the decision of the Joint Committee. I go along with it, having expressed my opinion at the time. However, my opinion is now as it was then. It is false to pretend that all the recommendations made by the Joint Committee reflected unanimous opinion. They did not. On this point, a substantial amount of scepticism was expressed.
<P>
The analogy with a joint stock company and the Cadbury report is too simplistic to carry weight. The Joint Committee debated whether the non-executive directors should have a monitoring role over a wider range of issues than the audit and remuneration as is suggested in amendment No. 29. It did not follow that line because they would be monitoring themselves. As non-executive directors they are involved in all that takes place on the board and the conduct of operations, so to monitor themselves would be redundant.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Colin Breed </B>(South-East Cornwall): Having not had the benefit of the discussions that took place in the Joint Committee I am persuaded by the arguments that the organisation should have both a chairman and a chief executive. I have not been able to ascertain yet why those roles cannot be identified in the Bill even if they are at some time, and at least initially, carried out by the same person. When we are setting out legislation that will last for some time and while we are waiting to see how the FSA will develop, it is surely sensible in terms of accountability to incorporate at the top both an executive and non-executive function. That does not in any way preclude both roles being combined either now or in the future. Perhaps the Economic Secretary will consider that point when she responds.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Tyrie </B>(Chichester): Although I do not think I need to declare an interest, perhaps I should declare a potential interest as one never knows in this world. The Register of Members' Interests lists my unpaid advisership to a venture fund operating in eastern Europe. Who knows it might one day be remunerated. It is of course regulated. I perhaps should also mention that I once worked for one of the few institutions in the city--I think it may be the only one--that is not regulated at all. That was the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. I was there while Mr. Jacques Attali was chairman and chief executive. He was called the president and I am afraid that it all went to his head and he had to be removed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> Is not that a fine example of how an unregulated business with so much power concentrated in one person, that spends a fortune on marble walls and such frippery, just did not work? That is the best example and I am sorry that I did not give it myself.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I will not allow that digression to continue for too long as I am sure that we will run into all sorts of difficulties with you, Mr. Atkinson. I meant it as a semi-jocular point, but there was a serious element to it which my hon. Friend has picked up.
<P>
The arguments for splitting the roles are pretty strong. There is always an argument for having a check on enormous authority. It is therefore beholden on those arguing against this to show why all the authority should be placed in the hands of one person. A more important issue, however, is how the concentration of authority appears to those who are being regulated. It is clear that the City will be reassured by the division of these roles. That reassurance is itself of value and therefore very good arguments are needed for not seeking to put it in place.
<P>
The amendment would provide a non-executive chairman. There would be no conflict between the two people over the day-to-day running of the FSA. The division is based on management by exception: the chief executive gets on with job, does what he needs to do and the chairman merely keeps an eye on things. The chairman does not intervene on a daily basis, but the fact that he is there--just watching what is going on--will have some influence on the behaviour of the chief executive and may circumscribe how he performs his job.
<P>
The distinction between day-to-day executive authority and overall chairmanic oversight is well understood--[
Interruption.] The Treasury Bench does not like the world "chairmanic", but I have heard so many ghastly words from new Labour that I wanted to supply one or two of my own.
<P>
Let us consider the arguments against the amendment. The consultation document asserts that it would complicate the issue of accountability. However, I know of no organisation operating with this split in which accountability was complicated. That argument is a red herring.
<P>
It has also been argued that we are not dealing with a normal joint stock company so the joint stock company model does not apply. That argument does not hold either. Many organisations have this split. My local constituency association has a split between a chairman and a president. The Audit Commission, with which Howard Davies used to be associated, also has such a split of authority.
<P>
The only substantive reason for concentrating power in the hands of the chairman--the view that Labour Members maintain--can be found in the fifth paragraph of section 5:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"it is standard for our international counterparts to be run and represented by full time executive board chairs: the UK would risk losing authority in international discussion if the FSA were represented by a non-executive chairman."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In other words, the status of the chief executive might be imperilled when he engages in continental discussions. If that is the problem, let us find a title that is commensurate with international practice--president, or whatever is required to deal with the problem--and do away with the chief executive title. Conservative Members would be sympathetic to any Government amendment that sought to achieve that.
<P>
I can find no other serious arguments in the document, although the same argument resurfaces on several occasions, dressed up differently. For example, the point about representation in a single person reappears as the second paragraph of section 5:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"there is a strong benefit in a single individual providing a recognisable public face of the FSA".
<P>

<P>
Adding the word international to public would allow us happily to dispense with tierÄ 5 and nothing would be lost from the document.
<P>
In conclusion, I simply cannot understand the arguments against the proposal. I cannot see what will be lost beyond a little international recognition--a problem that can be solved readily by a change in the title. I strongly support the amendment and I hope that the Government will reflect carefully on it.
<P>
<H5>9.45 am</H5>

<P>
<B>Mr. David  Heathcoat-Amory </B>(Wells): We tabled the amendments to give effect to the recommendation of the Joint Committee, on which some of us served. We are anxious to make clear that we are not commenting on--still less criticising--the present incumbent, Mr. Howard Davies. We are trying to look ahead, as there is always a danger when considering legislation that one may be influenced too much by short-term considerations or the status quo. By contrast, we are endeavouring to legislate for the long term and put in place a structure that will deliver the Bill's objectives for many years to come.
<P>
The Joint Committee recommended the splitting of the two roles, so it is incumbent on those who are critical of that recommendation to explain carefully why they cannot accept it. As our short debate has shown, that recommendation is in line with good governance; indeed, the Cadbury and Hample Committees recommended such a structure.
<P>
The FSA is neither an ordinary company nor a Government agency. It is a private company, although it does not have a private company's range or multitude of shareholders. Instead, it has a more complex duty of accountability to the market, this House and Ministers. Splitting the roles would enhance that accountability.
<P>
Those who advocate that the roles should be assigned to one person slip into a rather dangerous mode of thought, as they are advancing the proposition that an accountable individual must deliver those functions. For example, in their letter, the existing non-executives assert, rather remarkably:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"There are some decisions (eg to close a bank) that must be taken at the highest level by someone with full time commitment and involvement in the issues."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am rather alarmed at the concept of an individual, however committed and involved, taking a decision of that magnitude. The authority is given those duties and powers, and it must account for them.
<P>
This morning, we have already agreed clause 1, which states that the "the Authority" shall
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"have...functions conferred on it"
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and must comply with various requirements.
<P>
Clause 1 does not refer to an individual, but to the authority as a whole. We therefore wish to design an appropriate structure within that authority. A parallel--although not exact--may be drawn with the BBC, which, rather fortunately, has a separate chairman and director general.
<P>
The recent appointment of a new director general at the BBC created a great deal of controversy; indeed, I personally disapprove of the selection of Mr. Greg Dyke. However, how much more contentious would that appointment have been, if Mr. Dyke was also assuming the chairmanship of the organisation, leading to almost unchallenged authority?
<P>
Luckily, however, that appointment is balanced by other structures in the BBC so as to deliver the authority and accountability with which we are familiar. The structure of the BBC does not undermine its public face or ability to speak with conviction and authority to the outside world. There has never been a problem about knowing what the BBC thinks or what its duties are. Indeed, the position of the chairman and the director general are mutually strengthened, so that there is dispersal of accountability along with certainty that the outside world has confidence in such decisions.
<P>
I have outlined an argument in support of the Joint Committee's recommendation. We want a response to the question posed by my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs (Mr. Flight), who reminded the Committee of the concentration of executive power and the role of the legislator. We must find ways to disperse power and authority rather than concentrating them. A separate chairman and chief executive would be one step towards that.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> This has been an interesting debate on a matter of great importance to the future of the Financial Services Authority.
<P>
I begin by responding to the remarks made by the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs who said, rightly, that we are not approaching the Bill in a partisan manner. I put on record my appreciation of the Opposition's agreeing to the use of the carry-over procedure, so that we can make speedy and effective progress in our consideration of the Bill.
<P>
The Joint Committee helped us substantially to improve the Bill and the Committee will make further improvements to it. However, I say, in a gentle and non-partisan manner, that the hon. Gentleman did not help his cause by describing the FSA as a Stalinist institution and I hope that he will not use such exaggerated language in future. I am no expert on the history of the Russian Communist party, but I do not recall Stalin having a non-executive deputy chairman or a majority of non-executive directors on his board. I do not think that he had a complaints investigator or an independent ombudsman, or that his victims had recourse to an independent tribunal.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> It may interest the Committee to know that Stalin was never more than secretary-general of the Communist party; his authority over 200 million Russians derived entirely from that position. The history of the world might have been different had Stalin had a non-executive chairman above him.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I bow to the right hon. Gentleman's superior knowledge of these matters.
<P>
There are a range of provisions in the Bill to ensure that there are checks and balances and that the FSA is properly accountable; I am only a quarter of the way through my list of those checks and balances, which will ensure that the Bill does not resemble a monstrous creature as the hon. Gentleman suggested. That is a serious point; the media, commenting on the Bill and on the FSA recently, have continued to use phrases such as the FSA being judge, jury, prosecutor and warder in its own cause. It would be a pity if members of the Committee were to perpetuate that kind of myth.
<P>
My colleagues and I have given careful thought to the proposed separation between a chief executive and a non-executive chairman, both in the original drafting of the Bill and subsequently. The issue was not raised much in consultation, but it has become the focus of debate since it was raised by the Joint Committee. I stress, as my hon. Friend the member for Stafford did, that the Joint Committee's recommendation was that in the longer term the two posts should be separated under a non-executive chairman. The amendment would make it a requirement for the functions to be separated from the time that the relevant provisions come into force. It would rule out the possibility of the existing chairman and chief executive continuing in the role to which he was appointed, and which he has played with distinction and effectiveness.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> Has the Minister taken any soundings from Howard Davies on the effect of the amendment? If it were accepted, his role would be split in two. Would he stay on as chief executive under a non-executive chairman?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> Our response to the Joint Committee made it clear that we do not intend to go down that path as it is not the right thing to do. I wish to underline--and I know that Howard Davies would concur--that the immediate change proposed in the Opposition's amendment would risk unacceptable disruption to the enormously challenging process of establishing the Financial Services Authority and ensuring that it is able to fulfil its extremely important duty effectively.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> The hon. Lady said that the main objection is that it would be very disruptive in its initial period, but the recommendation was to have a split in the longer term. Are the Government prepared to commit themselves now to acceptance of that recommendation so that after the initial teething period, there will be a split longer term?
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I am about to come to the reasons why I do not believe that this is the right way to go, even in the longer term. My first point was simply that the Opposition's amendment would require an immediate split in the posts between a non-executive chairman and a chief executive, which, short term, would be extremely disruptive.
<P>
The authority's non-executive directors made some points extremely effectively in their response to the Joint Committee's recommendations. The hon. Member for Worthing, East and Shoreham stated, rather dismissively, I thought, that the current non-executives would not always be there and that the views of their successors might change in time. That may be true. However, the present non-executive directors are extremely experienced and distinguished in their own right and I think that we should take seriously the views that they offered to us.
<P>
They made the point, echoed by several leading practitioners in the financial services industry, that the FSA is not a listed company of the type that the Cadbury committee was set up to consider, where a straightforward split could be made between the interests of the organisation and those of shareholders. The FSA is not a commercial company in which the interests of shareholders need to be protected by the appointment of a non-executive chairman. Every member of the board of the authority is appointed in the public interest.
<P>
I remind members of the Committee, including those who served on the Joint Committee, that Chris Bates, of Clifford Chance, a leading commercial law firm, told the Joint Committee on 25 March:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The corporate model is inappropriate. I don't think you can necessarily say that it's a company. Therefore you ought to separate the two roles."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Derek Wanless, chief executive of NatWest, told the Joint Committee on 13 April:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Cadbury is there for public companies who've got shareholders and I personally have a view that the separation of a chairman and chief executive, particularly if we are talking about a non-executive chairman of the FSA, would complicate the issue of accountability rather than clarify it." 
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Indeed, when I saw Mr. Wanless recently, he was somewhat disappointed that the Joint Committee had not taken his advice on the matter
<P>
The Joint Committee had before it a very distinguished and impressive list of witnesses from the City to examine on 13 April. They included David Challen, chairman of the FSA's Practitioners Forum, Tim Herrington from the Law Society Company Law Committee, Kit Farrow from the London Investment Bankers Association, Derek Wanless, Mark Boleat of the Association of British Insurers, and Angela Knight, a former Member of the House and one of my predecessors as Economy Secretary in the previous Government. When questioned on this point, they said that they were perfectly happy with the arrangements that had been established and put in the Bill. Mr. Challen said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"For my part I do think so. I think it is okay."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Clearly he was not at all worried about it. Mr Herrington said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>" I think we are broadly content with the way it has come out."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Mr. Farrow said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"We are happy with the board structure arrangements that the Government has chosen."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Miss Knight said something similar to what was said by the LIBA:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Yes we do agree that what is being proposed is not unreasonable."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
So they were all perfectly happy with it and, although the issue of the separation of two possible roles did not receive much attention in the consultation, in so far as practitioners in the industry have drawn it to my attention it has largely been to say that we should keep the present arrangements.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I do not dispute the quotations that the hon. Lady has just used. However, why does she think the Joint Committee came to a completely contrary decision from that of the witnesses she quoted?
<P>
<H5>10 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> That is a matter for the Joint Committee, of which the hon. Gentleman was a member, rather than for me. Of course I understand the Joint Committee's concern to ensure effective accountability and proper checks and balances. Indeed, not only did we welcome the Joint Committee's report, we accepted the vast majority of its recommendations. But on this point, for the reasons that I am outlining and those given by the non-executive directors of the FSA, we did not feel able to concur with the Joint Committee's recommendations.
<P>
The non-executive directors gave various other reasons. These included the need for a full-time individual with the full authority of both the organisation and the board to take very significant and sometimes difficult decisions. They point out, relative to their specific example of the possible closure of the bank, that, even as the old Securities and Investment Board, the FSA always needed, and had, a full-time executive chairman.
<P>
The directors also referred to the fact that the Standing Committee structure set up in the interests of stability in the financial system as a whole, and established by the 1977 memorandum of understanding from the Treasury, the Bank of England and the FSA, establishes relationships among those three organisations and their heads which in their view, would be quite unbalanced if the FSA chairman was non-executive. They refer to the improvement in accountability achieved by having one individual with whom the buck stops. They spoke of the importance of having a single person--some hon. Members have said this--with the board's full authority and a full-time commitment to the organisation who then takes part in international discussions.
<P>
The non-executive directors refer to the use of this single individual model amongst other United Kingdom regulators. Last year's response from the Department of Trade and Industry to the consultation about how to modernise the framework for utility regulation said that, for energy and telecommunications, the Government had concluded that we should replace individual regulators with a full-time executive board composed of a chairman and two others.
<P>
However, I wish to stress that the majority of members of the board established under the Bill consist of non-executive directors. It has a chairman, who would usually be the deputy chair of the board. In other words, a very senior member of the authority must be, and is, a non-executive director who can thus fulfil some of the other functions to which the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs referred--for example, being able to receive expressions of concern from the regulated community.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Does the Minister agree that, taking that view of the situation--a board of non-executive directors and a chairman, who, in a sense, is the vice-chairman--amendment No. 29 is absolutely appropriate? The non executives are not executives who monitor themselves. The whole concept of non-executives is to monitor fully what the executive is doing. Therefore, it is appropriate that their role should be defined as something much wider than remuneration?

<br>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I do not accept that, but I shall come to amendment No. 29 in a moment.
<P>
On the matter of the split between the non-executive chairman and the chief executive, my final point is that schedule 1 of the Bill does not rule out the possibility of the functions being split at some future point, and that in case a different view is reached on the matter in the future, the Bill does not prohibit a split between a non-executive chairman and a chief executive. The Bill simply requires that there is a chairman, that he is a member of the FSA's governing body, and that the power to appoint and remove that person rests with the Treasury. Schedule 1 leaves open that possibility, but the amendments would put us in a straitjacket by requiring a split not in the longer term, as the Joint Committee recommended, but immediately.
<P>
As to amendment No. 29, it is right that the statutory and general functions of the authority should be discharged in accordance with its general duties. As part of its accountability, the authority must demonstrate the extent to which it has met those duties. That is why we put in place, in paragraph (10), the duty on the authority to report on the discharge of its functions and the extent to which the regulatory objectives have been met. We intend further to clarify paragraph (10) by adding a requirement for the board to report on the matters mentioned in clause 2(3).
<P>
In order to make the report, the authority has to monitor and assess its actions against its statutory duties. The FSA must also put in place appropriate arrangements for consulting consumers and practitioners on the extent to which its general policies and practices are consistent with its duties.
<P>
Including the term "internal procedures" could create a wider remit for the non-executive committee than would be helpful. It could mean that the report must include, for instance, whether the FSA's functions were carried out in accordance with health and safety regulations--an example of internal procedures. That is not helpful. We believe--and all hon. Members would surely agree--that the Committee's real role lies in examining the strategic level policies and practices of the FSA's work.
<P>
The Joint Committee report stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"We would not want to extend their"--
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the non-executives'--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"role to other aspects of performance",<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
beyond those specified in paragraph 4 and required by the general law,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"as it would be anomalous for the non-executive membership of the Board to monitor the performance of a Board of which they are the larger part".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That point was made earlier. The Joint Committee was right about that, which is why we accepted its recommendation. The non-executive directors will always be in a majority.  They will have important responsibilities in keeping under review the FSA's use of resources and internal financial controls and determining the remuneration of the chairman and executive members of the FSA board. They will form a committee whose chairman will be appointed by the Treasury. By virtue of being the majority of the board, they will have continuing responsibility--and obligation--for the effective discharge of its duties.
<P>
In the light of that explanation, I hope that Opposition Members will withdraw their amendments. If not, I must ask my hon. Friends to vote against them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> This has been a good and lengthy outing on our first debate on amendments. However, as my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester (Mr. Tyrie) said, it is up to the Government to make a case for failing to adopt the normal model of splitting these roles, and I have not been convinced by the Government's arguments. I shall certainly press the amendments to a Division.
<P>
The Economic Secretary was justified in saying that the measure was not quite Stalinist in its set-up. It may have been the enthusiasm and excitement of the opening stages that led my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs to develop that analogy. We also debated finding appropriate titles, but that is not the main issue either: it is about the perceptions of the regulated community by a powerful regulator.
<P>
No case has been made out to explain why the FSA should be so different from so many other bodies--other regulators here and overseas--and so different from UK plc and the many multinational companies that take important decisions affecting whole communities and industries. They need to take quick decisions and they are not hamstrung from doing so by dividing responsibilities between a chairman and a chief executive.
<P>
The FSA will be different in that it will be far more powerful than any of the bodies that have been mentioned. Surely, that is why watertight checks and balances, accountability and lines of responsibility should be in place from the outset.
<P>
Let me take some of the arguments to the extreme. No one suggests that the Prime Minister has one hand tied behind his back when he negotiates with European member states simply because the Queen is head of state and may be looking over his shoulder.
<P>
The case for the three main pluses of a split role that I highlighted earlier has not been undermined in the debate. Such an approach would help to set the agenda and assist relationships with non-executive directors. Focus on a single individual is unhealthy. The argument that a split role would complicate matters does not hold up. The FSA will be a complicated organisation, so splitting the roles would not complicate matters much further.
<P>
The FSA will regulate the whole financial community, but any quoted financial company and the major private players in the City would think it strange if the functions of chairman and chief executive were not split. However, the body that will be responsible for regulating all those organisations will be unique in that those posts will be combined in a joint role.
<P>
The Economic Secretary said that there would be a powerful deputy chairman. In doing so, she acknowledged that there should be an extra person in authority to act as a check to whom non-executive directors could go. Why make that person the deputy chairman? Why not make that person the chairman, as would be common practice in many other organisations? The hon. Lady acknowledged the need for someone else to have that role and to look over the shoulder of the supremo, so why is that person being made subordinate when he could nominally be the head?
<P>
I was a little confused by what the Economic Secretary said about timing. She said that she was not inclined to accept a division of the roles of chairman and chief executive even in the future. However, she also suggested that there were powers in the Bill to change that and that the Government did not want to be straitjacketed by splitting the roles now. It is unlikely that one would want to have a single role of chairman and chief executive later if the Bill split the post now. I am confused as to whether the Government are sympathetic to the idea of change in the future.
<P>
We agree that Howard Davies has done a good job and that the FSA has come a long way. However, that is in the past. We want the Bill to make clear how the FSA will operate in the future. By the time that it is enacted--probably next year--the FSA will have been in existence for three years and Howard Davies will have done a good job for that time. The Economic Secretary referred to the disruption that occurred while the FSA was being established, but that has largely happened. If the FSA is not in some semblance of order by spring of next year, it will not do its job very well and we will have had three years of regulatory limbo. I hope that, by next year, it will be up and running and firing on all cylinders. Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 are designed to look ahead. They would enhance the role of the FSA and improve it in the yes of those being regulated. I urge my hon. Friends to vote for them.
<P>
I shall be brief about amendment No. 29, which I wish to push to a separate vote. Regardless of whether non-executive directors form a majority on the main board--as, of course, they do--a wider remit for them, going beyond checking the accounts, should be enshrined in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Liz Blackman </B>(Erewash): With respect to amendment No. 29, does the hon. Gentleman believe that giving mandatory procedures for fire drills should be among the many functions of the FSA's non-executive directors?
<P>
<H5>10.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> If, given the enormous powers that the authority has, the non-executive directors are not intelligent enough to work out that it is not their job to monitor fire drills, they should not hold such posts. Our amendments do not mention fire drills.
<P>
We are taking an awful lot on trust in relation to the FSA, giving it an awful lot of powers that we hope will be used reasonably in its pursuit of its objectives and principles. It is rather flippant to suggest that the non-executive directors would discuss fire drills.
<P>
We want the non-executive directors to have the power to act not just as accountants or a remuneration committee, but to check that the overall role of the FSA board--which includes themselves, so, ironically,   a degree of self-regulation creeps in--are being carried out. That is entirely reasonable.
<P>
<B>Mr. Beard:</B> Is not that the role of the board itself? What would be gained by having the greater part of the board going over the same ground again?
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> The relationship between the board's supremo and non-executives would be different. It is not beyond the wit of man to imagine that the non-executive board might make recommendations that it would not make within the confines of the overall board. The scenario would be completely different.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> Is it not the exact function of a non-executive chairman to ensure that the board go over that ground and perform the long-stop role of scrutinishing the work of the chief executive. Is not that why we are making the proposal? We do not want a layer additional to the board; we want to help the board do its job better.

<P>

<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> That is absolutely right.
<P>
There is a danger of the non-executive board turning out to be tokenism, and the non-executive directors simply checking figures in the balance book and deciding salaries. We must give them greater powers and more teeth, as proposed in our amendment.
<P>
The Economic Secretary said that the Government are not minded to accept amendments Nos. 1 and 2. That makes giving teeth to the non-executive directors even more important than it would be with the checks and balances of a split role. Therefore, I shall press all three amendments to a vote.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman saying that he wishes to press for three separate votes on amendments Nos: 1, 2 and 29?
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> Should amendment No. 1 be rejected, amendment No. 2 would become redundant. Therefore, those amendments should be voted on together, and amendment No. 29 should be voted on separately.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I propose that the Committee should have one vote on amendments Nos 1 and 2. and a second one on amendment No. 29.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> It is probably too sensible to have a vote on amendment No. 1. In the unlikely event that that amendment is rejected, amendment No. 2 would also fall, so I would not press it to a vote. We could then move on to amendment No. 29.
<P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'.The maintenance of competition and promotion of United Kingdom competitiveness objective referred to in section 2(2)(e) is: regulating in a way which does not unnecessarily impede competition in financial services and markets in the United Kingdom or by any category of authorised participants and which seeks to secure a regulatory regime in the United Kingdom which provides a competitive advantage internationally'.
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
New clause 2--Duty of Treasury to maintain competition and competitiveness--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'.When deciding what regulations or orders the Treasury should make under this Act, or what other powers or discretions the Treasury should exercise under this Act, the Treasury must seek to meet the maintenance of competition and competitiveness objective and must have regard to the considerations set out in section 2(3)(c) and (d)'.
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> We have in these nine amendments and two new clauses perhaps the most important debate of principle on the Bill. They inter-relate to some extent, but the crucial debate is about making the maintenance of competition and the promotion of competitiveness a key additional objective of the FSA. Talking a little about each amendment individually is unavoidable as there is more than just the general broad subject of competitiveness. I therefore apologise, Mr. Atkinson, if I speak for rather a long time.
<P>
Amendment No. 4 endeavours to qualify the enforcement powers of the FSA with the sound Anglo-Saxon principles of reasonableness, proportionality and fairness. As drafted, its powers are completely unqualified. I do not want to be ticked off again for using certain words, but members of the Committee still do not realise that we are creating a massive legislator which will not be in any way democratically accountable. If we believe in a free and democratic society, it is wholly appropriate to be over-cautious and to check its powers: it must be wrong to allow the FSA to have unqualified powers of enforcement in its constitution. I cannot see how the Government or the Committee can object to qualifying those powers with sensible Anglo-Saxon concepts.
<P>
Amendment No. 35 addresses a slightly different point. Clause 2 as drafted has a technical aspect. It refers to discharging general functions, which it defines, but it excludes all sorts of functions, which I think is not the intention of the clause. The authority should have regard to the crucial regulatory objectives in discharging its functions. I do not mean the silly things--people might say, "Oh, does that mean fire duty?"--but its regulatory functions. Deleting the word "general" would make that clear. Clause 2(3) sets out the important objectives and duties.
<P>
Amendment No. 19 would remove the subjective wording in clause (2)(1)(b) relating to the authority meeting its objectives. Again, it is about checks on the authority and not being above the law. The amendment would ensure that it is not just the authority's own view that is taken into account, but what is appropriate for the good of society.
<P>
Amendment No. 20 would impose a basic requirement to act reasonably; it is superseded by amendment No. 36, which would require the FSA to discharge its functions in a reasonable, open and transparent way. Although one of the key concepts of proper dealings in our financial services industry is transparency, the Bill as drafted does not provide for the authority to act in a transparent fashion. Our amendment would apply to all the FSA's functions, but it would not impose a problematical concept on the authority because everyone in the financial services industry--regulators and practitioners--should regard it as second nature.
<P>
Amendment No. 46 would impose a check on the danger of excessive powers. It is a key antidote, based on the approach of the Joint Committee and several important Law Lords, which the industry has expressed through the media.
<P>
The maintenance of competition and the promotion of United Kingdom competitiveness becomes an additional key regulatory objective to which the authority, in discharging its functions, must have regard. The two concepts of competitiveness and competition reflect the international situation, the competitiveness of UK industry around the world and the internal situation in terms of competition versus monopoly and oligopoly. I do not know where the Chancellor of the Exchequer stands on the issue. We have been led to believe that he, too, has twigged that this is the key area in which to have an appropriate balance of power and the potential for redress.
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The references to competitiveness in paragraphs (e) and (f) of clause 2(3) do no define it as a key objective, so it comes in the second category of matters to which the authority must merely have regard. Such references have nothing like the weight of key objectives, which are defined up front.
<P>
I want to explain why making competitiveness and competition key objectives would set the FSA structure within the right balance of powers. I also want to explain what that would enable, legally speaking. The FSA's code and the Bill might turn out not to be satisfactory or clear enough as regards market abuse. The US Bond Traders Association might, as suggested earlier, advise its members not to trade in London because there was no clarity about what was within or without the law. An immeasurable amount of trade might, therefore, move from London to New York or Zurich as a direct result of the Bill. However, if the maintenance and encouragement of international competitiveness were defined as a key regulatory objective, there would be a straightforward case for bringing a judicial review to the effect that the FSA was not meeting its objectives. There would be tangible evidence of that and a constitutional mechanism to correct the problem. That is the essence of the issue as regards setting up an unaccountable legislature.
<P>
There is also the issue of domestic competition. The number of independent financial advisers might fall by two thirds because the overall effect of the costs of much of what would be required of them rendered it commercially impossible for them to continue. Again, there would be an obvious opportunity to bring a judicial review of the fact that competition had been undermined and that an oligopoly had been established in the provision of financial advice to individuals. Under our proposals, that would be contrary to the fundamental regulatory objectives of the Bill.
<P>
The marketplace and the maintenance of appropriate international competitiveness and domestic competition provide the most natural check and balance on a legislative regulator that has the powers that the Bill establishes.
<P>
Clause 2(3)(e) and 2(3)(f) should be deleted. Consequent on that, we have proposed new clause 2, which joins the Treasury in meeting the objectives of maintaining competition and encouraging competitiveness. As hon. Members will be aware, certain powers in the Bill are reserved for the Treasury to allow it to determine what the FSA does. If one wishes to have that key check to promote those objectives, one must join with the Treasury, given that the reserve powers behind the FSA are retained by that Department.
<P>
Amendment No. 37 reflects amendment No. 36 and makes the point that it is wrong to require the FSA to having regard only to general functions. The FSA needs to have regard to all its functions. That point echoes back to clause 2 and our amendment No. 4. Amendment No. 39 would delete subsection (4).
<P>
New clause 1 would give a fuller definition of 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The maintenance of competition and promotion of United Kingdom competitiveness".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Government have made much of the argument--with which we agree--that the good regulation that we all seek to achieve through the Bill should provide a competitive advantage for the country internationally. Increasing domestic competition would be an unreasonable and inappropriate objective, but the promotion of British competitiveness internationally would not. That is the subject of new clause 1.
<P>
The bill includes a fair degree of specific checks and balances, but lacks the provision of a major legal check and balance. If the authority, no doubt when not headed by a sensible and sound individual such as Howard Davies, acted in a less than responsible fashion, there would be no legal route for the straightforward address of such action. To repeat, we consulted with a considerable body of legal opinion, and our conclusion might be a development of Anglo-Saxon law. The only peg on which to hang the ability to have legal steps to address action by the FSA, were it ever to become out of control, would be to make the necessary maintenance of competition and competitiveness a regulatory objective.
<P>
I shall move on to the more mundane aspect of making competitiveness an objective. We must remember that the industry employs 1.2 million people. Some members of the Labour party may have a vision of the industry as one employing a few overpaid fat cats. Perhaps many of them are overpaid. However, in reality the industry consists of 1.2 million people doing straightforward jobs. If regulatory developments were to render the UK uncompetitive, the fat cats could all go off to Zurich and New York. Huge numbers of people are employed in the industry, and there is an absolute requirement to keep the UK internationally competitive and to promote its competitiveness. Domestically, the consumer will suffer if competition is reduced and oligopoly increases in the financial services industry. That tendency is already there to some extent, and the regulator should be a force in the market against the growth of oligopoly and for the maintenance of maximum levels of competition.
<P>
In conclusion, we have taken substantial legal advice and do not see any legal problems in making competition and competitiveness a key up-front regulatory objective.

<P>

<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> Although I have no wish to challenge the wisdom of your selection of amendments, Mr. Atkinson, it is difficult to have to attack such an enormous list in one go. I should therefore like to pick out a few specifically. Perhaps it is our fault for having tabled so many amendments in the first place, but we did so because of our passion about the subject and the many deficiencies in the Bill's wording. Much woolliness is evident in some of the paragraphs that we are seeking to amend.
<P>
I support my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs on amendments Nos. 4 and 5, which would apply the principles of reasonableness, proportionateness and appropriateness. At the moment, the powers of enforcement that the FSA will be taking upon itself are unqualified, and that does not help to alleviate the perception of it being over-powerful, to which I referred earlier. Amendment No. 35 would delete the word "general" to give the authority powers over all the functions, which are very narrowly drawn. The meat of the group of amendments comprises amendment No. 46, which deals with competition and competitiveness, and new clauses 1 and 2.
<P>
Hon. Members may recall that when the Committee met for the first time on Tuesday I referred to an article in the Financial Times upon which I was promptly told by the Chief Secretary to the Treasury never to believe everything that one reads in the newspapers. However, it was not only the Financial Times that seized on the glimmer of hope from a speech that was made last week by the Chancellor of the Exchequer to the American ambassador and other eager audience members. In the course of the speech, he said that the Government are in favour of opening up utilities, consumer goods and financial services to even greater competition. That was interpreted by the Financial Times--as well as by many other journals--as follows:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"A fundamental shift in the regulatory regime for banks and other financial institutions towards the promotion of competition is being planned by the Treasury.
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Gordon Brown, the chancellor, is expected to make a late amendment to the Financial Services and Markets Bill currently before parliament so that the City's super-regulator, the Financial Services Authority, would be given a statutory duty to promote competition."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I would very much support that, and lingered with eager anticipation around the Table Office to see whether the Chancellor or one of his minions would hotfoot it there with a late amendment. Alas, it has not appeared for consideration with the amendments that are before us today. Yet again, it will be up to Opposition Members to try to improve the Bill.
<P>
The issue of competition and competitiveness is a key consideration. I very much favour the four objectives that are already in the Bill and which were considered by the Joint Committee--market confidence, public awareness, consumer protection and the reduction of financial crime. We will come to those a little later.
<P>
The Joint Committee discussed at length the possibility of adding to the Bill a fifth objective of promoting competition or competitiveness--they are two different things. No doubt those Committee members who were also members of the Joint Committee would point out that although it decided that the issue should be flagged up, it was not in favour of adding it as an objective. I disagreed with that, but in the general spirit of bonhomie that reigned throughout the Joint Committee's long drawn-out proceedings, it was not pushed to a vote. However, strong concerns were raised in favour of it being a key objective rather than just a woolly principle in the Bill.
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs said, there is a difference between competition and competitiveness. Thus, new clause 1 is drafted so as to prescribe a competitiveness objective
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"which does not unnecessarily impede competition in financial services and markets in the United Kingdom".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It goes on to say that we should have a regulatory regime in the United Kingdom 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"which provides a competitive advantage internationally".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In my discussions with senior members of the FSA--executive and non-executive--I found that they were quite happy with that wording. The terms in which we have couched it--so as not to impede competition--are wholly acceptable. I am interested to know why the Government have not tabled an amendment to that effect.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
In his foreword to the better regulation task force guide, the Prime Minister said that the Government were not in the business of setting out regulations for regulations's sake or wrapping up the financial services industry in red tape. The Government's problem--perhaps the Economic Secretary would provide some clarification on this--is the competition role of the FSA vis-a-vis the Office of Fair Trading. Answers to questions that we have tabled on that issue have been fairly brief, so I should be grateful if the Economic Secretary would go into some more detail on that.
<P>
To promote competition in the United Kingdom financial services industry, the FSA could, for example, lower the capital adequacy standards of new banks coming into the market against existing banks. But is that right, or would it dilute the banking system if it included banks that had not attained the current high level of capital adequacy standards or any other measure one might like to take? Moreover, is it fair to the existing banks which would be operating under slightly different conditions?
<P>
At the end of the day, competition produces choice. Competition in and the deregulation of the financial services industry have produced enormous choice in products and a reduction in the charges for those products, which is a necessary function of the market. In order to maintain that great achievement in the interests of the consumer, surely we must elevate to an objective and a core part of the Bill the promotion of competition within our financial services industry. Competition would increase investors' choice in terms of the number of firms offering them products and the number and type of those products, as well as by the downward pressure on charges.
<P>
I would add as a rider to that a matter that comes up later in the Bill and which formed part of the Joint Committee's deliberations. The most effective form of regulation and the most effective way of bringing about competition is by the education of the consumer. There must be an educating function so that the consumer--for whom we are here, after all--can make the most appropriate and informed choices, which are not always the cheapest. That is the essence of amendment No. 46, which would set a new, fifth regulatory objective on competition. I support my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs, who proposed it.
<P>
New clause 1 explains the competition objective in amendment No. 46. I nearly made a mistake in drafting it--as I have said, it would be difficult for the FSA to promote competition for fear of being seen as operating on an un-level playing field by new and existing players. I think that every hon. Member would agree, however, that not to impede competition is the right approach. In the international context, the FSA should have a mind as to how our financial services industry goes out into the big wide world and competes with other companies abroad. Competition is fierce out there.
<P>
Howard Davies has put it to us that a competition--competitiveness objective might yet again mean that he has one hand tied behind his back when dealing with other international regulators. It sounds as if we want to give him a straitjacket, and as if he is having one hand tied behind his back in respect of competition and another if he has to have a chairman looking over his shoulder. If that were the case, he would have to be a veritable contortionist.
<P>
Those are not our aims, and the proposals would provide an advantage. When the supremo of the FSA negotiates with the supremo of the Security Exchange Commission or with the heads, of other regulatory bodies around the world, it will be a plus point if, as part of his or her remit, that supremo can promote the competitiveness of the UK financial services industry and show an example to the world on how better and less regulation is in everyone's interests. If it turns out that overseas regulators are holding out for unnecessary and excessive regulation, the head of the FSA would have a bound duty to say that it is unfair and that such regulation does not apply in the United Kingdom, to ask why it should apply in another world market, and to point out that markets should be opened up to as much competition as possible. Some countries could benefit from the effects of competition, from the lowering in prices and from the increase in choice that I have mentioned and which we have in the United Kingdom.
<P>
Some of our neighbours are behind us on competition. For many years, Germany has had a distinct lack of products--any sort of financial product that people want as long as it is black, as Henry Ford might have said. Germany has not had much competition because of too much regulation that defines too closely the financial services or products that can be offered to the consumer. It would be a good thing if the head of the FSA could promote competitiveness in his deliberations with the head of the German regulatory system; I have the name of that system in front of me, but I will not endeavour to pronounce it because it is very long--I think that BAWe is a suitable acronym. It would be in the interests of German consumers if the head of the FSA could say, "This is how we do it, and we are very competitive." Such an approach would also be in the interests of the penetration of the British financial services industry into the German market, and vice versa under the passport rules and dual arrangements now in place. I do not buy the argument that that proposal seeks to tie the hands of the head of the FSA when he is engaged in deliberations with overseas regulators.
<P>
The amendments and new clauses are very important, especially in respect of competition and competitiveness. It is essential that they are enshrined in the Bill as an objective rather than in the more woolly terms of a principle that the head of the FSA may or may not have a mind to. If the FSA is not about monitoring and overseeing the financial services industry in the interests of that industry and of its customers, it can only be about drawing up an enormous rule book that seeks to clamp down on every bit of expansion or innovation. That is exactly the wrong approach, and such concerns represent the fear that many people in the City have because of the enormous powers that the authority is being given. It is, therefore, essential that unimpeded competition in the financial services industry is a key objective. Subsidiary to that, it should be a function of the FSA to ensure that the UK's competitive advantage on the world scene is preserved.

<P>

<B>Mr. Beard:</B> The amendments reflect a long discussion that took place in the Joint Committee. In the light of the arguments that were made, the Committee rightly felt that the Bill's provisions reflected the great importance of competition in the financial world that we are discussing. Neither side yielded or differed as regards the importance of competition.
<P>
The Bill is complemented by the Competition Act 1998, which is the chief vehicle for dealing with competition in markets. It applies as much to financial markets as to any other markets. The link between the Act and the Bill is in clause 2, which refers to 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the principle that competition between authorised persons should not be impeded or distorted unnecessarily."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
A power is also available to the Office of Fair Trading if it believes that the FSA is doing something that impedes competition. The OFT can report such activities to the Treasury, which can step in.
<P>
If promoting competition is raised to the level of a main objective and central purpose of the FSA, the roles of the Competition Act, the Office of Fair Trading, the Financial Services and Markets Act and the Financial Services Authority in the financial markets will become extremely confused. There will be confusion as to whether the Office of Fair Trading and the Competition Act or the Bill and the FSA should be involved in dealing with competition in financial markets. I believe the Joint Committee's submission that the Bill's provisions already take care of the situation. Nothing is gained by the somewhat theological argument in favour of raising competition from a principle to an objective, except the danger of confusion. 
<P>
The argument about the impact on our external relations with other regulators of making competition the FSA's central, driving and overriding purpose is not to be dismissed lightly. The way in which global financial markets are to be regulated is a major issue. At present, that is likely to happen only through co-operation between different national regulators. If a foreign regulator believes that the chief purpose of United Kingdom regulators with whom he negotiates is not to reach a fair regulatory arrangement internationally, but to put the United Kingdom on top of everybody else, the negotiations will become impossible. We shall not have a reasoned and fair international regulatory system. That is second nature.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I have listened carefully to the hon. Gentleman. What does he have against foreigners?  Why should consumers in countries that are regulated by authorities equivalent to the FSA not have the same competitiveness and advantages that we have established largely since the 1980s. Would it not be a good thing to educate the heads of the equivalents of the FSA in European and South American countries that they have much to gain by deregulating?
<P>
<B>Mr. Beard:</B> I have no objection to regulators from the United Kingdom having a friendly drink with regulators from elsewhere and putting them right if that is necessary. That is not what we are discussing now. There is no reason to believe that other  regulators, when faced with the application of international regulation, will push their competitive position to a point where regulation cannot be achieved. All that has been said is that we should not put the FSA into a statutory position where it feels that it must advance competition.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The place for competition is with individual companies trading and competing with each other internationally and within the rules that are set down. They do not need the nanny that the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham wants to create. They are capable of competing, provided that they have a fair and level playing field on which to do so. That would be put in jeopardy by giving the FSA additional responsibility for competition.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> The hon. Gentleman is saying what new clause 1 says. It is up to individual companies to compete and the new clause states that the FSA should "not unnecessarily impede competition". That is not a nanny role; it is quite the reverse. We want to ensure that the FSA does not act as a nanny and does not stick its nose in unnecessarily. It should allow UK financial services firms to compete on the merits of their products and expertise.
<P>
<B>Mr. Beard:</B> The hon. Gentleman has not said how the new clause differs from clause 2(3)(f), which states that the FSA must have regard to 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'the principle that competition between authorised persons should not be impeded or distorted unnecessarily.'
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That provision is already in the Bill, so it is not clear what the amendments and new clauses would achieve. The international position is crucial.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I accept that the wording of amendment No. 46 and the others on competition is not that different from that in clause 2(3)(e) and (f). However, the crucial issue is whether it is appropriate to make their aims defined regulatory objectives or merely principles to which the authority should have regard. The difference is important because of the domestic legal consequences that flow from that. They effect the ability to use the competitive clauses to restrain the excessive might of any future Leviathan.
<P>
<B>Mr. Beard:</B> The domestic legal consequences are already embodied in the Competition Act 1998. Although the authority should do nothing to impede competition, it is not its prime purpose to advance it. If, as the amendments suggest, the authority's prime purpose is to advance competition, we would jeopardies and breach agreements reached internationally. To that extent, we will be weakened
<P>
Competitiveness was the other point raised. That issue is already covered in the reference to costs of regulation. The available evidence suggests that the United Kingdom is one of the lowest cost regulators in the world, and we would like to keep it that way. That is why costs of regulation can be reported on in the annual report and the Parliamentary Committee  will be able to take special note of that. Again, that problem has been take care of.
<P>
Apart from a somewhat theological argument about the difference between a principle and an objective, it is not clear what the amendments would positively achieve. However, it is clear that they could jeopardise many other agreements.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I wish particularly to emphasise our belief that the status of competitiveness and competition in the Bill should be elevated from that of a principle to that of a objective. I shall speak briefly and confine myself to debating amendment No. 46.
<P>
The Bill contains welcome points about maintaining the competitive position of the United Kingdom and ensuring that domestic competition should not be impeded or distorted. They appear as principles to which the authority must have regard. We are not arguing with those concepts, but we want to elevate them from being principles to which the authority must have regard into an objective that must be pursued along with the four existing objectives.
<P>
In the domestic context, competition is an alternative to regulation. A fully competitive market, in which customers are offered a range of competitive products from which they can choose, requires less regulation. Conversely, a distorted market with few products or a monopoly supplier requires a much higher degree of regulation. To that extent, the enhancement and promotion of competition is an alternative to the need for regulation.
<P>
We have often debated--in the Joint Committee and on Second Reading--the pre-eminent position of the United Kingdom: there are more foreign banks here than in any other centre in the world. However, we are also vulnerable because many financial services are mobile: they came here because they liked it here, but they can leave if they do not. If foreign banking institutions examine the Bill and conclude that there are dangers, they will not have to put up with them. Many other centres, as near as Dublin, are willing and able to accept any migrating institutions.
<P>
The world is littered with business centres that were once dominant but then declined. If the City of London is not to go into a Venetian decline--elegant, but sad--we must actively engage in counteracting the dangers. I do not want the City to become a tourist attraction in which people say what a wonderful centre it used to be. I want people to come to the City to work, to engage in trade, pay taxes, employ people and succeed. It is immensely dynamic at the moment, but we must not be complacent. That is why I want to put on a par with the other objectives the promotion and enhancement of the internationally competitive position of the City of London--and, indeed, other UK centres such as Edinburgh.
<P>
Not doing so could be dangerous. The FSA is already charged with the objectives of maintaining market confidence, public awareness, the protection of consumers and the reduction of financial crime. If those were the only objectives, almost any regulatory advance could be justified.
<P>
In some quarters, there is a culture of risk aversion, whereby if an institution fails or a bank goes bust, everyone must be compensated. It is assumed that markets must ever go upwards and someone is to blame if anyone loses money. If things go wrong, people will ask, "What is the regulator going to do about that; why did the regulator not take action?" It might be asked why additional laws and regulations were not introduced to prevent the failure of a bank in which someone had a deposit. That  could lead to an over-cautious attitude on the part of the FSA.
<P>
Committee members know that it is rather a good thing if, from time to time, and institution--a bank, even--fails, as that demonstrates the dynamism of the market and proves that the City is innovative, risk-taking and at the leading edge of developing and selling financial products.
<P>
That is one reason why banks come here. They believe that they are joining an institutional meritocracy and will thrive if they have a superior product or way of doing business. They do not wish their inefficient competitors to be kept afloat or bailed out. They want them to go to the wall unless that would put the whole banking system at risk, although there are safeguards against.
<P>
The Bill as drafted contains certain dangers, as the competitiveness principles are, by implication, inferior to the explicit objectives and will therefore rank below them.

<P>

<B>Mr. Kidney:</B> I agree with the right hon. Gentleman's arguments. However, I think that they undermine the amendment.
<P>
It is rare for a Bill to contain statutory objectives; the measure that we are considering belongs to a new generation of Bills. The Bill contains such objectives because the FSA will have rule-making powers; we are providing a framework within which those rules will be made.
<P>
The FSA may make rules to reduce crime or promote consumer education, and they may protect the markets. However, I cannot envisage how it would make rules to promote competitiveness or to prevent competition being harmed. We are therefore discussing a principle governing all the rules that the FSA may make, as opposed to an area of rule-making. As the Bill is drafted, that principle applies to each of the four areas in which the FSA may make rules. Will the right hon. Gentleman therefore reconsider his position?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> There is undoubtedly some force in the hon. Gentleman's comments. However, the Bill contains a hierarchy, objectives and principles.
<P>
I began by saying that I was glad that at least the FSA must have regard to the concepts of competitiveness and competition. However, unless those are brought up to the same level as the four existing objectives, there will be an implication that the protection of consumers ranks more highly than the competitiveness principles that are significant for the long-term health of the United Kingdom's financial services sector and for a dynamic and competitive domestic market, being a safeguard for consumers and an alternative to regulation.
<P>
A charge may be levelled that the FSA could be required to intervene to give the United Kingdom a privileged position. That is not our intention. Conservative Members want the FSA to promote competitiveness, which is the antithesis of subsidies and handouts and attempting to privilege the city. Who could object to promoting competitiveness? We would not object to another market, institution or other body offering a superior product, as that is competitive. However, should that undermine the City, that would be a fair struggle.
<P>
Therefore, our amendment is not dangerous, and would not undermine the global status or reputation of the FSA.
<P>
We sincerely wish to put these arguments; whether we press the matter to a Division will depend upon how the Economic Secretary responds. There is a genuine debate about how it should be done. We do not suppose that we have exactly the correct wording, but I should like the Government to consider seriously the points that we have made. My hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs will respond in due course. We are trying to be constructive. In tabling the amendments, we have at heart not only the health of the City, but the prosperity of consumers.

<B>Mr. Andrew Tyrie </B>(Chichester): I very much agree with my right hon. Friend. I wish to make two points. First, I want to examine what the point of departure for these legislative proposals should be. I strongly agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs that the amendment goes to the heart of why the Government decided to legislate in the first place and the primary purpose of the Financial Services Authority. We should be united in wanting the City to be as successful as possible. That is our objective and the principal reason for legislating. In that sense, competitiveness and competition underpin the principles listed with competitiveness in the Bill and the regulatory objectives. There is no point in having a level of regulation which gives consumers total protection or eliminates virtually all crime because although it would be worthy, there would be little business left to regulate. I am sure that the Government do not think that they should regulate to the point at which there is no crime, and never a loss of market confidence. A difficult balance must be struck and we must try to find it. That is what our amendment attempts to achieve.
<P>
If the latter two objectives were sought to the point at which competition was imperilled or reduced, we would have to say that that was not the intention of the legislation and that we had not got the objectives right. The four objectives must be balanced by the fifth objective of competition, the objective that underpins our very reason for being here--which is to make competition and competitiveness drive an even more successful City. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Beard:</B> I appreciate the hon. Gentleman's argument. However, it rejects the fact that there is a fail-safe device in place already, in that if the objectives are pursued to the extent that competitiveness or competition are being damaged, the Office of Fair Trading, as the custodian of rectitude in competition, has the right to report the fact to the Treasury and ask it to take action. Does not that cover precisely the hon. Gentleman's point?
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> That means passing the buck to the Treasury in each instance to ensure that competitiveness is protected. As my hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham said, that is a function that I am sure, having worked in the Treasury, it would rather not have.
<P>
There is another aspect. Where there is a conflict between the objectives and the principles, there will have to be a review of that conflict, and that could end up in the courts as judicial review. As I understand it, we are really discussing the key distinction between the regulatory objectives, which are statutory obligations with which the FSA is bound to comply in all circumstances, and the general functions of the FSA. I believe that the Authority must merely "have regard" to competition and competitiveness at present. It must have regard to all sorts of principles in the legislation, as well as to the objectives. Therefore, were some of these issues eventually to come to judicial review, as I am sure they will in some way, we would find that because competitiveness was not among the objectives it was not treated with the same force. The only way to secure competitiveness as a fundamental objective and to demonstrate that it underpins all that we are trying to achieve in the Bill, is to place it among the objectives. I see no alternative.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> We are considering a substantial batch of amendments covering a range of different issues. They go to the heart of how the functions under the Bill are to be performed. Amendments Nos. 4, 19, 20 and 36 address the possibility that the FSA may not act reasonably. I should like to explain why we consider them unnecessary.
<P>
Clause 2 makes it clear that when performing its general functions under the Bill the FSA must do so in a way that is compatible with its objectives in clause 2(2), having regard to the regulatory principles in clause 2(3). When it performs specific functions under the Bill, it will not be able to take into account matters that are not relevant to the circumstances of that case. It will also have to act rationally, only using its powers for proper purposes. In other words, as a body exercising public functions, the FSA will be bound to operate in accordance with administrative law and if it fails to do that it runs the risk of judicial review.
<P>
In addition, as a public authority for the purposes of the Human Rights Act 1998, it will be subject to the constraints imposed by that Act. Those are clear and, in the case of administrative law, well established principles. There is no reason why they should not operate just as effectively in relation to the FSA as they do in relation to other public authorities.
<P>
Amendment No. 19, suggests that the test with which the FSA should comply should be changed from a subjective, to an objective test. I understand the thinking behind that amendment and I also note the suggestion that the word "most" should be deleted. Taking that deletion first, I would feel most uncomfortable if the obligation on the FSA was not to act in a way that it considered most appropriate for meeting its objectives. If the test was simply that it had to act in a way that was merely appropriate, the test would be considerably weaker. 
<P>
The move to an objective test is even more worrying. I would certainly hope that whatever the FSA thought was the most appropriate way of meeting its objectives would be the best way of doing that, or at least arguably so. However, whatever standard is implied by the test, there is a risk that if it becomes an objective one, it would expose the FSA to a constant risk of challenge through the courts by people who alleged that it had not met the test at all. That would be extremely disruptive. It would impose huge costs on the FSA and would potentially make the day-to-day work of the regulator quite impossible. That is why we remain of the view that the FSA should rely on its judgment, but on its judgment as defined in paragraph (b). 
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> Can the Minister explain why there should be a greater risk of judicial review with what we propose than with the Bill as drafted? There is always a risk of judicial review. The question is what is being reviewed and what effect that will have on the behaviour of the FSA. If competition is elevated to an objective, that will alter the behaviour of the FSA. The threat of judicial review will be important. The Minister's assertion that there will be more judicial review is mere hypothesis, for which there is no evidence.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> I shall come to the matter of competition in a moment; the hon. Gentleman is anticipating the debate. I am referring to amendments Nos. 4, 19, 20 and 21, which relate to the way in which the authority has to ensure that as it discharges its general functions it is acting in a way that is compatible with its objectives and which it considers most appropriate for the purpose of meeting those objectives. It should not be constantly open to the risk of judicial review on that point, rather than on the general issue of whether, in making rules, for example, it is acting in a way that is compatible with its objectives.
<P>
Amendment No. 36 would introduce a requirement for openness and transparency. We consider that the FSA will be bound to act in that way, and the various accountability arrangements that are to be put in place address that issue.
<P>
For example, the reporting requirements and the requirements for an annual public meeting will require the FSA to be open and transparent about its general performance. On the rule--making arrangements for instance, the FSA will need to consult before making rules, and as part of that process it will have to explain how the proposed rules relate to its statutory objectives and the likely costs and benefits of adopting the rules. When it comes to enforcement and disciplinary action, the safeguards are in place to ensure that the FSA has to disclose the appropriate information.
<P>
As it is a body exercising statutory functions, the FSA will also be expected to meet appropriate standards, just as it will have to be reasonable.
<P>
However in seeking that transparency and open approach, we must also remember that the FSA is a regulator with access to significant commercially sensitive information, which it would be wholly inappropriate to disclose. The Freedom of Information Bill will apply to the FSA as it will to other public bodies, although there will, of course, be appropriate arrangements to protect the commercial information I have just mentioned. That is only right.
<P>
The Government's amendment will ensure that in clause 2 (4) the rule making function and the function of issuing codes are treated in the same way as part of what the Bill describes as the authority's general function. The codes are the code of conduct for approved persons and that relating to market abuse. It is a technical, but sensible, clarification.
<P>
Opposition Members, however, have proposed something more radical: to delete subsection (4), thus removing all reference to the authority's "general" functions. I can understand why they think that it might be helpful to make it clear that the FSA should act reasonably, or to be open and transparent, and why they want to attempt to require the FSA to act in accordance with its objectives and principles whenever it does something. However, the amendment is simply not a practical proposition and I urge hon. members to withdraw it. The amendments would require a staff member of the FSA who answers a telephone inquiry to consider the extent to which his or her response complies with the regulatory objectives and to have regard to what is listed in clause 2(3).

<P>

<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I thank the Minister for giving way. The regulations impose analogous burdens and responsibilities on any member of the financial services industry, when speaking to a client, to have knowledge of and regard to all their obligations. Why is such a general assumption of knowledge appropriate to the practitioner but not to the regulator? The Minister has hit the nail on the head; that is what we are getting at.
<P>
<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> The distinction is between staff employed for the purpose of giving advise to clients who indeed have to meet regulatory standards and to be trained and, in many cases, qualified for that purpose, and others. The staff employed by the authority, including administrative staff, do not need to be trained for that pu1rpose. For example, independent financial advisers' receptionists do not need to be trained because they do not give advice to clients and I should be concerned if they did so. 
<P>
The general functions in clause 2, which are specifically defined in subsection (4), are those to which the requirement in clause 2 applies and that is right.
