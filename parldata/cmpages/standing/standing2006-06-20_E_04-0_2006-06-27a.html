Oliver Heald</b> (North-East Hertfordshire) (Con): I beg to
move amendment No. 7, in clause 5, page 4, line 13, at end
insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(4A) The Secretary
of State may not make an order under subsection (1) or (2) in relation
to a trade union or other similar
body.'.</div><div class="hs_Para">If we are to regulate
the claims-handling world, we must do so properly. The definition of
claims management services in the Bill has clearly been drawn
intentionally wide to ensure that there are no loopholes that
unscrupulous individuals or companies could use to evade regulation.
The definition captures all those who provide claims management
services, subject to the points that I made about the term
&#147;regulated&#148;.</div> <div class="hs_Para">However, there
is also a power to exempt. While I can see the logic in exempting
bodies whose claims management services will be regulated under the new
Legal Services Board umbrella, I cannot understand why the Government
believe that trade unions should be exempt, because some have clearly
behaved in the same way as disreputable claims handlers.</div>
<div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">The Times </i>has exposed the activities of the
National Union of Mineworkers. It says:</div>
<a name="06062879000308"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Elderly men suffering
from chest diseases and a crippling hand condition were advised to
allow the National Union of Mineworkers to fund their legal claims in
return for paying part of their eventual compensation to the
union.</div> <a name="06062879000309"></a><div class="hs_brev">But what the
miners were never told was that in reality, the Government&#151;and
not the union&#151;was paying the legal bills for successful
claims.</div><a name="06062879000310"></a><div class="hs_brev">The solicitors
concerned, Yorkshire-based Raleys, have been paid &#163;53 million of
public money for their work on the cases settled so
far.</div><a name="06062879000311"></a><div class="hs_brev">The NUM has
banked an estimated &#163;10 million from the compensation scheme but
has not paid legal costs in any of the 28,000 cases that Raleys
has...handled.&#148;</div><a name="06062879000016"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
of the claimants, Mr. Roberts from Worksop, Nottinghamshire, said
that</div> <a name="06062879000017"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;when he first
contacted Raleys he was told he could only proceed if he signed a
document agreeing to pay NUM contributions out of his
compensation.&#148;</div><a name="06062879000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">He
added:</div> <a name="06062879000019"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I was
under the impression that the NUM was paying for the claim to go
through and that they were supporting
me.&#148;</div><a name="06062879000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">Recently, however,
the Law Society&#146;s adjudication panel has ruled against
inadequate professional services in this connection.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column111" />Column number: 112</div><a name="06062879000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">According to <i class="I">The Times</i>,
the right hon. Member for Rother Valley (Mr. Barron), who was a senior
NUM official, described the union&#146;s arrangement with Raleys
as</div> <a name="06062879000312"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a scam from day
one&#148;</div> <a name="06062879000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">and
added:</div><a name="06062879000313"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The NUM
has not put a penny into fighting these cases and they have raked in
millions of pounds for doing very, very
little&#148;.</div><a name="06062879000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
Second Reading, the hon. Member for Bassetlaw (John Mann) described the
NUM&#146;s activities and highlighted the case of his constituent
Mrs. Beckett, who was not a union member, but who was invited to have
the NUM fund the case. That shows that the NUM was acting as a pure
claims handler.</div>
<a name="06062879000024"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06062879000350"></a><b class="B">John
Mann</b> (Bassetlaw) (Lab): Mrs. Beckett was never invited to
do anything. She was presented with a fait accompli, having signed with
a solicitor and had no dealings of any kind with the third
party.</div>
<a name="06062879000025"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000351"></a>Mr.
Heald:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes the point even more
forcefully than I did. What has happened is a scandal. The hon.
Gentleman continued by calling on the NUM immediately to repay all the
money that it had acquired through compensation cases, and I echo his
comments. As far as we know, however, the NUM still chooses to keep the
money.</div> <a name="06062879000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman also pointed to the activities of the Union of Democratic
Mineworkers, which shows that the NUM case is not unique. Indeed, there
have been 750,000 registered claims so far, 390,000 of which have been
settled. The damages total &#163;2.8 billion, and the
solicitors&#146; fees total &#163;665 million.</div>
<a name="06062879000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for North
Durham (Mr. Jones) cited the two unions for their behaviour and said
that Thompsons solicitors had been garnering claims for the NUM and
joining people up at &#163;20 a time as so-called associate members.
Those individuals then have 7.5 per cent. of their compensation
deducted and given to the union for nothing. Unions should not be
allowed to conduct themselves in that way; they ought to be regulated.
There is no justification for their exemption. The Constitutional
Affairs Committee, which after all has a Labour majority, reached the
same conclusion in its report entitled &#147;Compensation
Culture&#148;. It said that it did not see any benefit in exempting
trade unions,</div> <a name="06062879000028"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;since all
claimants should have protection and the opportunity of redress, where
malpractice has occurred.&#148;</div>
<a name="06062879000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">And it concluded:</div>
<a name="06062879000030"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We would expect that
trade union services would be able to comply with any regulatory regime
without any
difficulty&#148;.</div><a name="06062879000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister has said that she can exempt the unions and still apply
conditions to them under clause 5(3). She talks of a code of conduct
and the possibility of withdrawing exemption if it is breached. Other
hon. Members have talked about the role of the trade union
certification officer, but that is prescribed in statute and it does
not include the area under discussion. We have heard nothing to suggest
that his powers will be expanded. We have not seen the code of conduct,
and we would question what teeth there are to enforce it. If it is
going to be a forceful and satisfactory measure, I am surprised that we
have not seen it.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column112" />Column number: 113</div><a name="06062879000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">When we talk about teeth to
enforce a code of conduct, we should not forget the Bill&#146;s
powers that the regulator will use. They are wide-ranging and
tough.</div>
<a name="06062879000033"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06062879000352"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Michael Clapham</b> (Barnsley, West and Penistone) (Lab): Most
trade unions use law firms, and they are regulated by the Law Society
and the Legal Services Ombudsman. There is regulation. There may be,
and there have been, one or two unions that stand to be criticised, but
one or two do not make the case for regulating the entire trade union
movement.</div>
<a name="06062879000034"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000353"></a>Mr.
Heald:</b> I can understand the hon. Gentleman wanting to
defend the union he loves, but when it comes down to it, Raleys the
solicitors has been done by the Law Society. That was the finding. But
the trade union, the NUM, received &#163;10 million, and it has not
given a penny back. So who will regulate the union? That is the point.
It is all very well to say, &#147;It is only a few trade
unions,&#148; but it is only a few solicitors. We still regulate all
them, because we cannot guess which one will
misbehave.</div>
<a name="06062879000035"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000354"></a>John
Mann:</b> Would that we did regulate solicitors. The hon.
Gentleman and the Committee will be interested to know that Raleys has
not paid back Mr. Roberts despite the fact that the Solicitors
Disciplinary Tribunal upheld the Law Society&#146;s decision, as did
the adjudicator. He still awaits justice. The circulation within the
Law Society, whereby solicitors practise avoidance even when their own
regulator rules against them, must be considered in terms of the teeth
of this Bill.</div>
<a name="06062879000036"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000355"></a>Mr.
Heald:</b> The hon. Gentleman&#146;s view is that at least
there is power over and regulation of solicitors, but is he really
satisfied with a system that just lets the unions off? What is the
position of the claims handler, Vendside, about which he speaks
regularly, and which does not speak charitably of him? It is wholly
owned by a trade union. Is he really satisfied that under the Bill, a
body such as that can be let off because it comes under a trade
union?</div>
<a name="06062879000037"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06062879000356"></a><b class="B">Paddy
Tipping</b> (Sherwood) (Lab): That is the point. Vendside acts
as a claims handler, not as a trade union. It is distinct, and it will
come under the legislation of claims handlers. Where trade unions act
properly and legitimately as trade unions within the code of practice,
they should be exempt. But if, like Vendside, they are claims handlers,
they will be subject to the regulator.</div>
<a name="06062879000038"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06062879000357"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Heald:</b> I do not think that the hon. Gentleman has spotted
the full subtlety of what the Government are suggesting. I agree with
him&#151;all claims handlers ought to be covered by this Bill. If
they are already regulated by another body then they may be exempt. But
the Bill says that only people whom the Government choose to regulate
are actually regulated. It is quite easy to be a claims handler under
this Bill and not be regulated at all. The Minister can then say that a
union is exempt.</div> <a name="06062879000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
is Vendside but a wholly-owned creature of the Union of Democractic
Mineworkers? It is the UDM. I am concerned that the clause is not going
to cover 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column113" />Column number: 114</div>Vendside. It is not going to cover the unions. And I cannot imagine that
the hon. Member for Sherwood (Paddy Tipping) would sanction the way the
NUM and the UDM have been going on&#151;it just is not good
enough.</div>
<a name="06062879000040"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06062879000358"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Anderson</b> (Blaydon) (Lab): The hon. Gentleman should
be more specific when he talks about the NUM. It is a number of
affiliated bodies, many of which matter in very different ways, so he
must be careful with his language. It is clear that he is trying to
make an analogy between claims handlers and trade unions, but trade
unions are regulated. They have an internal rule book, access
to disciplinary procedures, employment tribunals,
certification officers, and the ultimate one which we have to face, is
that its officials are voted into office, which does not happen with
claims handlers.</div>
<a name="06062879000041"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000359"></a>Mr.
Heald:</b> Well, of course the certification officer is not
able to interfere in this area because, as the hon. Gentleman will know
with his long record in the union movement, and his great support for
his union which he loves, the certification officer&#146;s remit does
not cover the activities of a trade union acting as a claims handler.
If he wants to tell me of some statutory provision that says that the
certification officer does, then he is quite welcome to stand up and do
so. I have read up on certification officers and I can tell him that
they do not cover this area.</div>
<a name="06062879000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">As regards the NUM, I hope that
he was not trying to threaten me in some way. The fact of the matter is
that it is not me but Labour Members of Parliament who have stood up
and made serious allegations against the NUM. One of our best reputed
national newspapers, <i class="I">The Times</i>, has investigated this in the
context of the solicitors&#146; disciplinary body, where all these
facts have been revealed. So it is not me, as a Conservative, making up
some story&#151;these are the facts, and he ought to get to grips
with them. It is not right for Parliament, just because the hon.
Gentleman has a sentimental attachment to trade unions, and he and his
brother Labour Members are not prepared to stand up and be counted, to
allow vulnerable people to be treated this
way.</div><a name="06062879000043"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000360"></a>Mr.
Anderson:</b> I need no lectures from the hon. Gentleman and
his party on how to stand up and be counted. There is a factual
incorrectness there. It is not the NUM, but certain regions of the NUM,
that have been taken to court. The National Union of Mineworkers is an
organisation of federated unions. There is a
difference.</div>
<a name="06062879000044"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000361"></a>Mr.
Heald:</b> I am shocked that the NUM has behaved this way. The
hon. Gentleman might say, &#147;Oh well, it wasn&#146;t my
particular little bit of the NUM&#148;. But surely, he must have a
sense of shame that the Durham NUM has behaved like this, given the
history of the union movement. Surely he is prepared to say that that
is shameful? Is he really saying here, in this Committee, in the
Parliament of this land, that he is prepared to defend miners having
money taken off them, out of their compensation, without their knowing
the truth that the Government were paying the compensation? Is he
saying that that is acceptable?</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column114" />Column number: 115</div><a name="06062879000045"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000362"></a>Mr.
Anderson:</b> What I am saying is that the hon. Gentleman does
not have all the facts and that those facts have not been established
anywhere in relation to the Durham NUM. The Durham area is actually the
Durham Miners Association, it is not the Durham NUM. The hon.
Gentleman&#146;s ignorance has let him down in this debate. The only
people who have gone through court are the people who took the case
against Raleys, which has nothing to do with the Durham area of the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000364"></a>Mr.
Heald:</b> All I say to the hon. Gentleman is that he should
look at column 494 of <i class="I">Hansard </i>on 8 June, and at what his Labour
colleague the hon. Member for North Durham said&#151;if anyone should
know, he should.</div>
<a name="06062879000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">To continue,
if I may, it is a question of enforcement. If someone is regulated
under the Bill, severe powers of enforcement are available to the
regulator. I am looking at paragraph 10(2) of the draft regulations,
which are called something long and complicated&#151;the draft
Compensation (Claims Management Services) Regulations 2006. That range
of powers includes search warrants, and regulators are allowed to
demand documents and information and to investigate complaints in all
sorts of ways. The regulations provide ways in which breaches can be
tackled and deal with the more complicated issues of warrants for entry
to residences&#151;the sort of powerful investigatory approach that
we have seen with other important regulators such as the Financial
Services Authority. Why should the unions be let off all
that?</div> <a name="06062879000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">At the moment,
we are getting glimpses of what is really going on only thanks to
<i class="I">The Times </i>and some good-hearted Labour Members of Parliament.
Should these people who are breaking all the rules&#151;or so it
seems&#151;be able to hide and get on with such appalling practices
without being subject to proper investigatory powers? Labour Members
need to give that a bit of thought. Obviously they love the unions, but
some of the most vulnerable people in our society need protection and a
Conservative should surely not be lecturing Labour Members about such
matters. Their history as a party and a union movement is that they
were the people who stood up for those who were vulnerable and in need
of help. It is not good enough. Will hon. Members please support
us?</div> <a name="06062879000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">There should be
proper protections. I am not asking for the unions to be treated in a
discriminatory manner, merely that they should be treated the same as
everybody else.</div>
<a name="06062879000051"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06062879000365"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Hamilton</b> (Midlothian) (Lab): I should declare first
of all that I am a member of the NUM, and that I still pay my dues to
the NUM Scotland area. The point that my hon. Friend the Member for
Blaydon (Mr. Anderson) was trying to make was that the NUM has many
parts. Those parts have their own rule books and officials are elected
to represent the people who pay their dues to the union. At the end of
the day, the hon. Gentleman has not mentioned that the claims handlers
are distinct from the unions. I do 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column115" />Column number: 116</div>not count the Union of Democratic Miners in that, as it is not
recognised as a union by the TUC and it runs a legal service, not an
arm&#146;s-length one.</div>
<a name="06062879000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is another point. Unions
are there to spend millions of pounds on defending their members and
taking cases to court. The chronic bronchitis and emphysema case would
never have been taken to court if it had not been for the unions
spending millions of pounds. Claims handlers and lawyers do not do
that; trade unions do. It is very distinct.</div>

companies that are entirely separate law firms? Would there be a
difference, in his view, if there was not a payment back to the union
by the solicitor&#146;s firm even when there is an
arm&#146;s-length relationship? Could he unpack what he wants to do?
I understand where he is coming from, but I would be grateful if he
could explain whether he thinks that a difference in approach is needed
for the two different ways of dealing with a trade union claim?

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000368"></a>Mr.
Heald:</b> The two key issues that have emerged are the
referral fee&#151;or, in the example given by the hon. Member for
North Durham, the associate member fee, which must amount to the same
thing&#151;and taking a slice of the damages. My view is that if one
criticises those outside the union movement for making charges when all
the legal costs are paid by the Government, it is very hard not to make
the same point about trade unions. I do not want to get into the issue
of structures. I do not know whether the hon. Member for North
Southwark and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes) agrees, but I fear that if a
gap&#151;a loophole&#151;is left, that is where the unscrupulous
will go. I am just trying to say, &#147;Look, let&#146;s cover
everybody. If you are a person who is regulated by some other body,
fine. Let&#146;s exempt you from this because you are covered
there.&#148; However, I do not believe that that would apply if a
trade union were continuing the sort of activities that Vendside have
been pursuing, or some of the other examples that Labour Members have
given.</div><a name="06062879000056"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000369"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> The hon. Gentleman is an expert, and hon. Members
on the other side of the Committee know much more about Vendside than
me. My understanding of Vendside is that, in law, it is a separate
company set up by the UDM to do claims handling. There is a difference
between in-house processing of somebody&#146;s claim, and giving it
out to somebody else, which could either be a recognised law firm,
regulated by the Law Society, for good or for ill, or a claims company,
such as
Vendside.</div><a name="06062879000057"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000370"></a>Mr.
Heald:</b> I thought that myself, but I eventually received
the letter, which described the hon. Member for Bassetlaw in critical
terms, and all the references in it are to UDM Nottingham
section/Vendside Ltd. It seems to be treated as one operation. In fact,
the president of the union signs the letter on Vendside 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column116" />Column number: 117</div>paper, so I do not know the extent to which there is genuinely a Chinese
wall. The people who are suffering with these dreadful illnesses, and
making claims under a scheme that the Government have set up to deliver
compensation for them, should not be subject to that sort of abuse. I
do not see why everybody should not be covered by some proper
regulation. That is the whole point of the amendment. I said at the
start that we wanted regulation to be effective, and that is all that I
am trying to
achieve.</div><a name="06062879000058"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06062879000371"></a><b class="B">Paddy
Tipping</b>: I am pleased to follow the hon. Member for
North-East Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald). Let me to say to him that I have
thought long and hard about the matter, and have no hesitation in
joining my colleagues, and latterly him, in criticising the activities
of some sections of the NUM and the UDM/Vendside. I accept that it is
not easy to sort out the legal structure of Vendside. It is a company
that is 100 per cent. owned by the UDM; it is a separate company but
has close links and the same directors and executives. In reality, it
is UDM Vendside. As I say, I have no hesitation complaining about those
abuses, which are irresponsible and immoral. It has yet to be seen
whether they are illegal. The hon. Gentleman rests his case on an
argument from the coal health claims sector, where the Government are
rightly funding the fees. There is abuse, which needs to be
controlled.</div> <a name="06062879000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
what has made me come to the conclusion that trade unions with
legitimate activities should be exempted&#151;I shall come to that
shortly&#151;is that I followed the history of trade unions taking
claims against employers. Trade unions are a force for good when it
comes to industrial injury. At present, only trade unions have the
resources to be able to take on bad practices against employers. As my
hon. Friend the Member for Midlothian (Mr. Hamilton) has already told
the Committee, under the COPD legislation, claims would have gone
nowhere without initial funding from the trade union movement. I see
nothing wrong in principle with trade unions handling and pursuing
claims&#151;nor, provided agreements are open and transparent with
members, with trade unions taking some money to put into the pot to
fund future actions. That is collectivism and a community response to a
real problem.</div><a name="06062879000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
no doubt that trade unions are taking forward activities that are
within the scope of a claims farmer or handler. I want a clear
definition of when the code of practice will be used. It would be
helpful if we had seen it and perhaps the Minister will tell us what
discussions there have been with the TUC about the code of practice. I
want an absolute assurance from the Minister today that trade unions
that act improperly&#151;I have no hesitation about saying
this&#151;will not be exempt from the
Bill.</div><a name="06062879000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">As my hon.
Friends have said, there is a difference when it comes to trade union
activity. At the end of the day, trade union members belong to an
organisation that has a rule book and fought for democracy. Trade union
members can make changes to its union&#146;s policies and
leadership.</div><a name="06062879000062"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000372"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> I bow to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s wider
knowledge of the history of the NUM and UDM in
Nottinghamshire. Can he tell us&#151;this is a straightforward
inquiry&#151;whether there have ever or 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column117" />Column number: 118</div>often been debates at Nottinghamshire area NUM or UDM conferences when a
motion has dealt with the issue and the members have had the choice of
deciding whether they want a deduction of money paid to be put in the
pot or not? Has that been a regular issue? Have members had an honest,
straightforward choice with no bullying or intimidation on the floor of
the
conference?</div><a name="06062879000063"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000373"></a>Paddy
Tipping:</b> Many of my colleagues, for historic reasons, will
have nothing to do with the UDM and I accept and understand that, but
it is a major trade union in my area. I have been to the UDM conference
and have criticised its activities of doubling-charging for co-handling
claims. I have been booed and heckled for that, but within the union
movement there has been a lively debate about that point. I do not
think the debate has been detailed enough or in sufficient depth and it
seems to me that some members of the UDM executive do not understand
the activities of Vendside, but there has been a debate and we must
encourage it. I hope that the Minister hears the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s comments because if it is argued that trade unions
should be exempt, the opportunity of changing the rule book and making
debate and democracy better must be a core function of the
argument.</div><a name="06062879000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">So I say to
my hon. Friend the Minister that I have changed my mind about the
matter. She knows that in the early days of preparation for the Bill I
took the hon. Gentleman&#146;s view that trade unions should not be
exempt and should be treated as claims handlers, but I am satisfied and
will listen again to the Minister&#146;s assurances that if trade
unions act as claims handlers they will not be exempt and that the code
of practice will be tough, strong and transparent. What guides me is
looking back at the history of the trade union movement, the struggle
of collectivism and of men working together in difficult situations,
the need to collect resources and to take forward powerful influences
against employers who act improperly and badly. That is what the trade
union movement has always been about. We must not deny unions the
opportunity to take a small proportion of any successful claim provided
that the money is used for the future and the collective, continuing
struggle for justice in work-related matters. I appreciate that those
are old-fashioned
arguments.</div><a name="06062879000321"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5
pm</div><a name="06062879000065"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000374"></a>Mr.
Heald:</b> If some person with a dreadful illness is entitled
to a service paid for by the Government so that they can get the full
benefit of the compensation, how can the hon. Gentleman then justify
taking part of that compensation and giving it to the trade unions?
That goes totally against the spirit of the compensation schemes set
up&#151;I guess&#151;with his
support.</div><a name="06062879000066"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000375"></a>Paddy
Tipping:</b> The hon. Gentleman is honest enough to recognise
that at the beginning I said that that was irregular, immoral and might
prove to be illegal. I make no apology for UDM/Vendside, or for some
sections of the NUM. I think that other trade unions have acted
irresponsibly as well. However, we are talking about a small sector of
the activities of trade unions.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column118" />Column number: 119</div><a name="06062879000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">That issue was brought to the
fore by the two coal health claims involving those suffering from
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and vibration white finger. The
Government are paying those bills, but in lots of cases, the trade
union movement has collectively found the massive resources needed in
order for a claim to be made. If a trade union member is aware that a
deduction is being made for the collective good, and in their interest,
they will not object. I am not including coal health claims&#151;I
write that
off.</div><a name="06062879000068"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000376"></a>Mr.
Heald:</b> I suppose that it is possible that somebody might
want to make a donation. However, the hon. Gentleman says, &#147;Oh,
the vast bulk are good, and therefore it is wrong to have the same
regulation for trade unions&#148;. I put this to him; the other night
I went to the legal aid lawyer of the year awards for solicitors in
this country fighting hard for and campaigning on behalf of people in
need. They are fantastic people doing a great job and putting in unpaid
hours.</div> <a name="06062879000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have heard
about a few firms such as Raleys and Thompsons which are misbehaving in
relation to those coal claims. I would not dream of arguing that every
solicitor should not be covered by those rules, but how can he justify
saying, &#147;Well, if they are trade unions, it is
different&#148;?</div><a name="06062879000070"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000377"></a>Paddy
Tipping:</b> I hold no brief for Thompsons, but many people
come through my surgery who have problems at work, who have been denied
justice and who have nowhere to go other than their trade union. It is
interesting that the vast majority, or a large proportion, of the trade
union movement uses Thompsons as their solicitors. I accept that it has
failings and does not win all its cases, but it has a good relationship
with the trade union movement.</div>
<a name="06062879000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have experience in that
matter; I think that I deal with more people using trade union legal
services, such as Thompsons, than does the hon. Gentleman, and most are
satisfied with those services. At the end of the day, if they are a
trade union member, they have the right to argue and debate for change
within that organisation. It must be right that trade unions have the
opportunity and resources to take unscrupulous employers to court,
which is why I have come reluctantly to the position that the
Government are
advocating.</div><a name="06062879000072"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000378"></a>John
Mann:</b> I want to make a few remarks&#151;the first in the
context of the amendment.</div>
<a name="06062879000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">Does the Minister intend to
exempt before-the-event insurers, which constitute the largest group of
potential exemptees? Without question, BTE insurance operates in
Britain as a claims handler. For example, if one crashes a car, one
goes to a claims handler. I am seeking her assurance that BTE insurers,
in their role as claims handlers, will not be exempted from the
legislation. It would be wholly improper for some of the current
situations in claims handling, for example in car insurance claims, to
be exempted. To illustrate that, I have received information that
demonstrates that just two companies have the lion&#146;s share of
the car 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column119" />Column number: 120</div>insurance market. That is only one part of BTE insurance, but it is the
biggest part. If one crashes one&#146;s car, one could therefore be
in negotiation with one&#146;s own insurer through the same insurer
and never know it. That is clearly entirely unsatisfactory in terms of
consumer rights. Will the Minister assure the Committee that she does
not intend to exempt BTE insurers under the
clause?</div><a name="06062879000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">My second
comment is that it is regrettable that during the Bill&#146;s
progress letters have been sent to certain members of the Committee and
other Members of the House specifically attacking a number of MPs,
including myself by name and other members of the Committee by
implication. For those members not to have at least been copied into
the letter shows that further investigation might be needed. Such
inaccurate and misleading allegations could influence Members&#146;
thinking on the Bill, and it is inappropriate for them to be given to
anybody or to hold any sway. I am sure that they will hold no sway with
members of the Committee, but the principle of the effective running of
Parliament is at stake. The matter should be referred higher within the
House, because such actions as those taken by Vendside Ltd should not
be tolerated in a fair and democratic
debate.</div><a name="06062879000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for North-East Hertfordshire said&#151;I paraphrase, but I
think accurately&#151;that a special case should not be made for
trade unions, but by specifically naming only trade unions in the
amendment he does precisely that. Others could equally be exempted, so
although I understand the principle behind what he is trying to do,
there is a lack of logic. The terms of the debate have been whether
unions should be covered by the rules. My understanding of what the
Minister and her officials seek to do&#151;she will correct me if I
am off beam&#151;is that they wish to ensure that unions are covered
by the rules, but not by the regulator through self-regulation. I am
interested only in how good the regulation is, and there is no good
case for exempting unions, thereby saying, &#147;Out with the
rules&#148;.</div> <a name="06062879000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall come on to the definition of unions, which is critical in this
context, but there is a good case for saying that unions as they have
generally been defined in the debate are already covered by a range of
legislation and statute. That means that their individual members have
a range of remedies available. The Minister might insist that an
effective code of practice be applied by the unions. However, not only
is existing statute sufficient, there is possibly more power to
regulate unions than any other body. There is already a common law
remedy, because union decision-making and the use of union finances are
covered by the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act
1992 and others. The individual has remedy under those Acts. There is
also a certification officer, who ruled that he was not prepared to
look at the miners&#146; cases because they were not members. If they
had been members, he would have been prepared to look at the consumer
issues involved.</div> <a name="06062879000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
must also consider the democratic structure of the unions, which are
not sufficient but create a good argument because there is a danger of
a loophole whereby precedent could allow other quasi-democratic
organisations to avoid regulation.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column120" />Column number: 121</div><a name="06062879000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will give one example that I
would want to avoid; the British National party. Four years ago in
Stoke-on-Trent, the British National party attempted to become a claims
handler, working with a firm of solicitors called Beresfords. They were
going door-to-door, as part of their political campaigning, trying to
recruit people.</div><a name="06062879000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having
received information and documentation from the Ceramic Union in Stoke,
I challenged Beresfords solicitors and gave them an offer that they
chose not to refuse. They decided not to work with that organisation.
However, that is a membership-based organisation, in theory anyway, a
registered political party.</div>
<a name="06062879000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is essential that the detail
is right. We are not talking about exemption. We are talking about
whether self-regulation will be satisfactory in the context of unions.
If it is, all sides of the House should&#151;if they agree in the
concept of this Bill and the principles&#151;regard that as rather
sensible because effective self-regulation is cheaper from the
state&#146;s point of view. Other precedents have been set. The Law
Society is one that is similarly going to be exempt.</div>
<a name="06062879000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not see a principled
problem. However, that relates to union members and it is union members
who have the rights. The problem with the miners&#146; cases was not
union members. That is the great irony. In every single area of the
NUM, and in the UDM, union members were not
charged.</div><a name="06062879000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore, it
was a myth that that was a contribution to help the fighting fund. It
was not and was never explained as that. However, if it had been, union
members would have been paying in. Union members were explicitly exempt
from paying; they did not pay
penny.</div><a name="06062879000083"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06062879000379"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Kevan Jones</b> (North Durham) (Lab): Is my hon. Friend aware
that in Durham, the words &#147;associate members&#148; were used
for people with no connection with the mining industry, in terms of
their rights under the trade union legislation, there were none. In
that case, would he agree with me that rather than being a membership
fee, it was an access fee to get to the benefits, just as the claims
handlers
used?</div><a name="06062879000084"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000380"></a>John
Mann:</b> If it had been a membership fee, the certification
officer would, having looked at the matter, been able to intervene on
their consumer rights. It was not a membership fee. If it was a
membership fee, there would be a range of benefits that go with
membership. That is what one pays membership for. Some of those are
covered by statute, others are covered by the union rulebook and can
therefore vary from union to union. However, some of the core ones are
covered by statute.
</div><a name="06062879000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">That was never
re-joining the union. People did not get ballots in union elections.
They did not get access to other union services. My constituents and
the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire praised <i class="I">The Times</i>
and a few members for raising the matter. However, the true credit goes
to people in constituencies such as mine and others, who saw that
something was going wrong. They were raising the issue in their own
union, seeing something wrong and then raising it outside.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column121" />Column number: 122</div><a name="06062879000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">In my constituency, Mrs.
Moorhouse is a classic case. Her husband was a lifelong branch official
of the NUM. She took an advert out in the newspaper and found
that she was paying a fee to the UDM. Mrs Moorhouse said it
was
straightforward,</div><a name="06062879000314"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;My
husband would roll in his grave if he knew I had done this. I will do
whatever is
required.&#148;</div><a name="06062879000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have scores of people like that, individuals such as Mr. Albert Priest,
on strike for a year, with whom I went to Raleys solicitors. He wanted
to know why they had taken his money off him, together with three of
his colleagues, also on strike for a year. Raleys came out with all
types of nonsense trying to suggest that he did not understand what he
was talking about and that he had been conned or kidded by
me.</div> <a name="06062879000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">He understands
what he is talking about. He understands that the Government have paid
a shedload of money&#151;&#163;55 million in respect of
Raleys&#151;and he wants to know, as I do, that if the company wants
to pay some of that money to the NUM, why not do so out of the
&#163;55 million? If Thompsons wants to pay some to the NUM, why does
it not do so out of its &#163;90 million or &#163;100
million? Although the matter is subject to other investigation, I can
put the reason why the solicitors can afford to pay that money on the
record.</div><a name="06062879000322"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.15
pm</div><a name="06062879000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">The UDM set up
an agreement with an organisation called Indiclaim, and, before that,
Walker and Co. There are some questions about those organisations, but
the solicitor paid &#163;500 as the highest rate in respect of
Indiclaim claims to a third party and collected the Vendside-UDM fee
from constituents. Out of the money received from the Government, the
firms could still presumably make a profit taking the cases and be paid
&#163;500. If the solicitors&#151;Thompsons with its
&#163;100 million, Raleys with its &#163;55 million, Beresfords,
Moss and the rest of them&#151;want to pay the unions, allowing them
to fight such cases not only can they, but they have ample resources to
do so. Ironically, within the UDM, although it has nowhere near the
number of union members of the NUM, precisely that has happened through
Indiclaim and Walker and
Co.</div><a name="06062879000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">So the question is
straightforward. The issue is non-members of the union, and the
dividing line is straightforward. The moment that we had rights covered
by statute, I would relax. I would use the law to ensure that justice
was seen to be done. My constituents would then receive justice. Even
now, without the regulation, it certainly would be much easier. There
is no reason why people should have to go to court. Good regulation is
important to avoid the process of going to court. That is what I want
to achieve from the Bill, as do my
constituents.</div><a name="06062879000091"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000381"></a>Mr.
Heald:</b> What does the hon. Gentleman make of the argument
made by the hon. Member for Sherwood that there are people who want to
support the UDM or the NUM and expect to pay a little bit out of their
compensation to the union for future cases in respect of other
conditions, and that I am wrong to think that the money should
not just be taken out of the
compensation?</div><a name="06062879000092"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000382"></a>John
Mann:</b> Well, I set up one of largest strike funds in
British industrial history in the Amalgamated Union of Engineering
Workers 35-hour week campaign. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column122" />Column number: 123</div>People made a contribution, but it was voluntary. If the contribution is
explained to people and it is voluntary, there is no problem. The
problem comes when the contribution is compulsory and it is not
explained to them. What would be the rationale for not explaining that
the contribution was compulsory? It needs, first, to be proportionate
to the amount of compensation and, secondly, to be
explained.</div><a name="06062879000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have put
it on the record before in the House that no complaints have been made
in Scotland, where the NUM levied a theoretically voluntary &#163;50
per claim. Everyone paid it and I cannot see the rationale for anyone
not paying it. I accept that, in theory, it is voluntary, but why would
people not pay it? It is proportionate. It puts money into a pot that
allows the union to take forward cases. The money is up front at the
beginning. That is all highly rational, and I have no objection to
it.</div><a name="06062879000094"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000383"></a>Mr.
Hamilton:</b> I am a member of the NUM in Scotland, where I
pay my dues, and &#163;50 is taken at the source. I have been a
Member of Parliament since 2001 and, before that, I was a councillor.
During that time, neither I nor any colleagues have received a
complaint from anyone in Scotland about that contribution. Under Scots
law, families also receive compensation. Members of the union, their
widows and their families recognise that the union provides
convalescent homes and many other types of support for miners&#146;
families and villages. It is a continuous process and I hope that my
hon. Friend will expand on it to make sure that we do not receive a
false figure for what is being
proposed.</div><a name="06062879000095"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000384"></a>John
Mann:</b> It is absolutely right that people should be able to
make a voluntary contribution of whatever they want. In the engineering
unions, it was common that if someone won an industrial accident case,
they would send a letter to the union journal saying that they had sent
a cheque to the union fund because they were delighted with the service
that they had received.</div>
<a name="06062879000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">But the key is that the case
was not conditional on a contribution being made. People were not told,
&#147;You have to do it in this way, and this much will be
deducted.&#148; The Scottish situation demonstrates the lie about the
fact that the money was required to take other court cases. More common
law cases than any other kind have been taken in Scotland. The Scottish
system is totally defensible. In south Wales, the unions chose not to
take anything.</div> <a name="06062879000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is an important issue of proportionality, but also an issue of
principle. Mrs. Beckett, a widow, went to Raleys solicitors, having got
their number out of the phone book. They deducted money for the NUM and
told Mrs. Beckett, who did not necessarily read every last dot and
comma of her solicitors&#146; letters, that the NUM was funding the
claim. In fact, it was not. I do not believe that the NUM had
ever heard of Mrs. Beckett. Then we found that both NUM
Yorkshire and Raleys were defending
her.</div><a name="06062879000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is no
defence for that. It is immoral, and I suggest that it is illegal. The
Law Society was eventually clear about it. That kind of thing should
not be happening. It is claims handling, straightforwardly 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column123" />Column number: 124</div>and absolutely. Thousands of my constituents are in the same position.
What really gets them going is when it is explained how much the
solicitors get out of it. They think, &#147;Hang on a minute. Why
have I paid this money, to whom and why?&#148; If I recall
correctly, Mrs. Beckett, a widow, paid &#163;598 to Raleys.
That is one of the lower sums that I have dealt with. Many are much
higher. With the UDM, it tends to be less, but it is usually two or
four claims per family, and &#163;352.50 seems to be the standard
charge. Sometimes it is lower. People want to know why they are paying
that and what they are paying for, and then they see. The UDM it has
been straightforward. They can see the salaries, the pensions, the cars
and the houses. That is where a significant amount of the money is
going.</div><a name="06062879000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the
Minister give us not just assurances&#151;she is a genuine and honest
Minister for whom I have the highest regard, as I said at the beginning
of these proceedings&#151;but the detail? It is essential that we do
not get this wrong. If she wishes to hold some Members on her side in
the approach that she is taking, the principle is not that the unions
should be exempted. It is that self-regulation must be as effective as
regulation.</div> <a name="06062879000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">If that
is the case, I will be delighted. It would be better. It would make a
clear divide between union members and non-members and make it much
easier to define what constitutes claims handling and what constitutes
a union representing its members. Even to have proper consumer rights
regulated by the unions in relation to their members would be a major
step forward. I therefore hope that the hon. Member for North-East
Hertfordshire will consider not pushing his amendment, depending on
what the Minister says. The amendment would not be too helpful to our
deliberations.</div><a name="06062879000101"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000385"></a>Mr.
Clapham:</b> I believe that trade unions should be exempted. I
would have liked to see exemption in the Bill, but that is not to be
the case. Trade unions should be exempted because of some of the points
made by my hon. Friend the Member for Sherwood. Over the years, they
have been able to collect together and to afford the legal services
that have pushed the boundaries of the law. In a prior life, I was the
deputy head of the NUM compensation department in Yorkshire. At that
time, we had in-house solicitors and claims officers. Following an
accident at a colliery, a claims officer would receive what was then
called the AR1 or accident report form. He would decide whether he
thought there had been a breach of common law or of statute and proceed
from there.</div> <a name="06062879000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I
said, the cases would be dealt with in-house, between the solicitors,
the claims officers and the Coal Board social insurance department.
Many cases were settled in-house. The few cases that could not be
resolved within the framework of the figures that our side had put
forward went to court. Generally, cases went to court on quantum
issues.</div><a name="06062879000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, that
changed following the collapse of the coal mining industry. Many of the
NUM areas could no longer afford to keep in-house solicitors or
in-house law firms so they engaged the services of trade union
solicitors such as Raleys and Thompsons. I can tell the hon. Gentleman
that I telephoned Raleys to ask what some of the reserves that had been
passed to the NUM 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column124" />Column number: 125</div>could be used for. I was told that there are 200
surface claims that may be run. The Committee will be aware that the
current chronic obstructive pulmonary disease scheme does not cover
surface workers. That issue may well still be challenged. We will
see.</div><a name="06062879000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend
the Member for Sherwood referred to the COPD claim. I can tell the
Committee that the COPD claim would have been unlikely to be
resolved had we not had a change of Government. On 17 January 1996 I
introduced the last debate on the COPD claim and requested that the
Government consider introducing a scheme. If I recall correctly, the
then Minister replied that one could not distinguish between the damage
done to a person&#146;s lungs by smoking and that done by dust. The
trade unions were in the Gallery and decided, following that debate,
that they would take the case to court. The case went to court and the
High Court came down on the side of the trade unions. That was
challenged. In between times there had been a change of Government, but
the Appeal Court heard the case in February 1998 and decided that the
decision of the High Court was
correct.</div><a name="06062879000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">At that
point, the Government decided that they would put a scheme into being.
Because the case was owned by the courts and not by the Government,
they left the solicitors from both sides to negotiate a scheme and a
fee structure. That is where the large sums of money referred to came
from. Solicitors from both sides sat down and negotiated the fee
structure, which the court accepted. The court endorsed the fee
structure, as indeed it did the COPD
scheme.</div><a name="06062879000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">So the COPD
scheme came into being as the result of the collective action of the
trade unions. They were able to afford to take that case to court and
through the appeals procedure and eventually to win through with a
scheme. Trade unions have done that over the past century. In doing so
they have pushed at the boundaries of the law. They are a force for
betterment.</div><a name="06062879000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">During the
debate on Second Reading I made the distinction between trade unions
and claims handlers. I used two cases to show that distinction. There
is clearly a distinction. Claims handlers exist to make a profit,
whereas trade unions and their legal services exist to represent their
members and to ensure that the working environment is made better by
collective action. So there is a huge difference, and I hope that the
Minister will ensure that trade unions are
exempted.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000386"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> I do not come to the debate with any particular
prejudice, although I was instructed and briefed by Thompsons in my
previous job and held a brief from them. Given that the issue before us
has been raised again, I thought that it would be courteous to ask
Thompsons what the current practice is and I shall share with hon.
Members the key points from their reply because they are relevant. They
also pick up a point that the hon. Member for
Midlothian (Mr. Hamilton) made the other day and confirm that
there are differential practices north and south of the border because
of differences in the law, and those are highly relevant to this
debate.</div> <a name="06062879000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">I asked the
hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire whether he would take a
different view depending on whether legal advice was in-house or 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column125" />Column number: 126</div>contracted out, simply because I wanted to know
whether he had addressed the question. Thompsons tell me&#151;I have
not done a survey myself, although other colleagues might know more
about this&#151;that unions &#147;invariably&#148; use law firms
rather than deal with cases in-house, so I am working on the assumption
that that is generally the case. In theory, unions could have their own
lawyers, and we certainly had an in-house lawyer in the old days when I
was a students union officer, but things have moved on, and I am
assuming that pretty well everybody in England and Wales contracts out
their legal advice.</div>
<a name="06062879000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of course, such firms are
regulated by the Law Society and come within its system. As people
know, I am pretty critical of how that system has worked in the past,
but I hope that it is being dealt with. I have tabled a later amendment
to ensure that we link this debate and this Bill with the legislation
that is coming down the track on the regulation of legal services,
because, logically, we need to put them under the same
umbrella.</div>
<a name="06062879000111"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000387"></a>Mr.
Heald:</b> So Thompsons have really told the hon. Gentleman
that the trade union functions as a claims
handler?</div><a name="06062879000112"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000388"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> The answer is that a trade union receives a
request for help from a member, but then passes on any legal aspects to
a company, which will act for it.</div>
<a name="06062879000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps I can pause there and
add that the point that the hon. Member for Bassetlaw made a minute ago
is important. There should be a clear distinction between union
members, who are entitled to the services that a union can properly
give them, and people who sign up for the day without having a proper
link to the union through their employment. That makes all the
difference. It is entirely proper that a union member and their
immediate family should have the protection of the services that are
offered to them as a result of their contributions, but somebody else
should not be able to walk in off the street, become an associate
member and get the benefit. That is important.</div>
<a name="06062879000315"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will just give a summary of
the points that Thompsons made. If the Minister believes, on advice,
that they are untrue, I hope that she will tell us, because we all need
to work on the basis of the facts. One key point picks up the
contributions made by the hon. Members for Sherwood and for Bassetlaw
and others. Thompsons say that unions have conducted all or much of the
legal work for their members and their families for a long time, and
that was certainly my experience when I did such work. They either did
that work in-house or they passed it out; indeed, they mainly passed it
out to firms such as Thompsons, and that was certainly true 20 years
ago, when such firms did much union work.</div>
<a name="06062879000316"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thompsons go on to say that,
for many years, trade unions&#151;particularly those in the coal
industry, where there is a heavy incidence of disease&#151;operated a
scheme of funding</div> <a name="06062879000317"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;that
was based on contributions from successful cases
cross-subsidising&#148;</div><a name="06062879000318"></a><div class="hs_Para">other
claims, and particularly test case claims. In the past, deductions were
made sometimes by the union and sometimes by the law firm. However,
they would, in theory at least, be put into a pot, although I 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column126" />Column number: 127</div>understand the point about the profits going to the solicitors. As a
result, there was money in the pot so that the firm could take a test
case on a new form of industrial industry or
disease.</div><a name="06062879000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thompsons
tell me&#151;I have no reason to disbelieve this&#151;that they
have never benefited from such deductions and that they have passed
them on to the unions to benefit the members who use their legal
schemes. I have not been able to check that, but that is what I am
told. I hope that it is true, otherwise Thompsons will doubtless be
challenged.</div><a name="06062879000115"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000389"></a>Mr.
Kevan Jones:</b> I am listening carefully to the hon.
Gentleman, but he is a little behind the times. He is suggesting that
we still have the system that used to exist, whereby somebody joining a
union was covered if they lost a risky case. That is not the case since
conditional fees came into
operation.</div><a name="06062879000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thompsons
have been a bit disingenuous in what they have said to the hon.
Gentleman. There is a big difference between the cases to which he
refers and a scheme case, in which there is no chance of anybody losing
anything at
all.</div><a name="06062879000117"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000390"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> I was coming to that. I am conscious that the law
has moved on in England and Wales, which is why the difference is now
between the English and Welsh system and the Scottish
system.</div><a name="06062879000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thirdly,
Thompsons make the good point that the unions are not alone in making
deductions and that the state also does so. If claimants receive
state-funded civil legal aid and succeed in their case, they pay back
into the legal aid fund. That continues to be controversial, but
remains the
case.</div><a name="06062879000119"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000391"></a>Mr.
Jones:</b> I am sorry to intervene again on the hon.
Gentleman, but in the case of the COPD scheme and the people with whom
I and my hon. Friends the Member for Bassetlaw and for Sherwood have
dealt, the solicitors were paid and the fees were guaranteed by the
Government. The idea that those cases were somehow risky is
wrong&#151;they were underwritten by the Government. To say that they
were on a par with other trade union cases with which I used to deal on
a professional basis is just not
true.</div><a name="06062879000120"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000392"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> I understand that and accept that there is a
difference between a test case on new ground, which is a risk and could
last a long time and affect a lot of people, and a case in which there
is clear underwriting of costs. I do not dispute
that.</div><a name="06062879000121"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000393"></a>Mr.
Heald:</b> I could not quite follow the point that the hon.
Gentleman was making about those who win their cases having to give
money to the legal aid fund. There was a scheme years ago whereby a
counsel had to put 10 per cent. back in the pot, but that
went out years
ago.</div><a name="06062879000122"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000394"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> I am talking about the pre-2000 position. When I
used to appear in the courts, if the claimant won a civil legal aid
case the costs were taken out of the damages awarded. That is
why, as I am sure you will know from your own experience, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column127" />Column number: 128</div>Mr. Atkinson, there could be a big damages claim but after a two-year
case the claimant would be left with a very small amount of money. That
is why the best advice was, &#147;Never go to a lawyer if you can
possibly avoid it.&#148; I am not being flippant about
that.</div><a name="06062879000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also wish to
put on record the fact that most of the big test cases, not only those
taken by Thompsons but others in the name of trade unions, have been
won. I am talking not about cases that have already been argued, after
which everybody seeks to gain the benefit of them, but about new ground
cases. The big test cases run for many years, as did the one that we
have debated, and the unions are best placed for such cases because
they have the widest experience and the most people able to give
appropriate evidence and help them to build up a case with examples.
Chronic bronchitis and emphysema are obvious examples of such cases. It
is also true that there is benefit in being a union member because
otherwise an individual would have to use a little local solicitor who
has not dealt with such cases and does not have the experience to pick
them up. Going to a firm that knows what it is talking about and has
been through the courts before is clearly a potential benefit to a
union member.</div> <a name="06062879000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
those days&#151;before 2000&#151;there was cross-funding whereby a
normal contribution went in and test cases were paid for from that
source. The hon. Member for North Durham made the point that in 2000,
when the Access to Justice Act 1999 came into force, insurance and
conditional fees started to be part of the way in which the system
works. I understand that because of the ability to insure personal
injury cases, contributions from compensation are now very rarely
needed. I therefore assume that the hon. Member for Sherwood was
talking about the pre-Access to Justice Act cases before 2000, when
money was still taken out of the kitty. People should not have to be
asked for money now. It should not come out to be paid either to the
union, in most cases, or to the law firm because there is an insurance
policy that they take out as soon as someone comes up with the
claim.</div><a name="06062879000125"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000395"></a>Paddy
Tipping:</b> That is not precisely the case, but my hon.
Friend the Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone (Mr. Clapham) talked
about the case that has been prepared for surface workers. There is
also a long-standing matter about cases on beat knee or miner&#146;s
knee, which will not be insured. It will be necessary for the trade
union to provide the initial funding to take the cases
forward.</div><a name="06062879000126"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000396"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> I accept that. The qualifying point that I was
going to make is that there are both old and more recent cases in which
a conditional fee or insurance does not work. Those are usually test
cases in areas that have not been tried before in which insurance
companies will not pick up or be able to quantify what can be big
libels.</div><a name="06062879000127"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000397"></a>Mr.
Kevan Jones:</b> Before the hon. Member gives way, may I say
to the hon. Gentleman that he seems to be going rather wide of the
amendment, which is related to the Secretary of State&#146;s powers
and
exemptions.</div><a name="06062879000128"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000398"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column128" />Column number: 129</div><a name="06062879000129"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000399"></a>Mr.
Jones:</b> I accept that there are cases that trade unions
need to fund. However, they do not need to get that money from
individual members. The other way is to claim a success fee from the
other side, which creates a pool of money that can be used for cases
that are lost or for tests. I know that because one of my last acts
before leaving chambers was to set up such a thing in the north-east
of
England.</div><a name="06062879000130"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000400"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> I understand that too. May I say, Mr.
Atkinson, in deference to your intervention, and to place it on the
record, that my view is&#151;on the basis of the information that I
am sharing with the Committee&#151;that they should not be exempted?
If they are to be exempted at all, it should be on the basis of a
rational assessment of the law position in England and Wales. For the
reasons that the hon. Member for Midlothian gave, it may be entirely
different in Scotland, which will mean that there are no conditional
fees and all the other
things.</div><a name="06062879000131"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000401"></a>John
Mann:</b> Is not the hon. Gentleman missing the point, as the
Thompsons briefing also does? The matter is not about different kinds
of funding, although there is an issue about that. Both this Bill and
the amendment are about whether there are individual consumer
rights.</div> <a name="06062879000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">For example,
in 1989, the NUM&#146;s president wrote to Mrs. Meacham, my
constituent, saying that she would have to decline the offer that she
had been made or the NUM would take action against her as a member.
Subsequently, she did not have her case put in the batches that went to
court, which resulted in her receiving no compensation.</div>
<a name="06062879000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">Consumer rights is the issue.
Should we not be wary of falling into the trap of discussing different
types of union funding? Should there or should there not be consumer
rights? Does the amendment improve on the Minister&#146;s suggestions
in ensuring that there are consumer
rights.</div><a name="06062879000134"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000402"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> I accept that that is the right place to make the
judgment. I accept that no one&#151;even if they have been a union
member all their life or are the wife or the widow or other family
member of a union member&#151;should suddenly find that, without
their express authority and having had the position explained to them,
they agree to what happens, particularly if it means they make a
financial contribution. I accept that. I agree with that completely. It
is quite wrong, it was wrong, it is wrong now.</div>
<a name="06062879000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">The point that I am trying to
make is that it is my understanding that since 2000, that situation
should be less frequent in England and Wales. The system of insurance
and conditional fee means that no one needs to take any money from one
when they start the case because they do not need to put money up front
into the kitty.</div> <a name="06062879000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
finish with the point that the hon. Gentleman prompted me to make. The
question is will everyone be covered? At the end of the day, is the Law
Society going properly to cover law firms, so that they do not take
money from people that they do not know has been taken and not put it
to a proper use? Is anyone 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column129" />Column number: 130</div>else going to take money? The Bill is about ensuring that other
organisations that are not regulated, as we hope law firms are, do not
take money from people in a way that the customer cannot understand and
that is not under control. Whether they are unions or other
organisation, they need to be under the regulatory umbrella so that the
individuals to whom the hon. Member for Bassetlaw and others have
referred never again find themselves losing not only their rights but
their money in such a way that they cannot control what goes
on.</div><a name="06062879000324"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000403"></a>Mr.
Anderson:</b> This debate was effectively about legislating
against the myth of the compensation culture. We said clearly on the
first day in Committee that that is what it is: a myth. I hope that we
can dispel some more myths later in the debate. The hon. Member for
Canterbury (Mr. Brazier), who is not in the Room, spoke a lot about
have-a-go claimants&#151;people who try it on. My experience is from
the other side of the fence, of people who never admit that they are
wrong, particularly employers who have done wrong and abused people at
work, and of trying to ensure the rights of the employees who have been
exposed to them.</div>
<a name="06062879000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">Unlike my hon. Friend the
Member for Midlothian, I cannot say that I am a member of the National
Union of Mineworkers. The section of that union of which I was a member
became defunct in 1995 thanks to the efforts of the Conservative party
in destroying the coal industry in the north-east of Durham. I am proud
of the fact that I was the president and am a life honorary member of
Unison, a union with 1.5 million members, a turnover of &#163;150
million a year and legal bills of probably more than &#163;10 million
a year. The same thing that Unison has tried to do, which is to look
after people who have been abused at work, is what the trade unions, or
what is left of them, in the coal mining areas have tried to do. They
have tried to look after people who have been left high and dry by
employers.</div> <a name="06062879000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
reality in the north-east is that from 1993 there were no paying-in
members, no subscriptions coming in and the union had no access to
information to try to run cases and expose the fact that people had
been treated badly at work. As everybody has agreed both here and in
the Chamber, people were exposed to bad treatment at work and their
cases were legitimate. They had to find the money to start the cases,
and there were only two ways in which they could do that. One was to
sell property and the other was to get together and say to the people
who had represented them for more than 200 years in the north-east,
&#147;We will try to carry on supporting you if give us funds to do
so.&#148;</div><a name="06062879000140"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000405"></a>Mr.

do that on your
behalf.</div><a name="06062879000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is clear
that we are considering whether trade unions are claim handlers. There
is a long history of the difference between trade unions and claim
handlers 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column130" />Column number: 131</div>being that when a case is handed over by a trade union it does not end
there. The union must continue to carry out work and a lot of work goes
on to try to find witnesses. There have been successful cases in which
people have been dead for more than 30 years, and the unions have gone
out and spoken to former members and colleagues, asking, &#147;Can
you remember what was happening and what this man was using, and where
he was exposed to this thing?&#148; No claim handler in the world
would do that; they want to be in and out, get the money and
leave.</div><a name="06062879000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other
difference, which is key, is that there is massive trust of trade
unions in the community. People might say that what has gone on has
breached that trust, which is a sad shame and I hope that it is put
right. However, people have faith in trade unions to do work for them
because of the long history of that having happened. When intervening
on the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire I said that there are
restraints on trade unions that there are not on claims handlers,
including the fact that financial records have to go in front of the
certification officer, who can be challenged by ordinary members and
who can go through books in a way that could never be done in the case
of an insurance company. Again, the reality is different in trade
unions.</div><a name="06062879000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">The ongoing
work is not just about individual cases; there are knock-on effects. In
cases in which compensation has been won, many people have accessed
payments through what was the Department of Social Security and is now
the Department for Work and Pensions. The unions on the ground have
supported those people to go to appeal and to take out cases on reduced
earnings allowances and other such matters. The unions have helped them
to continue to get the support to which they are entitled. To return to
my original point, without the deductions that would not have happened.
It is clear that they also intend to carry on doing work. The NUM is a
federated structure, and certain federations are now agreeing to take
on more cases for people who have had their knees damaged at work. That
can be done only if people work together. The union will provide the
money up front&#151;money that they do not have through
subscriptions&#151;and take a risk on behalf of their members. If the
risk comes off, those people will be well looked
after.</div>
<a name="06062879000145"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000406"></a>Mr.
Hamilton:</b> Several parts of that federation are considering
the weak knee issue, which will cost millions of pounds to take
forward. It will not affect existing miners; however, it will affect
hundreds of thousands of former miners who have not paid any union
dues.</div>
<a name="06062879000146"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000407"></a>Mr.
Anderson:</b> That is exactly my point. The union is doing
what it did years ago and taking a risk. It is saying to the members,
&#147;If we can deal with it for you, we need to do it up
front.&#148; The point was made that people are getting nothing back,
but one section still involved in compensation in the north-east pays
funeral grants, education grants and subsistence grants for people
moving into convalescence homes. There is
support.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column131" />Column number: 132</div><a name="06062879000147"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000408"></a>Mr.
Kevan Jones:</b> May I apologise for not being present at the
beginning of the debate? I was in the Administration
Committee.</div> <a name="06062879000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said
on Second Reading, the starting point for the debate is the consumer.
That is fair, and that is where the Government are coming from. We must
have something to protect the consumer. I also made it clear on Second
Reading that trade unions should be exempt in certain circumstances. If
they act as claims handlers, however, they should be covered by this
legislation.</div> <a name="06062879000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">I forgot
to say that I and my hon. Friends the Members for Bassetlaw and for
Sherwood have been castigated by certain people in the trade union
movement. It is strange that they do not come out the woodwork, into
the light and say to our faces that we are somehow hampering the
movement by insisting that regulation is introduced for those few trade
unions that act as claims handlers. I am sorry, but we are doing not
only the movement but the consumer a favour.</div>
<a name="06062879000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have great respect for the
work that my hon. Friend the Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone
has done on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asbestos issues,
but he says that there should be an exemption in the Bill. I heard it
put forward in a recent briefing by Thompsons, which seems to have much
to say to try to skew the debate. If the Bill exempted trade unions,
the exemption would have to include all trade unions. I am sorry but I
shall neither sanction nor support such claims-handling unions as the
Union of Democratic Mineworkers and the Durham Miners Association in
the north-east of England by providing them with blanket exemption.
That is why I support the proposal for a code of conduct that regulates
the way in which they operate. It will not provide them with a blanket
amnesty.</div> <a name="06062879000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">I, like my
hon. Friend the Member for Bassetlaw, wait with interest to see what
the code says, but if unions break it, they should be regulated. From
the examples that my hon. Friend has given, it is clear that the UDM is
not only acting as a claims handler, but setting up around it a string
of other operations.</div>
<a name="06062879000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall resist the amendment.
If one acts within the law and one is a trade union member, like my
hon. Friend, one will be covered by other regulations. That is fine. I
must disagree with earlier comments, because the Durham Miners
Association acts as a claims handler. It charges people&#151;some of
whom have no connection with the union movement at
all&#151;&#163;20 a year associate membership, which is not
membership at all. It does not confer on them any trade union rights or
voting rights in the association. Likewise, it is not covered by the
certification officer. I have checked whether such people come under
the certification officer&#146;s remit, and they clearly do
not.</div><a name="06062879000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">What is the
&#163;20 a year fee? It is an access fee, paid as a fee would be paid
to a claims handler, to get access to what was described in a letter
from Thompsons solicitors in my constituency recently as the
&#147;Durham miners&#146; legal aid scheme,&#148; giving the
impression that it is a great scheme. It is not; there was clearly no
risk involved in the cases. The fee is an access fee, and if somebody
does not pay it they get a threatening letter saying that if they
continue not to pay it their case will be withdrawn. The most
interesting point is that the person in question must pay on top of
that fee 7.5 per cent. of their final compensation. No early
explanation 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column132" />Column number: 133</div>is given to clients&#151;remember that they are not trade union
members&#151;that they could go to another firm of solicitors or the
secretary of the NUM north of the Tyne and get it done for absolutely
nothing.</div><a name="06062879000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">Like others,
I have no problem with what people do with their compensation. If they
wish to make a voluntary donation to a trade union or any other body,
that is fine and quite legitimate. What is wrong is for people to be
misled into thinking that a trade union is the only way to access
justice. That is why a case such as the one that I have with Thompsons,
or going to the Law Society, is the only redress that people have. The
legislation will cover such people and give them consumer
rights.</div><a name="06062879000155"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000409"></a>John
Mann:</b> Can my hon. Friend come up with any rationale why
solicitors such as Thompsons in his area, or Raleys or others in mine,
cannot pay the unions a marketing fee of &#163;300 or &#163;500 a
claimant, as Wake Smith and BRM solicitors do to Indiclaim, to fund the
unions in doing the worthy things that they do? Is there any reason why
Thompsons, Raleys and other solicitors cannot pay such a legal
marketing
fee?</div><a name="06062879000156"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000410"></a>Mr.
Jones:</b> I hear what my hon. Friend says, and I can see no
reason whatever. I have no problem with trade unions receiving money
from such claims, whether it be from conditional fee arrangements or in
the way that he describes. I find it a little rich that people are
saying that my arguing on behalf of my constituents who have been
misled is somehow an attack on the trade union movement and that such
cases are the only source of finance that trade unions have to continue
their work. I do not think that they are, but my hon. Friend raises an
interesting point.</div><a name="06062879000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
must remember that Thompsons has got something like &#163;100 million
in fees from the Government alone, and that figure is growing by the
day as it settles cases. I cannot see why the person to have their
money deducted should be the claimant and why in the Durham cases
Thompsons could not have paid the NUM to continue their work, if
Thompsons is the great trade union labour firm that it purports to
be.</div><a name="06062879000158"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000411"></a>John
Mann:</b> Will my hon. Friend comment on the fact that Wake
Smith is paying as its marketing fee to Indiclaim approximately 20 to
25 per cent. of the total costs that it gets? If a similar system
applied to firms such as Thompsons and Raleys, but they were to pay,
for instance, just 5 per cent., significantly lower than Wake Smith is
paying to Indiclaim, that would bring many tens of million of pounds
from different companies into the unions
instantly.</div><a name="06062879000159"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000412"></a>Mr.
Jones:</b> I agree, that would be a fairer way to do it as the
claimants would not have their money deducted. Many people might say
that the &#163;20 a year associate membership fee is somehow not much
money, but it is if it goes on for five years&#151;it is &#163;100.
The amount of money that has been deducted from the compensation of the
people with whom I am dealing is such that they can little afford
it.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000413"></a>Mr.
Heald:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way.
He will appreciate that one of the problems with claims handlers is
getting hold of a proper file to check through and find out what they
have been up to. What worries me about the code of conduct
approach&#151;the informal approach being suggested by the
Minister&#151;is that it will not have all the powers, which the
regulator will have, to investigate what has gone
on.</div><a name="06062879000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not know
whether the hon. Gentleman has seen a document called
&#147;The Compensation Claims Management Services
Regulations&#148;, which is a Government draft listing excellent
powers such as getting hold of documents by using the procedures
herein, including search warrants, or being able to seize documents.
They are all firm powers available to the regulator. That is what we
are going to miss out on if we go down the route of the code of
conduct. That is my
concern.</div><a name="06062879000162"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000414"></a>Mr.
Jones:</b> I do not think that we are. First, I want to see
the code of conduct as tough as possible. What the hon. Gentleman
misses&#151;I might be getting this wrong&#151;is that if people do
not sign up to or meet the code of conduct they will be drawn into
regulation and will come under the powers that the hon. Gentleman has
just explained. I agree that the important point is how tough the code
of conduct will be&#151;I hold my breath. The code must be tough to
ensure that trade unions or anyone else acting in the field has due
regard to issues around, for example, explaining to people their rights
if there is a complaint. I do not think that there is a loophole
because if trade unions start acting as claims handlers and not abiding
by the code they will be drawn into regulation by the Secretary of
State.</div><a name="06062879000163"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000415"></a>Mr.
Heald:</b> Say there were legitimate suspicions that the code
of conduct was being broken by, say, Vendside or one of the other
organisations. If they were regulated one could go in and get the
documents. That is easy. What would happen under the informal scheme,
with the code of conduct? There are no powers. That is my
concern.</div><a name="06062879000164"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000416"></a>Mr.
Jones:</b> I hope Vendside would be covered by the claims
handling regulation and not get
exemption.</div><a name="06062879000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">I find it
strange that the tables are turned here. The Government are arguing for
less regulation and the hon. Gentleman is asking for more regulation in
certain areas. That is a strange thing from the hon.
Gentleman.</div><a name="06062879000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">The point
is clear. If people do not abide by or fail the code, the Secretary of
State will have the powers to pull them into regulation. Therefore, the
powers outlined would be
covered.</div><a name="06062879000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government are putting forward a sensible approach. Trade unions
undertake fantastic work in representing their members. However, and
for the first time in my life, I have to agree with the hon. Member for
North Southwark and Bermondsey; there is a big difference between
members&#151;people who have taken a conscious decision to join a
trade union and gain the benefits, as well as the protection in law
with certification or other things&#151;and people with no such 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column134" />Column number: 135</div>connection, who are just being farmed into the organisation for claims
or legal services. That is a big difference that we need to
recognise.</div><a name="06062879000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">I come back
to the point with which I started; the consumer has to be the key
issue. It is clear from the Durham NUM cases that I have in my
constituency that there are no consumer rights apart from the
complaints made to the Law Society about the solicitors who should have
given clearer advice. I hope that we will give those people rights when
dealing with their claim through the claims handling
arrangement.</div><a name="06062879000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
a big difference between scheme cases where there is no risk in a lot
or none of the cases, and those bits of legislation involving injuries
where people&#151;if, for example, they are injured at
work&#151;are taking individual cases. Although there is no risk
here, clearly there is there. Certain people have seen this as a honey
pot to be dipped into, which frankly has not done credit to solicitors
or, I hasten to add, some who claim to be staunch trade unionists, but
at the end of the day are making a great deal of money out of people.
Many of my constituents can ill afford to lose any of the compensation
that they have been rightly awarded by a Labour
Government.</div><a name="06062879000170"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000417"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs
(Bridget Prentice):</b> We have had a good and thorough
debate. I emphasise the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for
North Durham that the second part of the Bill is about ensuring that
the consumer receives the best possible protection when dealing with
claims farmers or anyone else. I share the worries that have been
expressed about the activities of one union and individual NUM unions.
I accept what my hon. Friends the Members for Midlothian and for
Blaydon said about the fact that the NUM is a federated structure, so
we cannot talk about the whole of the NUM as if it were one entity in
such matters. I take those worries seriously, which is why I have been
working closely with my hon. Friends and the Law Society to resolve
such issues.</div><a name="06062879000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the
hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire, who tabled the amendment,
recognised on Second Reading, we accept that trade unions generally
provide an excellent service for their members, particularly in
personal injury and employment cases. Therefore, bad practice by two
trade unions should not justify imposing unnecessary burdens on the
rest. My hon. Friend the Member for Blaydon advanced a powerful
argument about the vital role that trade unions play in our society,
championing the rights of ordinary hard-working
people.</div><a name="06062879000172"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000418"></a>Mr.
Heald:</b> I wonder whether we can do a deal. If the Minister
does not exempt the UDM and the NUM, we could be
there.</div><a name="06062879000173"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000419"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> When I explain the thinking behind the
exemption, the hon. Gentleman might consider that we have done a deal
and be sufficiently reassured to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="06062879000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">We want to
focus the regulation on the areas where there is the greatest potential
for consumer detriment. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column135" />Column number: 136</div>The risk of harm is posed by commercial claims farmers, not the
overwhelming majority of trade unions. The Better Regulation Task Force
recommended in its 2004 Report &#147;Better Routes to Redress&#148;
that we regulate claims management companies, but it did not suggest
regulating trade unions. We need to put in place a proportionate
regulatory mechanism that is effective in clamping down on the cowboys,
but which does not shackle trade unions or others in the not-for-profit
sector. I must say that, during the whole debate, there has not been
much mention of the other organisations in that sector that we are
prepared to exempt and that also do an excellent job on behalf of
vulnerable people.</div><a name="06062879000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
hon. Friend the Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone made a powerful
speech at the beginning of the debate about the unique position in
which trade union find themselves. They have a long history of ensuring
that workers&#146; rights are protected and have campaigned long and
hard, as he has done, for health and safety protection. That motivation
therefore is qualitatively different from that of a commercial claims
farmer. The intention of the Bill is to tackle abuses by commercial
claims farmers and that is where we should be focusing our
attention.</div><a name="06062879000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I made
clear on Second Reading, we intend to exempt by order trade unions
certified as independent by the certification officer, when they
provide regulated claims management services to their members and their
members&#146; families. Many trade unions offer services to a
member&#146;s husband or wife, partner or other close relative. Of
course, we need to avoid loopholes and we will be looking carefully
with the TUC at the definition of &#147;member&#148; to ensure that
it is properly defined so that we avoid exempting the provision of
services to associate members. I hope that that reassures the hon.
Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey and my hon. Friend the Member
for North Durham, who made an important point about associate
members.</div><a name="06062879000177"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000420"></a>Mr.
Hamilton:</b> On that point, we should separate associate
membership from retired membership. In Scotland, we have a substantial
number of retired membership branches&#151;indeed, I opened one in
Midlothian just three weeks ago, which is the third one there. We do
not have a membership in Scotland&#151;there is a core of 20 or 30
members. Retired members still look to local, ex-union officials to try
to support them, and the retired branches should be included in the
same way.</div>
<a name="06062879000178"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000421"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> I accept what my hon. Friend is saying. He has
made the point that I think a number of Members made earlier, that
there has to be the link with the trade union and the services that the
union provides. If the union provides the services to retired members
in the way that he describes, I am sure that we can find a way of
describing membership to take that into
account.</div><a name="06062879000179"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000422"></a>John
Mann:</b> On retired members, is it not critical for the
Minister to ensure that rights of membership are the issue, rather than
category of membership? Otherwise a union such as the UDM could change
its rule book and say, &#147;Everyone is a retired member. If you
were ever once a member you are classified as a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column136" />Column number: 137</div>retired member and therefore will be able to bypass the
legislation.&#148; The critical issue is the consumer and other
rights that can be exercised by what is generally recognised as a union
member&#151;a paying one&#151;and the rights that ensue from that
membership.</div><a name="06062879000180"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000423"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> My hon. Friend makes the point well. That will
be at the forefront of our thinking when we come to define what is
meant by a member. We consider full regulation of trade unions to be
excessive and an unnecessary burden, but we think that proper standards
are needed to ensure that consumers are protected, and the trade unions
agree with us. We shall therefore make it a condition of the exemption
that trade unions demonstrate readiness and commitment to comply with
the code of practice that we shall devise in consultation with the
TUC.</div><a name="06062879000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">From the
political perspective of the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire
he is probably not aware&#151;understandably&#151;that the TUC
works closely with other organisations such as the Royal College of
Nursing and the Police Federation, which will all agree to sign up to
the code of practice, because they too represent their members in the
way that TUC affiliated unions
do.</div><a name="06062879000182"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000424"></a>Mr.
Heald:</b> I am aware of that. Even Conservatives meet the
TUC.</div><a name="06062879000183"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000425"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> A new caring
Conservative?</div><a name="06062879000184"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000426"></a>Mr.
Heald:</b> Actually, I have been meeting its representatives
since 1992. May I ask the Minister about the code of practice? I
imagine that there is a draft. Can we see
it?</div><a name="06062879000185"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000427"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> I am just coming to the code of practice and
what we expect it to contain.</div>
<a name="06062879000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">Any disregard by a union for
the principles outlined by the code of practice can lead to the
Secretary of State withdrawing the exemption. That is a pretty powerful
rule, and it will be enforced. There is no way that any trade union
will get off the hook. If it does not meet the standards in the code,
the Secretary of State can withdraw the
exemption.</div><a name="06062879000187"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000428"></a>Mr.
Kevan Jones:</b> Would my hon. Friend agree that the proposal
is a better method of dealing with rogue elements than a blanket ban,
and will she comment on the suggestion by the hon. Member for
North-East Hertfordshire that certain individuals be excluded? Is it
not the case that the law does not allow exemption only of TUC
affiliated organisations and not others? The proposal rewards all those
trade unions&#151;TUC affiliated or not&#151;that are good, that
will sign up to the code of conduct, and will come down hard on those
that do
not.</div><a name="06062879000326"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.15
pm</div><a name="06062879000188"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000429"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> My hon. Friend is absolutely right. The proposal
allows unions that are not TUC affiliated to be part of the exemption.
That is an important point to make.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column137" />Column number: 138</div><a name="06062879000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">I listened carefully to my hon.
Friend&#146;s point about fees. Transparency and clarity will be key
requirements of the code, which will make it plain that the information
given to clients must be clear and must give all the details about the
fees that are charged. The code will set out the acceptable standards,
especially in respect of transparency about fees. There must also be
transparency in respect of any fees that are paid to the union by
another party, such as a solicitor, in respect of a claim. There will
be a very clear procedure for dealing with consumer complaints and
effective redress.</div>
<a name="06062879000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for North-East
Hertfordshire asked me whether he could see a copy of the code of
practice. It is still under discussion but I expect it to be published
by Report when I will ensure that it is made available to every member
of the Committee and of the House.</div>
<a name="06062879000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend the Member for
Bassetlaw asked for two assurances. He asked first about
before-the-event insurers. We have already said that we would exempt
insurers&#151;insurance companies, insurance brokers and their
agents&#151;in respect of claims by their policyholders and anyone
with whom they have arranged insurance. That would cover the normal
business of insurance companies and their claims-handling agents
because such activity is already regulated by the Financial Services
Authority. When a claims handling activity is carried out by a BTE
insurer that is not within the regulation, that insurer would have to
seek authorisation under the scheme.</div>
<a name="06062879000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Gentleman also asked
about non-members. Trade unions that provide services to non-members
will require authorisation in exactly the same way as commercial claims
farmers would. Where that is granted they will need to comply with the
full range of articles, regulations and rules of conduct. Several of my
hon. Friends have pointed out that when trade unions act as claims
farmers they should be treated as such; that is the thinking behind the
Bill. On the other hand, when trade unions provide services to both
members and non-members they will have to seek authorisation in respect
of the non-members, although they will still be exempt as far as their
members are
concerned.</div><a name="06062879000193"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000430"></a>Mr.
Heald:</b> So the exemption will be for all trade unions, but
what would happen if, for example, the Union of Democratic Mineworkers
or the National Union of Mineworkers in Durham misbehave? Will the
Minister change the exemption so that it reads, &#147;All trade
unions except the north Durham miners, the NUM or Vendside.&#148;?
How will it
work?</div><a name="06062879000194"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000431"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> It will work quite simply. If the TUC tells the
Secretary of State that a union has not risen to the standard it
expects and it is not following the code of practice, the Secretary of
State can remove the exemption. The union will then have to apply for
authorisation under the regulations. If it does not apply, it will not
be able to practise in that fashion. That is how the proposal will
work.</div><a name="06062879000195"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000432"></a>Mr.
Hamilton:</b> I thank the Minister for giving way. I take her
point about the TUC, but the Scottish Trade Union Congress is a
separate body. As the proposal will, I hope, be rolled out throughout
the UK, it will have to be discussed with the STUC, as
well.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column138" />Column number: 139</div><a name="06062879000196"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000433"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> I take my hon. Friend&#146;s point. I will
ensure that the STUC is also involved in the discussions.</div>
<a name="06062879000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">We should remember that all
trade unions have to comply with general consumer protection law as
well as with the specific legislation relating to trade unions and
their conduct. As some of my hon. Friends have argued, it could be said
that trade unions are already extremely well regulated by a raft of the
laws that relate directly and solely to them. If Members think that
trade unions will be let off the hook, I can assure them categorically
that that will not be the
case.</div><a name="06062879000198"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000434"></a>Mr.
Heald:</b> As I understand it, the Minister is saying that the
TUC will be the regulator. For everybody else, regulators can knock the
door down, go in with a search warrant, require documents and so on,
but the TUC is not equipped to do that to Vendside or the UDM, is
it?</div><a name="06062879000199"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000435"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> The hon. Gentleman is missing the point. The
point regarding the exemption for trade unions is that there will be a
code of practice. If an individual trade union does not behave in line
with that code, the TUC can report it to the Secretary of
State&#151;the regulator&#151;who can then withdraw the
exemption.</div><a name="06062879000200"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000436"></a>Mr.
Kevan Jones:</b> Is it not the case that if a trade union
refused to agree to the code of conduct, it would be regulated
automatically? However, may I urge that matter not be left solely to
the TUC? The Secretary of State should be able to decide whether to
withdraw the exemption based on complaints from consumers or Members of
Parliament.</div><a name="06062879000201"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000437"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> I can answer yes to both those points. I think
that I said on Second Reading, in relation to those who would be
regulated, that the Secretary of State does not have to wait for a
national audit decision, but can, through Members of Parliament or
other individuals, look into a case if there is a suggestion that
someone is not behaving
reputably.</div><a name="06062879000202"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000438"></a>John
Mann:</b> The UDM is in a unique position, because there are
no consumer rights for those who did not go through solicitors. Such
consumers cannot even see their client file, unlike those who go
through a solicitor. Will the Minister ensure that when the Bill is
enacted, those consumer rights will come into place for those who
currently have
none?</div><a name="06062879000203"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000439"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> That will happen. The
UDM-Vendside&#151;whichever is the company&#151;would have to be
regulated. As a company acting in that fashion, it would have to apply
for authorisation.</div>
<a name="06062879000204"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000440"></a>Mr.
Heald:</b> I am surprised to hear the Minister say that
because the UDM is a union, although not a member of the TUC. She says,
&#147;acting in that fashion&#148;, and that trade unions will be
exempted. How will that work?</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column139" />Column number: 140</div><a name="06062879000205"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000441"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> I am saying that the
organisation&#151;UDM-Vendside, as a number of Members have called
it&#151;is clearly a commercial claims farming company and therefore
would be subject to regulation as laid out in the
Bill.</div><a name="06062879000206"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000442"></a>Mr.
Kevan Jones:</b> Is it not the case that the organisation
would be covered because it would not be able to meet the code of
conduct as outlined? Likewise, if complaints were made by Members of
Parliament, as they have been, clearly the Secretary of State would not
exempt
it.</div><a name="06062879000207"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000443"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> My hon. Friend makes a good point. The
organisation would have to comply with the code of practice and, like
trade unions, as I have described, show that it is prepared to abide by
that code. The TUC will have a role in monitoring the activities of its
affiliates and in informing the Secretary of State about any behaviour
that it believes falls below the required
standard.</div><a name="06062879000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">The code of
practice will provide an objective public benchmark against which trade
unions will be judged. If there is sufficient evidence that the
standards of service offered by certain unions has fallen below the
requirements in the code, the Secretary of State will withdraw the
exemption.</div><a name="06062879000209"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000444"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> Will the Minister give
way?</div><a name="06062879000210"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000445"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> Let me answer the point about putting an
exemption in the Bill raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Barnsley,
West and Penistone. I do not want an exemption to be put in the Bill
because that would not give the Secretary of State the flexibility to
deal with rogue behaviour in the way that I have described. If the
provision were in the Bill and rogue behaviour occurred, we would have
to have to act through primary legislation and the consumer could
continue to
suffer.</div><a name="06062879000211"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000446"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> Will the code make it clear to any union member
that they can at any time see any file of theirs held by any law firm
without any
cost?</div><a name="06062879000212"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000447"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> I have been asked questions like that in the
past and have had to be careful when speaking about the role of
solicitors and their files and what they consider to be confidential
documentation and what is not. I would like to return to the hon.
Gentleman on that specific issue, because it might relate to
solicitors&#146; rules and I do not want to make a statement that
might not be
accurate.</div><a name="06062879000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
I have clarified the Government&#146;s position. My hon. Friends have
made a very powerful case for exempting trade unions and other
not-for-profit organisations. I hope that, as a result of this
comprehensive debate, the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire, who
admires the work that trade unions do, will feel sufficiently reassured
to be able to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="06062879000214"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000448"></a>Mr.
Heald:</b> Equality is equity, as they say. There should be a
level playing field. The last thing I want to do is to embarrass the
hon. Members for North 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column140" />Column number: 141</div>Durham and for Bassetlaw, who have taken a brave stand; equally,
however, I do not want to give the Minister a signal that we are happy
with what is going on, because we are not. The idea is that the code,
which we have not seen, allied to the TUC will be an adequate remedy,
but I just do not see
it.</div><a name="06062879000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">If a body
regulated by the regulator&#151;the Secretary of State&#151;does
anything in breach of the codes of conduct issued by the regulator, a
massive raft of powers become available to the regulator to investigate
abuses. We know from what has been going on that it is quite hard to
investigate abuses. It has been hard to get hold of the files, people
have been obstructive, and obstructive actions probably continue. I am
sure that that is why the Minister has the draft Compensation (Claims
Management Services) Regulations 2006 and has put into them all the
powers for the regulator to act if information is not being provided
and there is, on the face of it, a credible allegation of contravention
of the codes of conduct.</div>
<a name="06062879000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not see that that is in
any way equal to what is proposed for trade unions. If there is no
investigator and no powers of investigation, how will Brendan Barber of
the TUC get to the truth? That just does not stack up. If the UDM is to
be exempted, who will get in there and investigate Vendside? The hon.
Member for Bassetlaw has had a heck of a job to get the least
information out of Vendside&#151;at least, that is my understanding
of what he has been saying&#151;so where are the powers? As far as I
can see, there is no question but that Vendside-UDM&#151;I think the
provisional wing is called Vendside&#151;will be exempt. What a
ludicrous notion.</div>
<a name="06062879000217"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000449"></a>Mr.
Kevan Jones:</b> The hon. Gentleman does not quite understand
what is proposed, because it will not be exempt. Let us say that a
trade union signs up to the code and then acts in the way Vendside-UDM
have acted. The hon. Gentleman asks what the powers will be. The
Secretary of State will withdraw the exemption and then the regulator
will be able to kick the doors in, as the hon. Gentleman says, to find
out what has been going
on.</div><a name="06062879000218"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000450"></a>Mr.
Heald:</b> No. Let us compare the two situations. Let us say
that the organisation is regulated&#151;not exempt&#151;and that an
apparently credible allegation is made of a contravention of the code
of conduct that the regulator issues, there are powers to obtain
documents, powers to search and a whole raft of other powers. That is
the first position.</div>
<a name="06062879000327"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.30
pm</div><a name="06062879000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second
position is that the organisation are exempt. Let us say that the hon.
Member for Bassetlaw hears an allegation and wants to investigate it.
Will he be given the file? Well he has not been so far. He has had to
struggle to get the files. Will anybody be able to come in and help him
to investigate&#151;Brendan Barber, for example? Why would the UDM
let him have anything? Equally, if it were the NUM, how satisfied is
the hon. Gentleman after what went on in north Durham that he would get
all the co-operation he required? There need to be some teeth. If
Ministers are saying that we need all these powers of investigation,
why should these cases not be covered in the same
way?</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column141" />Column number: 142</div><a name="06062879000220"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000451"></a>Mr.
Kevan Jones:</b> In the case of the Durham NUM, I accept, like
my hon. Friend the Member for Bassetlaw, that the present position is
very difficult because there is no method of getting redress for these
individuals apart from through the Law Society. If in future the union
were signed up to a scheme, it would have to abide by that code of
conduct. I agree with the hon. Gentleman. I want to be clear what is in
the code of conduct. To protect the consumer it needs to have both a
complaints procedure and a system to remedy complaints. That would
solve the problems of those individual cases. If it got to the stage
that we have reached in Durham and Nottinghamshire with Vendside and
that number of complaints, surely the Secretary of State would have to
act to withdraw the exemption. That would lead to the draconian powers
of kicking doors in that he described being able to be used against
those
unions.</div><a name="06062879000221"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000452"></a>Mr.
Heald:</b> I do not know exactly how long it has taken to
investigate the Vendside claims and to get hold of the files, but I
know that it is years. Is the hon. Gentleman satisfied that we have an
agreement for the trade unions, including the two that have misbehaved,
which means that if they want to they can sign up to the code saying,
&#147;Oh yes, of course we will behave,&#148; and when allegations
are made can be difficult about it saying, &#147;We have done nothing
wrong, why should we produce our files?&#148; Who will make them do
so? Nobody.</div> <a name="06062879000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">One would
not have a panoply of regulations like the Compensation (Claims
Management Services) Regulations 2006 if they were not
needed&#151;well, I do not think that the Government would do that in
this instance, or at least I hope not. If this is necessary to tackle
these sorts of people why should it not apply to the sort of people in
north Durham and Vendside-UDM who we know have been misbehaving. It
seems daft to let them
off.</div><a name="06062879000223"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000453"></a>Paddy
Tipping:</b> I do not want to pursue Vendside
endlessly&#151;I leave that to my hon. Friend the Member for
Bassetlaw&#151;but it is clear that as things stand, Vendside could
not be exempted. First, it is a claims handler, secondly it is a
limited company, not a trade union and, thirdly, the bulk of its work
is not for members, but for a wider audience. I would be pursuing the
Minister hard if there were any chance of Vendside being exempted in
its present form. It will have to change its behaviour
fundamentally.</div><a name="06062879000224"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000454"></a>Mr.
Heald:</b> Forgive me for being a suspicious old lawyer, but
when Claims Direct was sued as a claims handler, it started arguing
that it provided insurance services. It is not beyond the bounds of
possibility that if the powers do not apply to trade unions, Vendside,
which, let us face it, is a union&#151;it is the UDM and a creature
of the union&#151;will maintain that it is a union. I am sure that it
will. In fact, I think that it is doing so. Those people are prepared
to be inventive. We know that claims handlers are already setting up in
Fuengirola so that they do not have to comply with the regulations. We
should not simply accept that these sorts of people who have a lot of
money at stake will behave in a decent way.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column142" />Column number: 143</div><a name="06062879000225"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000455"></a>Mr.
Hamilton:</b> We are talking about 6 million trade unionists.
For the past half hour, the hon. Gentleman has been referring to an
industry with less than 5,000 people. Why does he not say what he
really means? He is attacking the trade unions, as he always
does.</div>
<a name="06062879000226"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000456"></a>Mr.
Heald:</b> Let me put it the other way. I am a lawyer; there
are about 100,000 lawyers, and I do not suppose that more than a
handful could be criticised in the area under discussion.
Raley&#146;s, Thompsons and perhaps two or three other firms have
been mentioned, but I accept that the entire legal profession should be
properly regulated. The question for the hon. Gentleman is, what is he
afraid of? Why does he want an easy deal&#151;easy street&#151;for
the trade unions? The people who are affected have been described as
consumers, but they are the victims of poor health and safety provision
in the workplace. He said that he has been a trade unionist his whole
life, so I would have thought he would have cared about
that.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000457"></a>John
Mann:</b> Why does the hon. Gentleman want a regulator, in
addition to the certification officer, union democracy and common law
rights, spending his or her time on any issue, however frivolous or
unrelated to his or her work, raised by anyone from the
series&#151;the 99.9 per cent.&#151;of trade unions where
nobody has demonstrated any problems, or if they have, from a union
that the Minister can un-exempt, instead of spending his or her time
concentrating on the problem and scandal, which means focusing
precisely on organisations such as the UDM and Vendside which will not
be able to opt in to the code of conduct? Any Minister with a
blossoming career who allowed them to do so would pay a terrible price.
The possibility of its happening defies common sense. I am sure that
the hon. Gentleman accepts that.</div>
<a name="06062879000228"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000458"></a>Mr.
Heald:</b> I should be careful talking about blossoming in the
Minister&#146;s presence, and I do not intend to do so.</div>
<a name="06062879000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">I looked into the point that
the hon. Gentleman made the other day about the certification officer
being the regulator, and I had the Library look into it, too. The
certification officer has distinct and restricted statutory powers that
do not cover somebody who acts as a claims handler, or ensure that that
person acts in accordance with the code of conduct. It might be useful
if the certification officer were the investigator, but the law does
not currently allow for it. I do not want to accept a convenient
solution or a fudge; I want something that works for all claims
handlers. There is a danger that, with so much money at stake and so
much poor behaviour behind us, people will take
advantage.</div>
<a name="06062879000230"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000459"></a>John
Mann:</b> I do not want to reveal the hand that may be used in
court for consumer rights against the UDM and Vendside, but I assure
the hon. Gentleman that had a member complained, the routes to the
certification officer would have been used some two-and-a-half years
ago, with great success, I am certain. When there is a major problem
rather than an individual, one-off complaint, the certification officer
has the power of redress; however, that does not exist with the UDM,
precisely because the complainants are 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column143" />Column number: 144</div>not members. None of the members was charged, and on that basis, the
certification officer will not even consider the
case.</div>
<a name="06062879000231"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000460"></a>Mr.
Heald:</b> It is true that an allegation of financial
irregularity can be made to the certification officer and that he can
investigate it. If a member has some money taken off them by deception,
which is one allegation, it can be investigated. However, the
investigation would not fully cover the misbehaviour in the cases that
we are discussing. As both hon. Members said, the unions acted as
claims handlers, not only for members but for non-members. I want to
ensure that they cannot do so.
</div><a name="06062879000232"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000461"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> I understand where the hon. Gentleman is coming
from, but, to be immodest, would it not be better to use the solution
that I offer him now? Rather than the blanket ban on trade unions being
exempted imposed by his amendment, we could change clause 14, which
allows any order laid by the Minister to be subject to the negative
procedure, so that it required the affirmative procedure. Then, if the
Minister were to come to us with a proposal to exempt unions in
general, types of union, or one union in particular, we would have to
debate it and vote on it.</div>
<a name="06062879000233"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000462"></a>Mr.
Heald:</b> I will support the hon. Gentleman on that. It is a
good idea, but I am still not satisfied. If the Minister said,
&#147;Look, here&#146;s my draft code of conduct; here are the
investigator and the powers. It will be the same as now, only with a
different slightly self-regulatory route, and as effective,&#148;
that would be fair enough. However, she has not gone that far. Perhaps
she will at a later date. I look forward to seeing the code of conduct,
but I should like to press the amendment to a vote.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000478"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> This is a probing amendment to discover the
Government&#146;s latest thinking on sentencing policy, which is a
mystery to most people given how many interpretations we have had of
their views on the subject in recent days. At the moment, the offences
that will be created could land someone who is tried in the High Court
with a period of imprisonment of up to two years, a fine, or both, and
someone who is tried in the lower courts with a period of imprisonment
of 51 weeks or less, a fine, or both. Subsection (3) reminds us that as
yet we have not seen the implementation of the much heralded and now
much discussed Criminal Justice Act 2003, which is meant to change the
sentencing system and will reduce the sentence to half of what it would
otherwise be.</div>
<a name="06062879000328"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.45
pm</div><a name="06062879000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">If my amendment
is passed, and subsection (3) and the parallel provision in clause 10
are removed, there will be a straightforward statement in the Bill that
people can be sentenced to prison for two years in the higher courts
and for up to 51 weeks in the lower courts, or be fined. I want the
Minister to say whether passing the provisions into law will create a
potential for imprisonment that will mean what it says. Out there, the
great British public appear to believe&#151;I always have great
sympathy with their view&#151;that when a judge says, &#147;Mr.
Heald, you will go to prison for six months,&#148; Mr. Heald goes to
prison for six months, not that he goes to prison for three months and
spends the other half somewhere
else.</div><a name="06062879000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">What will be the
implication of a sentence of imprisonment passed under the Bill? How
long will the person serve as a maximum sentence and how long will they
serve as a minimum
sentence?</div><a name="06062879000257"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000479"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes some interesting
points, but I fear that we are in danger of straying into the territory
of my colleagues in the Home Office, and I do not want to go
there.</div><a name="06062879000258"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000480"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> That might be
wise.</div><a name="06062879000259"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000481"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> I want to bring the focus back to the offences
in the Bill and explain the transitional provisions that relate to the
2003 Act.</div> <a name="06062879000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">The current
position is that magistrates courts have the power on summary
conviction to impose a maximum sentence of six months. Once sections
281(4) and 281(5) of the 2003 Act are commenced, that maximum
sentencing power on summary conviction will be increased to 51 weeks.
Under the new arrangement, which is called custody plus, the court will
decide the total length of the sentence, which must be no longer than
51 weeks.</div> <a name="06062879000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
sentence can be split between a custodial period and a licence period.
The custodial period must be between two and 13 weeks, and the licence
period must be at least six months and is subject to conditions, which
the sentencing court sets. If the offender 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column145" />Column number: 146</div>breaches the licence conditions, they will be recalled to custody for
part or all of the remaining supervision
period.</div><a name="06062879000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">Removing the
transitional provisions would give magistrates courts a power that
would be inconsistent with their existing powers and for which the
magistracy will not have the advantage of preparatory measures for
custody plus when it is implemented. It would be much better initially
to make the sentencing powers consistent with existing powers and then
to have a smooth transition to the new arrangements. Otherwise, the
courts might find themselves using one system for some offences and
another system for others. That is why we prefer the arrangement set
out in the Bill. I hope that that the reassures the hon. Gentleman
enough to allow him to withdraw the
amendment.</div>
<a name="06062879000263"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000482"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> As the Minister has nearly beguiled me, I will do
her a deal. I will not pursue the matter if she shares with the
Committee, without compromising her friendship with her colleagues in
the Home Office, the date on which the 2003 Act will be implemented in
relation to the provisions in the
clause.</div><a name="06062879000264"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000483"></a>Bridget

out.</div><a name="06062879000265"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000484"></a>Simon

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000485"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 38, in clause 14, page
9, line 9, leave out from &#145;section 5' to end of line 10 and
insert</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;may not be made unless a
draft has been laid before, and approved by resolution of, each House
of
Parliament.'.</div><a name="06062879000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment would change the provision so that orders made under clause 5
are subject to the affirmative procedure rather than the negative
procedure. I hinted at this a moment ago, so I will simply put it on
the record that it is entirely consistent for the Committee to agree
the affirmative resolution procedure for such orders made under clause
5, which is about exemptions, just as we are asked to agree the
affirmative resolution procedure for orders made under section 4, which
is about the regulator. They are equally important matters. If I were
in any doubt about that or if Committee colleagues, whatever their
views, were in any doubt, I hope that the earlier debate made it clear
how important the matter is. I also hope that the Minister will
understand that it is important to me and will be important to my
colleagues on Report.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column146" />Column number: 147</div><a name="06062879000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">I did not vote on the amendments
on trade unions moved by the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire
because the right way to deal with the problem is not to close off in
Committee the Minister&#146;s power to exempt trade unions, but to
give Parliament the right to decide when an order is
introduced&#151;automatically and only after a debate and a vote in
both Houses&#151;whether she should bring a particular exemption or
exemptions to the House. I hope that she will be sympathetic to the
amendment and that colleagues from all parties will see the merit in
guaranteeing the subject a debate and vote in both Houses. It is
important.</div><a name="06062879000274"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000486"></a>Mr.
Heald:</b> I support the amendment. It is sensible, as I said.
It was a bit miserable of the hon. Gentleman not to support my
amendment, but I hope that when we return to the subject on Report, I
will find an even more felicitous way of putting
it.</div><a name="06062879000275"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000487"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> Any decision to exempt people from a requirement
for authorisation cannot and will not be taken lightly. It must be
subject to proper parliamentary scrutiny. However, the Delegated Powers
and Regulatory Reform Committee in the other place, which by all
accounts is a robust organisation, considered in detail all the
delegated powers in the Bill and approved of our approach to
exemptions. In its report, the Committee said of the Secretary of
State&#146;s power to exempt by order:</div>
<a name="06062879000276"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Negative procedure is
usual for exemption orders of this kind and we consider the provision
to be
appropriate.&#148;</div><a name="06062879000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
know that the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey is keen to
ensure that parliamentary time is used efficiently. He said during the
Committee&#146;s previous sitting that we should avoid secondary
legislation if it creates unnecessary work. I suggest that secondary
legislation is required in this case, but that an order subject to the
negative resolution procedure is more appropriate. I hope that he will
feel able to withdraw his amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000488"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> I was aware that the Lords Committee took that
view. This morning, I learned for the first time from my noble Friend
Lord Wallace of Saltaire that there are more formerly active trade
union Members in the House of Lords than in the House of Commons. I
leave Labour colleagues to reflect on the ability of the Labour
movement in the House of Commons to represent working women and men in
its traditional way. Clearly, new Labour has taken over the Commons
more quickly it has taken over the
Lords.</div><a name="06062879000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not
satisfied with the result. The Minister is right: I have always been
particular in trying to ensure that we do not legislate when we do not
need to and that we do not create work that we do not need to do.
However, I still think that this is an appropriate matter for
compulsory debate and vote. I will seek the Committee&#146;s leave to
withdraw the amendment, but I give notice that I intend to return to
it. I hope that I can persuade colleagues to support me on
Report.</div> <a name="06062879000280"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the
interim, I ask the Minister to reflect on whether, having taken advice,
she might be willing to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column147" />Column number: 148</div>respond positively to what I hope has been a constructive suggestion and
approach in Committee from the Liberal Democrats. I beg to ask leave to

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000489"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 39, in clause 15, page
9, line 17, at end
insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(1A) The preceding
provisions of this Act, other than sections 1 and 2, shall cease to
have effect on 1st January 2012 or upon the entry into force of the
Legal Services Act 2007, whichever is the
earlier.'.</div><a name="06062879000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is the last flourish from the Liberal Democrat Benches. The amendment
would add another subsection between subsections (1) and (2) in clause
15. It is consistent with what the Minister kindly attributed to me as
an objective&#151;to ensure that we do not end up with more law than
we need, with people running about looking in &#147;Halsbury&#146;s
Laws&#148; or at statutes, cross-referring and cross-relating
them.</div> <a name="06062879000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want the Bill
to become subject to a sunset provision so that it disappears and is
incorporated into the draft Legal Services Bill when that becomes an
Act. Rather than having two pieces of legislation that regulate claims
made through a claims firm and through lawyers, anyone who is
interested can go to one piece of legislation. The same goes for
government. That is a justified position because the draft Legal
Services Bill is being considered by Parliament literally as we
speak.</div> <a name="06062879000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
the Minister will be positive about that. Parliament should not pass
legislation that will, or is presumed to, go on forever, when there are
other pieces of legislation in which it could reasonably be dovetailed.
All the provisions in part 2 will not only be in parallel with those
governed by the Legal Services Bill, but are likely to be governed by
the same regulator, as we are told by the Minister. That is important.
It would be a nonsense if we were to end up with one regulator
governing the things that are regulated by two different Acts of
Parliament that are passed within 12 months of each other.</div>
<a name="06062879000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope the Minister will be
sympathetic to the amendment. I am happy to say that I am not bothered
about pressing it to a Division, but I will take drafting suggestions
between now and our deliberations on Report on anything that might
improve it if it is inadequate. However, the purpose is to ensure that
part 2 ends up in the right place, with similar legislation. That would
leave earlier aspects of the Bill which were on a different
issue&#151;we spoke about them at length&#151;to stand in a logical
place. I hope that, in due course, we might be able to put them
somewhere else, too. If I have an excellent idea as to where they could
go tidily, I might come up with that on
Report.</div><a name="06062879000288"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062879000490"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> I am sympathetic to what the hon. Gentleman is
trying to achieve. I agree that it is better for the regulator to be a
member of the family regulating legal and other services. We are
considering carefully how best to pave the way to that type of
integration.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column148" />Column number: 149</div><a name="06062879000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">The draft Legal Services Bill
may or may not be enacted in 2007. It is because of the uncertainty
about the changing shape of the market and the number of companies that
will need to be regulated that we want to keep our options open to
retain maximum flexibility in targeting and giving proportionate
regulation. It is also not necessary to put a time limit on the
operation of the legislation. I am not in favour of adding further
provisions to the Bill unless they are absolutely necessary.</div>
<a name="06062879000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">Even if the legal services
provision is delayed, I do not want to leave consumers with a
regulatory mechanism that has a sunset provision hanging over it. I
would be concerned about them being left with a terminating regime and
no protection if the Parliament of the day was busy doing something
else. On that basis, I ask the hon. Gentleman to reflect on the
