On resuming 
<P>
<B>Mr. Douglas Alexander (Paisley, South):</B> I draw attention to the figure of £11 million mentioned by the hon. Member for Guildford (Mr. St. Aubyn). While the amendment would leave out the figure of £10 million and insert the figure of £20 million in schedule 13 at line 45 on page 213, it would not extend to the wording of line 1 on page 214, which states that the cap immediately following the investment
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"must not exceed £11 million"	.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No other amendment deals with the limit of £11 million, so it strikes me as inconsistent with the subsequent line of the Bill.
<P>
None the less, some wild figures have been bandied about by Conservative Members. Caps of £30 million, £40 million and even £50 million have been mentioned. They do a disservice to the case as the cap on the size of a qualifying company under the enterprise investment scheme could be increased from the asset limit of £10 million given, as the Library confirmed to me today, that that limit permits only the very smallest of newly quoted companies to receive the relief.
<P>
It is worth bearing in mind that, of the 303 recipient companies of the relief in 1996-97, only 15 were in the £500,000 plus range. The cost of the EIS relief is tentatively estimated by the Inland Revenue to be £20 million for 1997-98. To increase that limit in line with the amendment, never mind the wild figures that have been bandied about subsequently, could double the cost of the relief to the Exchequer. I ask my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary to consider whether the limit could be revisited in the future by an amount that would involve a much lower, modest cost to the Exchequer than that suggested by Opposition Members, but which would ensure that assistance was provided to a wider range of companies.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> Mrs. Dunwoody, I fear that you have been put at a disadvantage. You were not present this morning when, on a point of order, a colleague referred to a special coaching lesson that had been arranged by the Paymaster General. The hon. Gentleman moved from the Front Bench a practice that you may wish to draw to the attention of the Committee on Modernisation of the House to the Back Benches until we drew attention to that fact. He somewhat shamefacedly withdrew and we have been puzzled all day about the purpose of that visit to the Back Benches.
<P>
It now transpires that the hon. Member for Paisley, South (Mr. Alexander) was coached to draw attention to various technical deficiencies in our amendment and then, by some dint of special pleading, to encourage his hon. Friend the Economic Secretary to concede the principle at stake. Let us be clear. There are several ways in which schedule 13 will damage the secondary market andthe whole principle of reinvestment relief. Several amendments have been tabled that try to mitigate that damage.
<P>
Amendment No. 137 attempts to limit that damage by raising the limit from £10 million to £20 million. I shall deal now with the defects of that specific £10 million limit. It is faulty for three reasons. First, it is entirely arbitrary. It has been conjured out of the air; it does not exist anywhere else in the Bill. The parallel with venture capital trusts cannot be justified. Secondly, it is extremely poorly defined: the gross asset tests discriminate against companies that are involved in manufacturing and are in favour of companies that are involved in services. The definition of "relevant assets"	 is left completely vague. I cannot find it in the schedule. I have read to the end of the schedule and ploughed through the various definitions. Relevant period and relevant shares are defined, but I cannot find a new definition of the phrase "relevant assets"	. Perhaps the Economic Secretary can help the Committee. The problem is that this definition of the gross asset test will discriminate against manufacturing companies that have substantial assets such as capital equipment and in favour of service companies that can be floated on the alternative investment market with virtually no assets at all.
<P>
The third problem with the £10 million limit is that it is too low. As my hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Mr. Loughton) explained, a limit of £10 million leaves a huge funding gap for companies that have asset values of £20 million, £30 million, £40 million or £50 million. They, too, urgently need investment and have high risk stocks, which were the original purpose of reinvestment relief. It was designed to compensate investors because of the risky nature of the investment involved. Such risks apply to companies with assets of £20 million or £30 million just as they do to those with assets of £10 million. If the limit is fixed at only £10 million, that leaves a huge funding gap for companies with asset values of more than £10 million but less than £75 million.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies </B>(Croydon, Central): Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that the limit should be £50 million? Does he agree with the hon. Member for Guildford that the Opposition and the Government should encourage companies to understate their asset value in order to gain relief? It was suggested that they should.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> There are two points there. The first is the preferable increase of the limit. My hon. Friend the Member for Guildford tabled an amendment suggesting that the limit should be increased from £10 million to £20 million. That is a reasonable level. There is no particular magic attached to the figure of £20 million, as I am sure my hon. Friend will agree. The key point is to raise it above £10 million, which is itself an arbitrary figure. In a few minutes, I suspect that we shall hear that the figure might magically be raised from £10 million. We shall see what figure the Treasury proposes after its extensive consultations with the secondary market.
<P>
<B>Mr. Alexander:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> I will give way, but I want to deal with the second point made by the hon. Member for Croydon, Central (Mr. Davies). He suggested that companies might like to fiddle the definition of assets. That is precisely my point. There is no definition in the schedule of "relevant assets"	. We need to establish one. There is no definition because, if there were, it would become much clearer that the limit of £10 million discriminates against manufacturing companies and in favour of service companies. That is the weakness of the Government's proposals.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> I will give way.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Will the hon. Gentleman indicate to whom he is giving way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> I am being bombarded with advice, but I shall give way to my hon. Friend first.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> The hon. Member for Croydon, Central did not understand what was said. Before Labour Members make any further points, which I fear may be equally ill-informed, I should explain that book value which is a perfectly legitimate accounting notion may be different from market value. The terms do not involve companies misleading the public or anyone else about the true value of their assets. They are both perfectly acceptable ways of measuring value. However, as my hon. Friends have pointed out, the clause does not make that clear.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> My hon. Friend has assisted the Committee. The Economic Secretary may have found a definition of relevant assets at the back of the schedule that may help the Committee to define how the gross asset test is to be applied. However, I cannot find that definition in the schedule.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown (Cotswold):</B> Perhaps I may assist my hon. Friend. The definition is in paragraph 9(3)(6A) of schedule 9.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> I am always grateful to my hon. Friend. However, that sub-paragraph does not define relevant assets. It gives the context for relevant assets and excludes certain assets from the definition.
<P>
I do not want to be unfair, as I promised to give way to the hon. Member for paisley, South (Mr. Alexander). I will now do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Alexander:</B> I wish to comment on that paragraph and the hon. Gentleman's confirmation that he is committed to the figure of £20 million. Will he explain why the amendment leaves untouched the figure of £11 million, which appears in paragraph 9?
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> It is not for my hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown) to advocate the amendment that he has tabled. He will do that when he winds up. I am making the point that the £10 million limit is entirely arbitrary. It has been fixed far too low, leaving a considerable funding gap for small companies that have been successful in attracting initial investment, but find it difficult to attract institutional investment because of the junior market's problems. Those problems include the lack of liquidity and the extent to which company founders wish to hand on to their shares. The original reinvestment relief was designed to tackle such weaknesses.
<P>
The Government are curtailing that relief in an arbitrary way through the £10 million limit and by removing the relief from new shares and confining it to new shares. We shall return to that point when we debate a subsequent amendment.
<P>
In the meantime I wish to make it clear that we support my hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Mr. Loughton) in his attempt to drive up the limit to £20 million and who knows? even beyond that. Some kind of concession may result from the conversations between Treasury officials and the Stock Exchange that have been alluded to in our debate. I am sure that we are all eager to hear about that.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> We have heard a number of speeches. The hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham gave a reasoned argument for the position that he has adopted. The hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds made a stand, but was unable to resist playing to gallery. The hon. Member for Guildford blew the argument of his two hon. Friends by over-egging the pudding. He may have gone some way down the road of convincing me if he had been a little more considered in his approach and more rational in his arguments.
<P>
I must tell the hon. Member for Guildford that we go in for a better class of insult where I come from. [Interruption.] I am not referring to you, Mrs. Dunwoody you would never practise insults. If Opposition Members want to be in the top league of insulting, I commend them to some of my constituents, who would show them how to insult with panache.
<P>
My hon. Friend for Paisley, South made the most succinct point this evening. The amendment is a dog's breakfast. I am grateful to him and to other hon. Members for trying to explain the feeling behind the amendment. It was almost as bad as some of the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey), who told us that we must understand the spirit of an amendment, not necessarily its words.
<P>
I am grateful to those who have told us that the amendment would enable companies with gross assets of between £10 million and £20 million to benefit from investments through the EIS. However, that is not what the amendment says. It would leave the second leg of the test in place. The hon. Member for Sevenoaks completely failed to grasp that point. He might have read the Bill in great detail, but he should also read the amendments tabled by his hon. Friends. They have got themselves into a fankle.

<P>

<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</b> On a point of order, Mrs. Dunwoody. As a relative newcomer to these proceedings, I was under the impression that if an amendment is tabled and there are consequential provisions to it, that is understood when the debate takes place. Is not that the case?<P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> That is not the point of order; it is a point of debate.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> Let me return to this fankle of an amendment.
<P>
<B>Hon. Members:</B> Fankle?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Would the hon. Lady kindly explain the word fankle? [Interruption.]
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> It means convoluted, unclear or inept. I suspect that it is an English word, not a Scottish one. We might differ on that matter.
<P>
There are a few Glaswegian expressions that come to mind, but I will not use them, Mrs. Dunwoody, although I know that you might understand them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Efford:</B> Scunner.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I did not say that anyone was a scunner. [Laughter.]
<P>
The second leg of the test states that gross assets must not exceed £11 million immediately after the investment. I realise that the amendment would permit companies with gross assets of £10.5 million to raise £500,000, but a company with gross assets of £20 million would have to give away £9 million before it could begin to benefit. That is why I used the expression "fankle"	. When my granny dropped a ball of wool and it got into a knot, that was a fankle. That is what the amendment would do.
<P>
I am having some fun at the expense of Conservative Members because the hour is late. I assume that there has been an oversight in drafting the amendment and that Opposition Members are not plotting to destroy the whole purpose of the enterprise and investment scheme. However, even if we were to assume that the amendment had been properly drafted and that we could discuss it, could we go ahead with the ideas in it?
<P>
There are some serious flaws in the amendment. I want to return to first principles. If we read the remarks of Opposition Members in our earlier debates this evening, we would assume that the clause was connected with the promotion of a secondary market in shares. I remind the Committee that the purpose of this part of the Bill is to encourage investment in high-risk companies. The debate has become skewed by the remarks of Opposition Members.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> Will the hon. lady give way?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I will happily give way when I have finished my point.
<P>
To some extent, the debate has become skewed because there has been lobbying from AIM. I accept that, and I have a great respect for the work of AIM. However, I repeat that the purpose of the clauses is to encourage investment in small, high-risk companies that do not have ready access to other sources of venture capital.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> Will the hon. Lady give way?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> As a matter of courtesy, I shall first give was to the hon member for East Worthing and Shoreham.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> Regardless of the drafting errors, I am glad that the hon. Lady is now discussing the principle of the amendment. However, what she has just said is curious. Does she not see the link between the secondary market which she has been discussing and capital coming in to support the investments in the first place? The high risk, high tech companies would just not get the investment if there was not a clear liquid on which they could be floated and on which their investments could grow and be realised in the future.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> The hon. Gentleman might find it slightly more obvious if he did more of his homework. Roughly 300 companies are registered in AIM and about half of them do not benefit from the kind of relief we are talking about here. They seem to be doing rather well. The purpose of the relief contained in the establishment of AIM was to help it get off the ground. It was never envisaged as something that would continue indefinitely. The purpose of the clauses is to encourage the provision of new shares to help new companies. There are other routes whereby existing investments can be used as a means of generating capital.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> If the Minister says that the clauses have the support of the stock exchange can she explain why AIM has written to me saying
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"We are writing to draw your attention to schedule 13 and the threat it poses to the financing of some of this country's fastest growing and most promising businesses"	?<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> AIM is in the business of lobbying. I need no reference to the stock exchange or to any approaches that the stock exchange had made to Government. [Interruption.] The hon. Gentleman has just suggested that I was claiming that the stock exchange supported the clauses. I am here to put forward the Government's point of view and their wish to assist small high-risk companies gather investment finances. Instead of trying to play silly semantic games Opposition Members would do better to concentrate on the point of the clauses.
<P>
The purpose of the clauses and the schedule is to target the EIS at small high-risk companies whose asset base is generally too small for them to be able to attract investment from other sources. The test had admirably served the purpose for venture capital trusts. Who put that test at that level into venture capital trusts? It was the previous Administration, whom I believe some Opposition Members have been known to support. There is no evidence that that £10 million clause has proved too restrictive for venture capital trusts. They have so far managed to raise £500 million worth of funding for such companies.
<P>
Raising the limits could shift the focus of the enterprise investment scheme away from small companies towards those at the upper end of the range and could make the scheme more attractive for management buy-outs. We are told by venture capitalists, and I see their argument, that it is difficult to invest in small companies because the cost of servicing that investment is proportionately the same as that of servicing a major management buy-out. There has traditionally been a problem at that end of the market to generate finance. The Conservative Government recognised that difficulty just as this Government recognise it.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> Does the hon. Lady understand that there is a difference between setting a limit to the size of an individual fund and setting a limit to the type of companies they can invest in? The companies they invest in may have many shareholders who do not benefit from these reliefs but it means that there is a pool of shares available to invest in. The Government are restricting the number of companies in which such funds can invest. It is wrong to take the same figure that is used to limit the size of venture capital trusts and say that the size of the company in which they invest should also be limited.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> The hon. Gentleman is going back to his argument about a secondary market in shares, which is not what the clauses and the schedule are about.
<P>
I want to take up some of the specific points about targeting and cost. The whole issue of cost has not really been raised. As I said in an earlier debate, it is important to take into account the fact that every relief has a cost to the Exchequer. The Inland Revenue estimates that doubling the limits for gross assets of the EIS would cost about £50 million a year in the medium term. If the test for VCTs was to march in step with that and it would need to do so if the rules for qualifying companies are to stay in line the estimated cost would roughly double. That is another argument against the hon. Gentleman's approach.
<P>
It has been suggested that the alternative investment market would wither on the vine because liquidity would be seriously reduced. I repeat that the purpose of the enterprise investment scheme is to provide tax relief for direct investment, not to support a secondary market in company shares.
<P>
I mentioned earlier that a significant number of AIM companies have never qualified for reinvestment relief, but they have done quite well. It has not precluded an active market in their shares. Indeed, the prices of many AIM shares have risen or remained stable since reinvestment relief ceased to be available. It is too early to say with any certainty what the effects will be, but I will make the pledge that we will keep market liquidity under review. That is an important point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> Will the hon. Lady give way?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> No, I should like to make some progress. I shall return to the hon. Gentleman in a moment.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman made a point about institutions rarely investing in companies that were capitalised at less that £75 million.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> The hon. Lady should know that it is a qualification for full listing on the stock market, that the company must be capitalised at £75 million. It has nothing to do with institutional investment in it.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for clarifying something that was not clear in his initial contribution.
<P>
When VCTs were introduced, there was much debate about the funding gap for companies worth less than £10 million. Press cuttings which I am sure you look at every night, Mrs. Dunwoody show that. The hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds asked for evidence from studies. He suggested that the figure was plucked out of the air. If so, it was plucked out of the air by his Government. However, it was not plucked out of the air the limits were chosen.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> That is a different thing.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> The hon. Gentleman says that that is a different thing, but the limits were chosen specifically because there is a lead across to VCTs. The other clauses show that we are trying to turn VCTs and the enterprise investment scheme into a more coherent and harmonised structure.
<P>
VCT legislation was introduced three years ago following extensive consultation with the industry, in particular with the British Venture Capital Association. The debate was wide and as a consequence of that consultation with interested parties the figure of £10 million was decided on.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> Will the hon. Lady give way?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> No. I am trying to respond to my hon. Friend the Member for Paisley, South. The arguments have been obscured this evening by some of the fantasy figures that Opposition Members have plucked out of the air. However, my hon. Friend makes an valid point about the need to keep under review the nature of the limit. I undertake to give the mater due consideration, but I must make it explicitly clear to the Committee that the figures that Opposition Members have bandied about are ludicrous.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> In a spirit of openness, will the hon. Lady make available a copy of the report to which she referred earlier? There seems to be some confusion. AIM does not believe that there is any objective evidence demonstrating that the Government arrived at the £10 million figure as a result of research. It believes that the figure was plucked out of thin air. Opposition Members do not accept the analogy with the VCTs.
<P>
<H5>9 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</b> Had the hon. Gentleman been listening, he would have heard me say that consultation took place when venture capital trusts were introduced. So keen is he to play to the gallery that he missed my response to the rational and reasoned plea that my hon. Friend the Member for Paisley, South (Mr. Alexander) made for consideration of the limit. I gave a commitment to consider it, but I am not prepared to enter into a Dutch auction with some of the figures that the Opposition Members are bandying around.
<P>
On the interesting subject of the definition of assets, the hon. Member for Guildford asked whether we had in mind the book value or the market value of assets. I want to concentrate on the balance sheet value, which is the same test as for venture capital trusts. The hon. Member for Sevenoaks asked where the definition of asset value could be found. I have the statement of practice on gross assets. I shall not read it out at length, but it states specifically:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"In deciding whether to accept that a company satisfies the requirements of ICTA 1988, 28B Sch 8, the Inland Revenue's general approach is that the value of a company's gross assets is the sum of the value of all the assets shown in its balance sheet. The value of assets shown in a balance sheet immediately before and immediately after the issue of a relevant holding will be determined as follows"	.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am sure that the Committee does not want me to read out the whole of that statement.
<P>
The hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham mentioned the arrangements under the nouveau marcheÂ in France. That is not directly comparable. I understood that he was talking about arrangements for products available through the nouveau marcheÂ which are broadly similar to a collective fund PEP. Only 5 per cent. of the bond needs to be invested in unquoted companies or companies that are quoted on the nouveau marcheÂ. I think that that answers the hon. Gentleman's point.
<P>
Bearing in mind the points that were raised, I regret that, with a few exceptions, Opposition Members did not concentrate on the purpose behind enterprise investment schemes. Regrettably, they over-egged the argument. I cannot accept the amendment even if I did accept it after a rush of blood to the head, it would create pandemonium because it is so poorly focused.
<P>
I am, however, impressed by the arguments of my hon. Friend the Member for Paisley, South (Mr. Alexander), because he made them in a reasoned and thoughtful way something that was lacking in Opposition Members contributions. I will undertake to examine the issue, but I can give no commitment beyond that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> It is now clear that the hon. Member for Paisley, South made his arguments in a reasonable, rational and well-informed way the Paymaster General briefed him this morning to make precisely those points. It is an abuse of the Committee for a Minister to leap to the Back Benches, pick out a tame Back Bencher, suggest that he puts the argument in a particular way and for the Economic Secretary then to pop up.
<P>
<B>Mr. Alexander:</B> On a point of order, Mrs. Dunwoody. Is it in order for the hon. Gentleman to make allegations about private conversations between members of the Committee?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> It is my experience that Members of Parliament have a devastating habit of making quite horrid suggestions about other Members of Parliament. On the whole, we have to learn to live with that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> Happily, the Paymaster General's private conversation with not that private and once attention was drawn to it, he fled back to the Front Bench. His point was launched by proxy through the hon. Member for Paisley, South. Surprisingly, by a curious process of serendipity, the Economic Secretary has now answered it. That is an abuse of the Committee.
<P>
The Economic Secretary confessed that there was no proper definition of relevant assets in the schedule. She sought to rely on a press release that referred to an accounting practice, but that is not acceptable. I commend to her the suggestion that definition ought to be included in the various definitions at the end of the schedule.
<P>
Secondly, the Economic Secretary suggested with some nerve that the limit was arrived at after a process of consultation. Indeed she suggested at one point that we were indulging in "silly semantic games"	 when we suggested that it has been opposed. Let me remind her of the stock exchange's comments. It said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"These proposals Will make it more difficult for companies to raise equity capital to fund their growth."	<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am quoting from the brief that the stock exchange supplied to us; it is headed,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Why the Restrictionis so Damaging"	.</UL></FONT>
<P>
The suggestion that the limit is acceptable to the stock market is nonsense. That is why it has been negotiated with the Economic Secretary's Department week after week to have it raised. That is why she has had to concede at the very end that she is prepared to "keep liquidity under review"	. She knows that the £10 million limit is nonsense and that it is damaging because the stock exchange says it is. She knows that it will damage the companies that the Government originally wanted to help.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Loughton (East Worthing and Shoreham):</B> I just want to add a few comments in reply to the Economic Secretary I hope, with, the better class of insult that she requested. I shall not beguile the Committee with talk of things such as fankle. The Economic Secretary, however, tried to present the Committee with nothing short of good old English balderdash.
<P>
<B>Mr. Alexander:</B> Talking of balderdash, will the hon. Gentleman accept that the drafting of his amendment is contradicted by the subsequent line of the Bill?
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I am happy to say that that is the case. However, the amendment's principle is clear and the Economic Secretary eventually got to it. I would also remind the hon. Member for Paisley, South that I am not aware of a single amendment that has been tabled by Labour Members; I am certainly aware of precious few contributions to the debate by his hon. Friends. Drafting mistakes may be made. Better to make a mistake and make a contribution to the Committee than to sit there like mutes, or occasionally to jump up when the Paymaster General has provided a script, as he did for one hon. Member this morning.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> What we now have is a secondary marketing contribution.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. This is a good point for me to intervene, because the Chair did not hear the last intervention. There is a reason why members of the Committee are asked to address the Chair. It is not only an elementary matter of courtesy. This is the Finance Committee of a major Bill of the House of Commons. We need to record it and if hon. Members do not understand that they will find themselves in difficulty. I ask hon. Members to remember to address the Chair.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> Thank you, Mrs Dunwoody. We have heard some wild claims and suggestions. The hon. Member for Paisley, South asked why it should be £20 million; why not £30 million, £40 million or £50 million? It is clear that hon. Gentlemen do not understand that the tax relief is not germane to the value of the company; it is the qualification that is significant to the value of the assets, or the gross assets as now not defined in the schedule. Those wild claims, as hon. Members put it, were reported only in the Financial Times. The figure of £30 million or £40 million was quoted after a meeting with a Treasury official, which members of the AIM team at the stock exchange held the other day.
<P>
These are not wild claims, these are the figures that were genuinely discussed, which the Treasury official said that Ministers were considering. If it is wild for me to suggest it, it must be wild for the Minister to be considering it. Certainly the Minister has given us some leeway to suppose that she is considering a higher figure.
<P>
It was clear that Labour Members has no knowledge of why there is a gap between £10 million and £75 million for full listing on the stock exchange. I was surprised that  the Economic Secretary did not have that knowledge under her belt, given that she is responsible for legislation on ISAs individual savings accounts and a range of other stock market equity quotations. I should have thought that some of the basic tenets of what constitutes quoted companies on the stock exchange will be second nature to her. We will wait to see what happens.
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Sevenoaks said, the figure is entirely arbitrary. It is not completely beyond belief that by doubling the figure to £20 million we are trying to make the best of a bad job, which is what the schedule is. The Economic Secretary said, "Oh well, only half the stocks quoted on AIM have experienced this form of relief,"	 which means that half the stocks around 150 have been affected by the legislation. The stock exchange provided the Minister's officials with figures showing how the companies that will be directly affected by the Bill have significantly under-performed their peer companies on AIM since the Budget. But the Economic Secretary says that it is too early to tell. Her hon. Friend the Paymaster General is always saying, "Look what the stock market did in relation to the Budget. We now have the City's congratulations."	 We have seen what the stock prices on AIM have done in the past two and a half months; the AIM market does not like it because the stocks will be less attractive to investors in the future. Twice, the Minister failed to grasp the point about the secondary market. It is all very well raising money and taking a company to the market, be it a full listing or an AIM listing, but that company will not survive or attract future funding for expansion if there is no proper liquid secondary market in the company's shares. No investors with any nous would put money into what the Minister says, rightly, are high-risk, although not exclusively high-tech ventures, if they cannot see a way ahead for those shares to prosper and grow, to be added to and to be realised in a liquid market at some stage in the future. The two are inextricably linked. Her claim that the legislation is not about the secondary market, but is supporting investors who are coming to the market, completely misses the point. I am glad that the Economic Secretary is holding out a form of olive branch which might help with the wreckage of the schedule. However, it is rather disingenous to attribute that to the well-read intervention by the hon. Member for Paisley, South.
<P>
I hope that we will see some action on the matter in the future. I will withdraw the amendment on the basis that it is technically flawed.

<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree, in the more benign spirit that Conservative Members are trying to create, that concealed in the rather harsh words of the Economic Secretary there was a major concession. In producing the document from the Inland Revenue, she conceded that book value will be the basis of valuation. I hope that that betokens more concessions from her in the future.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I am grateful for that intervention. I hope that the Economic Secretary will address that point so that we have some clear definitions by which investors on the alternative investment market can work in the future, and I hope that she will come up with a better figure that gives more leeway to investors to invest in and thrive on that market. In looking forward to further good news about that from her Department, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 176, in page 223, line 32, leave out "subscribed"	 and insert "paid"	.

I should make the point that the previous debate, although it was on a narrowly-based amendment, was far-ranging. I hope that Committee members will address their comments to these particular amendments, as is our wont.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I shall do my very best to bear your comments in mind.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I hope so.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> Thank you, Mrs. Dunwoody.
<P>
I should like to begin by explaining the purpose of the amendments.
<P>
Capital gains investment relief is available not only on new shares under the enterprise investment scheme but is also available, as it has been hitherto under the system that was introduced by the previous Government, on later disposals of investments in those shares.
<P>
That may be seen as the second half of the argument in favour of AIM shares. They have been hit by two factors first, by the limitation on new issues and, secondly, by the fact that when investors have gone into these shares they cannot, unlike in the past, subsequently sell them on to another investor who would enjoy the same tax incentive. That is of great concern to those in the industry. One such has written to me warning that there is the potential for a major disaster for AIM which should not be discounted lightly. That is because AIM has done very well under the bull market that started under the previous Government. It is a great success story. Part of that success springs from liquidity. Liquidity is partly related to size, as we discussed earlier, but it also relates to the knowledge that the attractiveness that the initial investor has in a share can also be passed on to others because they get the tax relief on capital gains, if not the relief on income.
<P>
Before the Economic Secretary pre-empts our amendments, I should like to expand my argument. Why just shares on AIM? Why not small quoted companies as well? It is an anomaly that, under the new rules, companies on AIM, some of which are larger than the small quoted company sector, can continue to enjoy the tax benefits for which the Bill provides, when small companies, which may begin to grow, but opt for the small quoted market, are excluded from the benefit.
<P>
The Economic Secretary may be able to give us better advice, but I am not sure whether the amendment covers small quoted companies. That is its aim. To cite information from experts in the market, the average size of a transaction in a small quoted company is below £7,500. Deals that exceed that figure drive the market price down. Liquidity is important. If we remove that, and the free flow of shares, we also knock the price of shares and make it harder for companies to raise money initially.
<P>
The Government assume that people will invest in highly speculative shares, receive tax deferment rather than tax relief, and, in the long run, after the taper relief provisions take effect, enjoy a modest reduction in tax liability. But even the system for that is far from perfect.
<P>
People who invest in such shares are strong, brave investors, but they are not necessarily 10-year, or long-term investors. Their skill is in spotting opportunities when companies emerge, and passing them on to more prudent, cautious investors when they prove the value of their judgment. They then redeploy their capital in other new companies. Tying down that skill and investment to their first choices, or first punts, for want of a better word, through fear of a massive capital gains tax bill, will affect not only the liquidity of the market, but the supply of funds to those new companies that the Government claim they wish to help.
<P>
The Economic Secretary has given a rather arduous performance this evening because she knows that she is on extremely weak ground. The Government have not done their homework. The clauses are a mish-mash, and many members of the investing public, as well as their professional representatives, have written to me to point out anomaly after anomaly in the scheme.
<P>
If there was only one reason for the view in the financial press that the AIM market was hit by the Budget, it would be the Government's decision to deny the right to any incentive to invest in shares that had already begun trading.
<P>
It is evident that the scheme that the previous Government introduced has enabled a great deal of money to go into shares, and has also enabled the AIM market to succeed. The provision poses a danger to the market perhaps not tomorrow or the next day but when the Government's failures and mismanagement of the economy hit wider sectors of the economy. They have already hit the manufacturing sector. When the bullishness of the market is blow apart, the unquoted sector in particular may suffer catastrophic decline. If that happens, the memory of that catastrophic decline will prevent the re-emergence of such a market for a long time. The Government have the opportunity to make a small but important change to this ill-considered and ill-drafted set of measures. If they do not do so, they will be most short-sighted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> I rise to support the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Guildford in particular, his later remarks about exit strategies and the importance of a healthy secondary market for venture capital and other institutional investors who want to invest in the small, growing companies that have been the subject of this debate.
<P>
The point about exit strategies is well made by the British Venture Capital Association, which has praised the work of AIM, but also says that venture capital relies on exit routes. I am sure that Government Committee members will be familiar with the report from the Bank of England, no less, in October 1996, on the financing of technology-based small firms. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"An efficient capital market is essential for later stage technology firms... Exit routes have been crucial to the development of the venture capital industry in the UK."	<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am sure that Government Committee members would agree with that. The problem is that the proposals before us to restrict reinvestment relief to the subscription for new shares not existing shares will have the diametrically opposite effect. Institutional investors and other placees will effectively be discouraged from subscribing for new shares in the first place, because they will see that in future they will find it difficult to find buyers for any bundle of shares that they receive. It is perfectly clear that it will be less attractive to hold such shares if no relief attaches to them further down the road.
<P>
It was surprising when the Economic Secretary said in the previous debate I am sure that she will repeat her comments in this debate that the issue for her and her colleagues on the Treasury Bench is not the secondary market; it is all about promoting subscriptions of new shares and new issues. As my hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham has already pointed out, the proposals on reliefs go to the heart of a successful secondary market. We cannot separate the two markets. Investors will not subscribe to new issues if they believe that they will be difficult to sell on further down the road.
<P>
We need an answer from the Economic Secretary concerning what evidence she has and what research she has done into the intentions of institutional investors and other placees, who will typically be those who will subscribe for new shares. Has she any evidence to show that many companies will probably have to go down the more costly public offer route, simply because placees and other institutional investors will be extremely cautious when they realise the effect of the proposals?
<P>
We also know that the restriction has reduced the market price of many AIM companies. My hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham has pointed that out. That is well known in the marketplace: AIM says it; other members of the stock exchange say it. That has a worrying effect for the average entrepreneur who owns a small company which he hopes will grow and develop. In effect, there will be a dilution of his share capital the interest that he has in the share capital when raising capital. Ministers must analyse the lower share price. Did they expect a lower price? What do they believe will be the effect of dilution of ownership on those who are setting up, running and developing those companies?
<P>
Is there any evidence that entrepreneurs will favour trade sales, asset disposals and selling their businesses as going concerns, rather than issuing new shares, because they will find it more difficult than hitherto to attract institutional investors? Will not that result in a diminution of wider share ownership, which the Government says it is keen to promote? Those points need some answering.
<P>
The Opposition would be grateful to hear what the Economic Secretary makes of those straightforward points, which are at the forefront of AIM and the institutions. I make them in a spirit of honest inquiry. I would not want the Economic Secretary to think that the Opposition are playing to the gallery. I have the greatest regard for the Economic Secretary. She is the only Economic Secretary that I know who has been able to blush, especially during the episode with the hon. Member for Paisley, South. We look forward to her informed and, I hope, rational response.

<P>

<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> I want to support what my hon. Friends the Members for Guildford and for Bury St. Edmunds have said on the amendments. However, I must disillusion them if they are expecting an optimistic result from the Economic Secretary. It is rapidly becoming clear to us that the power behind these provisions is, of course, the Paymaster General, whose sidekick has now departed from the Room. It might well be that the remote control for the provisions is entirely offshore. The Paymaster General might now be holed up in his Park lane penthouse, and perhaps instructions cannot get back to the Economic Secretary on what she is allowed to concede.
<P>
So far we have heard the magical phrase that the hon. Lady will keep liquidity under review. That is pretty meaningless, and that applies to these amendments as it applied to the previous group. We should like the Economic Secretary to tell us what keeping liquidity under review means. Does it mean that she will be prepared to table an amendment on Report, if she concedes that there are still serious problems when the long-standing negotiations between the stock exchange and Treasury are concluded?
<P>
It is clear to us and the stock exchange that such a restriction will damage new shares as well as existing shares. As my hon. Friends have implied, removing the relief from existing shares will make it more difficult for those who invest in new shares to sell them later. It will make investment in AIM more difficult because new issues will be more intermittent. Rather than a steady flow of investment into AIM, which I though the Government wanted, investment will be confined to irregular, intermittent new issues. Again, that will damage liquidity.
<P>
The market price of existing stocks will be reduced because of the effects that I have described. I suspect that there will be more trade surplus, rather than wider sales to institutional and private investors. That will reduce share ownership and the number of shares.
<P>
Such changes will affect entrepreneurs' exit strategies. As the stock exchange says, it will be more difficult for venture capitalists to realise their investments. The changes will reduce their ability to recycle their funds into new starts and early stage companies. Those who risk their money in that way inevitable look at their exits; they want to be sure that they will get their return within a reasonable time. All the entrepreneurs whom I have met in my business career are clear about their exit strategies. The measure will damage exit strategies and will hinder precisely the kind of people who would be prepared to invest in the secondary market from making the investments in existing companies that the Government want. I do not want a reiteration of the Paymaster General's recycled pledge that liquidity will be kept under review.
<P>
If the Economic Secretary cannot accept the amendment, I hope that she will at least acknowledge that damage to existing shares will be done, whatever her intentions towards new shares. We look forward to hearing from her.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I am grateful for the opportunity to catch your eye at this late hour, Mrs. Dunwoody. I do not think that the debate has yet got to the kernel of the issue, which is that during the election the Labour party said that it would support small businesses and small business men. In our 18 years of stewardship, the Conservative Government managed to end up with an additional 1 million small businesses employing 1 million extra people. Part of that strategy was the success of the AIM market, which was established in 1975. This measure, coming on top of the previous restrictions for new shares, relates to existing tax relief and existing shares, and will further damage that market. It is no accident that David Poole, a director of the investment bank Singer and Friedlander said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"What you might see is people switching out of AIM shares into blue chips."	<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That would have a particularly damaging effect on the small business sector because it is expensive for smaller companies to raise capital. That is why we introduced the AIM, OFEX and other markets for smaller companies. It would greatly damage smaller companies if the market were restricted. There will be not only more trade sales as a direct result of the amendments, but more management buy-outs. Whereas we in the past 18 years were singularly successful in widening share ownership, the shareholder base will be narrowed by schedule 13. The net effect is that it will be even more expensive for small companies to raise money. Fewer of them will go to the AIM market; they will have to go to alternative venture capital sources for their money, for which they will pay more. The flourishing market in small businesses will begin to dwindle and the whole economy will be damaged.
<P>
I hope that the Economic Secretary will take special note of our amendments. They may be technically defective, but I do not think that they are, so I hope that she will pay them some heed and consider carefully the liquidity of the market. As my hon. Friend the Member for Sevenoaks says, if we can have a little guidance about what the Economic Secretary meant by looking at the liquidity of the market, it will be extremely helpful to those from outside the debate looking in.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I am flattered to know that I still blush. I should hate to disabuse the Committee. My only problem is that I am now starting to cook and I think that the hon. Member for Sevenoaks is in the same boat.
<P>
I am afraid that the Opposition have done it again. The hon. Member for Guildford had the aplomb I could think of a much worse word, but it would probably be an unparliamentary one to say that the clauses were ill-considered and ill-drafted. That was from someone who tabled amendments that are yet again a dog's breakfast.
<P>
There is no way in which the amendments will stand up to scrutiny and I shall point out their defects. They provide for enterprise investment scheme deferral relief to be available only for investment in existing shares and not for investments in new shares. What is more, because they refer only to new shares, they amend only the first paragraph of the relevant legislation, leaving most of the succeeding provisions high and dry. We are back to the argument proposed by the Liberal Democrats, which is that the Committee is being asked to debate not the amendment, but the spirit of the amendment. Legislation is not made like that.
<P>
I shall try to work out what it is that the Opposition want. I think that they are trying to get to the heart of our reform of reinvestment relief. The purpose of that reform is to bring reinvestment relief and the enterprise investment scheme together in a new, unified scheme that will be better targeted and which will give the Exchequer, and thus the British taxpayer, better value for money. The purpose of the amendments is to modify the new enterprise investment scheme so that it preserves a feature of the investment relief that gives poor value for money by postponing of capital gains tax charge if the gain is invested in existing shares.
<P>
In the new enterprise investment scheme, we focus on new shares to ensure that money raised through the scheme goes directly to the companies concerned. I reiterate that the purpose of the scheme is to help small, unquoted, high-risk companies raise equity capital; it is not meant to support the secondary market in shares or to ease the path of entrepreneurs in selling existing companies to new owners.
<P>
Opposition Members have paid considerable attention to the effects of the alternative investment market. There is no reason why small companies that are listed on AIM should not raise money through the issue of new shares directly to investors qualifying for deferral relief. That may entail some changes in how AIM brokers currently operate, but there is nothing in our proposal to place any sort of barrier in their way.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I am grateful to the Economic Secretary for clarifying that point. Will she extend the same concession to small quoted companies?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> The hon. Gentleman made that point during an earlier intervention. The enterprise investment scheme has never applied to companies listed on the stock exchange. In any event, I doubt whether any more than a handful of them have gross assets of less than £10 million a point that came up in the previous debate.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked me what I meant by saying that I would keep liquidity under review. It would be illogical of the Government not to take account of the performance of AIM. We will keep liquidity under review, but I am not giving a commitment that we shall return to the issue on Report. I am being specific in saying that we shall keep it under review [Interruption.] Let me repeat, in case Opposition Members were too busy playing to the Gallery, that we will keep liquidity under review. I did not say that we would come back to the subject on Report. Frankly, the time between now and Report stage is not sufficient to give any indication of the impact on liquidity in the medium term. That is common sense. I should have expected Opposition Members to accept that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> I think that the hon. Lady has now helped the Committee. She has said that her review is medium term. Does that mean that she will be back before the Committee with the next Finance Bill to review the effect of the schedule on the secondary market? Is that the sort of time scale that she envisages?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> No. The hon. Gentleman is not listening closely to what I am saying. I said that I would keep the issue of liquidity under review. It may be that, having reviewed liquidity, the horrors that Conservative Members suggest will not have come about, but it would be illogical of the Government not to take an interest in what is happening in AIM. We shall do that in a coherent and sensible manner.

<B>Mrs. Liddell:</b> I know how the hon. Gentleman loves procedure, but in the real world people do not go about with their hands out all the time. If one keeps issues under review, one keeps them under review at all times. The Government keep the performance of the economy under close review [Interruption.]<P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It is important that all Members of Parliament are heard in the Committee. If there is a constant background of noise, that will not be the case.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> Thank you, Mrs. Dunwoody. The Government are intent on keeping all aspects of the economy under review. We are intent upon establishing stability in our economy, to give the small firms that Conservative Members confess so much to support the sort of economic conditions that will allow them to thrive and also the sort of conditions that will encourage entrepreneurs to invest.
<P>
<B>Mr. Derek Twigg (Halton):</B> Is it not true that the Opposition have shown themselves technically deficient, so much so that their leader disappears after five minutes? They are now in a mess, because they cannot even put together a set of amendments that makes sense. My hon. Friend the Economic Secretary has put forward a clever and succinct way of dealing with the problem.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> My hon. Friend makes his point most succinctly. I accused Opposition Members of over-egging the pudding earlier; they now seem to be into cholesterol overload, given some of the hyperbole that we have heard.
<P>
I return to the question of the impact of the AIM. It is a comparatively new market and it has got off to a good start. It helps smaller companies, and it would be remiss of us not to take an interest in what happens in relation to AIM. However, I reiterate what I said earlier; the extension that was given on reinvestment relief in 1995 was given to help AIM get off the ground. It was never intended as an indefinite change. With that in mind, it is impossible to accept the amendments. They are technically defective; they also damage the overall spirit of the Bill. I therefore urge the Committee to vote against them.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I am disappointed in the words of the Economic Secretary. Although I savour the double back-handed compliment that was winging my way, it was followed by a number of acerbic remarks that were quite out of context.
<P>
We know that the Government Front-Bench team have an army of experts and technicians to help them draft Bills, amendments and whatever else is demanded; yet they still come up with the most appalling howlers. The Economic Secretary has skilfully tried to disguise those failures behind a sort of rearguard action against our modest efforts.
<P>
The hon. Lady knows full well the intent behind the amendment. It is not to her favour. Another amendment will be debated in a moment or two that was tabled by the Chief Secretary to the Treasury. The spirit of the amendment clearly reflects a difference of philosophy. I speak for many Opposition Members in saying that I am fundamentally opposed to capital gains tax in any shape or form. It is a fundamentally misconceived tax, and I therefore support any measure that might mitigate its effects and encourage healthy new investment especially in smaller companies.
<P>
In this new version of the reinvestment relief, we have seen the Government returning not just to the 1990s but to the early 1980s, when we tentatively first tried to introduce some form of help for such businesses. It was then that we identified 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. This is not a Second Reading debate. The amendment is very specific. Precisely, it reads:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"leave out `subscribed' and insert `paid'."	<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I have been very indulgent and, because I wanted to let members of the Committee put things in context, I have allowed them to go rather wider than the specific amendments that they no one else have tabled. However, that indulgence should not be relied upon indefinitely.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I can assure you, Mrs. Dunwoody, that I was coming to a most relevant point in my brief discourse on the history of such reliefs. No wide-scale use of tax avoidance has arisen from the existing measures. What the Government are afraid of in trying to limit investment to new shares and remove it from shares on the secondary market is some form of avoidance. Let me reassure them by telling them what the Institute of Chartered Accountants had to say about that. It stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Our experience is that reinvestment relief was not the subject of widespread exploitation."	</UL></FONT>
<P>
The point is that the previous Government set up a well-considered framework. We did not hear much about what would be the cost of our amendment; we submit that it would be very small. One reason for that is that under the proposed new system there is no taper in respect of the deferred gain. There may be taper relief in respect of the hopefully large gain on investment in new shares, but the original tax deferral is only that, and there is no reduction on it. Therefore, at the end of the day, the Government will get back the money that has been deferred we are not talking about any cost to the Government in terms of the cash that they will eventually receive from the investments; we are talking only about a deferral of that sum. We therefore have to weigh that against the benefits to companies in terms of liquidity and the greater attractiveness of an exit route if our amendments are passed.
<P>
The Economic Secretary cannot engage two sides of an argument at the same time. We heard the first side of her argument about the £10 million limit. We now hear the second side of that argument. It is simply not good enough for the Economic Secretary to stand up and say that the amendment would affect very few companies because there is a £10 million limit. She danced around the question of whether the limit would be reviewed. I ask her to review the whole concept behind the schedule. It has been much criticised by professionals for being overcomplex. That is why it is not only us who have had difficulty in framing amendments that reach the heart of the Government's proposals; the Economic Secretary and her talented and experienced advisers have also stumbled.
<P>
I think that we have said enough to convince you, Mrs. Dunwoody, if not those on the Government Benches, that the amendments are well merited. They deserve the support of the Committee. I am told that the shares of more than 300 companies are now traded on the alternative investment market, and some £1 billion of new equity capital has been raised. If that money is to be re-invested, our contention is that those who have invested in those companies should be able to pass on in a liquid market the benefits of shares and the tax advantages that they accrue, so that even more billions can be invested in other new companies.
<P>
The Economic Secretary's abject failure to appreciate the full economic cycle behind investment in new companies is a fundamental deficiency in the schedule.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman persisting with the amendment?
