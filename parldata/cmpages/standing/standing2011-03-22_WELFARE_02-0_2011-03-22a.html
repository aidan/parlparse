that disability living allowance reflects the needs of disabled people
better today than in the 1990s. DLA enables support to be targeted on
those with the greatest need. I was going to ask, initially, whether
you supported these objectives and if the proposals were met in the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="110322116000015">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">However,
I wanted to broaden the question out and get more specific views and
thoughts. DLA was introduced in 1992; since then, we have had a great
deal of change in the legislation, in the support at work, in aids and
adaptations, and in a broadening of our understanding of disability.
Specifically, what changes would you like to make to DLA to bring it up

a need for reform. We support the DLA but accept the premise that, in
terms of how it needs to be reformed, some of the recommendations for
aligning it with definition are
correct.<a class="bkMark" name="110322116000020">&#160;</a>

terms of specifics, the point that I would like to make is that the DLA
reflects and is in many ways a proxy for the additional cost associated
with living with a disability. We need to ensure that we do not mix
cost and need, because there is not a direct correlation between the
needs of individuals and the cost of individuals. What we are pretty
clear about is that the reform needs to focus on the cost. In many
ways, that drives a position in which we need to look at the supply,
and at the market in terms of the DLA and of driving down the cost, as
well as the focus on demand in terms of pure
numbers.<a class="bkMark" name="110322116000021">&#160;</a>

quite important. I also have to add that maybe people began to see that
claiming DLA was not instead of going out to work, and that there was a
possibility of still working and having DLA to perhaps support that
work. I think there may have been some confusion over that

headlines, people were worried that it would affect them. If it is a
benefit that has been used for their extra cost of care and their
mobility, they suddenly feel that a reform might take that away. What
that would do to them must be quite concerning. Reading the
consultation document and the Bill might allay some fears, although I
think that working that out in practice would be something that they
would want to see, and that would alleviate their

which baseline figure that comes. The broader point in allaying fears

and more people become aware of it. More and more people are perhaps
living with disabilities now. There is more awareness and a broader
definition of disability, so if we cap the rise there could be a
problem. Part of the need to cap that rise is an implication perhaps
that some people are getting DLA inappropriately, or misclaiming DLA.

million to 3.2 million today, is it simply a question of awareness or

no longer need to claim it, but that there has been no
assessment machinery? I think that 127,000 or 140,000 claimants have
not been seen since DLA was set up in 1992. Do you think that the issue

the care component of DLA is not paid to those in residential care. So
first, is it right for Government to be looking for those overlaps?

is a huge inconsistency in how mobility is provided across the
country—through local council contracts, residential care home

absolutely essential. When you are costing the running of a care home,
absolutely nothing is free, and therefore one needs to make sure that
fees are adequate for that resident to be able to live as full and

only once. If that principle were to hold for DLA, it would make a
significant contribution both to the administrative charge and, more

dire need. However, it should also be acknowledged that, where aids and
adaptations make life easier, then that is a good thing. I would be
concerned if the benefit were not then allowed, because somebody could
put their socks on using a sock putter-on-er or something of that sort,

                           </span> I want to move on to new penalties,
and there will a new penalty for those who knowingly fail to report
changes in circumstances. My direct question is whether, in your view,
that new penalty will bring genuine integrity into the system? There
have been a number of press reports about people claiming DLA by
basically conducting fraud, and the DWP has estimated that some
£220 million was overpaid due to fraud and error. In the light
of some of the press reports that we have seen, it is clear that people
are wrongly claiming DLA when they are actually fit and
able.<a class="bkMark" name="110322116000067">&#160;</a>

I gave earlier in terms of the fraud rates and where DLA sits with all
the other benefits and the DWP’s

                           </div>error rate, and it is less. Therefore, that suggests to me that, in
terms of the scope of the problem that may or may not occur, it is a
fairly small problem. Within the reforms, it is clear that any reform
should go hand in hand with accountability, and that that should
include accountability for the individual as well. We need to build in
a proportionate response to that. I struggle with the perception that
all people who claim DLA are potentially benefit scroungers, and,
therefore, that we are going to come down hard on them and penalise
them. The evidence and the statistics would tell you a different
story.<a class="bkMark" name="110322116000068">&#160;</a>

is actually to bring genuine integrity back into the system, because,
in their eyes, the public feel that there is not enough confidence.
They read press reports about people that are effectively claiming

not. We have had press reports in various newspapers this week to that
effect.<a class="bkMark" name="110322116000069">&#160;</a>

degree of integrity, and the reforms must be proportionate. Where

law will then take over. Given the evidence that we have seen around

estimate the numbers because the consultation that was published by the
Government was not very clear about what personal independence payments
would entail and, specifically, who would be eligible for it and who
would not. Based on the statements that were in the
consultation—that if you already use particular adaptations, you
would no longer be eligible—an estimate has been established. It
has been extremely difficult for us to estimate the numbers, but it
would be impossible for anybody else accurately to estimate the numbers
of either those who will be affected or those who will not be
affected.<a class="bkMark" name="110322116000079">&#160;</a>

have been to a number of conferences where I have spoken to people with
learning difficulties. First, they did not know that the consultation
was happening. When I told them that it was, their immediate impression
was, “Right, the Government are going to take away all of my

meeting, and I told them about the plans for personal independence
payments and the changes to disability living allowance. There were 40
people with learning difficulties in the room, and when I told them
what the Government are planning to do, there was a great big yell of
40 people saying, “They can’t do that.” I said,
quite calmly, “The Government are doing this.” The point

learning difficulties have access to and understand new media. Unless
you bring people with learning difficulties together in a conference

against making the benefit system a lot simpler, a lot easier to
understand and a lot more responsive. The universal credit will go a
long way in that direction. But we are concerned about the disabled
people who may not get disability living allowance any longer, and
therefore will not be passported on, as they are at the moment, to
certain other benefits. I know that that concern is shared very widely
and, certainly in my discussions with anyone in the Government, that
issue is recognised, but it has yet to be resolved. I think it
will need to be resolved, because in the worst case scenario, if the
figures turn out to be correct regarding the number of disabled people
who will be affected, this will have consequences not only in losing
DLA, but in losing disability related premiums. I think it will need to

some people who have already been on contributory benefit for some time
will find that their contributory ESA will stop immediately once the
change is introduced. What is the likely impact of that measure on

                           </em> I would be concerned in two ways. First, for
some newly disabled people, it can take a long time to establish
exactly what the prognosis is and how particular conditions are to be
treated. Some things take time. A good example would be people who are
receiving treatment for cancer, which could go on for longer than a
year. My second concern is a general one, which is the general erosion
of the national insurance system that we have seen over the years. I
think it would be more honest to say that the system is no longer in
place rather than to keep on eroding it. It will not have particularly
helpful consequences for disabled people. There is no sense in plunging
disabled people into further poverty—it just makes getting out
of that situation much more difficult. I understand where the
Government are coming from, but a year is too
short.<a class="bkMark" name="110322116000089">&#160;</a>

often professionals turn to doctors for advice, which is the proper
thing to do. When the Disability Rights Commission did a formal inquiry
into primary health care, it found a massive communication problem
between doctors and people with learning difficulties, and it made some
recommendations. I would hope that some of those were acted on. It
would be good if you could find out whether they

think that that will have a massive impact. The last thing that people
want to do is actively ask for help, and you can do something about
that because you have enough time. A lot of situations happen when
people are managing a crisis, like when someone loses their home
because they were too ashamed to come and ask for help, because they
valued being
independent.<a class="bkMark" name="110322116000092">&#160;</a>

all. We are all aware that local authorities are short on resources for
spending on social care to meet the need in their areas. I have not

the mobility of people in residential care.<a class="bkMark" name="110322116000096">&#160;</a>

thing, but the other thing is that I would be against this on
principle. I represent the National Centre for Independent Living.
Independent living is about choice and control in your life.
Independent living is not just for people who live in their own homes;
actually, independent living is a way of life wherever you live. People
in a home—I need to emphasise that residential care is not like
a hospital—live their lives; it is just that they happen to be
in a residential home. It does not mean that they stay in that home all
the time. They have lives. They want to socialise and go to medical
appointments when they choose to go, not when a member of staff decides
that they might take them. To my mind, it is an absolutely fundamental
principle that people in residential care should have mobility
allowance so that they can come and go, as anyone would in their
home.<a class="bkMark" name="110322116000097">&#160;</a>

example, if you have a catastrophic event like a car accident, that
affects you immediately. You cannot work, and you have a loss of
earnings in many areas of employment. Unfortunately, we are not all in
the kind of employment with good sickness benefits. Yes, that has an
immediate impact on somebody’s living standards, I
agree.<a class="bkMark" name="110322116000099">&#160;</a>

being independent; being able to make choices, whatever they are; going
wherever they want, mixing with their friends; and living the kind of
lives that they want to. When big events, like a health condition,
happen, the support that goes round you at that time is really
important. It is about being able to explain things in an accessible
way. It is a communications skill—support needs to be recognised
as a skill. Not everybody automatically has the skills and the ability
to support a person and it needs to be better recognised than it is.
The best people to help people learn that skill are those whose
experiences can give people the training, the knowledge and the insight
that they will need in order to support well. Good support is really
important; bad support is like having no support at all, whatever it is
that you are dealing
with.<a class="bkMark" name="110322116000100">&#160;</a>

here are visiting people with disabilities every week who are very
concerned about the new assessment arrangements. At the same time we
are helping people, because the current system is so broken that it
does not recognise a lot of disability. There is a lot of fear around
this assessment process. What more could be done to overcome the fear
that people have at the moment about the assessment
process?<a class="bkMark" name="110322116000101">&#160;</a>

Lee:</strong>
                           </em> The first thing is that local authorities are
closing down self-advocacy groups; the very organisations at a local
level that would be able to support people. They are doing that because
they are having to make cutbacks. I think that that is a wrong move.
Only two days ago I was speaking to a local councillor in Wandsworth
who did not know of the existence of the local self-advocacy group that
had been running for many years. It would be really helpful to make
sure that every local authority person who holds the purse strings has
a direct link to support groups. The contracts that they have to do
good, specific work mean that you come from a user-led point of view.
When a council is making those decisions, when they need support to
help people through a crisis, they are coming from a user-led point of
view. People give advice because they have had personal
experience—they have been there, they have got the t-shirt. A
lot of organisations that are not disability-led may have lots of
knowledge and skills, because they have done the work for many years,
but it is not the same. I am worried for the future, because people
need to understand users’ needs and they need to be explained
well. If they are not explained well, it is worse than not knowing
anything at all. People worry a lot, when accessible information and
talking to someone would help
immensely.<a class="bkMark" name="110322116000102">&#160;</a>

more complex in taking into account

One of the problems with the current system is that it feels like
someone comes into your home and they have a computer program. They are
ticking the boxes in the computer program and it is the computer
program that is coming out with the answer. That is a reflection,
maybe, of this day and age in which we seem to be doing away with
common sense. There needs to be a lot more common sense and a lot more
human contact. My personal view is that assessments for benefits should
always be carried out in the public domain—the public sector. I
worry when such things become part of a private company’s bottom
line, because that sends out the wrong messages, in my view. But, even
accepting that that is the chosen way of doing things, then it is very,
very important that whoever the contractor is who is carrying out the
assessments is clearly answerable to Parliament, and that their
activities are
transparent.<a class="bkMark" name="110322116000103">&#160;</a>

do with the fact that the current system is broken and people have had
so much difficulty. It has been lacking in that transparency, so that

line, so people contact us on a day-to-day basis. Frankly, some of the
decisions are just bizarre, particularly in the past few months, where
we have had wheelchair users who have said to us, “I have had my
work capacity assessment and now I have been told that I’m not
eligible for DLA.” Now, I am really not sure where that comes
from, because I do not think that DLA has changed as yet, but it feels
like its changes are already being implemented without anybody really
knowing what those changes are and what the rationale for them is. I
also had an e-mail just last Friday, from a father who is advocating on
behalf of his son with learning disability. The same thing had happened
to him, even though he has been receiving DLA for a very long time.
When that sort of thing starts to creep in, people really have no faith
in the system and are very fearful. It appears as if you
cannot challenge the system, either. You worry that if you challenge
the system, anything that you receive will be taken away from you. I
can assure all of you that that fear is very much present in many

for coming in to see us. Part 1 of the Welfare Reform Bill provides the
legislative framework for the universal credit and much of the detail
is to be set out in regulations. What are your views about whether the
proposals will in fact achieve the stated policy aims of simplifying
the system and making work pay?<a class="bkMark" name="110322116000120">&#160;</a>

                           </em> The original objectives in the White
Paper of simplification and fairness stood out. The difficulty with the
Bill is the lack of regulations and the way that we see simplification
and fairness is that a lot of the wiring must be done behind the
scenes, and to the individual claimant it must be simplified. It is
hard to judge the success of that, because the regulations are
not there at this stage and that is something that we have
really tried to urge the Committee to push for, because it is very hard
to assess a number of the different clauses because of the lack of
regulations.<a class="bkMark" name="110322116000121">&#160;</a>

                           </em> There are a number of areas where we think
that there is a significant amount of detail still to be worked through
on how universal credit will operate, which will significantly affect
whether or not work is able to pay. Specifically, we do not know how
council tax benefit will be integrated to universal credit. It is
conceivable in some areas that, depending on how that issue is
resolved, people will face steeper reductions in their benefits when
they move in to work than is intended at the moment. We do not know how
people will be supported when they have child care costs. We
know  
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 57<a class="bkMark" name="Column57">&#160;</a>
                           </div>that the Government have stated that the funding envelope will be the
same as it is currently. When that amount is shared among a larger
number of people, it is likely that some families will receive less in
child care costs than they do at present.<a class="bkMark" name="110322116000122">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We do not
know how passported benefits will be dealt with under the system. It is
likely that there may be some cliff edges introduced, for example if
large families have all their free school meals reduced at a certain
point, or if people who are disabled have large amounts of prescription
charge refunds taken away from their benefits at a fixed income level.
We also still have a lot of uncertainty about housing costs and about
the risk that, if the Government continue with their plan to uprate
housing costs, particularly for tenants in the private sector, in line
with the consumer prices index, the real terms value of housing costs
will fall and that may leave people, particularly in the longer term,
significantly worse off. Our wider concern about whether the universal
credit can make work pay and alleviate poverty is that £18
billion of benefit cuts are due to come in before its implementation.
Therefore, significant numbers of people may be better off at the point
of transition but significantly worse off than they are under the
current system, whether in or out of
work.<a class="bkMark" name="110322116000123">&#160;</a>

adult and child poverty in the country, and that can, of course,
include people in work as well as out of work. What do you think the

McGoldrick:</strong>
                           </em> I will focus on out-of-work poverty. The
aim behind universal credit is to make work pay, and for people to move
into work as a route out of poverty. It will not necessarily affect the
levels of benefits that they are currently on, but, if they take up a
mini-job, they will be able to bump up their benefits. That is a bonus,
but benefit levels will remain below the poverty level at that
stage.<a class="bkMark" name="110322116000125">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Secondly—again,
focusing on out-of-work benefits—we are concerned about the
conditionality regime and the effects of sanctions on poverty levels.
We think that the sanctions are much tougher. The sanctions that are
being brought in before universal credit are tougher, and they apply to
a system in which, as the Government have recognised, it does not
necessarily pay to work. We do not understand why very tough sanctions
are being applied in advance of universal credit. We are concerned
that, under universal credit, people will be left in poverty. There
will be a particular impact on the children in
families.<a class="bkMark" name="110322116000126">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
third aspect of out-of-work poverty is around the benefit cap that will
be introduced. It will not affect a large proportion of payments, but
it will affect a certain number, particularly those to the large
families that we work with in east London. We need to consider aligning
it with the child poverty strategy when we are thinking through these
processes.<a class="bkMark" name="110322116000127">&#160;</a>

about the impact that sanctions can have on poverty levels. I shall
talk a little about in-work poverty and universal credit. We know from
the Government’s impact assessment that universal credit is
assessed to improve take-up of benefits, which we think is credible. It
may well do that, as it proposes a simpler system.<a class="bkMark" name="110322116000128">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">As
I said in my previous answer, we also know that independent research by
the Institute for Fiscal Studies has shown that poverty levels will
increase dramatically prior to the introduction of universal credit as
a result of the Government’s package of benefit cuts. We do not
feel that we are in a position to assess the net impact on poverty of
universal credit and wider welfare reforms, and it may well be that as
detail emerges in regulations of how aspects of universal credit will
work in practice—for example, I referred earlier to housing
costs and particular in-work conditionality requirements—we may
find that there are other impacts on poverty levels that at the moment
it is completely impossible to
determine.<a class="bkMark" name="110322116000129">&#160;</a>

                           </em> There is a large amount of evidence to suggest
that the changes that we are seeing in housing benefit prior to the
introduction of universal credit in the future will leave large numbers
of families far worse off than they are now, and run significant risks
of increasing homelessness and poverty levels. I am not in a position
to assess the precise impact that the policy will have on the
market—no one is—but there is that real risk. There has
been no pilot of this full-scale roll-out of national policy, and if
the market effects are not as intended, there will be significant risks
for poverty levels. It is almost inevitable that families will see
their real terms incomes drop. I do not know whether other people have
views on the housing benefit
changes.<a class="bkMark" name="110322116000131">&#160;</a>

thousand. Looking at universal credit, it seems to me, from the

the second poorest decile benefit, respectively, by increases of
£4.40 and £5.40 a week. Is it not welcome and right that
we should concentrate benefits and help on those who most need

outlined in the Bill, we are concerned that, because many of the
regulations have not come forward and we do not have the necessary data

there will be a disproportionate impact on disabled people in

assessment, but also DLA—will look like, and therefore it is
equally suppositious to say that there is no impact as to say that
there is. However, all the modelling that has been done with the data

We know that because the people those benefits are targeted at are, by

to an increase in the poverty rate. We also know that the Bill proposes
the introduction of a much tighter conditionality regime, and that when
people are subject to sanctions their risk of poverty increases. I

point about scaremongering, and I think that there is an element in
this that we need to see how it pans out. However, whenever we look at
our Community Links services in Newham—we run a number of
welfare advice services—it is often the most vulnerable who find
out first, and with the Bill we need to do a lot of modelling to ensure
that it is not the people at the bottom who get hit first, and that we
learn from mistakes. We are looking, for example, at the civil penalty,
the hardship loans and the social fund reform, all of which will have
an impact on people who are at the very bottom and need the intensive
support of the welfare system. In some way, we need to factor in how
they will have an impact on the universal credit model, which the
majority of us are very supportive of. It will be those people at the
bottom who are potentially
hit.<a class="bkMark" name="110322116000149">&#160;</a>

Allirajah:</strong>
                           </em> I think that it would be useful to look at
how cancer patients need to be supported by the system. They are a very
good example of a vulnerable group, and the Government have pledged to
support vulnerable groups. Cancer patients need the right support at
the right time, and when they are undergoing aggressive, toxic
treatments and are completely wiped out because of chemotherapy or
radiotherapy, they need to receive ESA, or whatever will replace it,
without
conditions.<a class="bkMark" name="110322116000153">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">They
also need help with extra costs. If you are undergoing radiotherapy you
will be travelling to hospital. You could be going daily for five or
six weeks and racking up very high travel and parking costs. You are
probably not working so you have high heating bills, you might have a
special diet because of the effects of the treatment, and you might
need new clothes because of weight loss or gain. There are very high
additional costs during treatment, and those people need to receive
help there and then. When they have finished treatment they need
employment support to get them back to work, and financial support
during the period of getting back to
work.<a class="bkMark" name="110322116000154">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">If
we look at the provisions in the Bill, they fail the tests of
safeguarding vulnerable people and fairness. You have to wait six
months before you get the personal independence payment and cancer
patients need that immediately. As soon as treatment stops, they have
very high extra costs. It is no good waiting six months. There is a
danger that they will not be protected from conditionality. Patients on
oral chemotherapy are treated completely differently from those on
intravenous chemotherapy, and we want that anomaly removed. Oral
chemotherapy, which is becoming increasingly common, is just as
debilitating as intravenous chemotherapy. Radiotherapy patients are not
automatically exempt from conditionality, so the provisions do not
necessarily protect them.<a class="bkMark" name="110322116000155">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It takes
cancer patients a long time to recover their capacity for work. As we
understand it, 75% of those in the work-related activity group have
been on ESA for a year, and 18 months down the line, 63% of cancer
patients in that group are still there. If you time-limit contributory
ESA, you are cutting off their income at a point when they are not yet
ready to go to work. They could be doing everything to comply with the
work-related regime—working with a personal adviser, drawing up
action plans and undergoing courses to restore their coping
skills—but they are penalised simply because they have not got
back to work within 12 months. That fails the tests of fairness and of
safeguarding the most vulnerable.<a class="bkMark" name="110322116000156">&#160;</a>

                           </em> As the question was also directed at
me, I will respond. Working out what the greatest impact will
be on disabled people is very hard for the reasons I have already
stated. I would flag up the changing value of benefits, particularly
the tracking of the consumer prices index. Time-limiting benefits, as
my colleague mentioned, will have a significant impact on a lot of
disabled people who want to work and to continue to work but need extra
time to manage their condition. There is also concern about the
withdrawal of levels of support on top of the value of support, for
instance 
<div class="columnNumber">

                           </div>around the results of the work capability assessment and how that will
leave disabled people, particularly those with lower-value benefits,
without the right support that they need to start their
journey.<a class="bkMark" name="110322116000157">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">One
thing that I would like to highlight as having a significant impact on
disabled people, but which does not affect a majority, is the DLA
reform. Given the cumulative effects of removing crisis loans,
restricting local eligibility for social care and removing support
through DLA, and eventually through the personal independence payment,
it could have a substantial impact on an individual’s ability to
subsume the additional costs they face through living in
society.<a class="bkMark" name="110322116000158">&#160;</a>

Allirajah:</strong>
                           </em> On work incentives, with sick and disabled
people, it is important to realise that the biggest incentive to get
back to work is the fact that they lost their earnings while undergoing
treatment. That is a pretty strong incentive, and most cancer patients
we speak to and survey say that they want to get back to work. Work is
a signifier of normality. They cannot live on the benefits that they
get at the moment, and that is a strong enough
incentive.<a class="bkMark" name="110322116000160">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
problem is that they do not fully control their re-entry into the
labour market. They are very marginalised. They have long-term health
conditions. When cancer treatment finishes, a person can still be
suffering from the long-term physical and emotional consequences for
months afterwards—fatigue, depression and all sorts of late
consequences. The incentive will not be what gets them back into work;
it is the vocational rehabilitation, the personal adviser support and
the jobs. That is what they need. You are starting from the wrong place
if you think that, if you get the carrot right, they will go back to
work, because they are not making those decisions fully in control of
their entry into and exit out of the labour market.<a class="bkMark" name="110322116000161">&#160;</a>

                           </em> This is a difficult area, and we welcome the
Government’s commitment to include passported benefits in
universal credit. That is a positive step forward. We do not have an
ideal system designed, but we would like to see a move from the current
proposal of fixed income levels at which different passported benefits
are withdrawn. We think that a real risk with that is that these
passported benefits have a different value for different types of
family. For example, a very large family with a large number of
children receiving free school meals will receive a very different drop
in their income compared with a smaller family or someone with very
high prescription costs. As I said earlier, they will experience a
significant income drop if that benefit is withdrawn, whereas someone
without prescription costs will not. It is a complex area, but we would
welcome a tapered approach to the withdrawal of these benefits, rather
than the proposal to withdraw them at fixed income
levels.<a class="bkMark" name="110322116000162">&#160;</a>

McGoldrick:</strong>
                           </em> I will touch on that, because we run a
number of welfare advice services in east London. At the moment, our
demand is incredibly high. We have people lining up outside the door
every single day, and that is with the current system. That will
quadruple whenever we go through a transition period and whenever there
is a lot of confusion. People are incredibly anxious about their
benefits. A lot of changes and a lot of sanctions will, potentially,
apply to people, and a lot of appeals are occurring from that. There
will be even more demands on those welfare advice services than there
are at the moment. However, the welfare advice budget has been
dramatically cut, both for us at a local level and at a national level,
through the legal aid budget and through our local authorities. At this
stage, we have absolutely no idea from central Government funding where
we are going to get advice from. At a local level, it may be taken
in-house with our local authorities, where we may get a significantly
smaller pot of money to deliver the
services.<a class="bkMark" name="110322116000166">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
thing about welfare advice is that it is independent, and that is
absolutely fundamental to people coming to us, not only to access that
advice, but to reveal all their hidden needs, which result in them
quite often getting sanctioned. If we were to take that in-house, and
if it was to be done at either Jobcentre Plus or through our local
authorities, a lot of people would not declare a lot of their
problems—their debts, their addictions and so on—that got
them into the position that they are in. It is absolutely fundamental
that that advice exists until there is no need for it. In an ideal
world, we would see universal credits implemented, the system would be
much simpler and people would not need to appeal the processes much;
but until that stage, we would urge that there is a transition fund in

of our front-line advisers today and they said that, for the bulk of
people, it is a benefit for Government, because it will be cheaper to
administer. It will be of huge benefit for people who are quite close
to the labour market and capable of accessing employment, because they
find it frustrating to have to go into

for employment. But the people we deal with have English as a second or
third language. They are under the poverty level, so quite often they
do not have access to the internet. A number of additional cases have
come from social services and are in temporary accommodation at the
moment, or living on friends’ sofas. The online services will
just not be appropriate for those kinds of people. They do not have
access to them, or they would not understand them, or they might be
intimated by them, not claim benefits at all and be pushed underground.
It is about getting that combination right so that, as well as online
services, face-to-face support is available for the people who need it
most. It is also about ensuring that they can access that support, so
that whenever it comes to appeals, for example, or to the claimant
commitment, people with those kinds of difficulties and barriers will
be able to access an individual who will guide them through the
universal credit
process.<a class="bkMark" name="110322116000169">&#160;</a>

However, you can simplify and lose the sensitivity to needs and the
tailoring to meet additional needs. There is a real risk that, if you
simplify the system by levelling down, it is not flexible or responsive
enough to meet the specific needs of people—disabled people,
cancer patients, people with children and so on. The balance needs to
be struck. At the moment, we have concerns that the balance is not

good move towards that real-time element. People frequently find that
they have the wrong finances at the wrong time. It would be a benefit
if we increased the accuracy of payments, so that they came at the
times when people most needed them. I just want to flag the fact that
there are many situations in which disabled people will need that
personal touch to be able to navigate the system and to understand what
their commitments are. I also want to flag the problem of implementing
a very large IT-based system. We know the historical problems with
Government projects of that nature, and delivery will be a

commented on the effectiveness of sanctions at getting people into work
and out of poverty for the different client groups that you advocate

                           </em> I can briefly give our general view, which is
that there is not a strong relationship between financial sanctions and
changing behaviour. Evidence published for the Department for Work and
Pensions shows that often people who are sanctioned do not understand
why they have received a sanction. If they have not understood why they
have received a sanction in the first place, it is unlikely to have an
impact on their behaviour. Evidence also shows that the people who are
more likely to receive sanctions are those with learning disabilities,
very low skills or English as a second language.

			Column number: 65<a class="bkMark" name="Column65">&#160;</a>
                           </div>Again, that points to people receiving sanctions as a result of not
understanding the way in which the system operates. Sanctions cause
financial hardship and, in our view, lead to a much higher risk of
people completely disengaging with the system, thereby reducing their
chances of moving back into work in the longer
term.<a class="bkMark" name="110322116000173">&#160;</a>

in some of these measures, the necessary safeguards will not be in

people who offer advice and who have been hit by sanctions, but also we
are an employment support provider. It is quite interesting for us to
comment on this. When people come under a new deal programme, sanctions
play a role within that. We do not issue them ourselves, but we do pass
them on to Jobcentre Plus, and we recommend that a sanction is needed
in a particular situation. In effect, it is effective for us to be
there. However, we very rarely use sanctions, if at all, with the
people who get passed over to us. What we find more effective than
sanctions is doing a really thorough needs assessment and understanding
what the barriers are to these people getting into work and why we
would potentially apply a sanction to them. Once we can identify those
needs and overcome those barriers, there is a mentality change; people
want to move into work because they are accessing the right kind of
support and those fundamental barriers are being addressed. We think
that that presence should be
there.<a class="bkMark" name="110322116000176">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
are a number of recommendations that we would make about the sanctions
regime at the moment. There is a pilot in the Bill. We would like to
hear more about that and how it will be synchronised with the reforms
that will come in under universal credit. As the question indicates, we
knew nothing about the effect on sanctions and the extent to which they
will be applied. It is fundamental that we run a pilot on that so that
we can understand the effects.<a class="bkMark" name="110322116000177">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Also,
looking at the conditionality regime, we think that currently people
are being sanctioned based on what type of benefit they are on. Again,
that is putting people in a box: “You’re on JSA or ESA.
Therefore, you will be placed under this regime and be pushed into
work.” But somebody who has been moved on to JSA may have a
number of serious barriers to employment and may be extremely difficult
to get into work. Therefore, the conditionality regime may not be
appropriate for them, because those issues need to be overcome
first.<a class="bkMark" name="110322116000178">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We recommend
that the conditionality regime be based on the needs assessment done
with the adviser the minute that person walks in the door of Jobcentre
Plus and that that is agreed to collaboratively in the claimant
commitment, whereas the approach at the moment is very much,
“You have to sign up to this. This is what you have to agree
to.” The reason we say that, other than fairness, is to
encourage responsibility. We do that very much with our work programme,
which is about

                           </div>asking, “What would you do?” and saying, “I will
support you,” as a consequence. We are not really seeing that in
the sanctions regime at the moment. We support the carrot-and-stick
approach, but we do not think that it is quite right in the current
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="110322116000179">&#160;</a>

deal? If you are being required to undertake work-related activity, you
should also expect tailored, personalised and appropriate support to
help you get back to work. Our experience with cancer patients is that
the tailoring is not working. Our benefit adviser deals with people who
are terminally ill or undergoing chemotherapy who are being sanctioned.
They find that the old pathways to work programmes are not
helping them because they do not understand the specific problems that
cancer patients face. We will have the work programme. It is untested
and we do not know what it is going to be, but you cannot simply impose
sanctions without ensuring that people get help that works to get back
to work. That is the problem. This is entirely a one-sided
deal.<a class="bkMark" name="110322116000180">&#160;</a>

McGoldrick:</strong>
                           </em> Self-employment is a really important
issue, not because we are trying to push that through enterprise at the
moment, but if the mini-jobs and the earnings disregard are to be
effective, the majority of people will go into self-employment to take
up those mini-jobs. We approached a number of employers in east London
to ask them what the likelihood would be of them taking on long-term
unemployed people, in particular, who had just come off incapacity
benefit. Again, that is a major difficulty, but there is willingness.
But when we say, “Would you take them on for two, three, four or
five, or 10 or 15 hours?” there is horror on employers’
faces, particularly in deprived communities where employers are very
small.<a class="bkMark" name="110322116000182">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Self-employment
is a key answer for mini-jobs to be effective. However, there is a
massive difficulty with self-employment and the Department for Work and
Pensions as a whole. We need to recognise how self-employment works and
what problems it poses for the Department. We have done a lot of work
on self-employment, particularly by very entrepreneurial people in the
community. If they come from a poor background, they will need quite a
long period of test trading to allow them to establish their business:
even a mobile hairdresser, for example. That is very basic employment,
but it can take some time to win
even.<a class="bkMark" name="110322116000183">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
are asking for a longer period of test trading, but the universal
credit system also needs to be more responsive to how self-employment
works. For example, if a home worker did 80 hours in one week but had
an income of £50 coming back to them at the end of the week, we
suggest that with self-employment, universal credit should recognise
the actual earnings at the end of the month, whatever they may be,
rather than hours worked, as was in the White Paper, although that is
not in the Bill. There was an assumption of a minimum wage as a floor.
I think that that will deter many people either from declaring the work
that they are doing or from going into self-employment at all, because
it presents a huge risk for them.<a class="bkMark" name="110322116000184">&#160;</a>

is an area that would be incredibly supportive, and we are really keen
that the Government are pushing that agenda. Our major concern is that,
first, there is not enough understanding about self-employment and how
to become successful, and, secondly, there is the worry about
undeclared earnings with self-employment. When somebody is on benefits,
first, you have a risk to HMRC, but, secondly, you have a risk to the
Department around undeclared earnings and benefits, so it is an issue
about how we overcome those undeclared earnings. From our experience,
what we find works best is to have a business mentor or an employment
support worker working very closely with that individual, so they can
continually assure them and guide them to declare their earnings, to
play by the book and offer that continuous support to us as a
consequence.<a class="bkMark" name="110322116000185">&#160;</a>

the benefits system. We recognise the need for some conditionality. Our
view at the moment is that the balance of rights and responsibilities
has gone too far and that claimants already have very
significant responsibilities placed upon them in return for an offer
that does not offer them the rights that we would think they would be
entitled to—for example, very high quality labour market
programmes or the promise of a labour market programme that provided
them with access to an opportunity to undertake a paid job. So we
certainly do not see the need for strengthening

change that we would like to see would be to build into the system a
greater use of warnings for people who are at risk of a sanction, so
that before a claimant was sanctioned they would fully understand the
risk that they were taking and they would fully understand the change
in behaviour that the system was requiring them to make to avoid the
sanction. We think that that might actually lead to quite a significant
reduction in sanctions, and it would also lead to people understanding
better the conditions of their

small sums of money to top up their benefits. That is one of the main

                           </div>why we are incredibly supportive of universal credit. It will reflect
modern day employment where people are allowed to do many jobs, those

effect, universal credit will reduce the number of smaller players who
are committing fraud. We would therefore hope to see the fraud
strategies in the Bill really focus on the bigger guys at the top who
are earning a lot of money. I am not sure whether that is the case in
the fraud strategy at the moment. We think it is still quite
generalised, which of course it does need to be to an extent, but the
resources should probably be focused on those who continue to commit
fraud, even with universal credit in
place.<a class="bkMark" name="110322116000193">&#160;</a>

self-employment as a route off welfare. What is your view on the
proposal that people who are self-employed should be deemed to have
earned at least the minimum wage for the hours in which they are
working in self-employment? One of the witnesses in the next group that
is coming to us—the Tax Reform Group—says they are
worried that self-employed people will get a much worse deal than they
currently do. I wonder whether you would agree with that. How do you
think the new system

                           </em> Certainly, if it was based on actual
earnings declared at the end of the month, I think people would get a
fair deal. However, that requires a level of trust from the Department
that somebody will declare exactly how much they have taken on board. A
report released yesterday from the Federation of Small Businesses
highlights that a lot of people who are self-employed need to keep the
base amount of their money to be able to tide themselves over. There
needs to be much more understanding about the nature of
self-employment, how it works, and the level of income that people need
to survive. We usually see a three-year period for the long-term
unemployed to start making a profit out of self-employment. The first
year they just about survive; the second, they start to become
established and market themselves; the third year they are able to go
independent. However, we think this is a really good group to focus on,
because their aspirations for themselves are actually quite low, they
are very realistic, and they have incredibly good budgeting skills,
because they have been on benefits for some time. Those are the key
ingredients to successful self-employment. We think the point you
raised about actual earnings as opposed to an assumption of maximum
wage will completely deter people from stepping into this. It just
highlights that there is not an understanding from the Department about
self-employment.<a class="bkMark" name="110322116000195">&#160;</a>

undertaken a significant amount of work on vulnerable employment. We
ran a large commission on vulnerable employment, which looked in detail
at low-paid workers in self-employed jobs. That found a large number of
workers in that situation were not earning the minimum wage and were
often working far longer hours for far lower amounts of pay. I think it
is fair to say that is the reality for a number of people who would
find themselves self-employed and claiming universal credit.<a class="bkMark" name="110322116000196">&#160;</a>

may believe themselves to be an employee, or under employment law may
actually have employee rights were they to take the case to a tribunal.
We think there is a risk that a small number of people who may find
themselves in the system could find, for example, that an employer is
treating them as self-employed for tax purposes, while they believe
they are an employee and that could lead to some difficulties for that
group with the implementation of universal credit, if the employer is
not compliant with the tax law. That could lead to the worker losing
out twice: they do not receive the proper payment from the employer and
they could also find they do not receive the benefits to which they are
entitled. We would draw the Committee’s attention to the fact
that there is a minority of employers, who are documented—the
Department for Business, Innovation and Skills has also done work on
the matter—as avoiding employment law at the moment. That group
of employers may pose problems for the introduction and implementation
of universal

our view that the cut in money involved is actually very small in the
scheme of things, but for a very small number of severely disabled
young people it could mean a loss, we have estimated, of up to
£100 a week. The total estimated saving the Department has noted
from the change is £11 million. The Government’s wider
proposals would reduce entitlement to contributory ESA to one year,
which the TUC opposes. Were those proposals to be introduced, it is
likely the cost of retaining the youth provision would be even less. We
think that is a change that could have a significant impact for a very
small population of young people, and it is very unfair to remove
it.<a class="bkMark" name="110322116000203">&#160;</a>

additional costs that disabled people face and have to pay effectively
out of their own income, we are concerned that that may have been done
in an arbitrary
way.<a class="bkMark" name="110322116000217">&#160;</a>

levels for two single people as opposed to couples. In my constituency,
there are 10% more women than men on the electoral role for one simple
reason: in the benefits system, it pays to not declare that you are
living as a couple. Do you think that the system we are putting in

                           </em> I think that the universal credit is
actually quite positive in terms of removing the couple’s
penalty that exists at the moment. We would be very supportive of that,
and we currently see similar situations where we work, basically
because it makes no sense not to. However, we would like to highlight
the inconsistency with the disregards for single people and couples on
JSA. Currently the disregard for JSA stands at £5. That will be
increased if you are a couple on JSA, but not if you are a single
person on JSA. We understand why that has been put in
place—financially it evens out at a later stage—but we
would like to reiterate that the reason behind bringing in a higher
disregard is to allow people to take small steps back into employment
when they have been unemployed for a long
period.<a class="bkMark" name="110322116000219">&#160;</a>

will have a lot of people coming off IB, going on to JSA, and they will
be terrified to take up large pieces of work—they may have had
mental health problems in the past and be afraid of a relapse—so
mini-jobs would be ideal for them. However, because they are single,
they will not be allowed to use the disregard—their benefits
will be tapered off more quickly. We would like to look at how we can
balance out the fairness in the disregard between single people and
couples on
JSA.<a class="bkMark" name="110322116000220">&#160;</a>

I think citizens advice can offer an overview—a wider
range—of how the different impacts might affect people. The two
groups we are most concerned about are people with disabilities and
people with particular child care costs. The reason for our concern is
that we think they are affected by several different measures. The
problem with going through the Bill clause by clause is that you may
not necessarily identify how a number of different clauses are going to
have a cumulative impact on particular groups. How much detail would
you like—a little more than
that?<a class="bkMark" name="110322116000230">&#160;</a>

Royston:</strong>
                           </em> There are three main groups of people with
disabilities that we are concerned about in relation to the universal
credit. The first group is those who cannot work and the second is
those who can work. Some would still be found not fit for work; others
would be found fit for work; however, both would have a disability. The
third group is those people who suddenly have to stop
work.<a class="bkMark" name="110322116000233">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On
the first group, those who cannot work, there are three mechanisms in
universal credit—the work-related component, the support
component and the disability disregard. There is no mention of the
severe disability premium. We are very concerned about that. We think
that the severe disability premium performs a really important function
in the present system. It is given to people on a means-tested benefit
who are at least receiving middle-rate care and who live alone and do
not have a carer. That is because there is a recognition that people in
that situation have a lot of extra costs. For instance,
somebody who is registered blind would typically be
on 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 73<a class="bkMark" name="Column73">&#160;</a>
                           </div>middle-rate care. If they were on a low income and
living on their own, they would get the severe disability premium. If
support came just through those in the support group, a lot of people
who are registered blind would not be in that support group and would
not get that. The severe disability premium is worth quite a lot of
money, because people have a lot of extra costs if they have a severe
disability.<a class="bkMark" name="110322116000234">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
second group are those people with a disability who work. We do not
have the information about who is going to get help within that group.
It is fairly clear that if somebody is still found not fit for work
under ESA, they will get the work-related component and the disability
disregard. It will not be the same amount of money as permitted work,
but it will fairly well reflect the present help that is available
through the disability element of working tax
credit.<a class="bkMark" name="110322116000235">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Our
concern is the group of people who are going to be found fit for work,
but who still have a very significant disability. As the rules on ESA
tighten, more and more people have very significant disabilities and
are being found fit for work. They obviously will not get the
work-related component we assume, but it is not clear whether they will
be eligible for the disability disregard. A lot of that group would
still be eligible for the disability element of working tax credit
under the present system. If they do not get the disability disregard,
they are going to be a great deal worse off. Even if they get the
disability disregard, they are going to be worse off than under the
present system. The present system obviously has a lot of complexities,
so you cannot say at every stage how much people are going to be worse
off. But we have done a number of scenarios that we are happy to share.
They show that, through most stages, people who only get the disability
disregard are going to be worse off than people getting the disability
element of working tax
credit.<a class="bkMark" name="110322116000236">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
are extremely worried about the third group that I have mentioned. We
are talking about people who stop work because of a sudden
illness—for example, they are suddenly diagnosed with cancer and
they need treatment, or they have a stroke and a serious disability.
During the first six months of somebody’s illness, whether you
are on SSP or ESA, you can claim working tax credit. It is not clear
whether there will be anything in the present system that reflects
that. Looking at the way it could be done, if the present system
treated your statutory sick pay and your ESA during the first six
months as earnings, you would then get any disregard that applied to
your type of household. You would also get the tariff, so you would not
lose all the money, pound for pound. It is really important that that
is done, because people will lose out a lot compared with the present
system during the first three
months.<a class="bkMark" name="110322116000237">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
are other things that kick in that are not in the universal credit. The
proposal within the PIP to have a qualifying time of six months rather
than three months means that somebody who has had a stroke, for
instance, and who might after three months get middle rate care and
higher rate mobility—they need that money, because they are
going to have a lot of extra costs—will have to wait six months,
which is a long time to wait. It is not only that; if severe disability
premium is included, they also get that after three months in the
present system. And going further on, they will lose their
contribution-based ESA, if they have a partner who works or if they
have savings.<a class="bkMark" name="110322116000238">&#160;</a>

Williamson:</strong>
                           </em> I was just going to add to what Sue said
that one of the routes into work, and a very important route into work
for people with disabilities coming through ESA, is through
self-employment, particularly if more traditional forms of employment
are not necessarily suitable for them. They might have difficulty
getting out at a particular time and going to a particular place.
Self-employment is important, and it is vital that the kind of support
that working tax credit gives to self-employed people should be carried
over into the universal credit. At the moment, we have proposals for a
minimum income floor, and suggestions in the White Paper and the Bill
that there might not be the same income measurement, which gives
recognition to the expenses that a business incurs, may well be another
factor weighing against disabled people wanting to work under the new
system.<a class="bkMark" name="110322116000242">&#160;</a>

an extremely important function. We would like to see the disability
disregard, and we would like to see a mechanism for that that really
looks at disadvantage in the workplace, because of the changes to the
disability element of working tax credit. There are so many changes
going on in the system that people with more and more serious
disabilities are being pushed outside the criteria. We are very worried
that we are going to see a lot of people who will not be able to access
help. They will be pushed outside and lose in all sorts of ways, so we
would like to see a separate mechanism. For instance, PIP is going to
exclude a lot of people with lesser disabilities, but they are still at
a disadvantage in the
marketplace.<a class="bkMark" name="110322116000246">&#160;</a>

in relation to their capacity for work. As Sue says, the
narrowing of the criteria to achieve disability benefits has a knock-on
effect to what sort of support people get who may not be eligible for
the benefits, but who clearly have limited capacity in the workplace.

people’s limitations to work is one of the things that we are

                           </strong> The introduction of universal credit is clearly
going to change the way that benefits are claimed and paid. May I ask
about two points raised in Mr Williamson’s written evidence to
us? First, you expressed concern that there is an over-reliance in the
new system on real-time information. Will you tell us what the pitfalls
there might be? Secondly, you talked a moment ago about self-employed
people, who clearly cannot be dealt with through real-time PAYE
information. You said in your written evidence that you think that they
might get a much worse deal under the new system. Is it clear to you
how, in principle, self-employed people should be treated, given that
it is hard to know what their income in any given four-week period is?
Will you comment on those points? If CAB has comments as well, I would
be
interested.<a class="bkMark" name="110322116000250">&#160;</a>

Williamson:</strong>
                           </em> Real-time information will capture pay
and tax and national insurance contributions on that pay in real time
as it is paid to the employee. Income for PAYE purposes and for tax
purposes may not be the same. Almost certainly, there will be some
differences between the definitions and the measurements of income
within tax on the one hand and within universal credit on the other.
Even under tax credits, which are much closer to income tax than is the
traditional benefit system, there are some small differences in how you
define a benefit in kind and so forth.<a class="bkMark" name="110322116000251">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">If you have
any major differences, you are very likely to have distortions in the
transition of that information from HMRC to DWP, and from use for
purposes of the PAYE system to use for the purposes of universal
credit. For example, if you allow the whole of a pension contribution
for tax purposes, but only half the pension contribution for DWP
purposes, you are going to have to add back that extra half somewhere
in the transition. We know that computers do not always do what we
expect them to do, and if error creeps in during the transition from
tax to universal credit, whose responsibility is that going to be? Is
it going to be the responsibility of the claimant to check? If so, how
are they going to check? What paperwork do they have to enable them to
check? What support will be available to people who cannot cope with
paperwork, lots of figures and calculations? There are enough people
who find a PAYE notice of coding difficult enough. What is going to
happen to benefit claimants faced with a similar document? How
forgiving will the systems for recovery of overpayment of benefits and
imposition of penalties be to people who simply cannot cope and cannot
spot these particular types of official error?<a class="bkMark" name="110322116000252">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">There is
another difficulty between tax and social security. Tax is based on the
individual; universal credit will be based on the individual if single,
or on a couple if the individual is part of a couple. That is another
potential for error in the transition from one to the other. Somehow
you are going to have to merge the two bits of information that the tax
system is giving you. People are normally paid monthly. If the
universal credit assessment period is anything other than monthly,
there will have to be a further adjustment for real-time
information.<a class="bkMark" name="110322116000253">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Moving on to
self-employment—that, as you say, is outside the scope of
RTI—how do we find out what self-employed people earn? The tax
system is quite good at picking this up, at assessing someone’s
profit. We should bear it in mind that profit is very different from
drawings. Someone might draw on a business that might be funded by a
bank loan or might be living on income provided by a spouse or loans
from a relative, or whatever, in the early days or at a time
when the business is doing badly. However, the tax system, as I said,
can pick up and assess profits quite efficiently.<a class="bkMark" name="110322116000254">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The profits
picked up by the tax system by and large reflect the economic reality
of how the business is actually doing, and it does not assume any
particular level of income. It looks at the money coming into the
business and the expenditure that the business owner has to incur to
keep the business afloat. It analyses that expenditure to capital and
revenue, and it gives relief for losses.<a class="bkMark" name="110322116000255">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It is
important that universal credit recognises all those things simply to
preserve the work incentives that working tax credit has. If you have
information flows between HMRC and the DWP—I believe that
two-way information flows are provided for in the Bill—it should
be reasonably straightforward for one Department, or one computer
system, to be able to transmit to the other, or for HMRC to transmit to
the DWP such information as it
has.<a class="bkMark" name="110322116000256">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Okay,
there will be a time delay at the start of the business, and there may
be a period during which DWP will have to assume a level of income,
perhaps based on previous year income or an estimated profit as you are
going along, and make adjustments later, as and when the business owner
reports to the tax authorities, but that is, in short, how I would
suggest the information is
transmitted.<a class="bkMark" name="110322116000257">&#160;</a>

recently been having difficulties in getting a pension, perhaps because
they have retired early but are still working. Matching laws up does
not seem to happen. Some of those people could be in their 50s, and may
still have dependent children. If these things are not being matched
up, people are getting tax demands because the system does not
recognise them. Does that not suggest that it will be quite difficult
to match
everything?<a class="bkMark" name="110322116000258">&#160;</a>

to get the systems to match up. You are obviously referring to
situations where people have multiple income sources. A lot of work has
been going on within HMRC to introduce a new computer system that will
group information by the individual rather than by the income source,
so, in theory, it should be easier in the future to cope with cases
where an individual has multiple sources of income. The computer

                           </em> That is a key question for the future citizens
advice service. We are particularly concerned because, as you say, any
new system will require explanation of how it works. We support the aim
to simplify the system, but there is a danger of oversimplification,
which needs to be considered. Therefore, there will be a real demand
for advice: “What does this mean for you?” We are already
seeing such concerns coming through. People are already frightened,
particularly about disability benefits but also about the universal
credit as it comes in. The demand for advice will go up but the supply
will come down because, as you know, legal aid is a problem. We welcome
the extra year’s funding for the financial inclusion fund
equivalent, but the Bureau is still left with two of its three main
sources of income under
threat.<a class="bkMark" name="110322116000261">&#160;</a>

impact on clients—on the people out there—is that if they
do not have advice, they either will not apply and therefore will not
get the benefits that they are entitled to, or they are likely to end
up in the circle that you referred to of error and potential penalty.
We feel very strongly that the civil penalty is inappropriate. It is
likely to hit the people who are the most vulnerable—people who
struggle with forms and information. We are already seeing that
sanctions in the current conditionality regime tend to affect those
clients of ours who are least able to cope with that sort of
administration. We think that the idea of a civil penalty for clients
who struggle to fill in a form that is not matched by some sort of
compensation for official error is grossly

seems to be a great deal of concern that the new assessment, which
focuses on those with the greatest need, will exclude many disabled
people currently on the lowest rates of DLA. How do you feel that that
could be
addressed?<a class="bkMark" name="110322116000270">&#160;</a>

                           </em> Yes, it is straightforward. We understand
that there will be a 20% cut, and we understand that there is not going
to be a cut in the higher rates. So if you keep the higher rate of
mobility and—we understand—the lower rate of mobility is
kept, you keep the highest rate of care. If you look at the numbers
that are on the benefit at the moment, the calculations that we have
done say that all the lower rate of care would go and either half of
the people claiming middle-rate care would go or the amount that people
got on middle-rate care would drop very
substantially.<a class="bkMark" name="110322116000271">&#160;</a>

proposing that aids and adaptations are factored into that. Do you

Royston:</strong>
                           </em> Aids and adaptations are already factored
into DLA. With some aids and adaptations, it is, of course, entirely
right to take them into account. For example, someone may be able to
walk perfectly well with an artificial leg or a stick. It is not fine
to say that  
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 79<a class="bkMark" name="Column79">&#160;</a>
                           </div>somebody in a powered wheelchair, for example, can therefore mobilise
100 yards and then should not get the benefit, because not being able
to walk is actually a good proxy for having extra costs. They will have
extra costs as a result of the powered wheelchair, and if they want to
go anywhere other than their local environment, they will have many
extra costs. For instance, I know somebody, who is in a powered
wheelchair, who wants to retain her independence, which is what PIP is
about, but that means that if she is going somewhere else, she has to
get a specially adapted taxi. She cannot accept a lift from a friend,
because her powered wheelchair will not go in the friend’s car.
There are many extra costs, so it depends on which aids and adaptations
you are taking into
account.<a class="bkMark" name="110322116000277">&#160;</a>
