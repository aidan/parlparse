Thank you for coming to give evidence. It is a pleasure to have you
with us. As we are very short of time, we will not have lengthy
introductions. I hope that if you have anything to say about your own
position on anything, you will engage us with that in the answer to
your first question, which will be asked by Emily

read your submissions, which have been very helpful, thank you, it is
clear that you have concerns about the extent of public and patient

are so

                           </em> First, can I say that I am appearing on
behalf of Jeremy Taylor, the chief executive of National Voices, who
could not be here? I hope that members of the Committee are aware that
National Voices, as well as working in its own right, is working with a
group of seven other charities—you might have noticed the letter
in <em>The Times</em> earlier in the week, but you will also learn that
we are working together on joint briefings and
amendments.<a class="bkMark" name="11021095000010">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">When
the Government’s policy was drawn up in opposition and first
published, it was presented with the tagline of putting GPs in the
driving seat, which begged the question for those of us from the
patient-centred care side of things as to where the patients were. A
lot of that has been heavily addressed in the White Paper and related
documents, and we strongly welcome the vision that is set out there.
What we want to see is effective
implementation.<a class="bkMark" name="11021095000011">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
think that what we have in the Bill up to this point is not enough to
put us alongside the driver as co-drivers, or navigators, of our care
and treatment and our health services. We think that we are probably
still sitting in the back seat, commenting occasionally on the
direction that is being
taken.<a class="bkMark" name="11021095000012">&#160;</a>

                           </em> With regard to healthwatch, there are two
levels. First, at the national level, we want the HealthWatch England
committee to be as robust, independent and effective as possible. That
means understanding what the appointment process is; who are the people
who are going to be selected to serve on it, and why; what the role of
local healthwatch bodies is in putting people on that
committee—they will strongly want to be able to elect or
otherwise send people on to that committee as it represents a national
focus for their interests—and whether it will have resources
with which to conduct its own research to inform itself sufficiently
about the views and experiences of patients and service users, in the
way that some of the consumer bodies attached to regulators in other
sectors would have a bespoke budget or
resources.<a class="bkMark" name="11021095000017">&#160;</a>

local level there are various places—some of them are covered in
our briefing, and some you will find in briefings from the National
Association of LINks Members, for instance—where things can be
tweaked in the Bill, but a key overall question is not thinking that
healthwatch is it, locally, in terms of involvement and accountability.
It is not for either commissioners or providers to feel that they have
sent something to the local healthwatch and therefore that is that bit
done. We are looking, in particular, for much earlier involvement in
the way that commissioning plans are drawn up and discussed, and the
way that services are designed in a process of discussion and dialogue
before the point when a commissioning consortium publishes its plan.
That is what I mean: if you only comment on a plan that has been
published, that is what I mean by being in the back seat, commenting on
the direction. We want to be up front, putting those plans together
with the clinicians and
others.<a class="bkMark" name="11021095000018">&#160;</a>

answer that question, but in general with the architecture of
involvement and accountability across the Bill I think it would be
wrong to place too much trust in any one mechanism. Many of these
things are very welcome, and we are clear about the fact that we
welcome what the Government are trying to do through the Bill, but it
is a picture—a jigsaw puzzle of pieces of accountability,
democratic scrutiny and patient and public involvement.<a class="bkMark" name="11021095000024">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The good
thing about what the Government are doing with healthwatch is that they
did not throw out the LINks structures. They have said they will build
on those, and that is very much wanted, because the structures of
involvement locally have been messed around so much over the past
decade or so. I think whether local healthwatch proves to be effective
will, in large part, depend on how much resource it is given by the
local authorities commissioning it. That may not be a concern that can
be dealt with in terms of legislative scrutiny, but it is a real
concern.<a class="bkMark" name="11021095000025">&#160;</a>

some detailed pieces of the picture that we might like to see tweaked
for local healthwatch—I mentioned the one about being involved
with consortia. We would also like to see stronger representation on
the health and well-being board, because all our experience and all the
experience of patient advocates is that if one of you is put on a
committee, that is a recipe for being marginalised and isolated. Coming

of further ideas for strengthening the system, but I think the question

                        <p class="tabbed">To draw a
parallel, we give an education budget to schools and we want head
teachers to have autonomy to make the best educational decisions for
children, but we do not expect them to do so according to their own
whim or preference. We expect them to have a governing board. As the
chair of governors for a primary school, I have experience of that. An
estimated 300,000 school governors in the country do that job,
representing parent bodies, communities, church foundations and so on
in how the schools are run. The system brings value to that process and
it would bring value to the process of commissioning health services.

the new

those who say that the boards are pivotal. We would say that they are
another useful piece of the system. We want joint strategic needs
assessments to be taken forward; we want the strategies to deal with
such needs to be fully agreed between all parties in a local health and
social care economy. The boards are not highly decisive, however; they
do not have a lot of power, and we would not necessarily expect them to
do so. We would much rather be closer to the seat of power, which is
where the commissioning consortia and the commissioning board are
making their decisions about how to commission services and how those

key point, because having integrated services is one of the key things
that would make the lives of patients, service users, their families

is a purpose for local bodies to work together. Studies such as that of
the Audit Commission have found that simply having a process of working
together does not necessarily deliver benefits for patients and service
users—some pooled budgets might be saved, but where are the
outcomes for those who use the services? We would like the purpose of
integrated working to be specified as being “to produce
integrated
services”.<a class="bkMark" name="11021095000042">&#160;</a>

own values and preferences every time they move from one professional
to another. Integrated services are key to dealing with the Nicholson
challenge, in particular in relation to long-term conditions, so it is
win-win for the system. However, we have made very little progress on
chronic care models in this country. National Voices has said, since
before the election, that we would support sometimes radical changes to
local services, as long as we can see that they are being made in a way
that produces better outcomes and involves patients and service users

I want to tease out one thing a little more. You gave us an example
comparing the role with that of school governors. There is perhaps a
distinction, because one of the criticisms of LINk organisations has
been that the people who get involved often have their own agenda and
do not represent the general issues of concern to that part of the
country or locality—the more general health care issues in an
area. Often the people who get involved have their own specific medical
agenda—<a class="bkMark" name="11021095000046">&#160;</a>

particularly want to direct my questions to Mind and Rethink, although
I am sure that the others will have views. You probably came in at the
end of the last witness session, when we were discussing
multidisciplinary commissioning. I know that there is concern, which
all of you probably share, that GPs are generalists—we heard
that from Hamish Meldrum on Tuesday. GP may not have specific
experience of certain conditions, particularly long-term conditions.
What are your views on GPs being able to get expert advice when they
are commissioning and how the Bill helps that? Also, what is the role
of the third sector in providing those services, taking in
multidisciplinary commissioning and “any willing
provider”? I would be grateful for your thoughts on the
involvement of the voluntary or third sector, particularly in relation
to the conditions that you
represent.<a class="bkMark" name="11021095000054">&#160;</a>

Jenkins:</strong>
                           </em> That hits a really important issue. When the
White Paper was published, we very much welcomed the commitment to
“no decision about me without me”. For mental health and
a whole range of long-term conditions, the involvement of people in
their own care is crucial to getting good outcomes. The real focus of
what we need to do, if we are going to get effective care pathways and
save the NHS money, is to get secondary clinicians, primary care
clinicians and patients, their representatives and their carers talking
together. That is one of the reasons why we have been keen to
strengthen some of the provisions on patient involvement in the Bill.
We want to see a greater mandating of the need to involve patient
groups as well as other professionals, and to use the word
“involve” rather than just the phrase “seek advice
from”, so that it is a two-way street and people are there as
equals, not as being done
to.<a class="bkMark" name="11021095000055">&#160;</a>

Farmer:</strong>
                           </em> I agree entirely with that. Our starting
point is that, when one in four of us in the population experiences a
mental health problem, and mental health comprises such a high volume
of the average GP’s work load, it is slightly surprising that
GPs feel so nervous about commissioning mental health services. In a
way, there is a key need to ensure that consortia are appropriately
supported to give GPs greater confidence in being able to commission
and support appropriate mental health services. It is particularly in
the area of engagement with secondary care that the key issue
arises.<a class="bkMark" name="11021095000056">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
are two key questions about how the new structures will work. The first
question is simply: how many consortia will there be? The numbers of
people with a severe mental health problem will be relatively small if
there are a very large number of consortia. The second issue, which
touches on Paul Jenkins’ point, is the need to ensure that the
advice is given by a range of different organisations. The work that we
are doing with others to try to create some of that commissioning 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 116<a class="bkMark" name="Column116">&#160;</a>
                           </div>guidance will be really important. Any strengthening of the legislation
to ensure that third sector organisations—as you heard in the
previous session, patients are heavily involved in that
process—will be important and will help to create a much
stronger line.<a class="bkMark" name="11021095000057">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">To pick up on
the point about “any willing provider,” we are willing,
as organisations that provide services, but the key issue is the risk
of fragmentation. That is where continuity, cohesion and co-ordination
of care are important, particularly for people with mental health
problems, who often also have comorbid physical health problems. Their
care journey is often very difficult. We set them huge tasks to help
them find the right kind of care. Care co-ordination will be a key part
of making sure, in an even more plural environment, that that works
effectively and that we do not have a lot of wastage in the
system.<a class="bkMark" name="11021095000058">&#160;</a>

commissioning to be improved and developed through using the expertise
of patients, particularly people with a long-term condition who, over a
number of years, have really come to know exactly what elements of
service need to be put in place. In neurology, we have formed the
neurological commissioning support service, which is effectively a
consultancy of patient groups, who are able to sit round the table with
commissioners and even to take over some of the commissioning. There
are some real opportunities in the Bill to elaborate on what that kind
of duty to involve patient groups means and to provide real incentives,
so that patients, by informing the key commissioning decisions, are
really at the heart of the
process.<a class="bkMark" name="11021095000059">&#160;</a>

certainly an opportunity to improve cancer commissioning. We have
cancer networks that have been working very hard in recent years to
help to improve commissioning, provide expert advice and support, and

                           </em> In terms of the less common
conditions—I speak for women with ovarian cancer, but my point
covers many people with less common but life-threatening
conditions—the real concern around GP commissioning and
multidisciplinary commissioning is that the treatment of women with
ovarian cancer currently takes place within a very specialised
environment. Multidisciplinary teams operate in specialist centres, and
for ovarian cancer those are regional centres. We are not confident
that sufficient expertise will be available at consortium level, and it
is not clear where that expertise will come from or whether consortia
will be mandated to follow any guidance. We would like to see a
mandated care pathway that is developed with GP consortia, with
clinical involvement from secondary care, tertiary care, the
appropriate voluntary sector organisations and, most crucially,
patients themselves.<a class="bkMark" name="11021095000061">&#160;</a>

concerned about the loss of the one-year and five-year cancer survival

specific cancers being identified in the outcomes framework that are
not the majority of cancers—59% of people who die from

cancers—for people who have less common cancers we are concerned
that the focus in primary care and commissioning will not be on those
non-priority areas, but will be only on the big three, which are
breast, lung and bowel cancers. There may actually be some retrograde
steps, such as survival rates getting worse, not better, in cancers
that are not covered. We are very keen that there is a clear outcomes
environment in which the commissioning takes place, and also that a
care pathway or services are mandated to protect those who have less
common conditions, to ensure that outcomes improve for them.<a class="bkMark" name="11021095000062">&#160;</a>

                           </em> Speaking as someone who was diagnosed with
ovarian cancer 18 months ago, I can tell you that when that happens out
of the blue, you are physically ill, you have massive things to take on
board, and however clued up you are, the last thing you want to start
doing is quality controlling—trying to sort out which is the
best hospital for you, or the best consultant, or the best treatment.
You are not an expert, but you suddenly have to become an expert
overnight. I am certainly convinced that I would not have been equipped
to do that, and I am pretty convinced that my GP, who has seen very few
cases of this, would have been in the same position. You just want to
be confident that you are having the appropriate treatment. You do not
want to have to start making complicated decisions. Choices about which
hospital for convenience or whatever are fine, but what can be
overstated is the ability of vulnerable people to be involved to such
an extent and to take on what feels like a rather unfair responsibility
to become an expert in a rare cancer overnight. Actually, you need
urgent treatment. That is the
priority.<a class="bkMark" name="11021095000063">&#160;</a>

Steve’s point: after 18 months, or whenever you feel ready,
perhaps in a few years’ time, given your involvement and
understanding of the system—I am sure you would rather not have
that understanding but you do—do you feel that your knowledge
could help your GP to commission services, or that you could offer
advice to other patients? That builds on what Steve was saying about
how patients do want to be involved. There is a certain cynicism
surrounding the Bill sometimes, and localism generally, that people do
not want to be involved in their lives or their care. Actually, from
what you were saying Steve, that is not the case with many patients,
who would want to be involved, perhaps once their treatment has
concluded.<a class="bkMark" name="11021095000064">&#160;</a>

groups, I mentioned shaping commissioning earlier, but providing the
information to support choice is incredibly powerful, as well. I wonder
whether there is a model here, almost whereby the Department of Health
accredits patient organisations to be accreditors of local services. We
know that there are rigorous standards that patient groups are going
through, but having done that, we can provide information to support
GPs and patients, which really helps patients make the right, wise
decisions about how to navigate the system. I think that there are some
great opportunities for patient groups to take that on. I think that
patient groups are really willing to take it on, but there needs to be
support in terms of infrastructure and leadership to enable that to
become a reality. I think that could really put patients at the heart
of
commissioning.<a class="bkMark" name="11021095000067">&#160;</a>

evidence from people with different experiences, I would be interested
to hear what you have to say about this. We heard this morning that you
can get NICE guidelines that will give assistance on best practice in
relation to commissioning care, but that you cannot force GPs to stick
to them. There may be lots of other ideas for advice that can be given
to GPs or to patients in terms of information, or to groups or anything
else, but, as the Bill stands, there is nothing to force GPs or anyone
else to listen to any of that good advice. Are we not simply handing
over this power in good faith that GPs will do the right thing? Are you
not concerned that we will end up with very patchy GP services and
health services throughout the country as a
result?<a class="bkMark" name="11021095000069">&#160;</a>

Farmer:</strong>
                           </em> That is a really important question. In
mental health, we have the primary example of this in access to
psychological therapies. The mental health strategy was published last
week and it gave us a very clear indication of both the state of
progress on access to psychological therapies and the very welcome
intention to complete that state of progress, so that there is a wider
degree of access to a treatment that is very clearly NICE-supported. In
fact, it is not just one single form of therapy that is available, but
several forms, yet the reality is that people up and down the country
continue to tell us that they wait six, seven, eight or nine months
before they can access therapy. If you are a mother experiencing
post-natal depression with a young baby, that is no
joke.<a class="bkMark" name="11021095000070">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">It
is important, first of all, to recognise that we are not sitting in a
world in which NICE-recommended guidance is universally utilised, but I
think that this gives us a really important opportunity to strengthen
the hand and the role of those recommendations, so that consortia are
able to make the decisions that lead to the people who need that help
and support being able to access it. In the context of the mental
health strategy, it sets out a very clear intention to increase the
availability of support, but we really feel that the litmus test for
this legislation needs to be how the strategy can become a reality for
people on the ground in an environment where there is greater scope for
choice and a greater degree of local determinism.<a class="bkMark" name="11021095000071">&#160;</a>

funded by PCTs. They are virtual groups of people that cover geographic
areas. They operate in slightly different ways across the country, but
essentially they provide a valuable service to support commissioners
and providers by providing expertise, and they are often where user
involvement to support the commissioning process takes place. They have
also done some delivery or have facilitated the delivery of cancer
prevention initiatives, and they have supported early diagnosis
initiatives in communities and so on. Their status at the moment is
that the Government have committed to fund them for the next financial
year, 2011-12, after which their future is
uncertain.<a class="bkMark" name="11021095000074">&#160;</a>

Research UK would say that many of them provide a very valuable
resource and offer expertise that is valuable and has helped to drive
improvement. We do not want that expertise to be lost, but recognise
that, structurally, things will change. It is a matter of how we ensure
we keep hold of the expertise in the system. What we hear from cancer
networks anecdotally naturally includes concern and worry about
organisational change, and worry about the funding from now until
April. With PCTs wanting to reduce headcount, that is an
issue.<a class="bkMark" name="11021095000075">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Where there
are really good cancer networks, they are thinking about the future,
about social enterprise status and how to make themselves most useful.
An obvious concern is about potential inequality. In the areas where
the networks are already very strong, they get their act together more
quickly and continue to be the fantastic resource that they can be. In
areas where they are less good, there is a potential vacuum.<a class="bkMark" name="11021095000076">&#160;</a>

point about the question. We know that there has been significant
improvement and progress over recent years, but our cancer outcomes are
not currently world class. The key reason, we believe, is because we
often diagnose cancer late. GPs have a critical role in improving early
diagnosis and sorting out that issue. One of our concerns is whether
the incentives are going to be strong enough. If you think about early
diagnosis, we know that it is partly about raising awareness of signs
and symptoms among the public and encouraging people to come into
primary care. Then it is about getting GPs and other primary care
professionals to get people appropriately and quickly referred for
diagnosis and treatment.<a class="bkMark" name="11021095000077">&#160;</a>

issues—also an opportunity—is that some of these

                           </div>and some will rest with GP consortia. It is a matter
of making sure that the incentives are strong enough to drive that
forward. That links to a point that Annwen made. We are going to have
to monitor this really closely. One-year cancer survival is a good
proxy for diagnosis, but there is still lag time. We feel that the
Government should be looking at staging data, the stage at which people
are diagnosed, trying to shift things along the pathways so that we get
people diagnosed at stage 1 and 2 more often.<a class="bkMark" name="11021095000078">&#160;</a>

point of view, I had fantastic treatment, but it was largely a matter
of luck. I feel strongly that that is a shame, although lucky for me.
In my case, a strengthening of co-operation and co-ordination between
experts was needed. Things very nearly fell over in my case when I was
told by a specialist multidisciplinary team that I had inoperable
tumours. By luck and happy chance, a friend paid for a second opinion.
It happened that, after a bit of pressure, an NHS team literally two
miles down the road was able to do the operation. That had a happy
outcome and I had the surgery, but if my expert team in one very big
hospital does not know what is happening just down the road, how much
less likely is my GP to know what is going on? We need to strengthen
the relationship between the centres of expertise and specialism, not
do anything that it is going to make them work against each other or
damage them by competition. That is a real concern from my own

have two Ministers here and the Secretary of State will be here later.
What would be your advice to Government to secure the safe transition
of the cancer networks to consortia? I think that that is the nub of
good cancer commissioning. There are, as we know, more than 200
cancers.<a class="bkMark" name="11021095000086">&#160;</a>

embrace what the Bill is about. If you were launching Fair Care for
Parkinson’s now, as opposed to when I first met you 18 months
ago, what opportunity would there be for an organisation such as yours
to work with consortia and see that the request that you made in that
very good campaign had even more
impact?<a class="bkMark" name="11021095000087">&#160;</a>

                           </em> I think there is an issue, as I outlined,
of transitional risk. There is uncertainty in the networks. One other
piece of anecdotal feedback that we have had is that the pathfinder
consortia that are being set up in their localities often do not match
the areas that they are covering. There are lots of structural,
organisational issues and uncertainties that they are having to deal
with. Good communication out to them and an offer of help and support
are required.<a class="bkMark" name="11021095000088">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">What has been
mooted as a potential way forward is seed funding for some networks
that move forward more quickly and think about social enterprise status
and so on. Of course, there is a risk that the good ones get their act
together more quickly and you exacerbate
inequalities.<a class="bkMark" name="11021095000089">&#160;</a>

other thing is to learn from the good practice that has been developed.
Lots of people have said that the cancer network model could be applied
to other disease areas, so let us make the most of the opportunity that
we have to share best practice and learn from them—particularly,
for example, in patient and public involvement, where many of them have
done a wonderful job in helping redesign patient pathways for cancer
patients.<a class="bkMark" name="11021095000090">&#160;</a>

Ford:</strong>
                           </em> Our Fair Care campaign was effectively about
inequalities. The NICE guidance states that everybody should have
access to a specialist nurse, and 25% of people with Parkinson’s
have never spoken to a specialist nurse, so it is about how we deal
with that. I think our approach—and, I guess, the role of the
patient groups—is two sides of the coin. One is to do everything
we possibly can to support, advise, engage and make sure the mechanisms
enable us to do that, but the second bit is about holding services to
account and wanting those NICE standards to mean something.<a class="bkMark" name="11021095000091">&#160;</a>

invested in producing this evidence about what works. Any commissioner,
whether it is a PCT now or a group of GPs in the future, needs to be
able to give a very explicit reason to their local community about why
they have no intention of meeting that standard. How else can a patient
expect to have any kind of dialogue if they have no sense of that from
their
commissioner?<a class="bkMark" name="11021095000092">&#160;</a>

                           </em> On ovarian cancer, we know that women want
choice with regard to some aspects of their care, but with a less
common condition a hyper-local model does not work. Although we know
that women with ovarian cancer want to feed into and contribute to the
development of pathways, and help to maintain accountability and have a
voice, that really cannot be done at that local level. I think that
that is where the opportunity is in the NICE quality
standard.<a class="bkMark" name="11021095000093">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There are
lots of very promising aspects of the Bill, and certainly the focus on
outcomes and the NICE quality standard for ovarian cancer is very
important, but it comes down to who develops the standard. Does the
standard cover the whole pathway from diagnosis to

			Column number: 122<a class="bkMark" name="Column122">&#160;</a>

enforced? It is about checks and balances. It is about having that
reassurance, particularly in conditions that are less common but
life-threatening. We are talking about people’s lives here.
There is a huge appetite to take the opportunities within the Bill but
also nervousness that, if you have a condition that is less common, you
will fall through the crack. It is about trying to get that reassurance
in the Bill that patients with those less common conditions will be
protected, particularly if their specific disease area does not have a
defined outcome. Inevitably, levers will be pulled to meet outcomes,
and if there is no outcome against your name or your disease, there is
a risk that you might not be a priority. That is why the NICE quality
standards are so important and implementation and monitoring are
critical.<a class="bkMark" name="11021095000094">&#160;</a>

all happy that there will be a group of consortia with knowledgeable
and active GPs, who will do everything that we want. In a national
health service, the concern is what happens in areas in which that
expertise does not exist. What happens in areas of greater social
disadvantage, where standards may lag behind the best? Certainly,
mental health is bedevilled by the fact that you can go from one area
to another and outcomes and experience will be very
different.<a class="bkMark" name="11021095000095">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">There is a
strong push to see some of the Bill’s provisions strengthened to
increase pressure on the people who will be furthest from best
practice. There are two ways in which that can be done. We have talked
about the NICE quality standard and patient involvement, but the
provisions for local authority scrutiny need to be independent and
linked to elected members. There is also the local role of healthwatch,
not just to advise patients on what services they should get and to
facilitate the complaints process, but as a local source of
intelligence that can feed in concerns straight to the scrutiny process
about local services that are not meeting NICE
standards.<a class="bkMark" name="11021095000096">&#160;</a>

success story in many ways, but of course we can do better. Another
point is that people trust their GPs. If a GP gives a brief
intervention, be it about smoking cessation or another lifestyle
activity, a patient will often listen—we have NICE guidance to
that effect. We know currently that GPs and primary care are not as
involved as they could be in cancer prevention and encouraging earlier
diagnosis. The big push in cancer policy is making this happen, so we
want the Bill to help make it happen, so we want the Bill to help make
it happen. We think that in order to do that, you have to monitor what
is going on closely and think about staging data and various other
metrics, and you have to ensure that local authorities, health and
well-being boards, joint strategic needs assessments and GP consortia
are forced to work together to that end.<a class="bkMark" name="11021095000103">&#160;</a>

evidence from a survey of GPs that indicated that, compared with
physical conditions, about half as many GPs—about
30%—were comfortable commissioning mental health services as
were comfortable commissioning for long-term conditions such as asthma
and diabetes. It is more significant with more severe mental illnesses
such as schizophrenia, because those conditions are more complicated

Although we have to get the structures right, there could be real merit

in practice. It is about a real cultural shift that means all

the issue of quality, you talked earlier about local authority

ensure that commissioning streams are done within these types of

The commissioning board needs to police standards, so that local

there is evidence that they are adhering to NICE guidelines, as Paul
said earlier. Mental health has an appalling record of adherence to

happen. It is really the excess treatment costs that PCTs currently
cover for clinical research. What we have said is that this urgently
needs to be resolved. It could be GP consortia or it could be a
proportion of budget taken from the NHS commissioning board that would
cover excess treatment costs. What we absolutely want to happen is for
research to continue to be championed in the NHS. Although the
commissioning board has a duty with regard to research, we would like a
research champion to be on the commissioning board. We would like a
research champion—or somebody with a duty to promote
research—to be on or involved with every GP consortium to ensure
that we get the kind of support for research in the NHS that we think
we need. The context is that patients treated in research active
environments tend to do better. Cancer has been a real success story.
Nearly one in six cancer patients are involved in a clinical trial. We
are world leaders, so we have to ensure that we maintain momentum and
continue to
progress.<a class="bkMark" name="11021095000119">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">One
other critical point relates to where we are not very good. We are not
very good at getting trials off the ground quickly, smoothly and
efficiently. The Academy of Medical Sciences recently published a
report with some recommendations that have been broadly welcomed by the
community. We would like them to be taken forward in parallel with the
Bill. The most important matter is trying to solve the problem of NHS
trusts duplicating because they are all having to approve trial
protocols. That is ridiculous and delays trials totally unnecessarily
and in a lengthy way. We want the Bill to take account of that and be
an opportunity to get this
right.<a class="bkMark" name="11021095000120">&#160;</a>

will turn up at a GP’s surgery with a cancer and the GP may not
have—as would happen under current
circumstances—sufficient insight into where the clinical trials
that might be of relevance are going on. They also might not understand
how to navigate the patient to those

Woolnough:</strong>
                           </em> Then, it is a couple of different issues.
One critical issue is that we know patients want to be told about
research opportunities and want to be involved in research if they can
be. We would like to make sure that patients have every opportunity to
do so. Often that will be through primary care or early after a
diagnosis. They want to be told about research opportunities. That is
one side of it. The other side is making sure that, as we go through
this big organisational change, we do not lose sight of the importance
of research. We know that PCTs sometimes disagree with trusts about
paying the excess treatment costs and I suppose that our concern would
be that, in a time of financial constraint, research might not be at
the top of a GP consortium’s list as something to support.
However, it has been critical in driving improved cancer outcomes,
which is why we have highlighted it in our

                           </em> I understand that there is an emphasis on
patient choice, and obviously you cannot make a choice unless you have
the information. It is different with different illnesses. If you need
a hip replacement, you might want to shop around: some hospitals might
be able to do it quicker and others might have more private rooms or
whatever it is you are after. With a life-threatening illness, when you
are very ill and need treatment quickly, you just want to be confident
that you are having the right treatment. You do not want to have to
start massive rounds of consultations, trying to get your GP, an expert
and a commissioner in the room at the same time. I just cannot see that
working, and I cannot see seriously ill patients being able to engage.
The more vulnerable and the more ill you are, the less able you will be
to do that sort of thing. It sounds fine, but I just do not know how it
will work for individual patients. Particularly with a rarer cancer
where there are a lot of us nationally, but on a local level the GP is
possibly as ignorant as you are, I am not sure how it will
work.<a class="bkMark" name="11021095000125">&#160;</a>

that it is important that there is some clarity about what is meant. We
prefer the word “involvement” to
“consultation,” because what the NHS needs to develop
with patient groups is a long-term relationship. Consultation has the
ring of a one-night stand about it, and what we want is the involvement
of a longer-term relationship. Patients have important expertise to
give and they want to feel that that expertise is respected and will be
listened to over a period of time, having a real impact on decisions
that are taken at the end of the process. It is important that, whether
it is in the legislation or in the policy guidance that follows, there
is some clear guidance about what kind of involvement
“involvement”
means.<a class="bkMark" name="11021095000126">&#160;</a>

really clear. It is easy for there to be confusion between what goes on
at two different levels. The first is between the individual patient
and the individual clinician in the discussions about individual care,
and there are key proposals on that in the legislation, which needs to
take account of the balance between an appropriate amount of
information being given and informed decisions being taken, especially
when you have a genuine choice about the kind of treatment that you can
pursue. The other level is how you ensure informed contributions from
people who have had experience of particular conditions. The two who
commented previously absolutely illustrated the need to have both,

thing that we have heard a lot about in the discussion has been this
“no decision without me” mantra. The strengthening in the
legislation is still needed to make that real in terms of embedding it
in the system. To take Paul’s analogy a little further, the
relationship often takes place between managers and clinicians, between
whom there are all kinds of rows and relationship breakdowns, and it is
often the patients who do not get the chance to have a voice in that
debate because the others are going at each other very strongly and
forget about the patient. This is that opportunity to embed the patient
experience right the way through the spine of the system, which
includes patient representation on the commissioning board right
through to individual quality and the ability to make informed choices

a voluntary sector point of view, when we first saw the health White
Paper it was quite exciting. There was a sense that the patient
community could finally engage rather than be at arm’s length,
and there would be meaningful participation either nationally or
locally—specifically in terms of potentially being able to
partner to deliver local services, whether that be on the early
diagnosis front or the treatment front. I think there is a huge
appetite, though not necessarily among individual patients. Naturally
it depends on where they are within their treatment, and it is quite
difficult with less common conditions to have an active patient
involvement in every region, but it should be recognised that there are
a lot of patients and groups sitting here waiting to participate and
help improve outcomes. However, it is not clear at the moment how that
engagement can take

lost if we do not, that we are prepared to put up some money—but
how do you engage in that way in this new system? There is an appetite,
but what patients do not want is to be ultimately responsible for the
success or failure of the system. It is a major reorganisation, a huge
opportunity to make progress, but also a huge change, so there are
risks. Patients do not want to blamed at the end of the day if and

                           </em> They are both tailor-made, but I would go
back to Paul Jenkins’s earlier point that, at the moment, there
are no constraints around them. It will be important to embed patient
voice into the structures of both health and well-being boards and
local healthwatch, however you might want to describe
that—whether it is directly through individual patients, or
through patient organisations. The strengthening of the composition of
those groups would really help. Many organisations have managed to
stick with the various incarnations of patient and public involvement
mechanisms. By way of an example, in one of those mechanisms, the
Commission for Patient and Public Involvement in Health system, which
revolved much more round trusts, many mental health service users
actually played a fabulous role in engaging with their mental health
trusts and are actively engaged in wanting to continue. Some continuity
would be important so that people receive the right training and the
right support, but also to ensure that they are welcomed to the
table.<a class="bkMark" name="11021095000134">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">People’s
involvement has improved significantly in recent years, but often their
experience of such meetings is being confronted with three inches of
paperwork, with no explanation of how it was developed. The support
available has been limited. We can look at the role that members
councils and foundation trusts, for instance, in some parts of the
country have taken in encouraging more direct involvement from patients
and patient organisations. We want to see strengthening in the
legislation that puts patients there as of right, but we also want
encouragement for appropriate training and support so that the places
are not just

involving the harder to reach groups. Mental health service users have
some patchy involvement in the predecessor bodies—some good,
some not so good. It is important that we do not just have a system
that leaves every local healthwatch to its own devices. HealthWatch
England needs to have a really strong leadership role in setting
standards for how to engage different groups and how to share
information.<a class="bkMark" name="11021095000136">&#160;</a>

be at the bone of what HealthWatch England does in more effective ways

of its role. I alluded to its input into scrutiny, but we must also
give it a statutory commitment that it will have a role in commenting
on local commissioning

between patient involvement and public involvement. We need to make
sure that the system recognises that. This morning, I was with a number
of people who have Parkinson’s, who would be desperate about
getting involved in decisions about Parkinson’s neurology
services, but would have less appetite and, to some extent, less energy
to get involved in system-wide, trust-wide mechanisms for engagement
and configuration of services. While we need those really strong
healthwatch mechanisms, that

question about the elephant in the room, the price competition issue in
relation to both cancer and mental health illnesses. As with many other
types of care and treatment, we are all agreed it is essential that we
have a co-operative and co-ordinated environment where patients get the
most clinically, appropriate care. I wonder about your views on the
introduction of price competition and an open market. Do you think that
that would be the best way to achieve a co-operative and co-ordinated
approach?<a class="bkMark" name="11021095000139">&#160;</a>

                           </em> From a mental health perspective, we already
have price competition. There are no fixed tariffs for mental health
services. It is not necessarily a bad thing. What needs to be fixed is
the quality element. You can have price competition in quality that is
fixed and transparent. Encouraging greater diversity in the provision
of services, which has happened to a significant extent in mental
health involving both the voluntary sector and the private sector, can
be a good thing. The importance is the transparency of quality and
avoiding fragmentation and cherry
picking.<a class="bkMark" name="11021095000140">&#160;</a>

Woolnough:</strong>
                           </em> Just a couple of quick points, which are
related. We know that excellent cancer services are well integrated,
high quality and, often, cost-saving, so a big focus for cancer has
been reducing a patient’s stay and getting people back to their
homes or in the community more quickly, which relies on integration
and, of course, can be cost-saving and good for the patient. That is
one point and, whatever happens, we cannot lose the focus on
integration.<a class="bkMark" name="11021095000141">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
second point, which applies to commissioning as well, is the critical
importance of information as a driver: information for
cancer patients about cancer, but also information about cancer
services and the clinical outcomes that they are likely to see. There
has been huge progress in cancer with the creation of such things as
the national cancer intelligence network, and some really exciting data
is coming out which will tell you things like how likely you are to get
access to surgery for different types of cancer, depending on where you
live in the country. This is incredibly powerful stuff. In
commissioning and the provision of treatment alone, we need to shore up
and support the provision of such data and information, so that the
reforms can have the best
impact.<a class="bkMark" name="11021095000142">&#160;</a>

                           </em> The objective is that competition will drive
up standards and improve outcomes. Clearly, the quality issue is
absolutely central to all of that. Thinking about cancer diagnosis as
an example, the increased access to diagnostics is incredibly good news
for cancer patients, but will GPs access those diagnostics, and will
they do so based on cost or clinical judgments? I think that some
issues need to be looked at in terms of referrals and how services
chosen. What safeguards will be in place to ensure that patients have
access to the specialist services that they want and need and that they
are not perhaps sent somewhere that is not such good quality but
cheaper?<a class="bkMark" name="11021095000143">&#160;</a>

                           </div>are you concerned about the possibility that, instead of a patient going
off to the hospital and specialists there saying, “Right, the
treatment you need for cancer is surgery here, chemo here, radio here,
and in this order, let’s get it done—chop, chop,
chop,” you have a generalist who has to commission all of that?
Is that not problem No. 1? Problem No. 2: as gatekeepers with a budget,
is there not a concern that GPs might feel there are times when they
need to lock the
gate?<a class="bkMark" name="11021095000144">&#160;</a>

concerned. We want to see provision in the Bill for managing such risk.
In the past 10 years in cancer, with the reorganisation of services, we
have seen significant progress in outcomes as a result of that
specialisation. We do not want to see fragmentation happening as a
result of considerations other than clinical need. Concern about that
is real, and we want to see how it will be
addressed.<a class="bkMark" name="11021095000145">&#160;</a>

right, that should not happen. If GPs are incentivised to improve
cancer outcomes and if things are working well, of course that should
not happen. However, to make one point about the support that GPs will
need, I echo that the new resource for increased access to diagnostics
is incredibly welcome. It will be complex to think the system through
and think it out. We are starting from a relatively low base of
knowledge in terms of baselines—what tests GPs order, and the
wait time for test results, which varies hugely throughout the
country—so GPs will need a lot of support to make some of those
things
happen.<a class="bkMark" name="11021095000146">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Going
back to my earlier point, we will have to monitor the system, because
if it is about getting the incentives right, then we have to keep a
close eye on whether it is working. For cancer, the lag time on
something like five-year cancer survival is seven or eight years, so we
will have to—it looks as though we will—keep a number of
proxy measures, which means that we can performance manage what is
happening and ensure that GPs are acting in the best interests of
patients.<a class="bkMark" name="11021095000147">&#160;</a>

correct that your role is to be the safety net—to ensure that

there being competition on the basis of quality. Will you be able to
monitor that? Where will people go to know and to

Healthcare Commission to co-operate with each other, or at least
perhaps they relied too much on each other’s assurances. How do

inquiry, an enormous amount of work has been done, both formally and
informally, to establish a relationship between Monitor and the Care
Quality Commission. At one level, we have a memorandum of understanding
that shapes our relationship, which we are reconsidering at in light of
the demands of the legislation. We have a formal agreement with Monitor
about a standard of quality—a threshold—that trusts must
meet through the authorisation process to become foundation trusts, and
we have formal and informal meetings with it to share our concerns
about trusts we both regulate. There is a clear understanding that if
we have concerns about the quality of care in trusts, they are shared
with Monitor through its compliance team and my operations directorate.
We meet extremely regularly.<a class="bkMark" name="11021095000164">&#160;</a>

                           </em> We have something called an equality and risk
profile on every organisation we regulate, and particularly NHS trusts.
The quality and risk profile holds all the information that we have
about a particular provider. In NHS terms, that can be a lot of
quantitative information, which trusts submit as part of their normal
process of dealing with patients. We take information from things such
as the Dr Foster unit at Imperial on mortality outliers; we have our
own outlier programme that looks at that as well. More particularly, we
have developed pro formas for local involvement networks and for
foundation trust boards of governors to upload information to our
system, so that they can tell us about work they do and concerns they
have about quality of care. We regularly look at websites, such as
Patient Opinion or NHS Choices, to see what is said on the web about
individual
hospitals.<a class="bkMark" name="11021095000166">&#160;</a>

are also developing digital tools that allow us to search a large
amount of quantitative information about what patients say about
quality of care. Obviously, we do not deal with complaints, but
patients write to us regularly about their experiences of care. All
that is fed into our quality and risk profiles. The inspectors on the
ground use those risk profiles to make judgments on whether they need
to do an inspection or to seek further information about the quality of
care. We have a constant process of monitoring, which allows us to look
at whether we have information that a trust may not be compliant on the
standards of care and there is therefore something for us to worry
about.<a class="bkMark" name="11021095000167">&#160;</a>

information about quality of care, so we are not treading on one
another’s toes, so to speak. We are very clear that we have a
different remit. We give Monitor information about quality, and it uses

care and to be uncompromising about that. Part of what is clear to us,
particularly in terms of our future relationship with Monitor and with
economic regulation, is that the system is clearly set up so that we
are not there to make judgments about the finances of an organisation
above and beyond the organisation’s financial ability to
continue providing a service, which, particularly in social care, we
examine at the start of our licensing process. Other than that, we are
deliberately set up to be indifferent to issues of money. We are there
to establish whether or not organisations meet essential standards of
quality and safety. That is our job. In “The state of health
care and adult social care in England” report, which we
published in 2009, we made a number of comments about the way in which,
for example, the NHS could be more efficient and therefore save money
through things like lengths of stay, delayed discharges and so on, so
we have commented on value for money in terms of the NHS, but the Bill
removes our specific responsibility to make comments on value for money
in the

questions, it is clear to me that applications may not be only from GPs
in consortia but from private companies. I have not seen anything to
contradict that. Is there a conflict of interest there? It could be
that a private health care company is a provider and also a
commissioner. How will you deal with

                           </em> The law that relates to us is absolutely
clear. It is set out in law what services you have to be registered to
provide. The law is very clear: it describes a range of services; if
you are providing them, you have to be registered with the CQC to
legally provide those services. At that level, there is not a conflict.
I can see that, from the public’s point of view, there might be
a conflict of interest if you are paying yourself to provide services.
From CQC’s point of view, it matters not one jot. What matters
is that the service you are providing comes into our ambit, because it
is a regulated activity under the Act, and you are providing services
for that level of quality. We deal, as did our predecessor
organisation, the Commission for Social Care Inspection, with local
authorities as both providers and commissioners of services in adult
social care, so we are accustomed to dealing with

                           </em> From my point of view, the most obvious
problem is the standard of management. I know that we are talking about
the NHS, but in social care, for example, we are absolutely clear that
the quality of the registered manager of a social care service has a
fundamental impact on the organisation’s ability not only to
meet the essential standards but to engage with patients or service
users and offer a high standard. We are constantly looking at that.
When we make a judgment about quality concerns, we also make a judgment
about our confidence in that organisation’s ability to improve
services. Poor care happens all the time in all sorts of
circumstances—people make mistakes. The general point that I
would make is that we look to the managers of that system to make sure
that people are given the optimum opportunity to deliver high-quality
care.<a class="bkMark" name="11021095000198">&#160;</a>

clear when we do inspections that our first priority is to observe
patient care and to talk to front-line clinical staff, patients and
their carers. We use that to enrich the information that we get. We use
that information to make judgments about what action we believe the

hard-to-reach communities, who we then work with to consult on various
pieces of work that we are doing. That infrastructure offers us general
support and advice in our work as a regulator, and we then have a range
of tools for when inspectors go into organisations. For example, we
have the short observational tool, which allows us to observe the care
of people with dementia in an organised fashion, so that we can
understand the experiences of people who perhaps cannot communicate
with us in straightforward ways.<a class="bkMark" name="11021095000228">&#160;</a>

and component parts. Our concern is that the £20 billion, which
is 4% a year for four consecutive years, is something that has never
been asked of any public sector organisation. Blue chip companies that
were making profits would struggle to do that. The evidence that we
have is that because people are under pressure to do this, they are
taking short-term, short-sighted measures such as blunt
instruments—recruitment freezes—which ultimately do not
demonstrate intelligent thinking. We want to see a more efficient NHS
and we want to see money spent better, but the evidence from some
trusts—not all—is that this is not well thought
through.<a class="bkMark" name="11021095000235">&#160;</a>

isn’t there? In a sense, many people who have spoken
to us have rather liked the idea of adding to the GP commissioners, and
some of you have put in representations, which say that secondary care
should be part of the commissioning

                           </div>process, and that there should be a clinical commissioning panel, rather
than a GP commissioning panel. There is another thought, which
obviously crossed the minds of Ministers, that one of the objectives of
having greater efficiency is to make less use of the secondary care
sector and hospitals. There therefore does not seem to be an easy
solution to how you can achieve good clinical input and, at the same
time, involve the secondary care sector. It might get you a nice
clinical network, and it might work seamlessly, but it would not have
those strong drivers to reduce the number of hospital admissions. Could
you comment on
that?<a class="bkMark" name="11021095000237">&#160;</a>

We are very keen, as you have correctly picked up, that secondary care
clinicians, nurses, public health and social services all sit round the
same table, and actually at the top table in the consortium. Otherwise,
in certain areas of the country there will be a turf war between the
providers, or a very powerful single provider, and the GP consortia. I
prefer, as you say, the teams without walls, which we have written
about that, and to get rid of the barrier between primary and secondary
care. We call that “commissioning without walls,” where
we are all together around the same table and doing that. I hope that
very sensible decisions will then be made, as you say, between the
balance of secondary care and primary
care.<a class="bkMark" name="11021095000238">&#160;</a>

Black:</strong>
                           </em> At the Royal College of Surgeons, what we are
anxious to see—and would love to see in the Bill—is the
necessity in the national commissioning board for clinician advice. By
that, we mean practising clinician advice, not people with medical
qualifications working in the Department of Health or in public health,
but real working
clinicians.<a class="bkMark" name="11021095000241">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We
are slightly concerned about the gap between national commissioning and
local commissioning by relatively small groups of GPs. National
commissioning is fine for rare diseases, where you need two centres in
the country, but at present there is an awful lot organised on a
regional basis that GPs do not know enough about, because they do not
see enough patients. In my area, for example, cardiac surgery,
neurosurgery and children’s surgery are organised for a
population of about 5 million. No GP collective, unless it is very much
bigger, is going to be able to do that. We hope that the national
commissioning board, with appropriate clinician advice, will fill that
gap on whatever sort of sub-national level is
decided.<a class="bkMark" name="11021095000242">&#160;</a>

under and one goes up, but you cannot do that with hospitals, because
you cannot allow a hospital to shrivel. I do not believe that
competition works. I always say that the harder you work in the health

who is actually on the commissioning board is important. Otherwise,

the evidence we have heard either anecdotally as constituency MPs or
from previous evidence givers. How does it work at the moment? I sat
with a GP on Monday morning who was less than complimentary about other
parts of the NHS that he has to work with. Is some of your discomfort a
result of the fact that generally care is moving from secondary care
into primary care? We heard earlier from patients. If we have better
diagnosis at a very early stage—at the GP level—of, for
example, cancer, that would improve outcomes for thousands of
people.<a class="bkMark" name="11021095000270">&#160;</a>

that more care should be in secondary care. The diagnosis is not being
made in primary care because primary care doctors do not want to refer
patients as there is a cost involved in that. The reason that cancer is
not being diagnosed is because they are not sending patients up for
referral. Andrew Lansley told me that. He has been to the Marsden and

cure
them.”<a class="bkMark" name="11021095000271">&#160;</a>

nuisance. People do not know their consultants, they sit there and wait

they will get a good opinion. I entirely agree that they should not
have to wait, and that the parking and transport should be good. If it
were working properly, patients would prefer to see a specialist. In

                           </strong> I want to take you back to the issue of
competition. Let us say that a GP has a long-standing relationship with
a local hospital; for example, the GP always sends hernia patients to
Mr Thompson, who deals with hernias. They know each other
well, and indeed, they have an idea of where you go for care
afterwards, and that is the way it has always been. There is a Bupa
hospital just as close, but they are not using the Bupa hospital under
the new legislation. From your understanding of it, could the Bupa
hospital challenge the GP? Although the patient may have some choice,
perhaps they take the doctor’s advice, do not question it and do
as the doctor suggests. Some might interpret that sort of relationship
as co-operative and integrated, and an example of working together.
From what you understand, however, can that also be seen as
anti-competitive?<a class="bkMark" name="11021095000295">&#160;</a>

the competition should be on quality, not only on price, and that the
service must be comprehensive. If you decide, therefore, to send

alternative provider would also have to include training, teaching,
research, audit, outcome measure and the ability to deal with
emergencies arising from those particular conditions. That means that
you should only compete if you can give a comprehensive, quality
service, if you are prepared to measure your outcomes, and if you are
prepared to use your outcomes as they come in to make modifications to
provide that the patient gets the best care. That is a pretty demanding

out what is meant. Apparently, it is because the pensions are better in
the NHS. However, lots of things are stacked on the people outside the

while being operated on is transferred to the NHS. A lot of the costs
are piled on to the NHS, so it is quite difficult to unravel the

other way—it is very much in favour of the private provider. If
there are financial biases against it, what about all the things that
we have just talked about—audit, research, training? If all the
simple cases go to private hospitals, how on earth is the next
generation going to be trained? And training has a cost. If that is

The differences were dramatic. Even if you included a component for the
costs of training, which I appreciate is a very important point, there
has to be a way of the private sector complementing, challenging and
innovating to get the NHS hospitals to improve their practice, as has
been the case with some independent treatment centres. Do you not

waiting lists down and day case cataract surgery is a good example. It
encouraged the hospital to do what it should have done earlier, I quite
agree. However, as you know, the financial structure of the centres was
appalling. The process got foreign people coming over. The standards
were very low, and it took NHS staff out and actually paid them extra
to work in them. To me, that is entirely wrong. What should have
happened is that the surgeons in the NHS hospital should have been
doing day case cataracts. A poor way to get change is by setting up
independent treatment centres at a huge
cost.<a class="bkMark" name="11021095000329">&#160;</a>

support it. If you visit north America or the countries with fairly
successful systems in Europe—particularly France—some of
the major providers are almost Imperial college-size units that are
owned and run by religious orders and independent charities. This is a
matter on which, as a college, we would think, “Fine—a
gramophone record—if they do the same standard.” They
have done exactly what I am asking for, which is fair competition, and
good luck to them. The trouble is that they don’t exist in this

Carter would tell me that proper professional advice from nurses would
set nursing staffing at levels that would have stopped some of the much
publicised disasters we have seen over the past years. That is an area

has been a huge underestimation of the need for a body to do
overarching strategic planning, and there is a huge distance between
the national commissioning board and the consortia. I think that the
consortia will have their hands full. Let me give you an example. We in
the Royal College of Nursing are supportive in some areas, particularly
some of our metropolitan areas, of the reconfiguration of acute
hospitals. They are very difficult decisions. They have been difficult
decisions for SHAs and PCTs and, if I may say, very difficult decisions
for MPs. I cannot see GP consortia getting into that, and I cannot see
the commissioning board having the capacity. In recent weeks, this term
of “sub-national groups” has emerged. Is that a
re-emergence of a health authority by stealth? Someone is going to have
to do it. As I say, I just do not think that the consortia will have
the

engagement of clinicians—not so much in consortia, but in trusts
and in management generally. The Mid Staffordshire trust is in my
constituency and my experience is that there was quite a lot of
disengagement over a period of years by clinicians from
management—perhaps it was something that they did not
particularly want to

have done visits to Mid Staffordshire and it is clear that clinicians
there have tried to change things, as indeed they did in Bristol, but
they are disempowered and their views are ignored. I think they should
be doing more management. Indeed, we are setting up a faculty of
medical management for all types—not only clinicians, but other
managers—so that they have a faculty together that will do much
better training for medical management. But it is
disempowerment—apathy—that stalks the corridors among

divide. At the moment, the providers are run as independent financial
institutions competing for business, and they run it on financial
grounds, as happened in Mid Staffordshire, where they ended up cutting
the nurses and other staff in spite of the protests of doctors and

specific reasons in the Mid Staffordshire case as to why they became

shape of the hospital. A district general hospital is a house of
cards—if you pull out one bit, the consequences are profound.

Equally, because it is supposed to be directed from the centre, they
should be encouraging managers to listen to concerns. To be fair to the
Department, it has put out new guidelines to say that people can
complain without damage to their careers, but that has not been the
experience in the past. Concern should be considered to be a positive
thing. In your annual appraisal, you should be asked, “How many
concerns have you put in, Dr Thompson? Why haven’t you put some
concerns in?” Managers, as in any good business, should be
asking for concerns to be raised, as I do in my own institution and the

advocate their patients’ case. Do you feel that there needs to
be a fundamental change in the way the NHS values the role of

that have I asked all the witnesses. I asked them whether they felt
that there were risks associated with the changes. We have heard
people’s concerns about the fragmentation of training, reforms
being too fast, public accountability not being strong enough and
competition being directly against the idea of collaboration and
integration. We have heard worries about the configuration of services,
about who is going to make the decisions, about how is it going to be
accountable, about the extent to which the market is going to be
involved and so on—I could go on. A whole list of concerns has
been raised before us in this Committee, so do you think there are any
risks in relation to the Bill? If so, what? If you do not, why do you
not just stop for a bit and listen to what people have to

                           </em> There is a risk if one were to interfere
with the consistency of it. If I may say so, Mr Hancock, I am grateful
to the members of the Committee for the work that they have done and
will do. This is very important—a once in a generation
opportunity to get it right. I want to emphasise that we did not arrive
at this legislation without a substantial process of consultation. We
had the White Paper in July and a 12-week consultation. I will not list
them, but you will have seen from the Command Paper that we published
before Christmas a series of amendments to the proposals that were
originally in the White Paper, which I hope have substantially
mitigated any of the concerns that people had.<a class="bkMark" name="11021095000383">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Are there
risks? I think there is a risk if the transition is too prolonged and,
as a consequence, it threatens the underlying necessity, which is not
really occasioned by the modernisation reforms themselves, for us to
achieve greater quality and an improvement of outcomes and efficiency
in the next three years. If the transition were too long, that would be
threatened.<a class="bkMark" name="11021095000384">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">There
is a risk involving the institutions inside the NHS and some of the
vested interests, which frankly will find this difficult—change
is difficult. As I have said many times over a number of years, power
is a zero-sum game. If we give more power to patients and clinician,
and if more power shifts towards the front line, there is a
disempowering of intermediate tiers of managers and bureaucracies. Many
national organisations, strategic health authorities and primary care
trusts have good managers who will play an important part in the new
system, but who, institutionally, sometimes find change difficult.
There is a risk if they try to use the new system simply to recreate
themselves, which is exactly why some of the safeguards have been built
in and why some of the statutory duties are here to provide against
precisely
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11021095000385">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Beyond
the Bill, since we came into office last May, we have identified the
running costs of the system, which had previously never happened. We
are clear that we will reduce those running costs and ensure that there
is a financial control that is geared to containing those running costs
in the
future.<a class="bkMark" name="11021095000386">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
third thing is about the passage of the Bill itself. If one focuses on
the Bill to the exclusion of the modernisation of the NHS as a whole,
it would be a mistake and a risk. The Bill is not the whole story. The
story is in the White Paper, and it is about putting patients at the
heart of decision making. They should feel that there is no decision
about me without me. It is the focus on results and the outcomes
framework that we published before Christmas. It is the empowerment of
patients through the information consultation that we
published.<a class="bkMark" name="11021095000387">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There are
references in the Bill to the mandate to the NHS commissioning
board—and, through it, to the commissioners—to improve
outcomes. It is there, but to think that the Bill tells you the
outcomes we are looking for and the shape of those outcomes is
wrong—it does not do all that. The cultural change in the
national health service, which is about shifting responsibility towards
the front line and giving patients real control over their health care,
will not be achieved by legislation.<a class="bkMark" name="11021095000388">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Legislation—and
I have been involved in quite a bit of it, including writing
it—is like a lawyer writing a contract. It is very important to
get it right if things go wrong. There will be many occasions in your
discussions when you will think, “Okay, if something goes wrong,
how does the Bill impact upon that?” However, it is not the
means by which you make things go right. We are intending to make
things go right in the national health service by the White Paper
modernisation as a whole, not least by the empowerment of patients and
the focus on responsibility on the part of
clinicians.<a class="bkMark" name="11021095000389">&#160;</a>

will be more democratically accountable in the future. As a patient,
the influence that you exercise in the NHS in future will be enhanced
in a wide variety of ways, and not just through choice or through
information—important as that is. We will give patients greater
opportunity to have a voice through local health watch, which will have
additional powers and Health Watch England, which connects directly to
the Care Quality Commission. Patients have a direct input into how
safety and quality are secured, and can participate in the scrutiny
function—at the moment they cannot—democratically through
local authorities, through the health and well-being board, which is a
system leader in terms of the strategic design of health and social
care in this area.<a class="bkMark" name="11021095000392">&#160;</a>

your point, if the commissioners sought to designate services then
those services would be maintained, and that would be secured through
the role of Monitor. If, however, it was intended that there should be
a major service change in an area, in the first instance, I would
expect and the Bill would require that that was part of the discussion
between commissioners and the health and well-being board, because that
is where one discusses proactively the strategic needs through the JSNA
and translates them into commissioning plans.<a class="bkMark" name="11021095000393">&#160;</a>

it on behalf of local people, in the first instance, to the NHS
commissioning board and, if they are not satisfied with the response
they get, in the second instance to me as Secretary of State. Then I
can ask the independent reconfiguration panel to advise me on the

                        <p class="tabbed">I
know that the Bexley clinical commissioning group, for example, took
cardiology and looked for new ways to deliver improving services for
its patients who required cardiology interventions. That was extremely
successful. I have been to visit Nene commissioning group in
Northamptonshire, which has put together an integrated service, drawing
together a range of providers, to look after patients who have
long-term conditions. It identified patients who were having large
numbers of emergency admissions and substantially reduced those. People
who know Cumbria will know well that the acute trust and primary care
trust were pretty much at loggerheads. It took the GPs to step in. They
stepped in, started to reconfigure services and took responsibility,
and they are turning around the whole health system in Cumbria, which
was under threat, but is now demonstrating how services can be designed
successfully from a community point of view. GPs in Redbridge came
together in a commissioning group and are transferring dermatology and
ophthalmology services into the community and leading it.<a class="bkMark" name="11021095000399">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There are
risks in not making enough progress with this. My predecessors,
including Labour Secretaries of State, have said time and again over
years, “It would be better if we could deliver more services
more accessibly to patients, maintaining quality but doing it in a way
that reduces the extent to which people have to be admitted to
hospital, particularly as emergencies.” If we can do that, it is
better for patients, the quality is better and the efficiency is
better.<a class="bkMark" name="11021095000400">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There are
implications for hospitals, of course, but what hon. Members of all
political parties have objected to many times in recent years is the
idea that service provision is written down in a primary care trust
business plan. Then, in order to transfer patients into the community,
the hospital budget is cut, but patients still arrive at the hospital.
That is not an effective process of service transformation, which is
why at the heart of this is the principle that those who are most
responsible for the care of patients—not just GPs but the teams
who work with them, in the community and in general
practice—should also be directly responsible for using resources
best to deliver that care. Then, if we transform services successfully
in the community, there will be changes in the pattern of services, but
the public will understand, justify and accept
them.<a class="bkMark" name="11021095000401">&#160;</a>

director of the finance of the NHS—if I have got his
title right—that he was very confident that GP consortia would
manage and respond well to the budgets for managing
themselves—their management costs, if you like. Do you think
that if they manage those budgets extremely well and come in under the
targets for the cost of managing themselves, we might even consider
having an incentive for them to take some of that money and
put it back into front-line services? There could be an extra
incentive, perhaps, on the management costs.<a class="bkMark" name="11021095000402">&#160;</a>

Lansley:</strong>
                           </em> We set out in the Command Paper before
Christmas our estimate that in 2014 the running costs of GP
commissioning consortia would be between £25 and £35 per
head. Richard may well have said to you that GP commissioning groups
thought that that was an entirely reasonable basis on which to
plan.<a class="bkMark" name="11021095000403">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Let
us say, for the sake of argument, that we have a running cost limit,
but a consortium spends less than that. That money would then be
available for patient care. There is no question about that. In the
design of the structure of GP-led commissioning, we have taken account
of past experience. One of the flaws in fundholding was that, if
fundholders saved money on their practice budget on behalf of their
patients, it was too easy for them simply to spend it on themselves.
The current design will not allow that. The budget for patients and for
management costs is completely separate from the budget for individual
practices and for the consortium itself, and the reward to general
practices collectively, like the quality and outcomes framework that is
set out in the quality premium here, is for delivering improving
quality and results for patients. It is not the case that they save
money and they somehow get additional compensation as a
result.<a class="bkMark" name="11021095000404">&#160;</a>

wanted to ensure two things: decision making that was close to patients

accountability. When we actually looked at the question, we made part
of the overall process of reform, the transfer of public health
responsibilities to local authorities. Local authorities’ social
care departments and the NHS need to work increasingly closely
together. In terms of service design, the essential relationship was
between general practice leading local commissioning, and local
authorities running those services and providing democratic
accountability. To that extent, there was not a role for primary care
trusts. The principle we applied was that form follows function. If

publication of the coalition programme for government and the
publication of the White Paper, as Andrew just said, we spent time
looking at the functions and where they could most appropriately be
discharged. One conclusion we came to early on was that it would make
much more sense to locate public health within local government,
because that would present many opportunities to drive a health agenda.
It would also allow us to look at the role of local government as an
actor in the commissioning functions of the NHS; we actually see the
opportunity to integrate health and social care through the formation
of health and well-being
boards.<a class="bkMark" name="11021095000421">&#160;</a>

the current system primary care trusts have an idea,
individually—151 separate organisations— what quality
looks like? Often they do not; that is why the weaknesses in
commissioning at the moment are as great as they are. We need
commissioning to be based on quality. For decisions to be made on the
basis of care of patients, at a local level, we should design services
to meet those quality standards. There is the idea that what the
evidence base tells us constitutes quality. Ten or 11 years ago under a
Labour Government, it was decided there was a need through NICE for a
good evidence base for what quality looks like. It has not
happened.<a class="bkMark" name="11021095000430">&#160;</a>

nurses, the health professionals who are in charge of them, exercising
their clinical judgment on the basis of high-quality

Anybody can make a fair case for reform. The type of reform can
obviously vary. There was another option on the table, which was to
take the existing PCT structure and slim it down by 30%, as I think the
chief executive of the NHS was intending to do; bring in clinicians to
dominate the board, if you want; build or bolt on democratic
accountability, and add outcome measures. They are all laudable aims of
the legislation. That way you could keep institutional memory, acquired
skills and coterminosity with local authorities. Theoretically, you
would have less upheaval and risk, and save money while creating very
few new organisations. With that as the alternative, why was it not
chosen? I am sure there is a
reason.<a class="bkMark" name="11021095000434">&#160;</a>

well-being boards will bring the relevant commissioning
consortia—there may be one or more—in their areas
together to secure that. From the point of view of joint working, most
upper-tier local authorities do not manage social services as a single
function, but tend to devolve it to a range of localities. It is
perfectly possible to make these things work effectively.<a class="bkMark" name="11021095000437">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The essence
of it is that we had far too many organisations spending too much. You
cannot get around that. When we came into office, there were 909
practice-based commissioning groups, 151 primary care trusts, 10
strategic health authorities and about 57 varieties of arm’s
length bodies, and the Department of Health. Coming to my point about
power being a zero-sum game, most of those organisations did not make
their own decisions anyway. Most of them just looked and waited for the
Department of
Health.<a class="bkMark" name="11021095000438">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Mr
Barron talked about stroke care—he knows. He and I have been
involved in this for years. Most of the commissioning organisations out
there, and many of the providers, did not even begin to do the things
that they should have done on improving acute stroke care until the
Department of Health published a document telling them that they
should. That is not the kind of health service I am looking for in
future. When it becomes obvious, as it did more than a decade ago, that
you can change the design of services for acute care of stroke and
secure for a significant minority of patients an overwhelmingly better
outcome with fewer resources, I am looking for a health service where
people simply change the design because it is the logical thing to do.
That requires clinical judgment and clinical
leadership.<a class="bkMark" name="11021095000439">&#160;</a>

respect, Mr Pugh, when you come back to the idea of simply doing it
through primary care trusts, I say that we have been there and we have
tried. Practice-based commissioning was the previous
Government’s effort to make that happen, and it did not happen.
Why? Because it was still managers on top and clinicians on tap. It has
to be the other way round.<a class="bkMark" name="11021095000440">&#160;</a>

that the primary care trusts should have clinicians on top. I have to

progress as they have. The idea that the first thing we do to the
pathfinder consortia as they come together is require them to fill in
questionnaires from the Department of Health is what we are trying to
get away from. There is a process of transition. They will be
establishing themselves over the coming months. They have a year in

will be on quality? There are no clinicians in

                           </em> That is not the issue. Quality is the basis
of competition, because those who make the choice—the
patients—will be choosing on the basis of quality. Why would
they do otherwise, since the service will be free to them? The
information that is provided to them will be entirely about the quality
of the service available to them. The commissioners will be focused on
quality, because they will have a duty to improve the standards and
quality of the service they provide. They will be incentivised through
the quality premium to do so. The design of the structure of
commissioning is between the commissioning consortia and the NHS
commissioning board. Monitor’s job is to ensure that those who
are engaged in providing those services do so on a level playing field
and that we maximise the opportunity for those commissioning services,
or those choosing the services that they go to, to get access to a
range of quality providers, who meet the standards of quality, and so
far as possible, exceed
them.<a class="bkMark" name="11021095000449">&#160;</a>

applies to some 60% of hospital activity, which, in itself, is just
over half of total activity. More than half of what happens in the NHS
is subject to price competition now. I do not think that the quality
safeguards are as good as they should be, because we do not have
quality standards. We are only now at the outset of getting essential
standards of safety and quality registered and enforced by the

competition in mental health services is an interesting case. Talking
of former MPs, I spent Friday afternoon with the senior management of
my local mental health trust, Cambridge and Peterborough mental health
trust. In mental health services at the moment, there is effectively a
kind of price competition. It is run through a block contracting
system. They are currently in a situation in which, effectively, the
primary care trust does not commission for quality; it commissions
simply for price and volume. Cost and volume commissioning—Mr
Barron will not doubt confirm this—was the overwhelming
character of commissioning by primary care trusts that the previous
Select Committee found when it investigated commissioning. I am
determined that we move away from cost and volume
commissioning.<a class="bkMark" name="11021095000456">&#160;</a>

mental health trusts, the chair of that trust is Anne Campbell who used
to be a Labour MP for Cambridge. She wants to see the extension of the
tariff to mental health as fast as possible. Why? Because then money
follows the patient. The quality that is related to the price is
absolutely explicit in the tariff. Consequently, if they do a better
job, they will get the resources to go with it, rather than constantly
being treated on a cost and volume basis
alone.<a class="bkMark" name="11021095000457">&#160;</a>

thing, which is that it is very challenging to deliver the reforms set
out in the Bill at the same time as delivering 4% savings per year,
leading to a £20 billion efficiency gain. It strikes
me that what they have all misunderstood is that the reforms in the
Bill are an

Lansley:</strong>
                           </em> If I may say so, it is because there is a
disconnect in political discourse between local and national. The
moment you go and talk to people who run acute hospital trusts and ask
them whether they think, given greater freedoms as foundation trusts,
that they have been able to deliver improving efficiency, the answer is
almost always yes. This is the principle we have applied to local
government. It is tough but, in local government, if you give local
authorities greater freedoms and flexibilities, they are better able to
manage under the financial circumstances we have.<a class="bkMark" name="11021095000460">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">If you say
that to general practices coming together into the local commissioning
groups and meet them locally, they almost always say, “We can
redesign services and deliver greater efficiency.” I make no
bones about it: from their point of view, this is one of the reasons
why many GP groups are keen to get involved. It is because they know
that the alternative would be traditional salami slicing by primary
care trusts—rationing, salami slicing and saying, “You
can’t do this.” They do not want systems of referral
management where the clinical judgments of general practices are
overridden by a PCT-led referral management scheme to try to deliver a
budget without regard to the implications for their patients. They want
to redesign
services.<a class="bkMark" name="11021095000461">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
truth of the matter is, even if we were increasing the resources to the
NHS not by 3% in cash next year but by 10%, we would still do this. We
are not doing it to deliver the efficiency savings; we are necessarily
doing it in the context of having to deliver efficiency savings. I
remind everybody that every penny saved is a penny available for
reinvestment in health care services. There are people the length and
breadth of the health service who have had previous pressures on
efficiencies. The last time it happened on this scale was in 2005-06.
There was a massive constraint. People across the NHS were angry and
frustrated because they did not feel that they took ownership of that.
When you go into productive care services—the new productive
care approaches in hospitals—the essence of it, like lean
management in industry, is to transfer the ownership of what you do
into the hands of the people on the front line who have to deliver it.
They redesign the services and they capture the benefits. They can
reinvest the benefits to improve services for those they look
after.<a class="bkMark" name="11021095000462">&#160;</a>

done in designing this new system is to realise where things went wrong
in the past. I mentioned one issue in relation to fundholding. Another
issue is the potential for conflicts of interest, which, I am afraid,
were too many in the past. We are designing to escape from that. It is
one of the reasons why Mr Smith says there is an awful lot here about
the introduction of competition rules. You know what competition rules
give you inside the NHS? It happens at the moment technically when
public procurement rules are applied, as they already are. It gives you
the opportunity to combat abuse.<a class="bkMark" name="11021095000464">&#160;</a>

transparent in the legislation that we allow them, for example, to
create more integrated services and to commission on that basis but it

from yourself, for example, by definition you have created an abuse and
the competition rules would say that you can step in or somebody else
who has been closed out by that can step in and bring a complaint. The
same would be true if there was cartelisation on the part of providers
of if there was a very large provider that was engaging in an abusive
relationship with the commissioners and saying, “I’m
going to push up the price of this service and there is nothing you can
do about it because you can’t go anywhere else.” That is
why you need Monitor for this purpose and why you need the people in
Monitor to have the appropriate expertise, which is in competition
rules and economic judgments. It is a specific task. But it is not a
task that gets in the way of delivering the best possible care and even

health budgets alongside their social care budgets. We are trying to

                           </em> The record will show that I did not say that
they would never be required to put it out to competitive tender. There
are specific circumstances. The urban myth was that the introduction of
competition rules in the NHS would require everything to be put out to
competitive tender. Myth one—competition rules already apply and
the ones that really apply are EU public procurement rules. They
already apply to primary care trusts, so there is no change there. The
second myth is, actually, the only circumstances in which competition
law bites is if you are trying to restrict provider access to
commissioning services. For example, if you wanted to give a volume
guarantee to a provider, you have to go through competitive tender in
order to do that. If, however, you want to specify a service and there
is the NHS tariff price, the any willing provider approach would be
that you have a range of providers available to you as commissioners
and to your patients exercising choice. You do not have to have a
competitive tender for that purpose because if they meet the standard
and the price, they can offer the service.<a class="bkMark" name="11021095000475">&#160;</a>
