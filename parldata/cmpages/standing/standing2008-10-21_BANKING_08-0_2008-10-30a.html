Mark Hoban</b> (Fareham) (Con): On a point of order,
Mr. Gale. The order of consideration of the Bill has been
varied to enable us to move on after the current provision to part 1.
The purpose of reordering the order of consideration was to enable
members of the Committee to have access to the code of practice
referred to in clause 5 before the relevant date. The Economic
Secretary to the Treasury said in the evidence session and at other
points that the code of practice would be made available today. As of
10 minutes ago, I had not received the code of practice. I wonder
whether it is the intention of Treasury officials to ensure that it is
circulated.</div><a name="08103042000027"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103042000404"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Strictly speaking, the provision of all
Government papers is a matter for the Department involved, not for the
Chair, but if the Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury wishes to
respond, I should be pleased to allow her to do
so.</div><a name="08103042000028"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103042000405"></a>The
Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury (Angela Eagle):</b> Yes.
The code of practice should have been sent today. It is a surprise that
the hon. Member for Fareham has not got it, so we will check to
see&#151;</div><a name="08103042000029"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08103042000406"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mark Todd</b> (South Derbyshire) (Lab): Nobody has got
it.</div><a name="08103042000030"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103042000407"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> Well, if nobody has it, I will personally check to
see where it is. It is obviously for the convenience of the Committee
that that important document in draft form is available, so I thank the
hon. Member for Fareham for bringing the matter to my attention. I will
certainly
investigate.</div><a name="08103042000031"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103042000408"></a>The

the relevant documents are available in a timely fashion, so I am sure
that if officials dealt with that, the Committee would be
grateful.</div><a name="08103042000016"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103042000410"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I welcome you to the Chair for this
afternoon&#146;s proceedings, Mr. Gale. Before we
adjourned, I had moved on from the debate about the amendments to the
clause stand part debate and I was talking about the financial
stability objective. I identified three key areas for clarification:
what does the objective mean, how is it measured and what tools does
the Bank have to deliver financial
stability?</div><a name="08103042000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
gave the definition of the objective that the Governor of the Bank of
England had used in evidence to the Treasury Committee. That definition
was amplified when we held our evidence session on Tuesday 21 October.
The executive director for financial stability expanded on the
Governor&#146;s definition when he defined a situation of financial
stability as one
where</div><a name="08103042000347"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
financial intermediation mechanism works normally, where households and
corporates can mediate their savings into real investment in the
economy at home and abroad, and where the payment system operates
normally. It is a situation where intermediation works well, where
people have confidence in the system and where the payment system
operates well.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report,
Banking Public Bill Committee, </i>21 October 2008; c. 21,
Q53.]</div><a name="08103042000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is
quite a narrow definition. Clearly, it is one that the Bank is happy to
use, and it ties in with one of the new responsibilities that have been
given to the Bank in the Bill. I am referring to the regulation of
payment systems. There is a clear link between that definition and the
Bank&#146;s
responsibility.</div><a name="08103042000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am concerned, however, that the definitions that the Bank has used are
very much process-driven, focusing on the payment system and how
effectively we can mediate savings and investments. Other definitions
are available that focus on broader issues. Andrew Crockett, who was
formerly the general manager of the Bank for International Settlements,
referred to an absence of financial stability
as</div><a name="08103042000348"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a
situation in which economic performance is potentially impaired by
fluctuations in the price of financial assets or by an inability of
financial institutions to meet their contractual
obligations.&#148;</div><a name="08103042000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are two elements to the definition. One is about process&#151;the
ability to meet contractual obligations&#151;but the first one
broadens the definition somewhat by talking about the impact that the
fluctuation in asset prices might have on the
economy.</div><a name="08103042000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
raises a different set of issues and links into a definition of
stability given by Garry J. Schinasi in an International Monetary Fund
publication called &#147;Defining Financial Stability&#148;. He
described financial stability as</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column226" />Column number: 226</div><a name="08103042000349"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a condition in
which an economy&#146;s mechanisms for pricing, allocating, and
managing financial risks (credit, liquidity, counterparty, market,
etc.) are functioning well enough to contribute to the performance of
the
economy&#148;.</div><a name="08103042000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
defines financial stability much more broadly, and it reflects on some
of the current problems in the financial system and indicates why the
system is unstable. For example, the pricing of risk related to
mortgage-backed securities did not appear to work, as the level of risk
inherent in those products was underestimated and consequently lower
interest rates were charged. The credit crunch, in its early stages,
was a sign that liquidity risks in the market were not well understood.
We know that from Northern Rock, where the problem was not the
bank&#146;s solvency but its liquidity, because of its exposure to
wholesale markets. People&#146;s understanding of how wholesale
markets functioned did not flow into their understanding of liquidity.
Banks that were perceived to have adopted a more cautious approach to
risk and were widely criticised for the conservatism of their
strategies, have withstood the market turmoil with greater resilience
than banks that followed more aggressive policies. Again, there is the
issue of understanding the risks and the markets. Part of the problem
that we face is the consequence of an asset price bubble that was
fuelled by an increase of debt and which has caused instability in the
market.</div><a name="08103042000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would argue that it is a combination of those issues that has given
rise to some of the current problems, such as the threat to payment
systems and the means of intermediation. My concern is that the
definition that has been adopted or discussed by the Bank is narrow. If
we look at the causes of the current financial instability, we will
understand that there are wider issues of financial stability than
simply the functioning of the payment system. My concern is that if we
have too narrow a definition of financial stability we are at risk of
losing sight of the threats to that stability and of the policy actions
that we might take to combat
that.</div><a name="08103042000061"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103042000411"></a>Mr.
Todd:</b> The hon. Gentleman has used, I think, the same
source as I have&#151;the Treasury Committee report. The most
appealing definition that I found among those offered&#151;they are
all flawed in various ways&#151;was the one that the hon. Gentleman
has not quoted, from the Deutsche
Bundesbank:</div><a name="08103042000350"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
steady state in which the financial system efficiently performs its key
economic functions, such as allocating resources and spreading risk as
well as settling payments, and is able to do so even in the event of
shocks, stress situations, and periods of profound structural
change.&#148;</div><a name="08103042000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
somehow encompasses some of the basic functional aspects that the hon.
Gentleman talked about in relation to the Governor&#146;s comments,
and also the management of risk and stress analysis, which is another
key
element.</div><a name="08103042000063"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103042000412"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes a good point. I did not
wish to regurgitate everything that was in the Treasury Committee
report&#151;just perhaps most of it. This dual aspect of financial
stability is what is really important. It is about how the systems
function and their resilience, but it is also about the allocation of
risk. Narrowing the definition of financial stability could potentially
lead to ignoring the risk aspect of that stability. It is important to
reflect on that. As the Bank comes to terms with its new role and looks
at its financial stability objective, I hope that it will consider
actively the allocation of risk and the price that risk gets in the
marketplace.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column227" />Column number: 227</div><a name="08103042000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
difficult to define financial stability. I expect that explains why the
Government moved from their policy in July of wanting a definition in
the Bill, to just saying that it is a high-level concept. Sir John
Parker, in his memorandum on this to the Treasury Committee, suggested
that there could be a &#147;qualitative&#148; objective for
financial stability, rather than a quantitative objective, which might
be developed to identify factors that could be used to define far
better what financial stability would be. In his evidence, he suggested
five factors that might be helpful in coming up with a qualitative
objective:</div><a name="08103042000351"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;First,
the Bank cannot and should not seek as its objective the elimination of
all instabilities...within the...system. That could only be
achieved by suppressing the financial intermediation...Second, the
tools available to the...banks...are
limited&#148;,</div><a name="08103042000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">which
implies that the elimination of financial instability is unrealistic.
That is important to recognise&#151;I shall come on to tools later
on, but there is a limited range of policy levers available to the Bank
to tackle financial instability. I shall propose one additional lever
that the Bank might be able to use. To
continue:</div><a name="08103042000352"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Third...the
objective of the...authorities should be to ameliorate the
effects&#148;&#151;</div><a name="08103042000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">costs&#151;of
failure, which goes back to the definition that the hon. Member for
South Derbyshire quoted. How can we build resilience into the system to
ensure that, where there is a failure, the system continues to function
effectively? Some of the clauses in the Bill tackle that&#151;the
reforms to the Financial Services Compensation Scheme will help the
system perform better when there is a banking
failure.</div><a name="08103042000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">Sir
John also suggested, fourthly, that the Bank&#146;s role with regard
to financial stability would be strengthened with its new
responsibilities for oversight of payment systems, which we debated on
Tuesday, and the operation of the special resolution regime, which we
will come on to in part 1 of the Bill. His fifth comment was that,
while financial stability might focus on the banking sector, there are
non-banking activities that have an impact on financial stability. In
our debate this morning on clause 214, the Minister explained the
rationale for Government amendment No. 28 in the context that
non-banking institutions can have a significant impact on financial
stability, given the intermediation in the system and some of the
business models that have been employed over the past few
years.</div><a name="08103042000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the Bank were to look at Sir John&#146;s comments about the factors
that could be used to set up a qualitative measure, that might help
flesh out the definition of &#147;financial stability&#148; beyond
that stated in the Bill. It would also help provide a framework for
assessing how well the Bank met its objectives. Part of the challenge,
in how the Bill is structured, is how to hold the Bank to account for
deepening financial stability, when we only have a vague definition of
financial stability and&#151;we all accept this&#151;it is
difficult to
measure.</div><a name="08103042000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am sure that there will be a rash of research into the definition of
&#147;financial stability&#148;. We may be able to reach a
consensus in time, but the absence makes it harder to hold the Bank of
England to account. As I said earlier, we shall know where there is a
lack of financial stability, but the problem is in determining it. Sir
Andrew Large, a former deputy governor of the Bank, said:</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column228" />Column number: 228</div><a name="08103042000353"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;There
is neither a clear over-arching analytical framework nor a commonly
agreed set of indicators of incipient financial instabilities...We
are dealing with tail events&#151;low probability
scenarios&#151;rather than central projections. It is about aberrant
rather than normal behaviour and situations: less predictable and
harder to
model.&#148;</div><a name="08103042000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
presents us with a challenge&#151;how do we measure financial
stability? The Governor alluded to this in the evidence that he gave to
the Treasury
Committee:</div><a name="08103042000354"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I
think therefore the danger is that financial stability looks like a
period in which you are merely sowing the seeds of the next crisis and
it appears to be a tranquil time but in fact beneath the surface those
seeds are germinating and will produce the crisis down the
road&#148;&#151;</div><a name="08103042000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">very
eloquent. I happily give
way.</div><a name="08103042000072"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103042000413"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> It might be eloquent, but it is a rather
pessimistic view. Does the hon. Gentleman not agree with
me?</div><a name="08103042000371"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.15
pm</div><a name="08103042000073"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103042000414"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> The Minister makes a very interesting comment and I
will come to that later with remarks about the tools that the Bank has
to deliver financial stability. Some activities in the financial
markets may be acceptable at a low level but as they grow in scale they
cause wider risks to the economy. The Governor might have been
pessimistic but I think he was right in what he said about relatively
low-level activity in a particular area. When things such as credit
default options and credit default swaps were first thought about they
were seen as valuable financial instruments, but as their usage grew a
risk to the economy arose. I think the Governor is being realistic
rather than pessimistic when he says that what we might accept as
normal at one point might become a threat to financial stability in the
long
term.</div><a name="08103042000074"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08103042000415"></a><b class="B">Ms
Sally Keeble</b> (Northampton, North) (Lab): Would the hon.
Gentleman not accept that the Governor was speaking widely about the
general issue? I do not see how the hon. Gentleman can relate the
Governor&#146;s remarks to a discussion about how either an executive
committee or a sub-committee of the Bank of England can work. A number
of the issues that the Government are talking about are dealt with by
regulation or by the
FSA.</div><a name="08103042000075"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103042000416"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I apologise. I have moved on. I moved on before
lunch from the discussion of the group of amendments to the more stand
part nature of this
debate.</div><a name="08103042000076"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103042000417"></a>Ms
Keeble:</b> Yes, I understand
that.</div><a name="08103042000077"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103042000418"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> This is about how one measures the objective of
financial stability and whether the financial stability committee has
an executive or non-executive role. That is not relevant to this
discussion. It is something that either model of the FSC or the hybrid
model in the Bill will have to come to terms
with.</div><a name="08103042000078"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103042000419"></a>Ms
Keeble:</b> I understand what the hon. Gentleman is talking
about but, having sat through all that evidence that the Governor gave,
what he was talking about were 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column229" />Column number: 229</div>pressures that build up within the system. Most of those pressures are
properly dealt with by the FSA or by other forms of regulation. They
are not necessarily matters that the financial stability committee
would ever deal with, whatever model was taken for its
structure.</div><a name="08103042000079"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103042000420"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Yes. One challenge in looking at the risks
identified in the financial stability report published by the Bank this
week is to understand when the Bank identifies a risk who responds to
it and how. I agree with the hon. Lady that some responses may be
within the remit of the Bank of England, some within the remit of the
FSA and some within that of the Government. We can all agree that the
horizon-scanning role of the Bank in identifying risks is really
important but we need to think about who will tackle those risks once
they have been identified and that is not exclusively the Bank&#146;s
role. Indeed, the Bank&#146;s role may be quite limited. I will touch
again on some of this in a minute.</div>
<a name="08103042000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was trying
to make the point that it is difficult to measure when there is or is
not financial stability&#151;events that appear to be normal might
hold the seeds of a potential future crisis. We need to accept that
that could be the case. In the evidence that the Governor gave to the
Treasury Committee he referred to the creation of products such as CDO
squared and the relaxation of credit criteria as potentially sowing the
seeds of the crisis before us at the moment. Even actions such as the
relaxation of credit criteria have a dual edge to them. One effect is
to enable more people to have a home of their own but another could
lead to sub-prime lending. In looking at some of the seeds we need to
think carefully about what the impact might be, and the pros and cons
of tackling some of the risks that have emerged to financial
stability.</div>
<a name="08103042000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to
talk about the tools that the Bank has to deliver its objective of
financial stability. In last week&#146;s evidence session, Nigel
Jenkinson listed tools available to the Bank. He referred to the bank
being the ultimate supplier of liquidity to the economy, its roles on
payment systems and financial infrastructure and, under the Bill, the
operation of the special resolution regime. He also mentioned some
areas where the tools available to the Bank are more of an advisory
nature rather than direct action. The financial stability report is
part of that role: flagging up the risks to the economy, the advice
that the Bank can give to the FSA on prudential
regulation&#151;participation in international forums such as the
Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the Financial Stability
Forum, for example. These tools are all available to the bank. The
extent to which they lead to action depends on whether it is an
advisory role or a more executive one for the Bank as an institution,
putting aside the debate about what the committee might do. Although
the list is not exhaustive, it gives the Committee a flavour of the
tools available to the Bank.</div>
<a name="08103042000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, one
of the challenges we have to think about is whether the Bank has
sufficient tools&#151;I am mixing metaphors horribly here&#151;in
its
armoury&#151;</div><a name="08103042000083"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103042000421"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b>
Weapons.</div><a name="08103042000084"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103042000422"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Tools at its disposal to maintain financial
stability might be a better phrase. I want to dwell on this for a
moment, because it indicates the problems that the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column230" />Column number: 230</div>Bank of England has in delivering its objective. We would all agree that
one of the causes of the current crisis was the asset price bubble. In
one of its reports in 2006, the Bank
said,</div><a name="08103042000355"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;asset
prices have risen considerably over the past few years, dwarfing recent
price falls...Some of the drivers of rising prices&#151;such as
financial innovation that allows risks to be better matched to
investors&#146; preferences&#151;are likely to endure. So risk
premia may remain lower on average than in the past. But other factors
that may have boosted prices, such as low global risk-free yields and
benign macroeconomic conditions, may not last indefinitely. Against
that backdrop, and despite recent market falls, the price of risk in
financial markets still appears somewhat low. Certainly, risk premia on
a number of financial assets remain low by historical
standards.&#148;</div><a name="08103042000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
was a very prescient warning of the causes of our current
problems.</div>
<a name="08103042000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">The question
is then, &#147;What could the Bank have done at that point?&#148;
It has clearly flagged up the risk to the market, and to the other
members of the tripartite authorities, but in terms of the
Bank&#146;s ability to influence that, its role was reduced to having
flagged up the risk; the next measure is beyond its control. The FSA is
not required to respond formally to the financial stability report
about how it would reflect the Bank&#146;s assessment of risks, in
terms of how it might supervise individual institutions.</div>
<a name="08103042000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of the
conventional responses to the asset price bubble would have been to
increase interest rates, making credit more expensive and thus reducing
upward pressure on asset prices. However, the remit of the Bank of
England, which was introduced in the Bank of England Act 1998, is that
setting interest rates is limited to combating inflation, so its
actions are constrained by that objective. Therefore, at a time of low
inflation and weak inflationary pressures, the Bank has set a low
interest rate, but the consequence might have been the context of that
in 2006, where that helped to fuel the asset price bubble and then the
Bank was unable to cool it down.</div>
<a name="08103042000088"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08103042000423"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Colin Breed</b> (South-East Cornwall) (LD): Does the hon.
Gentleman agree that, in tracking the inflation rate, it is probably a
good idea to have the right rate, bearing in mind that the current
target has nothing to do with house
prices?</div><a name="08103042000089"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103042000424"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Indeed, there is an argument for that. I am wary of
trying to use interest rate policy to tackle two
objectives&#151;inflation and asset prices. We need to look to other
tools to influence asset prices, which I shall come to in a
minute.</div>
<a name="08103042000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">The UK has
not been the only economy affected by the conflict between asset prices
and inflation. There have been asset price bubbles in Ireland and Spain
because they have high interest rates, and although the rates are right
for the eurozone as a whole, they are not right for the economic
conditions of those territories. The fact that interest rates cannot be
used to affect asset prices indicates a limitation on the Bank of
England&#146;s tools for maintaining financial stability, which is
why we need to look more broadly.</div>
<a name="08103042000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
argued that the rules surrounding the level of capital should be
reformed to act as a check on the level of debt in the economy as a
whole. In part, reform of Basel II to deal with pro-cyclicality could
address that. I 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column231" />Column number: 231</div>know that the Government share that position. We also need to think
about what checks there should be within the UK regulatory system
looking at the level of debt in the economy. In our recent publication
on financial stability, we called for a debt responsibility mechanism,
which would create a linkage between the Bank&#146;s assessment of
risk and the action that the FSA took as the prudential regulator. The
Bank of England would be asked to take on broader responsibility for
debt in our banking system and our economy, and for the risks that that
debt poses. The Bank would, throughout the year, send an open letter to
the FSA setting out its assessment of market-wide risk. The FSA would
need to take account of the Bank&#146;s assessment when regulating
lending by individual banks. Imposing tougher capital rules, bank by
bank, during boom times would help to stop debt-fuelled bubbles
emerging in the first place. The Bank could and should be given that
tool to enable it to both look at its assessment of risks and then have
a policy lever that it was able to deploy to encourage a response, in
this case from the prudential regulator&#151;the
FSA.</div><a name="08103042000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Bank&#146;s financial stability review, published this week,
highlighted the need for improved macro-prudential arrangements to
tackle excess lending. There is a growing consensus that we may need to
take that approach, both international and, perhaps, domestically, to
enable regulation of the amount of credit available in the markets.
Certainly, countries such as Spain have looked at other tools, such as
dynamic provisioning, to build up a cushion in the good times, so that
the banks are not hit too badly when the economy
deteriorates.</div>
<a name="08103042000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will
conclude my speech, which will be to the relief of the Committee, and
indeed to me because I have spoken for over an hour.
<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">] </i>It seems like a very long time. I
am grateful to the hon. Members for Northampton, North and for South
Derbyshire for their
feedback.</div><a name="08103042000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are giving the Bank of England the statutory objective to deliver
financial stability. It is not a statutory objective that the Treasury
or the FSA have, but it is important that the Bank has it. It is not
well defined, it is difficult to measure and I am not sure that the
Bank has the tools to do the job. Furthermore, the proposed financial
stability committee&#151;the subject that I started on at about
quarter to 10 this morning&#151;and the structure add to the
Bank&#146;s difficulty in delivering financial stability. How will we
hold the Bank to account the next time that we have a financial
problem? Has it had the right tools and structure, and does it know
what it should be doing to maintain financial stability? The Committee
does not want to see a reoccurrence of the events of the past year.
This is not a once-in-a-generation opportunity, but it is an
opportunity to get it right. I am not sure that we are quite there yet
with this Bill, and I would like to see the Government, the Bank and
the FSA working a little more closely over the weeks ahead, to see
whether we can improve and clarify the arrangements so that the Bank is
clear about its role and how it will deliver
it.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103042000425"></a>Mr.
Todd:</b> It is a pleasure, as always, to serve under your
chairmanship, Mr. Gale. I will cover similar ground to the
hon. Member for Fareham, but perhaps not at quite the length he treated
us to.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column232" />Column number: 232</div><a name="08103042000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, I will
focus on what is in the Bill and the purpose of my amendment, and then
go back to some fundamental principles. Financial stability and any
objective that we set in that regard should be set by a democratic
body. In this context, that must be the Treasury, and its policies
should be answerable to the House of Commons, so the first goal is for
the Government to set out exactly how they intend to drive forward the
achievement of financial stability in this country, however defined.
That is not set out in the Bill, and my purpose in proposing the
amendment is to provoke the Government to say more about it. It would
be helpful if they defined their approach more sharply. The Bill does
not give responsibility for financial stability to the Bank; what it
actually states is that the Bank</div>
<a name="08103042000356"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;shall
contribute to protecting and enhancing the stability of the financial
systems of the United Kingdom&#148;.</div>
<a name="08103042000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is a rather
different thing, because I think that we all accept&#151;the hon.
Member for Fareham made this clear&#151;that there are a number of
potential assistants in that process. We have tended to shorthand the
text by saying that the Bank has been given that objective, but
actually that is not true. It has been given a specific contributing
function, and my task is to try to make that function more specific and
clearer.</div><a name="08103042000098"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103042000426"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Is not part of the problem that the Bank is the
only member of the tripartite with a statutory duty for financial
stability? The Bill therefore projects almost sole statutory
responsibility on to it, rather than the Bank being a contributor to
the process.</div>
<a name="08103042000099"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103042000427"></a>Mr.
Todd:</b> The hon. Gentleman is of course right, but that is
not what the Bill states.</div>
<a name="08103042000100"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103042000428"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> In fact, the hon. Member for Fareham is not quite
right. It might assist the Committee if I say that the FSA has
important objectives in relation to financial stability and the
Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, which has a direct bearing on
what we are talking about. For example, the FSA has a responsibility
for maintaining market confidence in the financial system. That, too,
is about financial stability, so it is inaccurate to say that only the
Bank of England has that duty in all the laws that impinge on the area
we are discussing.</div>
<a name="08103042000101"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103042000429"></a>Mr.
Todd:</b> But it is the only body that will be nailed with the
particular piece of jelly that we are trying to hammer to the
wall&#151;financial stability. The terminology, which the Minister
has rightly quoted, does not quite use those words. One of the
difficulties is defining what we mean. We have just had a little
exchange about the various definitions, and I accept that they vary
widely.</div>
<a name="08103042000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">The sort of
process that I am used to, if one accepts the principle that core goals
should be set by a democratically elected Government, is that the
strategy for delivering those goals is worked out between the various
participants who are supposed to deliver the objective. I think that we
would all accept that fundamentally those participants are the
tripartite authorities, but there may be other contributors to the
process. The Government must own that task, however. That is why I
attempted in my amendments to define more narrowly the role of the Bank
of England court. The Bill states&#151;indeed, it is the
Bank&#146;s current reporting 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column233" />Column number: 233</div>practice&#151;that the court determines the
Bank&#146;s strategy in that regard. I have some doubts about whether
that is right. The strategy should be set by the Government, and the
detailed mechanics of delivering it should be a matter for the
governance of the Bank. One of my amendments touches on that point.
Clarification of who leads and how to divide the responsibilities would
be
valuable.</div><a name="08103042000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
I focus on the Bill&#146;s narrow elements. We must define the
institutional structure and how it functions. I shall not repeat the
comments made by the hon. Member for Fareham, with interventions from
me, but I shall try to simplify things. One difficulty is that the
court of directors as we know it is not the court of directors to which
we may give responsibility in future. The number of members of that
court is, of course, specifically modified in the Bill, but my strong
feeling is that we shall be looking for slightly different characters
in terms not of their morals, but of their background, knowledge and
experience. One of my difficulties lies in imagining the Bill in the
hands of the people I know and encounter through my work on the
Treasury Committee, whereas the challenge is perhaps to envisage a
slightly different group of people. That leads me to believe that
without sharper knowledge of the sort of qualifications that the
individuals who will fill the seats will have, it will be hard to judge
the Government&#146;s rather uneasy compromise, which gives a
substantial role to the court of directors in that area of
policy.</div><a name="08103042000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall go into a little more detail. The court of directors, as it is
now, is in essence a non-executive body in its functions. The way in
which it is acknowledged in the annual report suggests that it performs
a more profound role, but my experience is that that does not seem to
be the reality. The Bill asks it both to determine and to review the
Bank&#146;s financial stability strategy. Although I would expect the
court, if it were primarily a non-executive body, to review the
strategy and monitor its delivery, determination of that strategy
should lie with the Treasury and the Bank&#146;s executive. Giving
that critical task to the court, chaired by a non-executive, as the
Bill explicitly requires, means that the proper function of scrutiny
and challenge is
compromised.</div><a name="08103042000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having
said that, this country is used to fudge and deals made around
personalities and the occupants of individual posts. We have tended to
do that for centuries in the role of, for example, the Lord Chancellor,
so it is not foreign to say, &#147;That may be the theoretical
position, but surely we can find another way of cracking this.&#148;
If that is our approach, I would like the Government to set out with
greater clarity how the monitoring and oversight functions are clearly
separated from the executive tasks involved in delivering what the Bill
requires of the
Bank.</div><a name="08103042000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is important for the financial stability committee to recognise that
the Bank already has governance structures for some elements. The hon.
Member for Fareham referred to the financial stability board, which
already exists in the Bank. The deputy Governor is tasked with
financial stability, so we are not talking about new tasks and
functions with which the Bank is unfamiliar. It carries out core tasks
in relation to financial stability. We can argue about whether those
tasks have always been done well, but they are explicitly recognised.
The Bank regularly publishes a financial stability report focusing on
many of the issues that we have discussed. I sense that what is
happening is an attempt to formalise 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column234" />Column number: 234</div>the financial stability board and to make it more
capable of bearing greater explicit burdens and broadening its
membership from its current, relatively narrow, base. It would be
useful to see, set out in a clearer form, the lineage from where we are
to where we seek to be.</div>
<a name="08103042000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
committee, as set out in the measure, will be a core part of the
executive team at the Bank, and there will be four non-executive
directors drawn from the court, who would normally see their core role
as challenging and monitoring the performance of the Bank&#146;s
executive. The tasks that the committee has been given are a curious
mixture. The first, in new section 2B(2)(a)&#151;</div>
<a name="08103042000357"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to make
recommendations to the court of
directors&#148;&#151;</div><a name="08103042000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">contains
an explicit relationship to the court, so that subsidiarity is
confirmed and there is a reasonably clear definition of what is
expected. However, as I pointed out in our evidence session, it is not
clear to whom the committee is answerable regarding other tasks. In
subsections (2)(b) and (c), the committee is invited to &#147;give
advice&#148; on critical issues to persons unspecified. It could be
to the court or anyone else&#151;the Treasury, the world at large or
the financial community; I do not know. The issues on which it may give
advice include</div>
<a name="08103042000358"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;whether...the
Bank should act in respect of an
institution&#148;</div><a name="08103042000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">and</div><a name="08103042000359"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;whether
and how the Bank should use stabilisation
powers&#148;.</div><a name="08103042000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
gathering of information before a critical executive decision by the
Bank is a vital part of what is in essence an executive function. To
me, that sits ill with the membership of the board that has so far been
defined.</div><a name="08103042000111"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08103042000430"></a><b class="B">Stewart
Hosie</b> (Dundee, East) (SNP): It does sit ill. The hon.
Gentleman is absolutely right about the advice being given&#151;it
might be given to the world at large, and it might be general rather
than specific. Is there not a contradiction between the possibility of
offering that sort of advice, which might be public, and the abolition
of the weekly return, thus allowing the Bank to publish only the
information that it sees fit? Is there not a contradiction between
publishing general, global advice while possibly restricting
information that might allow people to determine whether that advice is
good?</div><a name="08103042000112"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103042000431"></a>Mr.
Todd:</b> The hon. Gentleman anticipates a point that I shall
touch on&#151;the communication and public role of the body if we set
it up in the form that is being discussed.</div>
<a name="08103042000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsections
(2)(d) and (e) provide for the accepted, non-executive function of
monitoring various activities within the Bank. To be rather explicit, I
think that those matters should be carried out by non-executives. Much
though I admire the current Governor&#151;I do not wish to imply
otherwise&#151;if I were in his position, I would find it
uncomfortable to sit on a body that was monitoring the performance of
my duties if I were chairing that body when it happened. I am not sure
how I would manage a meeting of that kind if the process was genuinely
meant to be challenging and critical. The Governor is a man who might
be able to master that process, but it is certainly not one that many
people would be particularly comfortable
with.</div><a name="08103042000114"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103042000432"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> May I draw a parallel with the private sector?
Where a plc has an audit committee, the financial director would not be
a member of that audit committee to avoid the great tension to which
the hon. Gentleman referred.

<div class="Column"><a name="Column235" />Column number: 235</div><a name="08103042000115"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103042000433"></a>Mr.
Todd:</b> As was said in a quiet intervention from my right,
we are talking about a unique set of circumstances, so it is difficult
to draw comparisons. That is a fair comment. However, if we work out
the principles of the matter, it can be helpful. The hon. Gentleman is
right to say that, in a corporate environment, we would expect the
model to be one in which the executive responsible for carrying out a
function would at least not be leading the meeting that discussed
whether the person or persons had done the job
appropriately.</div><a name="08103042000373"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.45
pm</div>
<a name="08103042000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall not
press the amendments to a Division, but I want to disentangle the
process to some extent or at least encourage the Government to make
more explicit their rationale for choosing such an apparently
compromised framework to deliver the tasks. My alternative would make
clear the oversight duty of the court. It would establish the financial
stability committee not as a sub-committee of the court, but as an
entity in its own right. It would place it within the executive
framework of the Bank, correctly led in my view by the Governor. It
would add four members who are separate from the executive and not
members of the court either, and in that sense would have parallels
with the Monetary Policy Committee, as no member of the MPC is a member
of the court of the Bank of
England.</div><a name="08103042000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
proposal sets out some qualifications. I do not claim that my choice is
particularly wise, but it attempts to find some qualifications and
disqualifications in respect of the membership. Although the precise
means of the committee&#146;s operation need not be defined under the
Bill, I can see it fulfilling some functions beyond those that my
amendment structure has left from the Bill, as drafted. In response to
an earlier intervention, the Bank already publishes a financial
stability report. It is fair to say that in the evidence sessions
enjoyed by the Treasury Committee the Governor and other Bank officials
made it clear that close reading of the financial stability report
would have revealed many of the problems that have crystallised into
the crises that beset us
now.</div><a name="08103042000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
our consideration of this and other matters relating to the crisis, it
has come across quite frequently that there is a strong argument that
the communication function is critical. Some remarks made by the hon.
Member for Fareham have some resonance. It would be valuable if there
was open communication and an obligation for people to respond to it,
so that they acknowledge that warnings have been expressed and must
prepare a response that at least says, &#147;We&#146;ve heard that,
and this is our reaction, and this is how we will manage the
information that has been provided.&#148; Adding external weight to
the body that produces that communication would be helpful. Both the
line of questioning that I followed in the Treasury Committee and the
evidence that the Committee heard was that that experience needs to be
drawn from well outside these shores, too. We have much to learn from
other countries about managing financial stability. Furthermore, that
would not be a new experience for the Bank. I believe that one of the
members of the financial stability board in an ex officio role is a key
Scandinavian banker who was presumably selected by the Bank&#146;s
executive to provide exactly the sort of experience of the Scandinavian
banking crisis that would be helpful when considering some of the
complexities of both anticipating loss of financial stability and
attempting 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column236" />Column number: 236</div>to rectify the problems caused by it. Deepening the intellectual base of
the committee and the communication channels available to it are part
of what I am
proposing.</div><a name="08103042000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
we know from the activities of the MPC&#151;I touched on this during
an intervention&#151;it spends a good part of its time travelling the
country, listening to other people. The Bank has an excellent
collection of regional agents who often host functions with MPC members
so that they can listen carefully to the experience of those on the
ground in the economy. Members of the financial stability committee,
when it is established, would play a valuable role if they did
something similar. Gathering information, not merely from data in the
economy but from the anecdotes and experiences of those who are working
to deliver wealth in our country, is an important function of people
carrying out such a role. Communicating that to the outside world, not
just in a report, which I have mentioned, but in speeches is, as we
know, an important part of the MPC&#146;s work. The hon. Member for
Fareham mentioned the role of David, or Danny,
Blanchflower&#151;depending on how well people know him&#151;in
these matters. To be honest, all those involved perform that
function.</div><a name="08103042000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
will be important to have people who do not share exactly the same
intellectual leanings on the committee. Diversity of membership is a
strength and an incredibly powerful educational resource for those of
us who dip into many of these subjects. A range of experts should
approach the issues from various directions and would present
challenges, both to other parts of the intellectual community and to
those in the real economy, who are the critical determinants of whether
we will succeed or
fail.</div><a name="08103042000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
operational duties of the Bank in that respect, which are covered in
aspects of the Bill, could benefit from greater external experience and
challenge. Again, the Bill has the potential to do that. If it is
confined only to drawing from a membership who are members of the
court, it will narrow the ability to respond to that
need.</div><a name="08103042000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
further point that came up in the discussions in the Treasury Committee
is the importance of stress-testing and war-gaming in these critical
areas&#151;examining data that indicate where weaknesses might be and
positing some of the scenarios that will have to be confronted by the
various authorities involved in dealing with threats to financial
stability. Although the exact circumstances to be faced can never be
predicted, there is evidence, certainly in respect of the Northern Rock
crisis&#151;where it was obvious&#151;of inexperience in tackling
some of the functional tasks of addressing the &#147;what if&#148;
scenarios that lie before us. When discussing this subject, I am afraid
that such scenarios tend to be rather dramatic and outside our normal
experience, as we have seen. Defining some of those scenarios and
testing how we might respond to them institutionally is thus an
important function of the body we are talking about. All the things I
have mentioned are executive resources, making the Bank do its job as
an executive
better.</div><a name="08103042000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
answer the Minister&#146;s question about which model I would prefer,
I favour the more executive model. I have a pretty strong suspicion
from the evidence that we heard from the Governor that that is his
preference too. That may explain the slightly hybrid body that
confronts 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column237" />Column number: 237</div>us; it has some executive features and some
non-executive features, and it has some curtailment of members in
various respects
too.</div><a name="08103042000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
sense that what we have in these provisions is a typical compromise
that is designed to meet the rather unique circumstances. That is why I
have not gone down the route of thinking, &#147;Well, this is how we
do it in plcs, and so on&#148;. These are unique circumstances. There
is no right answer, but there may be some issues of principle that we
can get wrong.</div>
<a name="08103042000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want this
debate to be an opportunity for the Government to set out more sharply
what they are trying to do and the means that they have chosen to
achieve it, as well as the linkages to where we are now, so that we can
see more clearly the path that is being put down for
us.</div><a name="08103042000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I said, some of the frameworks already exist within the Bank; some of
the tasks are already there. Some questions remain. How do we move from
A to B? What are the underlying principles, and why have we chosen a
model that, on the face of it, does not fit the expected division of
non-executive and executive functions? The Treasury Committee was
certainly robust on that last point.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103042000434"></a>Ms
Keeble:</b> I am pleased to serve under your chairmanship,
Mr.
Gale.</div><a name="08103042000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall speak briefly. The clause goes to the heart of what many people
are looking for us to do, which is to deal with issues of financial
stability. Although the aim is not defined in the legislation, I think
that people would generally understand it to have a fairly
common-sensical meaning, in terms of their ability to feel some sense
of security about the way that the financial system is managed and its
reliability in terms of the different aspects of their lives that
depend on it. That sense of security has obviously been completely
disrupted by current circumstances.</div>
<a name="08103042000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">A few years
down the track, I am sure that people will talk about these
arrangements in the way that they now sometimes talk about the MPC;
they will ask, &#147;Why was it done this way and why wasn&#146;t
it done the other way?&#148; It is, therefore, important that we make
sure that we have got the structure right.</div>
<a name="08103042000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">It seems to
me that the kind of structure that we set for a body such as the
financial stability committee will depend on several things: its
functions, the nature of the decisions to be taken, the nature of the
tools at the committee&#146;s disposal, and the requirements of
accountability in a democratic society. That means both accountability
to Parliament and accountability to the public, including the duty to
explain, which has been a key, and successful, part of the MPC&#146;s
role. Both the hon. Members who have spoken mentioned
that.</div><a name="08103042000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
choice in terms of models was clearly presented by the hon. Member for
Fareham. Should it be an executive-style structure like the MPC, or a
sub-committee? Despite the fact that there is a slight hybrid nature,
it is basically a sub-committee. Personally, I think that is the right
way to go.</div>
<a name="08103042000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am using
the MPC as a frame of reference for my comments, because discussions
about the MPC are the kind of discussions that people have more
generally. Part of the MPC&#146;s success is that it has become
established and people talk about it quite widely. People say,
&#147;If the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column238" />Column number: 238</div>MPC can fix inflation, why can&#146;t we have something similar to fix
financial stability?&#148; That is a very crude argument.</div>
<a name="08103042000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">The MPC has
been successful because it has a clear policy framework set by
Parliament; in other words, it deals with the accountability issue.
That gives it a very sharp focus for its work, which is about inflation
and the clear targets around 2 per
cent.</div>
<a name="08103042000374"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2
pm</div><a name="08103042000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
MPC also has a lever&#151;interest rates&#151;to which my hon.
Friend the Member for South Derbyshire referred. Its members explain
well that they have a clear job to do: they have one lever, and after
taking a huge amount of information and discussing it, they must decide
how to pull it. They have been phenomenally successful in doing that,
but it is worth considering now that the issue of public credibility is
at stake. Inflation figures are exactly what the public recognise as
being inflation nowadays, and the lever seems to have lost some of its
effectiveness because of what is happening with interest rates.
Although the committee has been successful, we must be cautious about
saying, &#147;Because it has worked for that, it can work for other
things.&#148; One cannot simply adopt a structure&#151;even a
successful one&#151;and expect it to work in perpetuity. Whether the
MPC should be able to take wider economic circumstances into account
when considering interest rate decisions will, I am sure, become a
major issue. It has been discussed in the Treasury Committee, and I
think that it will become a wider public concern in months to
come.</div>
<a name="08103042000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">When we look
at financial stability, we can draw contrasts and look at why a
structure such as that set out in the Bill will probably be more
effective. This is a considerable beefing up of current structures to
do with financial stability, and it has a sharper focus. Under the Bank
of England Act 1998, financial stability is the responsibility of the
tripartite authorities and of one of the deputy governors. The Bill
represents a clearer, sharper focus on what has become the dominant,
economic financial issue of our time. That is welcome, and I would not
downgrade it.</div>
<a name="08103042000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
financial stability is not as clear a matter as controlling inflation
or setting interest rates&#151;it is a completely different sort of
event and decision. Although the structure might seem quite woolly, an
enormous range of different materials and issues must be looked at
before the pertinent ones can be picked out and fed into the process,
as set out in the list of functions.</div>
<a name="08103042000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps I can
illustrate that. I happen to have the financial stability report and
the executive summary. It is a wonderful document&#151;an eight-page
guide to the collapse of capitalism. At one point it gives a guide to
what happened. It has little graphs too&#151;it is like a comic strip
for financial fundies. It says that concern
was</div><a name="08103042000360"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;heightened
by severe institutional distress, including at Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac
and Lehman Brothers in the United States, Bradford &amp; Bingley in the
United Kingdom and Hypo Real Estate in
Germany.&#148;</div><a name="08103042000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is not confined only to one country, it is a global event. However much
the Bank of England might like to control the world economy, it is not
quite there yet.</div>
<a name="08103042000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">The document
also mentions the nature of the decisions that might have to be taken
and notes the Government-supported recapitalisation of the banking
systems. If 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column239" />Column number: 239</div>large amounts of taxpayers&#146; money are going
to be spent on recapitalising the banks, Parliament should have
something to say about it&#151;among other things&#151;including
about the terms, and including the type of questions we heard at
Treasury questions today.</div>
<a name="08103042000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">The model of
the MPC has been extraordinarily successful. The MPC has taken
decisions about interest rates independently of political influence and
has actually served us phenomenally well, but one cannot then say to
the Bank of England, &#147;You take the decisions about financial
stability and we&#146;ll just sit back and let it happen.&#148;
That is a bit of a crude, over-the-top way of putting
it&#151;</div><a name="08103042000141"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103042000435"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> It is a
bit.</div><a name="08103042000142"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103042000436"></a>Ms
Keeble:</b> Yes, but the type of decisions that might have to
be taken to deal with a crisis, such as the one we have had, cannot be
delegated. There should be a much closer relationship with the
institutions of the state, which is what we have got in the structure
set down in the
Bill.</div><a name="08103042000143"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103042000437"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> The hon. Lady makes a powerful point. She said in
her opening remarks that we need to think about the tools that are
available. Perhaps an alternative way of looking at the role of the
financial stability committee is to say, &#147;These are the tools
that are available to that committee.&#148; Clearly, we are not going
to give the financial stability committee the power to commit
taxpayers&#146; money to bailing out banks and recapitalisation. It
does not have those tools, so the task is actually to have a
tools-based approach to developing the remit of the FSC and what its
objectives should
be.</div><a name="08103042000144"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103042000438"></a>Ms
Keeble:</b> There may well be some issues that it will have to
consider as a sub-committee, and I am sure it will want to work out
some tools and some ways forward. At this stage, when do not have a
clear definition&#151;although we have a common-sense
understanding&#151;and when we are looking at what is frankly still
an emerging phenomenon in the international financial markets and world
economy, I do not want to say that this whole area, which is key to
political decision making and to how the international community works,
will be put at arm&#146;s length in the way in which interest rates
have successfully been. If there were one lever that could work in
relation to international financial stability, we might want to use
that, give it a tight policy remit and say, &#147;We don&#146;t
want it to go above or below a certain level,&#148; and set that out.
The conceptual tools simply are not there and, in those terms, it is
right to have a substantial sub-committee set up in this way, with a
remit to deal with the matter, a reporting line and a much sharper
focus. I certainly accept that the structures we had previously did not
serve us well. The warning signs might have been there, but no one saw
them. Action was not taken until the crisis started to ripple through
from some of the financial institutions and the United
States.</div><a name="08103042000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
think that we have the right structure here. It might not be the
world&#146;s most wonderful structure, but it is the right one for
the present circumstances. It will be bolstered by the increasing focus
on financial stability and the increasing pressure that I am sure there
will be from Parliament and elsewhere to make sure that the structure
delivers and that if there are warning signs, they are seen and acted
on.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103042000439"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> I shall start by acknowledging your presence in the
Chair this afternoon, Mr. Gale. It is a pleasure to see you
there&#151;I am saying that somewhat belatedly, I know, because we
have had quite a long debate. I shall deal with the earlier point of
order because I have an update that the Committee might wish to hear.
The code of practice has been prepared and will be on letter boards by
the time the Committee adjourns this afternoon. That is something for
everyone in the room to look forward to, as long as they get down to
the letter board before it closes. We all know what we will be doing
this weekend.</div>
<a name="08103042000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have had
an interesting debate, which is clearly indicated by the number of
amendments tabled to the clause. The clause deals with the nub of the
issue in part 7 on the correct and appropriate structure of
the new arrangements for financial stability, the new duties the Bill
gives the Bank of England in that respect, and how they should be
fulfilled. The hon. Member for Fareham, quite properly, identified two
different approaches and is agnostic about which is the best one, so we
have had a debate about it. My hon. Friend the Member for South
Derbyshire expressed a more definitive view that there should be a more
executive approach. My hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, North
said that we have got it about right. Naturally, as I am here to
explain the Government&#146;s thinking on the model we have set out
in the Bill, I think that we have got it about right and hope that I
will be able to persuade and reassure those who are dubious about it
during the course of my remarks both on clause stand part and on the
amendments.</div>
<a name="08103042000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">It might be
helpful if I briefly set out the Government&#146;s approach and the
purpose and thinking encompassed in clause 216. Clearly, the aim is to
strengthen and formalise the Bank of England&#146;s role in relation
to financial stability. As all the hon. Members who have contributed to
the debate this morning and this afternoon have said, the Bank already
plays a key role in supporting financial stability, but unlike its role
in monetary policy, it does not currently have a clear statutory
responsibility to support financial stability.</div>
<a name="08103042000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
therefore formalising what has been informal in the past. In doing so,
we have to plump for a model, rather than continue the informal
arrangements that have always been in place. Perhaps that is where all
the different models have come from. It is proper that people should
think through how those models are formulated and the potential issues
with them. The Government have proposed the model set out in new
section 2A(1) of the 1998 Act, which gives the Bank of England a
statutory objective</div>
<a name="08103042000361"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to contribute
to protecting and enhancing the stability of the financial system of
the United Kingdom&#148;.</div>
<a name="08103042000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.
Friend the Member for South Derbyshire astutely noticed the use of the
phrase &#147;to contribute to&#148; as the way of expressing the
Bank&#146;s duties. That phrase reflects the fact that the Bank does
not have a duty to ensure financial stability on its own, because that
would be impossible. That responsibility is shared nationally with the
FSA and HM Treasury and internationally with the European Union and
other international bodies, which all have a major role to play,
alongside market participants themselves.</div>
<a name="08103042000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">Financial
stability cannot simply be guaranteed on a national basis like an
interest rate. The interest rate either is or is not at a certain
level, like a price, but 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column241" />Column number: 241</div>financial stability is a much more complex concept
to grab hold of, and what is important for delivery might shift over
time as the institutional framework shifts and as markets and market
participants evolve. It is therefore a moving target and a complex
matter to deal with. It is important that we bear that in mind when
considering the institutional approach that the Government suggest in
the
Bill.</div><a name="08103042000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are clarifying the Bank of England&#146;s position by setting out an
objective in legislation. That has been widely supported by respondents
to our public consultations and by the Treasury Committee, even if it
did not quite go along with the model that the Government decided to
put forward in the
Bill.</div><a name="08103042000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
section 2A(2) sets out that the strategy that the Bank will follow to
fulfil its new objective will be set by the Bank&#146;s court of
directors, consulting with the Treasury, and on the recommendation of
the new financial stability committee, as set out in new section
2B(2)(a). It is right that the court, as the body with the ultimate
responsibility for the Bank&#146;s affairs, has the final say on
setting the financial stability strategy.</div>
<a name="08103042000375"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.15
pm</div><a name="08103042000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause will also create a new financial stability committee, as
outlined by various hon. Members who have contributed their views on
the model, as a sub-committee of the court of directors. The committee
will further strengthen the Bank&#146;s framework by directing and
supervising the Bank&#146;s functions in relation to financial
stability and by providing expert support. The committee will be
chaired&#151;this has been the subject of comment, which I shall deal
with when I come to the subsequent amendments&#151;by the Governor of
the Bank of England, when present, and other membership will consist of
the two deputy governors and four directors of the court, who will be
appointed by the chair of the court of directors. Those external,
non-executive directors will bring valuable and relevant expertise to
bear on the Bank&#146;s decision making in the area of financial
stability, and they will ensure that the Bank commands authority and
credibility in discharging its new financial stability
objective.</div><a name="08103042000155"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103042000440"></a>Mr.
Todd:</b> I do not know how to put this, but the current
membership of the court might not necessarily provide the depth of
experience that my hon. Friend appears to seek in filling those four
positions. Am I to understand that the process may entail a complete
replacement of the court with a new&#151;reduced&#151;membership,
or will there be some continuity for the current
membership?</div>
<a name="08103042000156"></a>

Eagle:</b><b class="B"> </b>The Bill makes provision in later clauses
for a reduction in the court&#146;s size, in part to acknowledge some
of the structural changes that we are dealing with. The idea is that
when the Bill becomes law, the terms of all current court members who
are appointed will lapse and there will be a reappointment process. The
reappointment process at that stage will consider the appropriate
balance of expertise and presence for the new smaller court. Although
all current outside members of the court will have their membership
terminated, it does not mean that they will not be reconsidered for
appointment. However, the entire process will take place in the new
context, without having to think about transitions. I hope that that
reassures my hon. Friend.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column242" />Column number: 242</div><a name="08103042000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
naming non-executive members of the committee, it will be vital to
maintain a balance between ensuring that they have relevant expertise
and experience of financial markets, and avoiding damaging conflicts of
interest, which is why the Bill imposes the same restraints on members
of the proposed financial stability committee as already exist for
current members of the court. They must declare any direct or indirect
interest in any dealing or business that could potentially produce a
conflict. If the financial stability committee considers that a
conflict of interest could occur, the member will have no influence or
vote on those
matters.</div><a name="08103042000158"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103042000442"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> It is right that the Government will ensure that
the people on the committee do not have a conflict of interest, but I
wonder how challenging that is to deliver in practice. Given the
interconnected nature of the financial services sector, the Chancellor,
or whoever selects the court members, will have to be very careful not
to appoint someone who has directorships across a range of City
institutions and is an active participant in the market, as they could
be excluded under the clause. The alternative is somebody who has
recently retired and has no interests, but whose market knowledge is
not as fresh as it might be. How will the Chancellor, in appointing
court members, to deal with that, particularly given the reduction in
the court&#146;s size from 16 members to
nine?</div>
<a name="08103042000159"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103042000443"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> The hon. Gentleman rightly identifies some of the
issues that need to be balanced when deciding who to appoint. They are
not new issues for the court, however, because this part of the Bill
ensures that the financial stability committee itself comes under the
same regime that has worked successfully for the court of directors in
the past. He rightly points out that there is always a balance between
having those with enough up-to-date knowledge and savvy experience of
markets to be able to contribute and avoiding those who have so many
conflicts of interest that they have to leave the room for every
meeting. That balance will have to be borne in mind when the
appointments are made. I do not pretend that it will be easy, but those
matters will be in the Chancellor&#146;s mind when he makes those
decisions.</div>
<a name="08103042000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">As set out in
new section 2B(3), a Treasury representative and others may attend the
committee but they will have no say in decisions. The Bill also
provides the Bank with additional policy levers by which it can
contribute to financial stability. There was talk about a lack of
tools, but hon. Members recognised that the earlier part of the Bill,
which we shall start to discuss next week, puts other tools at the
Bank&#146;s disposal to contribute to financial stability, in
particular its key role in the implementation of the special resolution
regime and oversight of inter-bank payment
systems.</div><a name="08103042000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
functions of the financial stability committee, which are set out in
new section 2B(2), reflect the committee&#146;s role in advising on
and monitoring the Bank&#146;s use of the new tools for maintaining
financial stability. The committee will make representations to the
court on the nature and implementation of the Bank&#146;s financial
stability strategy. The court will then be able to delegate further
functions to the financial stability committee, if necessary.</div>
<a name="08103042000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">I believe
that the clause establishes a coherent model for the financial
stability committee&#146;s form and functions. Clearly that is why it
is in encompassed in the clause. We 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column243" />Column number: 243</div>have debated at some length a range of amendments
which seek to change in various ways the settlement of the structure
that is outlined in the clause. The hon. Member for Fareham talked
about hybridity, as he put it, and wondered whether we should have gone
for a pure executive committee or a pure committee of non-executives.
Decisions on financial stability may have to be taken extremely swiftly
in fast changing circumstances. It may be difficult to ensure that a
committee could meet with the urgency and frequency that the use of the
special resolution tools would require, which tends to militate against
a purely non-executive
committee.</div><a name="08103042000163"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103042000444"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> May I draw the Minister&#146;s attention to new
section 2B(2)(b)? It states that one of the FSC&#146;s functions will
be</div><a name="08103042000362"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to
give advice about whether and how the Bank should act in respect of an
institution, where the issue appears to the Committee to be relevant to
the Financial Stability
Objective&#148;.</div><a name="08103042000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
decision may have to be taken quite quickly, but we are to have a
committee that will give advice on how the Bank should act. In a way
that new section demonstrates part of the problem: by the time the
committee talks about a particular institution it may be too late. It
may take too long to get the committee together to talk about how it
might approach a particular
institution.</div><a name="08103042000165"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103042000445"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> Obviously, the financial stability
committee&#146;s work will relate to a range of work that the
tripartite system itself, in all of its forms, will be doing to monitor
the circumstances of the market. For example, although we do not
discuss it in the clause, the FSA has the duty to monitor particularly
important market participants on an ongoing basis. I do not anticipate
that a problem that serious would suddenly emerge and would not have
been tracked earlier as a potential risk. I do not envisage a problem
with getting monitoring and advice in a space of time that was too
short to draw together the members of the financial stability
committee&#151;</div><a name="08103042000166"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103042000446"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> It could make a
decision.</div><a name="08103042000167"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103042000447"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> Let me come to that. The hon. Gentleman referred to
the &#147;hybridity&#148; of the proposed model when expressing his
worry that perhaps we had not picked the right one. As I understand it,
he was getting at the hybridity between an executive committee, such as
the Monetary Policy Committee, and a scrutiny committee. The former has
been used as a model by both the hon. Gentleman and my hon. Friend the
Member for South Derbyshire and is clearly supported by the Treasury
Committee in its report, and the latter is the model that we are all
familiar
with.</div><a name="08103042000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
membership of the financial stability committee, as suggested in clause
216, reflects its functions. It is important to ensure that the
committee is set up in a way that best enables it to fulfil its
functions, rather than to compare it with very different committees. I
agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, North that the
Monetary Policy Committee is not a model on which to base the financial
stability committee, simply because the FSC&#146;s job is very
different from and more complex and more difficult than the
nevertheless important one of the MPC&#151;deciding on the price of
money, as reflected in an interest rate decision. The
FSC&#146;s functions as set out in the Bill and
as reflected in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column244" />Column number: 244</div>its membership are primarily advisory, but they are also supported by
monitoring functions. However, that does not mean that the committee
should be constituted of only non-executive
members.</div><a name="08103042000169"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103042000448"></a>Mr.
Todd:</b> I have already hinted that it is not explicitly
stated to whom the committee gives advice, whereas it is clear that the
recommendation should go to the court. The Bill is silent on who will
receive the committee&#146;s
advice.</div><a name="08103042000170"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103042000449"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> That is not because we do not have a view on who
should receive the advice. It is not always the case that everything
about the operation of committees is necessarily set out in primary
legislation.</div><a name="08103042000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
a day-to-day basis, the financial stability committee will advise the
Bank&#146;s executives, because it is they who will often need to
make decisions on how to deal with individual institutions, in perhaps
fast-moving conditions. The Governor and his executives derive their
authority from the court: they have delegated responsibility from the
court and are ultimately accountable to it. That will be consistent
with the strategy that the court of directors has agreed for fulfilling
the financial stability objective, and it will be the court that holds
executives and the committee to account for supporting it in meeting
that objective.</div>
<a name="08103042000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some
decisions relating to financial stability will need to be taken by the
court of directors, particularly the setting of the financial stability
strategy. On some occasions a sub-committee will advise the court. The
approach is context-specific, and it sits better in practice than in
primary legislation. I hope that that gives my hon. Friend a view of
what was in our mind when we plumped for this
structure.</div><a name="08103042000376"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.30
pm</div><a name="08103042000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
model provides the best of both worlds; it allows executives and
non-executives to come together to discuss, debate and advise on
issues, including crucial decisions regarding banks and the operation
of the special resolution regime. In designing the financial stability
committee, the priorities of the Government have been to provide the
Bank with a single source of co-ordinated expertise and advice; to
monitor its functions and actions in relation to financial stability;
to ensure that the Bank&#146;s executives can take timely and
informed decisions to safeguard financial stability in fast-moving
situations; and to draw clear lines of accountability from the
executive and from the financial stability committee to the
Bank&#146;s governing body. The model that we are proposing will
allow us to achieve those
objectives.</div><a name="08103042000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">By
establishing the financial stability committee as a sub-committee of
the court, we integrate it into the existing governance structure
rather than tearing it up and starting again. That helps to ensure that
the financial stability committee will be central to the Bank&#146;s
decision making on financial stability. The non-executive members of
the committee will provide vital expertise on financial stability,
while the executive members on the committee, including the Governor as
chair, will mean that the committee will be close enough to the action
to be able to give informed advice, often in fast-moving
situations.</div><a name="08103042000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is right that the Bank&#146;s executive takes the lead in operational
decisions, taking expert advice from the financial stability committee,
where possible. It would not be realistic to expect a committee
including the  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column245" />Column number: 245</div>expertise of non-executives to meet with the frequency that may be
required for decisions in fast-moving emergency
situations.</div><a name="08103042000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that that approach at least explains the thinking behind the
model, hybrid or otherwise, that the Government have set out in clause
216 and I hope that it explains why we ask that all the amendments,
from amendment No. 58 to No. 63, not be moved or that they be voted
against.</div><a name="08103042000177"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103042000455"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. For the benefit of the Committee, the
procedure is that only the lead amendment is moved; the others are
moved formally in due course, if necessary. So the hon. Gentleman does
not have to withdraw his amendments, if that is what he was about to
do.</div><a name="08103042000183"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103042000456"></a>Mr.
Todd:</b> Then I will explain why I will not move them, if
that is the case. The nub of this is a very English model, which will
greatly depend on the people who are appointed to the functions set
down in the Bill; it does not have the intellectual coherence that I
would like, but it may well work, and that is what we tend to do in
this country. On that basis, I will not move my
amendments.</div><a name="08103042000184"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103042000457"></a>Mr.

intervention I can come back and make a longer intervention in answer

Eagle:</b> Thank you, Mr. Gale; we got there in the
end. Again, my apologies for not covering this point
directly.</div><a name="08103042000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
debate featured just a sprinkling of the many different definitions of
financial stability that the Treasury Committee managed to uncover in
its hearings that various people, not only from the UK but from all
around the world, have come up with. The one that Nigel Jenkinson
quoted and the one that was quoted earlier from the Governor of the
Bank is perhaps as good as any. The fact that there are so many
definitions and they all differ slightly bears upon why there is no
direct definition of financial stability in the Bill in primary
legislation. We know it when we see it. In fact, some of the
definitions are of financial instability rather than stability. It is
interesting to note that Nigel Jenkinson in his evidence at the
beginning of this Committee&#146;s proceedings
said:</div><a name="08103042000363"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I
do not personally think that it is necessary to have a definition of
financial stability in the Bill. We produce regular
reports&#148;.<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report, Banking

Friend the Member for Northampton, North quoted some of them, as did
the hon. Member for Fareham.</div>
<a name="08103042000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">Financial
stability is context-specific with a very broad definition that can
change quickly. We felt that it was such a moving target and so
context-specific that it would not fit easily in the Bill. The Bank, of
course, will have to agree its financial stability strategy with the
Treasury and we have every confidence that it will do so appropriately,
drawing on all the available international and academic sources. It has
the capacity to call in people to advise it on that subject. Rather
than have an awkward and rigid definition of financial stability in the
Bill, we felt that this would be the more appropriate and future-proof
way of dealing with it. I hope that helps the hon.
Gentleman.</div><a name="08103042000194"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103042000464"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103042000466"></a>Mr.

for Northampton, North gently chastised us for using the Monetary
Policy Committee as a model for this but I would point out that her
right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer
said:</div><a name="08103042000364"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We

<a name="08103042000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">The present

situation.&#148;</div><a name="08103042000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
just shows that, even over the course of six or seven weeks, the
Treasury&#146;s own view of this had evolved. We will see how
effective it is in practice. While not necessarily coming back to look
at legislation, I suspect that people will pore over the practice of
how the Bank of England

have to see how this works and think about the context. We are in
difficult waters at the moment trying to work out the right

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103042000467"></a>Mr.

clause 216, page 103, line 43, at
end insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(6) Proceedings
of the Committee shall be made public in good time unless disclosure of
the proceedings would result in a threat to financial
stability.&#146;.</div><a name="08103042000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
goes back to how we hold the committee to account. Without wishing to
test your patience, Mr. Gale, the comparison is with the
MPC, which produces minutes on a monthly basis. They shine a light on
how the MPC operates, and its thought processes and deliberations. That
is exactly the point where there is a parting of the ways between the
MPC and the financial stability committee, and how we expect them to
work. From the discussions that we have had and on the basis of the
remit of the financial stability committee, particularly when it gets
down to institutional level, we know that specific data or information
about particular institutions will be discussed, and we need to be
careful about how that is
disclosed.</div><a name="08103042000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">At
the same time, there will be more generic debates about risks and how
the Bank responds to them, and how it exercises its functions under
part 5 to oversee inter-bank payment systems. As there will be
legitimate public interest in those matters, I tabled this probing
amendment to understand from the Minister how she would expect the Bank
to report and make known the operations of the
committee.</div><a name="08103042000204"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103042000468"></a>Mr.
Breed:</b> The debate on the last set of amendments was
useful, and I think that to come to no overall conclusion after two and
a half hours of discussion is probably about
right.</div><a name="08103042000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">Comparison
was made with the MPC. One of the great principles of the MPC is that
it publishes its findings, albeit some weeks later, which give some
reasonable idea of its operation. The amendment seems entirely
appropriate, in the sense that if we are to make such comparisons and
try to get to that, it would be appropriate for the financial stability
committee to publish its proceedings as well. Of course, the sting in
the tail is that that could create the financial instability that the
financial stability committee is supposed to address. It would torpedo
itself.</div><a name="08103042000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am not entirely convinced by all of this. The situation that pertained
at one time was that the central bank&#151;the Bank of
England&#151;was charged with responsibility for financial stability,
had a deputy governor in charge of it, and had it on the agenda of the
court on a fairly regular basis, yet we are now supposedly to have an
independent Bank of England, and we are telling it how it should carry
out that function. I am happy that we will support the
proposal.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column248" />Column number: 248</div><a name="08103042000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
we are to understand whether the financial stability committee is
working, its proceedings will have to be published; otherwise, all of
what we have done or are trying to do will be to very little point. I
expect that, inevitably, there will be confidentiality in respect of
some aspects of the committee&#146;s proceedings, and it might be
right for those aspects not to be published, but on the whole it would
be appropriate to publish the proceedings. I support the

issues are different from monetary policy issues, and said that owing

amendment No.

on Second Reading, the financial stability committee&#146;s
deliberations will be made public, although not immediately. The hon.

Hoban:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for those comments;
she makes some valid points. My only comment is about the
timing&#151;the delay between meetings and the publication of
minutes. If a pattern is established of the minutes being published on
the last day of every month but suddenly they are delayed by six weeks,
that would trigger concern about financial stability in the market. We
need to be clear about frequency, timing and the expectations of the
markets of how the information will be disclosed. However, I beg to ask

2003 the Governor has delegated the chairmanship of court to one of the
non-executive directors. This change formalises in legislation what has
been practice since 2003. It is a sensible provision, which formalises
the Bank&#146;s current practice and is fully supported by the Bank

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103042000475"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> The amendments refer to the tenure of the Governor
of the Bank of England. The clause limits how many terms the Governor
can serve&#151;he can serve no more than two terms. It is the view of
my party that those arrangements work against the perception of the
Governor of the Bank of England as independent. The fact that the
Governor has to be&#151;can be&#151;reappointed could create in the
minds of observers some doubt as to whether he is independent of the
Chancellor. The Governor may wish to be reappointed, and there may be a
sense that he tempers his decisions so as to improve the chances of his
reappointment. To be absolutely clear, I do not believe that that has
occurred so far, but there is potential for that risk in the
future.</div><a name="08103042000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
a consequence, on several occasions we have proposed that the Governor
should serve a single, non-renewable term of eight years. That is in
line with the term served by the governor of the European Central Bank,
who serves a single eight-year term. Such a provision would enhance
people&#146;s view of the independence of the Governor. Other
processes too could be used to strengthen the independence of
appointments, to ensure, for example, that the process is open and
transparent. There have been cases in the past where appointments to
the MPC have not been made openly and transparently; we think that that
should change. The Chancellor of the Exchequer has recognised that in
connection with other appointments to the MPC.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column250" />Column number: 250</div><a name="08103042000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">We also felt
that, when it comes to the reappointment of the current Governor, at
the time of the current period of financial instability, there could be
a concern that the Governor may have been put under pressure, because
he was awaiting reappointment. It would be better to have much greater
clarification about Governor status than is the case at the moment,
where it is possible for the Governor to be appointed for a second
term. We therefore believe that a longer single term is in the wider
interests of the Bank of England and of ensuring that the Governor is
seen to be independent of the Treasury.</div>
<a name="08103042000228"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103042000476"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> In considering the amendments, it might help if I
explain some of the context of clause 221 as it currently
stands. In his letter to the Treasury Committee of 19 June 2008, the
Chancellor set out his plans to strengthen the procedure for future
appointments to key roles in the Bank and the Monetary Policy
Committee. These measures include limiting external appointments made
by the Government to the Monetary Policy Committee to a maximum of two
terms, and limiting the Governor and deputy governors to serving a
maximum of two five-year terms in a particular
post.</div><a name="08103042000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">While
not captured in the legislation before us, the Chancellor also
announced that in future, vacancies for Governor and deputy governor
and external Monetary Policy Committee appointments would be openly
advertised and be conducted in a way consistent with the principles of
open competition. With respect to the tenure of the Governor, which
these amendments seek to change, the current five-year term for the
Governor and deputy governor was set at the time of nationalisation in
1946 and has proved itself perfectly effective ever since.</div>
<a name="08103042000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">Turning to
the specific amendments, we believe that having a maximum of two
five-year terms in office offers a strong balance between certainty and
continuity on the one hand, and flexibility on the other. A five-year
term for the Governor, with the possibility of a second term, gives
that individual a natural break point at which they can consider
whether they wish to continue in the role. It also gives them something
to work towards and provides an opportunity to consider their
performance. In contrast, a single eight-year term might actually
discourage some strong candidates from applying, as they do not feel
that they can make such a long commitment. It might also increase the
likelihood that a Governor would step down mid-term, potentially
creating uncertainty and speculation in the financial markets. It is
for those reasons that the Government oppose amendments Nos. 65 to 67.
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will recognise that there are arguments
on this side, as well as his own advocacy for a longer term, and he
should take them seriously when considering whether he wishes to press
the amendment to a
vote.</div><a name="08103042000231"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103042000477"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I do not intend to press the amendment to a vote,
but not because I have been persuaded by the Minister&#146;s
argument&#151;far from it. However, we shall live to fight this
battle another day. With that, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103042000478"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> The clause removes the requirement established by
the Bank Charter Act 1844 that the Bank of England must produce a
weekly return of accounts. My understanding is that, following the
passage of this change, the Bank will be able to determine whether, and
in what form, it produces a return.</div>
<a name="08103042000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
understanding is that the genesis of this change was the debate that
took place around Northern Rock last year. There was some debate about
whether Northern Rock could have been saved if there had been a less
transparent process. A great deal of that argument rested on the market
abuse directive, whether a consortium of banks could pull together to
buy Northern Rock, and a whole host of arguments around that. That is
not necessarily germane to the amendment, but one argument made at the
time was that the Bank of England&#146;s weekly return would disclose
financial assistance given to a bank, which might trigger awareness in
the market of a bank receiving financial support. Hon. Members may
recollect that it was the Governor&#146;s announcement that Northern
Rock was in receipt of support from the Bank of England as a lender of
last resort that triggered the run on the
bank.</div><a name="08103042000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government consultation response stated that there had been support for
the change, but the summary of consultation responses suggests that
very few people responded to the proposal to withdraw the weekly
return. Can the Minister elaborate on what the alternative mechanism
for reporting the Bank of England&#146;s assets and liabilities might
be? Is there widespread support for it? It appears to have generated
relatively little interest in the
consultation.</div>
<a name="08103042000239"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103042000479"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> The clause removes the requirement, established in
the 1844 Act, on the Bank of England to produce a weekly return of
accounts. That requirement has since been overtaken by other elements
of transparency, but it has remained and the Bank has always done it,
with nobody realising that it might cause a problem until recent
events, as the hon. Member for Fareham pointed
out.</div><a name="08103042000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
removing the requirement, the clause removes the legal obligation that
could give rise to unnecessary early disclosure of liquidity support. I
want to reiterate that the Government have a strong commitment to
transparency and believe that the free and effective flow of
information is vital, both to a functioning market and to the trust
placed in public institutions. In periods of high market stress, as we
have been experiencing recently, there may be circumstances where
immediate disclosure of liquidity support is in no one&#146;s best
interests. The clause allows the Bank to delay the disclosure of
liquidity assistance.</div>
<a name="08103042000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
operates together with clause 230, &#147;Registration of
charges&#148;, to remove provisions that may require premature
disclosure of liquidity assistance by the Bank of England. Clause 223
addresses disclosure from the Bank, while clause 230 addresses
disclosure from the recipient institution. The Bank of England weekly
return is a short weekly statement of accounts. It has ceased to be
needed as a record of the Bank&#146;s 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column252" />Column number: 252</div>activities since other instruments, including an
annual statement of accounts, have superseded it. The Bank also remains
subject to normal Office for National Statistics and Companies Act
reporting
requirements.</div><a name="08103042000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
publication of a weekly return is not only unnecessary, but potentially
damaging. Analysts have been monitoring the return to detect changes in
the Bank of England&#146;s capital position that may indicate that
liquidity assistance has been provided to a market participant. In the
case of Northern Rock, for example, analysts studied the return in an
attempt to determine the amount of liquidity support drawn down.
Members will be aware that early disclosure of liquidity assistance of
that kind can be deeply damaging, and can potentially lead to runs on a
bank or a serious effect on market sentiment. The clause, therefore,
addresses one avenue of such early disclosure, which is a reasonable
and proportionate
step.</div><a name="08103042000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">Members
will rightly wish to know for how long the Government expect the Bank
of England to limit disclosure of liquidity assistance. The Government
have been consistently of the view that it is neither right nor
practicably possible to restrict disclosure over anything other than
the short term; Members raised that point during the Second Reading
debate. The Government do not expect the Bank to keep liquidity support
covert permanently or for any substantial period. However, it is
possible to delay disclosure, and that could make a significant
difference to the effectiveness of liquidity assistance. The clause
takes an important step in working to achieve that.</div>
<a name="08103042000346"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent">Members
will understand that it is not possible for the Government to indicate
any precise time frame for the period under which restriction of
liquidity support will be kept covert&#151;to do so in advance is
necessarily arbitrary, and could also be counter-productive in that it
would invite analysts to continue intensive scrutiny after whatever
period the Government had
announced.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103042000480"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I understand the arguments why we should not
disclose the level of covert support as it would not then be covert.
However, there are systems such as the special liquidity scheme, which
is not a covert mechanism for support and is currently disclosed on the
weekly return. That is a legitimate form of liquidity support. If the
weekly return is suspended and there is no commitment to regular
publication of a similar summary, I am not sure how the Bank and
Treasury can be held accountable by Parliament for the amounts that
they deploy through the special liquidity scheme. Can the Minister
tease out or separate the covert from the overt support that the Bank
might offer?</div>
<a name="08103042000245"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103042000481"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> It is difficult to be precise. If we were to move
from a weekly to a fortnightly report, some of the problems that
occurred with Northern Rock might reassert themselves. The Bank has to
report, quite rightly, on an annual basis, and there is a bi-annual
report on financial stability and monetary policy. Those are standard
ONS reporting requirements and include issues of money supply and other
areas for national statistics.</div>
<a name="08103042000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
difficulty, which I think the hon. Gentleman appreciated by the way
that he asked the question, is that if the Government changed the
weekly report to a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column253" />Column number: 253</div>fortnightly one, it still might not deal with a
particular context. Liquidity support that was essential to prop up an
institution in trouble might be revealed earlier in a way that did
damage.</div>
<a name="08103042000247"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103042000482"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Is there not an alternative way of looking at the
matter? In preparation for the debate, I had a quick look at a weekly
report; in effect, it is the balance sheet of two notional departments
in the Bank and a consolidation. It would be possible to produce a
report that was not a balance sheet and did not require full
disclosure, yet set out the normal forms of support that the Bank could
offer an entity without having to reveal any covert support. By
changing the published information, we could get round the issue of
disclosing covert support, while still allowing the Bank to be
accountable for the overt support it gives.</div>
<a name="08103042000248"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103042000483"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> The hon. Gentleman is right&#151;it is a balance
sheet. I, too, had a look at one before attending the Committee. I
understand his point. The clause abolishes a requirement to publish a
weekly return that dates from 1844, when the consequences for Northern
Rock of doing so were probably not in the minds of those who
legislated. Everybody agrees that premature revelations about liquidity
support are damaging to financial stability and should be avoided.
Clause 223 will remove that absolute requirement&#151;dating from 160
years ago&#151;to produce a weekly report. That will no longer
apply.</div>
<a name="08103042000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">We still
expect the Bank to publish such returns as it considers appropriate. It
will decide how to shift from the old rigid system of doing so
weekly&#151;for no reason other than that it has done so since
1844&#151;to another process that we hope will prevent premature
revelations about liquidity support that might damage financial
stability. That is the context for the switch that the Government
suggest in this clause and clause 230.</div>
<a name="08103042000250"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103042000484"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> The Minister and I are in agreement about the need
to move away from where the Bank has been in the past. We are moving
from a situation where data are transparent, to one where we do not
know what the replacement for that obligation will be. Can the Minister
say whether the Bank will have set out its alternative reporting
arrangements by the time the Bill gets to the other place? I know that
she does not speak for the Bank, but she can see the point I am trying
to make.</div>
<a name="08103042000251"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103042000485"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> I cannot speak for the Bank directly and make an
operational decision, but I have made it clear that it is important
that the Bank is transparent about its activities, except in the
unusual circumstances when premature revelations about liquidity
support would actually damage everyone. I have also made it clear that
the usual reporting arrangements and expectations in respect of the
annual report, the returns to the ONS for its often monthly statistics
and the bi-annual financial stability report are still made public. It
is for the Bank to decide how to move from an old rigid system to a new
system, and avoid the potential offered in the weekly return for
premature revelations about liquidity support that are
damaging.</div><a name="08103042000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand what the hon. Gentleman is trying to get at. The Bill will
make clear how it is intended to proceed in due course, but I cannot
promise&#151;since it is not in my gift&#151;that the Bank will
have made that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column254" />Column number: 254</div>decision by the time the House of Lords considers the Bill. I hope that
he will accept that no attempt is being made to take away transparency
or to hide things for any longer than is necessary to protect financial
stability in a particular instance. He raised the issue that brought

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103042000486"></a>Angela

clause 224, page 106, line 27, at
end insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">&#145;(c) an
authority in a country or territory outside the United Kingdom which
exercises functions similar to those of the Treasury, the Bank of
England or the Financial Services Authority in relation to financial
stability;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">(d) the European
Central
Bank.&#146;.</div><a name="08103042000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment strengthens clause 224 by permitting the Bank of England to
share information related to financial stability with overseas
partners, as well as with other members of the tripartite. It is right
and proper that the Bank of England should have expanded powers to
share information both across the tripartite and with overseas
partners, when
appropriate.</div><a name="08103042000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amended clause would enable the Bank to share relevant information that
it has received in relation to its financial stability functions.
Typically, the Bank of England receives information from the FSA, which
it can share among the tripartite. However, it is possible that the
Bank might receive information from other sources, such as an
institution administered under the special resolution regime or from
other institutions that may approach the Bank
directly.</div><a name="08103042000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">At
present, when the Bank of England has received confidential information
from a third party, it may not be able to share it. In an emergency,
under current rules it might face uncertainty about precisely which
information it can legally share with other authorities. Clause 224
takes away that difficulty by enabling the Bank of England to share any
information that it has received with other authorities. That removes
any complexity or uncertainty that might arise in fast-moving
situations and will enable the authorities to act more effectively in
an
emergency.</div><a name="08103042000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment builds on the clause by enabling the Bank of England to share
such information as it deems fit with overseas agencies that perform
functions similar to that of the Bank, the Treasury and the Financial
Services Authority. In a globally connected world where the financial
marketplace is interconnected, the United Kingdom needs to be able to
co-operate and share information effectively with other jurisdictions,
particularly in the case of concerns about large cross-border firms. I
can assure members of the Committee that there is no intention that the
power should be used lightly by the Bank of England, or that it would
disclose information unless it was necessary. However, it is
appropriate that the Bank of England should have the power to share
information on major issues of financial stability with our overseas
partners.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103042000487"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I want to ask the Minister two questions. Is there
a parallel ability for the FSA to share information with comparable
overseas institutions? Given that there is a lot of discussion about
colleges of regulators supervising individual institutions, and bearing
in mind her reassurance that such information will not be transferred
lightly, how will that reassurance work with the prospect of much more
information sharing through colleges of
regulators?</div><a name="08103042000261"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103042000488"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> Obviously, it is in the UK&#146;s interest that
there is full international co-operation on financial stability, and I
suspect that we are just at the beginning of a process that will
strengthen arrangements globally to ensure that that happens,
particularly when a firm of systemic importance to the UK is
internationally interconnected.</div>
<a name="08103042000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
important for us to be able to inform overseas partners so that
regulators can co-operate in managing the difficulties associated with
the firm in question. It is desirable that other regulators and central
banks reciprocate. The UK authorities maintain excellent relationships
with key counterparts overseas. The colleges of regulators, which the
hon. Gentleman mentioned, are an evolving example of the strengthening
of that reciprocal relationship.</div>
<a name="08103042000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman asked whether the FSA can share information. Yes, the
Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 includes the power for the FSA
to share information with overseas regulators within limits set by the
Treasury. That all helps to enable regulators to pick up systemic
problems, particularly in firms that are globally present,
interconnected and of systemic importance in the UK or
elsewhere.</div><a name="08103042000264"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment

permission</div><a name="08103042000267"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103042000489"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 9, in
clause 226, page 106, line 39, after
&#145;person&#146;, insert</div>
<a name="08103062000006"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#145;, in connection with the exercise
of functions by any person under the Banking Act
2008,&#146;.</div><a name="08103042000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause is the first of three clauses relating to the powers of the FSA.
It affects the powers that the FSA can use under section 45(1)(c) of
the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. Under that Act the FSA can
use powers on its own initiative to vary the permission relating to the
regulated activities that an authorised person may have permission to
undertake. The own initiative variation of permission&#151;often
known as OIVOP&#151;gives the FSA the power to restrict what an
authorised person can
do.</div><a name="08103042000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
concern is that the power in the clause seems rather broad. I assume
that the power can be used only in the context of decisions or actions
taken under the Bill, but the clause is not written in that way. It is
not as narrowly defined as that. Can the Minister reassure the
Committee that the OIVOP power will be used by the FSA only when it
relates to powers exercised under the
Bill?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column256" />Column number: 256</div><a name="08103042000270"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103042000490"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> The amendment undermines the effect of clause 226,
which is to clarify the provisions of section 45(1)(c) of the Financial
Services and Markets Act 2000. The clause is technical in nature and is
designed purely to clarify existing legislation. It is expressly
drafted to clarify the provisions laid out in the Financial Services
and Markets Act. By restricting the provisions of clause 226 to the
Banking Bill, the amendment would render the clause meaningless. It may
be useful to clarify the intent of the clause as it
stands.</div><a name="08103042000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">Section
45 of the Financial Services and Markets Act gives the FSA power to
vary or cancel on its initiative a commission it has granted to allow
the carrying out of regulated activities. The power to vary permission,
in effect to stop firms carrying out particular activities, is a core
power of the FSA and the Government want to ensure that there is
clarity about how it is
used.</div><a name="08103042000379"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.15
pm</div><a name="08103042000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">Section
45 allows the FSA to exercise its power in a number of circumstances,
such as when the person with permission is failing or is likely to fail
to satisfy the threshold conditions or has failed within the last
12 months to carry out the activity to which the permission
relates. Section 45 also allows the FSA to exercise that power where
desirable in order to protect the interests of consumers or potential
consumers. In the Financial Services and Markets Act a reference to
consumers usually means consumers generally, not just those of a
particular firm, so this is the better interpretation of section 45.
Recent events have shown that we need to consider the interests of
consumers generally, not only on a firm-by-firm basis, so clause 226
will amend section 45 to make it clear beyond any doubt that
the reference to consumers includes consumers generally.</div>
<a name="08103042000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">The proposed
amendment, by making the clause refer only to duties under the Banking
Bill, would effectively disapply it in many circumstances and in a way
that leaves the FSA&#146;s decision-making process more complex and
cumbersome. I hope that, with that explanation, the Opposition will not
press the amendment to a
vote.</div><a name="08103042000274"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103042000491"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for that explanation.
One of the general concerns that has been expressed about the Bill is
that it is here to address a particular issue in the banking system and
the recent problems. We are speeding its passage through the House and
the other place on the basis that it is a very focused Bill aimed at
tackling problems in the banking system. My concern with clause 226 is
that its scope goes beyond the banking system and that it is
effectively being used to satisfy a legislative wish list in that
respect, and that is not the purpose of the Bill. I am concerned about
the Minister&#146;s explanation because I think that the
clause&#146;s scope is rather broader than we were initially led to
believe, and that is also causing concern outside the House. I do not
propose at this stage to press the
amendment.</div>
<a name="08103042000275"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103042000492"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> I emphasise again that the clause is designed
purely to clarify the existing Financial Services and Markets Act on
the basis of the way that it is usually interpreted and to create
certainty. That also has a bearing on potential systemic risk and
relates to the effectiveness of regulation, which does bear on what 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column257" />Column number: 257</div>we are talking about. This is not an extension of power, but a
clarification that will make it clear beyond doubt that the powers
actively used by the FSA and laid out in the Financial Services and
Markets Act are being used as they were intended to be. It removes a
bit of legal uncertainty, but it does not change current
practice.</div><a name="08103042000276"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103042000493"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I will have to think about that because I am not
sure. I cite the concern that has been voiced over the past couple of
weeks that legislation can occasionally be accelerated through the
parliamentary process because it is there to tackle a specific threat,
but that the powers in it can be used to tackle a broader issue. In the
freezing of the assets of Landsbanki, the powers were exercised under
the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001. That Bill had been
accelerated through the House on the basis that it was tackling
terrorism, not to seize the assets of friendly NATO allies. I just want
to flag up that concern. We are helping the Bill through and would not
want to see our willingness to accelerate the process taken advantage
of. Although I will not press the amendment, we might return to that
issue at a later stage. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="08103042000277"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103042000494"></a>Mr.
Breed:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 11, in
clause 228, page 107, line 28, leave
out &#145;or in any other
way&#146;.</div><a name="08103042000281"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
suppose that my concerns about the clause are similar to those
expressed by the hon. Member for Fareham about the previous clause, in
the sense that I seek only to remove the last five words from the
clause. The FSA should, quite rightly, have powers to collect and share
information. Those functions are clearly set out in section 165
of the Financial Services and Markets Act.</div>
<a name="08103042000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

serve two purposes. The first is to undermine the basis of the original
authority of the Financial Services and Markets Act. The clause might
just as well say that the FSA can perform its function in any way that
it likes without any reference to the Act. The second is to provide
legislative cover for any actions that might be considered
inappropriate. That justifies the means by the ends. Hence, the assets
of Landsbanki were seized under terrorism
legislation.</div><a name="08103042000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
gathering of information from individuals in their homes or places of
work in any way, at any time of the day or night and in any
circumstances, such as breaking into premises, can all be justified by
this legislation. I can see people shaking their heads. We have had a
simple respect for Government, but far too often we have received
assurances that legislation will never be used in such ways.
Regrettably, that was said in the context of animal welfare and
inspectors have totally misused the powers that were
granted.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103042000496"></a>Mr.
Breed:</b> In a moment. While I will not press the amendment
to a vote, I think it right to raise these issues. The Minister thinks
she need merely say that of course the FSA will not carry out illegal
acts in the future. There is no evidence from the FSA that the current
powers for it to perform its function under the Financial Services and
Markets Act have been restrictive, have stopped it obtaining the
information it requires or have stopped it from sharing information.
There is no evidence that it requires any such use of the
words</div><a name="08103042000367"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;or
in any other
way&#148;.</div><a name="08103042000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">Frankly,
unless the Minister explains to the Committee exactly why this power is
needed or how the FSA has been restricted by the Financial Services and
Markets Act, she will have to justify it to the House if the matter is
raised at a later
stage.</div><a name="08103042000288"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103042000497"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> I wanted the hon. Gentleman to give way earlier
because he seemed to be suggesting that the FSA is somehow plotting to
break into premises to gather information. It has perfectly legal ways
of gathering information and does not need to resort to break-ins or
illegal acts. I hope that he will realise that these measures are about
trying to do things legally, not illegally. The FSA is a regulator. A
few weeks ago, people were condemning it for not being effective enough
in its regulation. He is now worried that it will resort to illegal
break-ins to gather information.</div>
<a name="08103042000289"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103042000498"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103042000499"></a>Angela

will give way to
him.</div><a name="08103042000291"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103042000501"></a>Mr.
Breed:</b> Such means of gathering information will not be
illegal if we pass this measure. That is the problem. They may well be
illegal at present, but in justifying them with the words &#147;in
any other way&#148;, such acts will be perfectly
legal.</div><a name="08103042000293"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103042000502"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> The hon. Gentleman must have had rather a long day
because there is no way that &#147;in any other way&#148; means a
whole load of illegal ways. I can reassure him about that. The
standards of behaviour that are legal and are expected of public bodies
do not extend to criminal acts. I hope that that reassures
him.</div><a name="08103042000294"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause will place a duty on the FSA to collect information relating to
financial stability. Giving it that duty will be to the benefit of us
all. We are not giving it that duty because it likes to collect
information, but for a particular point to do with the public good.
Subsection (2) confirms that the FSA may perform its function by using
its information-gathering power as in section 165 of the Financial
Services and Markets Act 2000, or in any other way. By removing the
words</div>
<a name="08103042000368"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;or in any other
way&#148;,</div>
<a name="08103042000295"></a><div class="hs_Para">the amendment would
substantially reduce the range of tools available to the FSA for
collecting information on financial stability. As the reference to
section 165&#151;&#147;Authority&#146;s power to require
information&#148;&#151;illustrates, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column259" />Column number: 259</div>the FSA has the power to gather information and this
clause ensures that formal powers can be used to gather information on
financial
stability.</div><a name="08103042000296"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
other ways in which the FSA might gather information include general
rules, which could be made under section 138 of the 2000 Act, requiring
reporting by all firms on particular issues&#151;in this case
financial stability&#151;and direct requests to individual firms for
specific information. Firms will tend to comply because of their duties
of general compliance under principle 11 of the Financial Services and
Markets Act handbook. Other tools include section 166 of the 200
Act&#151;&#147;Reports by skilled persons&#148;&#151;and
section 167&#151;&#147;Appointment of persons to carry out general
investigations&#148;.</div><a name="08103042000297"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

<a name="08103042000369"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;or in any other
way&#148;</div>
<a name="08103042000298"></a><div class="hs_Para">do not create
unfettered powers for the gathering of information by the FSA; they
merely indicate that the FSA is not required to use section 165; it
could use one of the means that I have just mentioned, or it could rely
on its good relations with the companies that it regulates, in that
they would provide information voluntarily. I am pleased to reassure
the hon. Gentleman that criminal acts will not be
involved.</div><a name="08103042000299"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment would have the unfortunate effect of limiting the
FSA&#146;s powers to gather information on financial stability to its
formal ones. Cutting off all those other avenues would significantly
reduce the FSA&#146;s powers in that regard. The authority would be
constrained in its ability to collect both general and specific
information. It would not be able to make specific requests for
individual items, or make rules on general reporting. In drafting
clause 228, the Government had in mind that the FSA&#146;s ability to
collect information on financial stability should be no less than its
ability to collect other information in pursuit of its general
functions. The amendment would undermine that
intent.</div><a name="08103042000300"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that I have reassured the Committee that the words &#147;in any
other way&#148; do not imply unfettered powers. They do not give the
FSA total power to gather information. Any information that the FSA
might gather under the clause would be collected with due regard to the
principles of proportionality under which the authority operates, and
under the constraints imposed on all public bodies by criminal law. I
would expect the FSA to work constructively with the companies that
it regulates in gathering the information. I hope that I have
reassured the hon. Gentleman that the amendment is not needed and that
it would be detrimental if it were to be in the
Bill.</div><a name="08103042000301"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103042000503"></a>Mr.
Breed:</b> I am not in any way persuaded&#151;in fact, just
the reverse. No evidence has been given that the FSA has been
restricted by its current ability to secure information. I see no
reason why it should be given extended powers by the use of those
words. I should like to press the amendment to a

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103042000514"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I have a quick question for the Minister. The
matter was covered in the Banking (Special Provisions) Act 2008, but it
is covered in this Bill
too.</div><a name="08103042000319"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
building societies are limited in the amount of wholesale funding that
they can use. It was 50 per cent., although the Bill sponsored by my
hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, West (Sir John Butterfill)
provided for that to be increased to 75 per cent. I think that the
Banking (Special Provisions) Act said that financial assistance, where
given, should be disregarded for the purposes of calculating the 50 per
cent. limit. Is that still the case in this
Bill?</div><a name="08103042000320"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103042000515"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> The clause provides powers for the Treasury to
amend the Building Societies Act 1986, as the hon. Gentleman rightly
pointed out. The purpose of such an amendment would be for building
societies to access financial assistance from central banks or the
Treasury on the same basis as banks. The Building Societies Act
includes a number of provisions that could restrict the ability of
societies to accept emergency lending from central banks or the
Treasury.</div><a name="08103042000321"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
particular, building societies are currently prohibited from granting
floating charges under section 9B of the Act. When seeking emergency
liquidity assistance, financial institutions may have to grant floating
charges over their assets, to provide sufficient security to a central
bank. The Bank of England would typically want to take and rely on
higher-quality collateral, except in urgent or unusual cases, and it is
likely to insist on title transfer collateral or fixed charges over
defined assets. However, in those urgent or unusual cases, it is
important that building societies are also able to offer a floating
charge, as a bank can. The fact that building societies cannot grant
such floating charges means that they are disadvantaged in comparison
with banks when seeking emergency liquidity support. There are two
possible implications. The first option could be that the Bank of
England could offer liquidity assistance without taking any charge,
which would leave the Bank exposed to a lack of security. The
alternative is that the Bank of England may not feel able to offer
liquidity support if it is unable to gain sufficient collateral. Both
outcomes are highly
undesirable.</div><a name="08103042000322"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
prohibition on the granting of floating charges is one of a number of
provisions of the 1986 Act that could prevent effective financial
assistance. Other important 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column261" />Column number: 261</div>provisions that might need to be modified for this
purpose include lending limits, funding limits and provisions
concerning what has to be in the memorandum of the rules of a society.
Such provisions remain appropriate in most normal circumstances. The
Government support a strong and vibrant building society sector,
separate and distinct from the banking sector, but with regards to the
provision of liquidity assistance, the legislation currently creates
anomalies with potentially serious consequences. The Bank of England
and other central banks, including the European Central Bank, and the
Treasury where appropriate, must be free to provide emergency support
to banks and building societies on an equal basis. That is what the
clause brings
about.</div><a name="08103042000323"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman asked about percentage limits. I need to write to him

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103042000516"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> When the Paulson plan was going through the US
Congress, I read with considerable amusement about the number of things
covered by the plan, including excise duties and the importation of
wooden bows and arrows. One assumes that that sort of thing would not
happen in the UK, but clauses 231 and 232 seem to have little bearing
on a Bill that is designed to increase financial stability in the
banking sector. I said in connection with clause 226 that we are
encouraging the Bill to go through at speed, because it aims to tackle
the current financial crisis, but I wonder what role the &#147;Funds
attached rule (Scotland)&#148; and &#147;Financial collateral
arrangements&#148; play in supporting progress in the banking
sector.</div><a name="08103042000329"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103042000517"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. The hon. Gentleman referred to clause
232. He has asked the same question of both clauses. I am perfectly
happy for the Committee to take both of them together if that is
convenient.</div>
<a name="08103042000330"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103042000518"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> I have to admit that the hon. Gentleman probably
has a point with respect to the clause on Scottish cheques. It was
originally unsuccessfully introduced as a private Member&#146;s Bill
in 1999. It is a deregulatory clause which modernises the treatment of
cheques in Scotland and aligns their treatment with the rest of the UK.
The abolition of the &#147;funds attached&#148; rule will mean that
if several cheques are presented simultaneously when there are
insufficient funds to satisfy all of them, the bank will choose which
it can satisfy from the funds available. That could be done in a way
that would do the least damage to the interests of the customer of the
bank while also ensuring that some creditors receive payment. The
current legislation is outdated and can cause problems with the smooth
running of financial transactions by causing delay, expense and
inconvenience for banks and their customers.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column262" />Column number: 262</div><a name="08103042000331"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Committee
of Scottish Clearing Bankers estimated in 1999 that the &#147;funds
attached&#148; rule causes expense and inconvenience for
approximately 100,000 bank customers each year. It was also estimated
in 1999 that the retention of the &#147;funds attached&#148; rule
causes Scottish clearing banks an administrative expense of
&#163;270,000 a year. The hon. Gentleman is right about clause 231.
It is a deregulatory clause that accomplishes something that many
people have wanted. It is not controversial. It is within the scope of
the Bill. That is why it is here, but for me to stand here and say that
it has a major bearing on financial stability would probably be pushing
it a bit, if I could put it that way. It is something that many people
have wanted. It benefits consumers in Scotland. It irons out a little
kink in the law. That is why it is here in this part of the Bill. I put
my hands up, but it is still a reasonable thing to
do.</div><a name="08103042000332"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103042000519"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> It is neither relevant nor controversial. That is
absolutely right. I hope that whoever championed the private
Member&#146;s Bill in 1999 will get satisfaction from seeing this
clause in the Bill. I return to the point that I made earlier. While
this may not be an area of huge controversy, I suspect that clause 226
was probably more controversial. I do not think it appropriate to use
the Bill in this way to tidy up an unsuccessful private Member&#146;s
Bill. Someone missed out on the opportunity to get a gift in the next
ballot for private Members&#146; Bills in the next Session. I am not
going to press the matter to a
vote.</div><a name="08103042000333"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103042000520"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Why is this in the
Bill?</div>
<a name="08103042000337"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103042000521"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> I should like to take a little time to explain
that. The clause enables the Government to make future regulations
relating to financial collateral, which is a key underpinning of modern
financial markets. It is a way to allow collateral takers to borrow at
more advantageous rates than otherwise and is a key risk management
tool in credit risk. That is why it is relevant.</div>
<a name="08103042000338"></a><div class="hs_Para">The power is
retrospective as regards the current scope of the regime. This is a
contingency measure in the light of a potential legal challenge to the
power to make existing regulations. It is a retrospective power that
could not be used outside the current scope of regulations other than
to provide for matters following from a situation where the existing
regulations were to be quashed. This is a relevant piece of activity
which relates directly to financial collateral which underpins modern
financial markets, so it is an important aspect of what we are
discussing
today.</div><a name="08103042000339"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103042000522"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> As I understand the numbering system used by the
EU, the directive is from 2002. Why has it taken the Government until
2008 to get round to thinking about introducing a power under
it?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column263" />Column number: 263</div><a name="08103042000340"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08103042000523"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> I cannot answer that question as I have not been
involved in this area since 2002. I can tell the
hon. Gentleman, however, that clause 232 provides the power to make
future regulations relating to financial collateral. That is an
important aspect of underpinning markets and has to do with stability
and current UK financial collateral regimes. A threatened court case
does have some implications, but this is a key updating part of
underpinning assumptions. A question about whether the understanding
behind those assumptions was ultra vires was taken to court. It would
have been  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column264" />Column number: 264</div>very threatening had that been found to be the case, but this puts the
issue beyond doubt.</div>
