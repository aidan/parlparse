<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Department of Trade and Industry (Mr. Ian McCartney):</B> I beg to move amendment No. 49, in page 26, line 4, leave out from `apply' to end of line 5.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendment No. 50.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> On behalf of all members of the Committee, I commiserate with my hon. Friend the Member for Stevenage (Barbara Follett). I saw the goals through bleary eyes last night and I suggest that the first goal was perhaps rather unfortunate. However, I heard the hon. Member for Buckingham (Mr. Bercow) say that the club made &#163;600,000 profit--that would probably bring it within the ambit of the Bill. It could then afford to pay its striker, although he will probably be signed up by Newcastle for a fat fee. I hope that my hon. Friend does not feel too bad today.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The Minister may be assured that the Chairman feels rather cheered up.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I was going to ingratiate myself with you, Mr. Atkinson, because matters will arise later on which I will need your good grace, so I wish you well. The question of whether your team will get any further in the competition is up for grabs. I say that as a supporter of Manchester United--that is a little secret that has slipped out.
<P>
The amendment does not alter the effect of the clause: prison workers in Great Britain and Northern Ireland are excluded from the Bill if they are working under prison rules. The amendment simply removes unnecessary wording in the reference to the prison regime in Northern Ireland.
<P>
The clause as it stands refers to particular circumstances in relation to institutions other than prisons in Northern Ireland--namely young offenders centres and remand centres--but our advice is that no specific reference to those places is needed for Northern Ireland in either the definition of ``prison'' or in subsection (2) (c), which defines prison rules. That is because young offenders centres are already covered by virtue of section 20 (2) of the Interpretation Act 1978, which means that any reference to the prison rules made under section 13 of the Prison Act (Northern Ireland) 1953 is extended by section 2 of the Treatment of Offenders Act (Northern Ireland) 1968, which includes young offenders centres. There are no remand centres in Northern Ireland.
<P>
I therefore urge the committee to support the Government in deleting the unnecessary words.Mr. Tim Boswell (Daventry): I join the Minister in commiserating with the hon. Member for Stevenage and I also empathise with her because my team was defeated in the premiership by the same team at the weekend. To throughly ingratiate myself with you, Mr. Atkinson, I say that we admire your team's performance and look forward to its future success.
<P>
We begin on a comparatively light note but on a serious topic. The Minister may rest assured that I do not intend to advise my colleagues to oppose the amendments or the clause. This is the right course of action in relation to prisoners, but it is right that we should spend a few moments discussing prison work.
<P>
I shall confine my remarks at this stage to the amendment and invite the Minister to widen the definition of who is and who is not a prisoner. The notes on clauses make the position clear on this matter, but I should like the Minister to clarify it further. I hasten to say that I am not trying to patronise him without at least patronising myself. To borrow a military analogy--we will discuss the military later--we are all conscious that we are operating out of area. When I was a Minister, briefs from other Departments on subjects with which one was inevitably not deeply familiar were always difficult. I doubt whether the Minister of State and I are entirely au fait with prisons legislation of the prison rules, but the notes on clauses are helpful. I want to be sure that the coverage is appropriate, not overkill, and does not leave any gaps.
<P>
I want to be clear about young offenders centres, not least because the Prison Act 1952 refers to superseded institutions such as borstals. There is no adult prison in my constituency, but there is a young offenders centre--I have a particular interest in a certain aspect of them. The amendment, which also relates to Northern Ireland, means that young offenders will be included because they fall under the prison rules, though perhaps not in the same way as adult prisoners.
<P>
I take it from the notes on clauses that remand prisoners will be included if their work falls within the prison rules. One or two points could be a touch awkward. I should like the Minister to say where we stand, or the Home Office could write to us on the matter. The notes on clauses refer to prisoners who are sent out into the community to undertake normal employment as part of the transition to ex-prison life. We are not arguing about the regime, but would the national minimum wage apply in such circumstances? Are there any wrinkles or anomalies as between types of prisoner?
<P>
I am more concerned about temporary absence. A prisoner working for the day on a farm is subject to the prison rules, but there could be--it is sometimes suggested that there should be--regimes where prisoners are confined for the weekend and released into the working world during the week, not necessarily near the end of their sentence but as part of the normal routine. If that practice were adopted under the prison rules, would such prisoners come under the national minimum wage provisions and be exempt from exclusion? The Minister needs to address the point, because some temporary absences might be part of a planned regime. If prisoners are working properly, there is no reason to exclude them from the national minimum wage.
<P>
Parole prisoners must also be considered, but young persons in secure training centres will not be included because they are too young to qualify for the national minimum wage. We want to get this right. Prisoners usually undertake organised community work under a community service order and receive no remuneration, but I am anxious that we should create no artificial anomalies.
<P>
I give the Minister a fair wind on the amendments, which he explained perfectly well. It would, however, be helpful if he addressed himself to potential pitfalls or mismatches in the coverage.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for his perceptive questions. I will give him a full explanation, which I hope will be sufficient to answer them; if not, I will give a commitment to write to members of the Committee if they so desire.
<P>
I am not a lawyer or a legal brain, but my street perception of the definition of a prisoner is that it means somebody who has been banged up by the old beak--that is the best description. That person remains a prisoner until he is released on parole at the end of his sentence or until he wins an appeal.
<P>
On the question of whether young offenders centres in England are covered, the answer is yes.
<P>
The clause excludes prisoners in custody, including those on remand, from entitlement to the minimum wage. Again, I am not a lawyer, but my view is that a person who is on remand is being detained by a court, which has good reasons for doing so. He is, therefore, in custody and is covered by the rules of the prison regime.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman's other questions come within the ambit of the issue of prisoners who work in the community, and I hope that I will be able to answer them. Most prisoners earn small amounts and are required under prison rules to work, on average, for &#163;15, although some earn up to &#163;30.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> A week.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> A week. Most work is provided in the prison. Some prisons operate regimes that allow prisoners nearing the end of long sentences to work outside in the community to help their resettlement and contribute to an offending-free future. The numbers involved are small--we are talking about 500 prisoners at most, out of a population of 63,500. Only 22 prisons out of the total estate of 135 operate release schemes. Most schemes do not involve real work, but work placements and voluntary and community work that come under prison rules. Some specialist resettlement centres, such as Latchmere House in Richmond, send out as many as 100 prisoners from a population of 193. Others send out between three and four at any one time.
<P>
Prisons have to get work where they can. In remote areas where work opportunities are scarce, prisoners often have to undertake outside work of a community or voluntary nature. In other cases, prisoners obtain normal jobs from outside employers for standard wages and operate under prison rules. Such prisoners will get the rate for the job. That small group of people is covered by the national minimum wage.
<P>
I think that I have answered the hon. Gentleman's points about young offenders, the definition of prisoners, who carries out community work and whether they are covered by the prison rules.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The Minister is indeed doing his best on those points, but I still have some reservations. Will he confirm that prisoners who are not sentenced but who are under community service orders are not covered by the Bill. Equally, will he confirm that they receive no remuneration? The Minister shakes his head; I think that he is confirming that they are not covered. As I understand it, those prisoners would not normally be paid anyway.
<P>
I do not require an answer to my next question now, but perhaps the Minister will discuss it with his colleagues and send us a note to clarify the position. Can he tell us of any change in prison regimes that would produce an in-and-out situation, in which a prisoner would be confined in the prison for a period, but would work all or part of a working week? My question is not an attempt to entrap the Minister; it simply draws attention to a potential development for which we need to cater in the Bill. Conservative Members have no problem with the principle or the amendments.

<P>

<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> Perhaps we should clarify the situation because I am not sure whether the hon. Gentleman was talking about convicted prisoners who get community work, not a custodial sentence. I am not sure whether he was confusing them with prisoners who simply do community work. I said clearly that prisoners usually do community work under prison rules, and will therefore be excluded. A small number of people are potentially covered by the minimum wage because they work in a normal situation with a normal working arrangement with an employer and are paid the rate for the job.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I probably did not make myself clear. The matter is separate from the in-and-out situations, about which I am still not clear. I was asking the Minister about convicted persons who have not yet been given a custodial sentence, but who have been required to do community work. They will not be covered by prison rules and, ipso facto, they will not be exempted from the national minimum wage under the clause, although the terms of their community service order may well require them to work for nothing.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I shall write to the hon. Gentleman about the matter. Without looking at my officials, my commonsense view of the matter is that that community work is imposed instead of a custodial sentence. Therefore, that service is due entirely to conviction and to being found guilty of committing an offence. The court does not impose a work situation upon the person involved, but imposes a service to the community that is based on his or her criminal activity. It is treated as such, as part of a programme of rehabilitation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> This is my last intervention. The Minister is speaking along the right lines. I am slightly anxious, for example, that if such people were to receive expenses or another form of remuneration, they could accidentally be drawn into the remit of the national minimum wage, which is not meant to apply to them. The matter is not quite clear to me, but I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will reflect on it.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I shall do so.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Amendment made: No. 50, in page 26, line 12, leave out from `1953' to end of line 15.--[Mr. Ian McCartney.]
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I shall be brief. I wish to obtain only a brief response from the Minister.
<P>
My mind goes back to remarks made by the hon. Member for Wentworth (Mr. Healey) in the Committee's long debates on training. The credibility and work of adult trainees were discussed. The hon. Gentleman made his point eloquently. Without condoning what convicted prisoners have done, which is not the subject of the debate, it is as least worth testing the Minister's mind about why the Government have not chosen an alternative approach. I am not canvassing one, but the point is worth being considered by the Committee for a moment.
<P>
A regime could exist in which prisoners would be paid what the Minister called, in shorthand, the rate for the job, which would fall under the national minimum wage. It could be felt that such prisoners should not end up pocketing that money, because of the substantial costs that they had inflicted on society--prisons are a very expensive way of giving them board and lodging, and custodial sentences should, if possible, be avoided. The Minister would, I think, share that view. A charge could claw back some of the money, and effectively nullify the advantage.
<P>
I am not canvassing that idea, because it is probably better to exclude such people from the benefits--as the Minister sees them--of the national minimum wage, as the Bill does. Given the principle of universality that the Government are broadly but not completely embracing, such a regime could have been created. It could have reflected positively the contribution of work to prisoner rehabilitation.
<P>
I also take the view, from what I have seen in young offenders institutions, that although work regimes are not always as constructive as they might be, a lot of effort has been put in by prison staff to try to make them more constructive and more fruitful. It would be possible to build up prisoners by paying the wage and then clawing it back so that they did not profit from their own wrong, to use a lawyer's phrase--it could be argued that that would be slightly more transparent. It also ties in with my final point.
<P>
Prison work is always a sensitive area because of competition with and the potential undercutting of other private sector or public sector providers--people are not being fully remunerated for work done at the margins and for a different purpose from that of ordinary commercial work. In certain contexts, a provision of prison workers will be remunerated with significantly less than other workers in the private sector or outside the prison, who will be subject to the national minimum wage. Has the Minister considered whether the measure will create any greater strains or inconsistencies, whereby prisoners subject to prison rules and not therefore availing themselves of the national minimum wage will be able to undercut other workers and the national minimum wage will be able to undercut other workers and the businesses that depend on them? Mr. McCartney: The general issue is not really for consideration under the Bill. It is about the Government's conduct towards the Prison Service and its management, and the access of those who are detained at Her Majesty's pleasure to employment, education and training. It is not justifiable for prisoners to have the right to the national minimum wage. They have forfeited that right, among others, because of their criminal activity. It is right that society shows its disapproval and seeks atonement.
<P>
However, rehabilitation should be part of a prison sentence and that should include varied work, training and education. There must be safeguards against the exploitation of prisoners or using them to undercut companies in the labour market. That is what the prison rules are about. The Home Secretary also has responsibility to determine through regulation the rates of payment to prisoners. They are not wages in the normal sense, but a contribution for work that is done under prison rules. Such payment also assists in terms of their board and lodgings. They do not, therefore, need the protection of the national minimum wage. We felt that this was the simplest way of dealing with the matter.
<P>
I said in our previous discussion that there is a long-standing, all-party arrangement for a certain, very small, number of prisoners--a small minority of the potential total of 500 who are working outside prison at any one time--to work under a proper contractual arrangement between them and an employer and to receive appropriate wages for that. We do not want to disturb that arrangement and we are therefore catering for it. When the hon. Gentleman mentioned that, I said that I would write to him.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman mentioned exploitation. The Home Office has recently been in discussion with ICL, about a work initiative in prison. If work is given to the Prison Service, ICL has undertaken to ensure a non-exploitative working arrangement, in terms of quality of training and education and of payments received by the Prison Service via the Home Office. I hope that that helps the hon. Member for Daventry.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Just to put it on record, the Minister has given us a particularly helpful response. The purpose of our exchanges, particularly those regarding the amendment, was to test the Government's thinking, not to subvert it. There is a common view that this is probably the simplest approach, and we are all reassured by what the Minister said and by his undertaking to clear up the details in correspondence.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before we begin the debate on the next group of amendments, I should like to remind the Committee that, although the lead amendment in the group is to clause 33, a number of them relate to clause 34.
<P>
If, after the debate on this group, it appears that the principle of clause 34 and any related matters have been adequately discussed, I shall put forthwith the question on clause 34 stand part when we reach it, although there will be one more amendment and one more clause to dispose of before them.

<P>

<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I propose to speak to the Government amendments, which are consequential, after discussing Government new clause 9.
<P>
The Government's aim has always been that the national minimum wage should apply to all workers. Our decision to exempt the armed forces from the Bill, which is the subject of new clause 9, does not undermine that. Nor will the armed forces be disadvantaged by comparison with civilians. We have remained true to our aim, unlike the Conservative party.
<P>
As I reflected on Tuesday's proceedings, I was reminded that the hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) had referred to the old joke about military orders: an order is followed by a counter-order which is followed by disorder. The hon. Gentleman said that the Government's decision was probably taken for good military reasons. On the same day, the right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) bemoaned the exemption of troops from the Bill on News Direct Radio. He said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``I find it stunning. Why exempt the forces?''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He commented to The Indepedent:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Why is Tommy not worth the minimum wage?''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He indicated to the Press Association his displeasure about the fact that elite troops have been exempted from the minimum wage. The head of the shadow trade and industry team obviously did not know that his hon. Friends the Members for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond) and for Daventry had tabled amendments to exempt troops. I knew that we would catch somebody--I shall give way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Lansley </B>(South Cambridgeshire): Is the Minister saying that Conservative Members have been saying two different things when he has been saying two contradictory things in Committee?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I shall deal with that comment by quoting a headline from the Cambridge Evening News:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Too tired to legislate, claims MP''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He was obviously sleeping when I made my last remark.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I commend the Minister of State for learning at least one basic military tactic: he is laying a smokescreen by suggesting that there is a fog of war over a major retreat by the Government. The Opposition's duty is to probe the Government's intentions and to discover whether those intentions are as uniquely consistent as the Government claim.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> After 10 years in opposition, I had been dragooned into guerilla tactics in Committee. The hon. Gentleman tries his best, but the truth is that his boss, the former Secretary of State for Wales and current shadow Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, the right hon. Member for Wokingham, got it hopelessly wrong. He wants troops to remain within the Bill, but his Front-Bench colleague wants them out. The Government's position is consistent; the inconsistency comes from the hon. Gentleman. Without over-using the military metaphor, he has shot himself in the foot.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Bercow </B>(Buckingham): Does the Minister not realise that my right hon. Friend the shadow President of the Board of Trade was not arguing that members of the armed forces should be paid the minimum wage? He was asking why, if they are not paid it, should not all sorts of other people be excluded from the provisions of this absurd legislation. Why has the Minister not grasped that?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> The hon. Gentleman will not like my saying so, but he is an old-fashioned spin doctor--he has just put a spin on the facts. He is hopelessly wrong. Conservative Members need to go and have a caucus meeting and return when they have decided their policy. We can then discuss it.
<P>
We have gone out of our way to include diverse groups in the Bill and have built into it flexible provisions to accommodate the particular circumstances of certain groups, such as homeworkers, agency workers, agricultural workers and, in clause 34, the armed forces.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The flexibility that we have provided for the armed forces is centred on the need not to disturb their operational effectiveness and on the unique position of service personnel. The Government have considered carefully the practicalities of applying the national minimum wage in the unique and diverse contexts within which the armed forces are operating. We have concluded that the Armed Forces Pay Review Body offers an effective mechanism to ensure that the minimum wage will feed through to services pay. We have concluded, therefore, that the references to clause 34 is no longer necessary and have tabled new clause 9 to reflect that.
<P>
Before turning to the review body, I shall briefly explain the content and effect of new clause 9.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> ``Eat it slower''.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I have to tell the hon. Gentleman that I have no problem with the measure. There would be a problem if the Government were exempting a class of workers which did not have a body capable of providing fair minimum pay standards. There is a body to do exactly that, so this group of workers is being exempted not because it will not be covered by minimum pay standards but because it will be covered in a different, but just as effective, way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Philip Hammond </B>(Runnymede and Weybridge): If the Minister has no problem with the measure, can he tell us why the Government amendments were tabled late on Monday night and why it was necessary to disrupt the Committee's consideration of the Bill? Is there any explanation other than that there was a last-minute row between Departments?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I suppose that the Opposition have to grasp at straws. I remember the right hon. Member for Wokingham brandishing The Independent on Second Reading--the headline read something like ``McCartney resigns: Cover up''. I pointed out at the time that I have never resigned from a job in my life; I have been sacked from plenty, but I have never resigned. The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond) will have to come up with a better explanation than that.
<P>
Last week, the Government got further with the Bill than Opposition Members thought possible. That was confirmed in the Cambridge Evening News by the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire. He writes a lovely column. He complained that he was allowed only a short break during deliberations, but said that at one stage he managed to have a bath. I do not know how he managed that and I know of no other member of the Committee who managed to have a bath during that time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> The Minister may, when he reads the record of the proceedings, find that on Wednesday morning, between 5.50 and 6.30 am, we had a break during which I had a bath.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. As fascinating as this is, the ablutionary habits of the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire are not in order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Is that to be defined as the Order of the Bath?
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I am on my feet. I think there is some rumbling in the ranks.
<P>
The Government tabled the amendments in the process of considering the Bill. We made it clear in January that during the proceedings we would consider matters relating to the armed forces. Having done that, we made our proposals.
<P>
New clause 9(1) would exclude from the Bill serving members of the armed forces and reservists while they were serving--for example, at weekends. To avoid doubt, subsection (2) makes it clear that civilians such as administrators or clerical staff who work in association with reservists are to be treated as Crown employees. They are, therefore, not excluded from the Bill. Other civilian employees of the Ministry of Defence remain entitled to the national minimum wage under clause 1(1) and clause 2. That maintains universality.
<P>
The pay arrangements of service personnel and reservists who are excluded from the Bill will be covered by the Armed Forces Pay Review Body. The review body is well established and enjoys the widespread confidence of individuals in the services, who have no collective or individual bargaining rights. It is seen as fair.
<P>
The review body takes into account broad comparability with civilian pay and the overall balance of advantages and disadvantages in service life. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence made it clear in reply to a parliamentary question on 12 January that one of the review body's duties was to take into account the circumstances that prevail in industry and outside the armed forces. The review body fully recognises that we need to give special consideration to the circumstances of different groups of service personnel, such as the lowest paid. We expect that to continue.
<P>
Service men and women are paid an annual salary that is based on daily rates. The 1998 review body report recommended that basic annual salaries for private IV class and equivalent lowest rank in other services should be &#163;9,527. The review body this year recommended a higher relative increase for privates and lance corporals in recognition of a serious manning problem among junior and other ranks. That confirms its sensitivity to the pay of those at the lower end of the scale. Although done for different reasons, that mirrors what reportedly already happens in civilian employment, where employers are adjusting their lower-paid employees' pay upward in anticipation of the minimum wage. The result of removing or avoiding low pay is what matters. The board provides the means to achieve that result for the armed forces.
<P>
I should emphasise that the exemption of the armed forces will not be a precedent for the treatment of any other group. The armed forces are unique in the demands that are placed on them and the diversity of duties that their members may be required to undertake at any time and for any period.
<P>
To avoid any doubt, I should also make it clear that Ministry of defence civilian employees will continue to be covered by the Bill.
<P>
The arrangements that we have provided for the armed forces in the Bill will maintain the universal coverage of the national minimum wage by utilising existing robust arrangements to ensure that remuneration for the armed forces does not fall below the national minimum wage. I therefore ask the Committee to agree to the inclusion of new clause 9.
<P>
I said that I would briefly clarify the consequential Government amendments, which are purely technical. Amendment No. 253 simply replaces the existing reference to clause 34 in clause 33 with a reference to new clause 9.
<P>
Amendment No. 254 makes it clear that the meaning of Crown employment in the Bill is subject to the provisions of new clause 9, which also deals with Crown employees who are members of the armed forces.
<P>
Amendment No. 256 removes the existing reference to clause 34 in clause 39, which provides for the application of the Bill to offshore employment, with modifications or exclusions for members of the armed forces. That is no longer necessary because new clause 9 exempts the armed forces from the Bill.
<P>
I ask the Committee to accept those consequential technical Government amendments. If it does so, we will ensure that every worker is covered by a system that guarantees fair minimum standards for pay and conditions in the workplace. That will be achieved directly through the Bill, through the agricultural wages boards that are associated with it and through the Armed Forces Pay Review Body. I commend the new clause to the Committee.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Other members of the Committee have expressed their commiserations to the hon. Member for Stevenage, but it might also be appropriate to express our commiserations to the Minister for being forced to suffer the humiliation of coming to Committee and delivering that speech. He moved the white flag amendment before we had a chance to fire a single shot. I must give him or his officials credit for skilled procedural manoeuvering which ensured that he got in the first salvo in this debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> It was on target, too.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> That remains to be seen.
<P>
The substance of the Government amendments goes further than the amendments that the Opposition tabled on clause 34 which, because of the grouping of the amendments, we are considering along with clause 33.
<P>
I suspect that Government amendment No. 256 is not quite as technical as the Minister suggested. It will remove the ability to make an order under clause 39, which would apply to clause 34. Its purpose seems to be to remove from the discretion of the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry any future power to meddle in the exclusion that the Ministry of Defence has imposed in respect of the armed forces. Thus, the Ministry of Defence does not trust the President of the Board of Trade with the powers that our amendments would have conferred on her, to deal differently with matters relating to the military by regulation or Orders in Council, should a situation develop which required such action.
<P>
The Minister said that he does not have a problem with the Government's decision to remove the armed forces from the provisions of the Bill, but we have seen an extraordinary chain of events over the past week. Opposition Members can only speculate about what has been going on behind the scenes. We know that until Tuesday, the Minister fought consistently, tooth and nail, for the universality of the principle, with a degree of commitment that has earned him at least the respect of Opposition Members.
<P>
We suddenly discovered on Tuesday morning that, late on Monday night--or early on Tuesday morning--the Government had tabled a series of amendments which, had we tabled them, the Minister would have described as wrecking amendments, designed to drive a stake through the Bill's heart. We were also faced on Tuesday morning with the Government's reordering motion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Does my hon. Friend recall also that the reordering motion on the amendment paper was itself amended, which left some members of the Committee in continuing confusion almost until the close of play?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> My hon. Friend is right. I confess that the Minister's sleight of hand in moving a motion that was different from the one printed on the paper in front of us escaped my notice until the afternoon sitting, so there are no flies on the Minister in terms of procedural manipulation.
<P>
We do not know what happened last weekend. Who was arbitrating? Was the President of the Board of Trade in discussions with the Secretary of State for Defence? Was the Prime Minister himself involved in what is clearly an important point of principle?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> My hon. Friend refers to discussions that might have taken place last weekend. Is not it conceivable that one participant in those discussions, anxious to get his own back following his defeat last December, might conceivably have been the Minister without Portfolio?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> That is an interesting speculation and I shall leave members of the Committee to draw their own conclusions. The Opposition will never know whether the Minister himself knows whether the President of the Board of Trade was batting for or against him in those debates.
<P>
<B>Mr. Damian Green </B>(Ashford): I think that my hon. Friend is being too defeatist. Given the recent history of the Government, in which special advisers leak their ministerial wars to Sunday papers, there is every chance that we will at some stage know what went on, who won and who lost.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> My hon. Friend may well be right. My local newsagent will benefit from his suggestion next Sunday, if I have to read all the Sunday newspapers to find out what really happened.
<P>
The Minister could be praised for his good sense in having picked up the theme of the Opposition amendments, albeit without giving us credit for proposing them. I believe that I did not hear the Minister once refer to the good sense and helpfulness of Opposition Members in tabling amendments that exactly anticipate the Government conclusions.
<P>
The word hijacking springs to mind. On Tuesday I was slightly mesmerised by the fact that the Minister had appended his name to amendment No. 199, which I had tabled, and which consequently appeared to stand in my name with the Minister seconding it.
<P>
I see that that has today been corrected, and that the Minister's name is back in the lead. The Minister will be disappointed that the relevant amendment had not been moved. No doubt he has procedural means at hand to deal with the matter.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman should be aware that that amendment was not selected.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am sorry, Mr. Atkinson, that is what I meant, and I thank you for your guidance. I am simply noting for the Committee's benefit that the interests and direction of the Opposition and of the Government seem to be quite tightly entangled.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that on Tuesday, the obvious confusion of Ministers was such that they reordered business to avoid a debate on the clause and the amendments to which he refers? Clearly the Ministers' confusion resigned so much that they were not fit to debate the Bill at that stage.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> My hon. Friend is absolutely right. The Opposition and the public will have to conclude that the debate was finally resolved on Monday. Amendments were tabled that would allow the Government to make their volte face. Time was then required for officials to tear up their briefing and write another one, which stated precisely the opposite.
<P>
The Opposition's problem in trying to praise the Minister is that while we accept the sense of much of what he said, we know from his earlier remarks to the Committee that he personally does not believe it. Somewhere on his desk probably quite near the bottom, is the original speech that the Minister would have used to speak to our proposed amendments to clause 34. It has been removed and probably shredded.
<P>
The Opposition have, however, heard the speech in relation to other amendments that we have tabled. It says something along these lines: ``These are wrecking amendments driving at the heart of the Bill; the Tories are determined to undermine the very principle upon which the Bill is built. Its universality is critical to its enforceability and to the ability of people to understand it''. The Minister has covered such ground before.
<P>
To his credit, the Minister clearly believes in that speech. No Opposition Member would doubt that. His position, however, has been undermined, whether by the President of the Board of Trade, or by powers even higher. The Minister alluded to his being quoted as having threatened to resign if the principle of universality were undermined. I had wished to ask him what his current position on that matter is, but he has made it clear.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I reported my position to the House when the issue was first raised. The only person who I could see in the House at the time who was prone to resignation was the right hon. Member for Wokingham, who resigned from his position. It always was a wholly fallacious article--I am a happy and ebullient member of the Government and I shall be for some time to come.
<P>
It always was a wholly fallacious article--I am a happy and ebullient member of the Government and I shall be for some time to come.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> In view of the Minister's self-confessed history of being sacked, I hope that he is right.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that it is sad that the attractions of the ministerial car outweigh the attractions of adherence to principles?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> Have you seen it?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I think that my hon. Friend has a good point. As I said earlier, in an attempt to shower praise on him, the Minister has earned the Opposition's respect for his obvious commitment to his cause, but his speech in support of clause 34 seemed to run counter to the principle on which he has hitherto based his arguments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Did my hon. Friend observe, as I did, that the Minister not only spoke more briefly than he is wont to do, but much faster? I suspect that that was because if he had spoken more slowly, the words might have stuck in his throat.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Our hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham has already made comments from a sedentary position on the wisdom of eating humble pie at various speeds, so I shall not dilate further on that, as my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry would say.
<P>
The Minister's argument for rejecting other amendments that would have created exemptions from the Bill was what I call the floodgates argument: if one creates a chink in the armour, one runs the risk of other groups flooding through which ought likewise to be excluded. It is difficult to see how the Minister can feel as comfortable as he has suggested he feels about the exclusion of 200,000 adults from the Bill's scope.
<P>
The Minister said that other arrangements--the Armed Forces Pay Review Body, for example--would ensure that service people's pay does not fall below the minimum wage. He sought in a face-saving statement to assure us that in reality, there would be a mechanism for ensuring that the armed forces effectively complied with the minimum wage, even though this exclusion is to be written into the Act.
<P>
That, however, is not the issue. It was never a matter of pay--there was never a question of whether service personnel's pay levels would be high enough to meet the requirements of the minimum wage. It was an issue of hours, specifically the long hours during active warfare or exercises which might be considered working time. What the Minister said about the Armed Forces Pay Review Body and the regard that it will have to wages in the civilian sector, while perfectly true, does not address the key issue, which has obviously been of concern to the Ministry of Defence throughout. People carrying out military duties over very long periods, whether on active service or on an exercise, might find that by virtue of those long hours, their pay levels have fallen below the level of the minimum wage.
<P>
With regard to the priniciple of clause 33, we accept that the legislation should apply to Crown employees. We had a similar discussion with regard to staff of the House of Commons and the House of Lords and it does not need rehearsing again. Opposition Members welcome the principle that any burden that falls on employers in general should also fall on the Crown. It would not be seen as fair and reasonable by employers if the Crown were to exempt itself whenever convenient.
<P>
Clause 34 would have included the armed forces but with certain provisos, allowing the Government to treat them differently by virtue of Orders in Council or regulations which could have been made under the Bill. The reasons for treating the armed forces differently, or for providing the capability to do so, are outlined in the notes on clauses, which state:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``However, the normal employer/employee relationship does not exist in the armed forces, since service men and women bind themselves to a particular form of service which recognises that the requirements of the service are paramount.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We agree with that, and it is the principle reason that we tabled our amendments. There is not a conventional employer-employee relationship in the armed forces. It would clearly be detrimental to military morale and discipline if individual soldiers were logging their hours and watching the clock, particularly in active warfare or even on exercise.
<P>
There would be great difficulties in following the procedures laid down in the Bill--record keeping, for example--if an officer in a dugout in the middle of the night with his men were cast in the role of employer and required to keep records of who was on duty at any given time. Does sleeping in a dugout constitute being at work? There is a range of issues that the Government have now recognised would make the application of the mimimum wage to military personnel inappropriate. We support the principle that the military should be excluded and to that extent we support the Government amendments.
<P>
There are, horwever, other classes of worker which are not involved in a conventional employer-employee relationship. The Government have identified and addressed that issue in relation to service personnel, where the employers who would experience problems have a powerful champion in the Secretary of State for Defence, who has been able to make his voice prevail over that of the Minister and, perhaps, the President of the Board of Trade. Other employers, such as those whose employees are family members working in small businesses where there clearly is not a conventional emloyer-employee relationship, have no such powerful advocate. This debate about the reasons for excluding the armed forces--an action that hon. Members on both sides of the Committee support--will only throw into starker contrast the treatment of other employers and businesses where there is no conventional employer-employee relationship. I hope that even at this late stage the Minister will give further consideration to their position.
<P>
Another issue, which I flagged up in our discussion on clause 37 and which is relevant to clause 34, is the situation of civilian employees on royal naval ships. I listened to the Minister's remarks and I fully concur with the conclusion that civilian employees of the Ministry of Defence should not be excluded in principle from the minimum wage. There would be no logical reason for doing so because the reasons cited for exempting service people apply only to them and not to civilians.
<P>
We must, however, consider the case of civilians who find themselves on a front-line fighting ship. There was an example in the Falklands of a tragedy in which many of the people killed were civilians serving on royal naval ships. The Bill would create the anomalous situation where those in uniform could be earning significantly lower hourly rates in active service conditions than those working alongside them who were not in uniform and who were able to claim the necessary overtime to give effect to the minimum wage.

<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am sure that my learned Friend, with his characteristic acuity, will have noticed other amendments on the amendment paper, including one in my name and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Solihull (Mr. Taylor), which provide assistance to the Minister with his new clause by making precisely that point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I had noticed those amendments. I am sure that my hon. Friend will speak to them. They deal principally with civilians in auxiliary vessels. My hon. Friend will deal with that genuine point in due course, but I hope that the Minister has given some thought to it. Relatively small numbers of individuals will be involved, but it is clear that it would not be conducive to good morale if two separate regimes applied to people who worked alongside each other in active service conditions and shared the same risks. Those in uniform might, indeed, take greater risks, but be remunerated by reference to different regulations and rules.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Conservative Members have moved amendments to give effect to the same provisions that the Government have proposed and we clearly accept that there are good reasons for the separate treatment of the armed forces. The Government's submission of evidence to the Low Pay Commission made no mention of the armed forces--the words simply do not appear. The Government have--either on their own or, we might speculate, with the help of the Opposition amendments--come to the conclusion that the line on which we have embarked is correct. We support the principle of the Government amendments, although we are concerned about some of the specific issues, on which my hon. Friends will elaborate in more detail.
<P>
The Government can be assured that Conservative Members agree with removing the armed forces from the scope of the minimum wage. We will resist the temptation to exploit the Government's internal disarray over the matter because the effectiveness of our armed forces is paramount. That is particularly so at such a sensitive moment when members of our armed forces may find themselves in active service conditions in the near future. Their operational efficiency must be paramount and all other considerations, including party-political advantage, must be subordinated to it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> With regard to the Minister's remarks, the least said, soonest mended. I noticed the speed with which he discharged them. This is the first time that I have seen him in the role of Mr. Mogens Glistrup, the Danish right-wing politician from the tax-cutting party. When asked by an astonished electorate how he proposed to effect his reductions in taxation, he emphasised the potential for cuts in the Danish Ministry of Defence. When asked to give further details, he said that it would be simple to make such cuts, adding, ``All I would do is install a tape recorder with the words `We surrender' on it.''
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> I can give the hon. Gentleman a better example from nearer home. The former Prime Minister said that he would cut taxes, but he raised them 22 times. Is that not a better analogy?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The Minister is trying hard, but it is not a better analogy--particularly when the Labour party has put up taxes a minimum of 17 times in a few months.
<P>
I am conscious of your impatience, Mr. Atkinson. I advert to the subject in all seriousness, however, because I am sure that, for all out party-political differences, and for all the give and take and banter across the Committee, we have a common commitment to and admiration for the armed forces of the Crown. That must be right. As the exchanges between the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition confirmed yesterday, no one would wish to do anything to diminish the operational efficiency of the armed forces. That is especially true at a time like this, when we are aware of the serious and direct challenges and dangers that they may face. That must be right.
<P>
In that spirit and following on from the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge--who has played a distinguished role in getting this issue on to the Committee's agenda and, contingently, in prompting the Government's change of heart--I should confirm that the Opposition will support the principle of extending entitlement to the national minimum wage to Crown employment. They will also support the Government's new intention to exclude the armed services from the national minimum wage.
<P>
The Opposition understand some of the difficulties that may lie behind that decision. I shall say a little more about them later. We believe that that decision is right. Our complaint is not with the decision, but with the Government's failure to be principled. They have considered difficulties that relate to employees in their own sector of employment. They are not, however, prepared to rehearse the problems of comparable employees in the civilian public services or in the private sector. The Committee has discussed those matters at length. I shall not return to them now, although I may refer to them in my remarks on clause 34.
<P>
I should like to make another point that I trailed in my interventions concerning the Prison Service. I do not claim to be an expert on pay in the armed forces, and I am conscious that almost without exception, Committee members are operating out of area, as the military would say. An important point of principle should be debated concerning the matter. I also wish to touch on one or two points relating to common prudential decisions made between Government Departments.
<P>
I shall begin the substance of my remarks by reference to a very small amendment, No. 233, which has been overtaken by events, in the form of the Government's decision to in effect exempt the armed forces altogether.
<P>
The armed forces of the Crown will always have persons on secondment. Some people may have different contract arrangements, and their position may be more difficult to define. A member of my family went to the Oman navy because of either a formal secondment or post-retirement re-employment. If service personnel were included in the national minimum wage, personnel in the service of Her Majesty who are seconded to a foreign service should also be included.
<P>
I shall pause to deal with another point that has swum into mind as I speak. Having excluded service personnel under new clause 9, would it be possible to reinclude all or some of them as special cases, by regulations under clause 38? The Minister may wish to reflect on that point. I do not canvass it, but merely ask the question. It is worth examining such secondment on all fours with direct employment in the armed forces.
<P>
The issue of what I shall call dual employment is also relevant, especially in relation to the reserved forces. A slight difficulty may arise from the Bill concerning people in the various territorial forces. That potential difficulty may be the reason for the Minister's decision to exempt the whole subject from the Bill. Personnel in those forces are typically paid in training bounties. They participate in courses of training and in exercises--I speak as someone who was many years ago a cadet at school--that are likely to be intensive and to involve a large number of hours a day. There is little point in such people going to their annual camp unless they will clock up a large number of hours--although not, I hope, more than the Committee has done on a daily basis. Nevertheless, they work hard.
<P>
Nobody suggests seriously that money is the motive for joining the Territorial Army or its counterparts. Such a suggestion would be an insult. Money is a useful bonus, an incentive or a sweetener, but it is not the prime reason for doing the job. People do it because of companionship, because it can be interesting and challenging and because it may foster personal development. There is no argument about that. However, a Territorial Army member already employed as, say, a teacher or a butcher might encounter a problem with topping up the bounty for the number of hours worked.
<P>
Moreover, would the national minimum wage requirement in respect of Territorial Army members with salaried civilian employment--as teachers, for example--be waived while they are in the armed forces? I think that such people would be treated as having two separate employments, one excluded from the national minimum wage and the other included in it, but such details need examination.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge mentioned anomalies. It would be unreasonable for the Minister to suggest that other people, outside the armed forces, do not fit those categories. For example, there is the matter of the treatment of serving special constables. Does the new clause mean that the bounties that they receive, allowing for other elements of remuneration, might not reach the national minimum wage? I hope that the Minister will check that with the Home Office.
<P>
The Government's change of heart is extraordinary. I shall turn to the wider issues arising from the new proposals, but I have some experience of the ways of Whitehall and I know that Bills are normally discussed to death between Departments. Ministers meet while officials take minutes, supplementary minutes and other correspondence are exchanged and the whole process is brokered by the Cabinet Office and the committee considering future legislation. A printed Bill is usually pretty definitive. This is an enabling Bill, but it is unusual to include a clause on the off-chance that the Minister of State might succeed in securing consistency of treatment before being rolled over by the Ministry of Defence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I wonder whether my hon. Friend can clarify something for me. Last week, during our overnight proceedings--I was tired but at least I was always here and awake--the Government appeared to be trying to get as much of the Bill as possible passed before publishing their evidence to the Low Pay Commission. We got as far as clause 31 last week: what does my hon. Friend think would have happened if we had reached clause 33 or 34?

<br>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I shall not indulge in such speculation, but the Conservative team in the Committee is capable of both guerilla warfare and in-depth defensive operations. I can assure my hon. Friend that a third line of defence was already in place, well behind the Maginot line. We want to assist progress, but we had no intention of allowing consideration to go further. Conservative Members smelt a considerable rat, and we stopped it. It is right that the Bill be considered properly.
<P>
The Bill solves one anomaly but, as so often happens, creates another. On occasion, service personnel will serve alongside civilian counterparts who benefit from the national minimum wage. There will be few cases but, typically, they would occur in an emergency or a war.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge has said, two brothers--one in uniform, one not; one entitled to the minimum wage, one not--could serve on the same vessel in a war zone. They would be subject to the same risk--my hon. Friend was thinking of the dreadful incident involving the Royal Fleet Auxiliary HMS Sir Galahad in the Falklands--and put in the same hours, perhaps 24 hours a day. At any moment, an exocet might kill them. It would be morally objectionable for them to be under different regimes.
<P>
The purpose of our first tire is to highlight that objection. Amendment (a) to new clause 9 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``In time of war or national emergency regulations may prescribe for equal treatment in respect of this Act for service personnel and civilians serving in a war zone under the command and control of the service authorities.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>The amendment is not confined to fleet auxilliaries, but they are foremost in our minds. We are not campaigning to exclude civilians working for the Ministry of Defence from the national minimum wage or primarily addressing peacetime, but anomaly between two such employees would be odd.
<P>
The Armed Forces Pay Review Body is also relevant. The Minister ran up the white flag on Tuesday morning. He said that he wanted as far as possible to preserve parity between civilians and the armed forces, suggesting that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the Armed Forces Pay Review Body . . . offers a well-established system that has gained the widespread confidence of individuals in the service . . . who think the system fair. The body's annual review takes into account a broad range of factors, including comparability with civilian pay and the overall balance of advantages and disadvantages in service life.''--[Official Report, Standing Committee D, 3 February 1998; c. 694.]
<P>
</UL></FONT>I am sure that those words were drafted by the Ministry of Defence as part of the peace terms. We want comparability to be enshrined in the new clause. The amendment continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``At all other times, so far as may be reasonably practicable, in determining the level of remuneration of armed forces personnel, Ministers should have regard to the principle of equal treatment with civilians in respect of the national minimum wage.'.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>There is a certain discomfort for the Minister in that, even if it is consistent with what he told the Committee on Tuesday. Even if he wants to keep to that fine aspiration, successive Governments--I need not exempt the previous one--have not taken the pay review body recommendations literally or acted on them immediately. Tapered or phased settlements are not rare. This year is no exception. The lower ranks--concern has been shown by the Hourston report--are being offered 3&#183;75 per cent., but they are going to get only 2 per cent. of that between April and December, which provides an overall annual settlement of 2&#183;75 per cent. for the 1998-99 financial year. They will get the extra pay in December, by which point the comparability target will, of course, have moved away again.
<P>
If the Minister means what he says about parity of treatment, he ought to accept our amendment to his new clause. It will not merely key in the Armed Services Pay Review Body, but he will be able to go back to the Chancellor and say, ``I am very sorry, but even if you want to phase this in for good reasons, in order to keeep faith and to comply with the legislation that we have put on the statute book, we need to implement it immediately''. They could not brook a delay because to do so would cause discontinuity and unevenness of treatment with the civilian sector, which might be industrial employees of the Ministry of Defence or people in the private sector. Thus, our amendments are intended as helpful glosses on the new clause. I hope that the Minister will consider them in the spirit in which they have been moved.
<P>
Before I leave the issue--it is one of the most interesting issues with which the Committee has dealt--it is worth going back, as my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge perhaps did not, to what is going on. It seems as if the Government's message to the private sector is, ``We acknowledge that you may have problems, but we won't know what those problems will be until the Low Pay Commission has reported and made a proposal which Ministers will then accept or modify for the introduction of a national minimum wage. You can then deal with your problems.'' Here, however, the Government are saying in advance that the problems affecting service personnel are such that we need to exempt them. Why should that be?
<P>
One element that bears on the matter and which would count against exemption--though I am not arguing that we should avoid exemption; we agree with the Government that there should be exemptions--is the fact that there has over the years been a move towards greater transparency in service pay, although I do not claim to be an expert in military pay matters. The concept of the military salary is an important part of that transparency.
<P>
In the old days, pay and rations was pronounced as one word and what was paid in cash was a comparatively contingent part of the total remuneration package. Now there is a salary, to which I shall come back in a moment. There are also many complex allowances--for example, there is something called a night-time bed allowance, about which I know very little. I suppose that we might have had one or two of those ourselves.
<P>
As I said in the context of prisons, it would be possible to argue for a system that gave service personnel the national minimum wage without difficulty and then, if necessary--if the problem was cost--clawed it back in another way. That would not be impossible. The issue also bears on the interesting subject of the pay reference period.
<P>
We have discussed at great length different remuneration packages, different employment profiles through the year and the appropriate pay reference periods. We do not have the details in regulations, but I cited the example--it is not, I think, a stupid comparator of an agricultural worker who might have two major peaks in the year, one in the spring for lambing and one in the summer for combine harvesting. Soldiers might experience spring and autumn manoeuvres as major peaks when they were working 20 hours a day or, heaven forbid, they might actually be at war. I do not see why a pay reference period could not be devised in principle which encompassed that unevenness of treatment.
<P>
That is a general point, but I suspect that one of the specific concerns of the Ministry of Defence is cost. The pay review body report shows that the pay of a private soldier is a complex matter because soldiers do not have an entitlement to holiday; they have a concession of leave, as appropriate. Their working days across the year are difficult to calculate, as are their working hours within the day. I suspect that that is mainly an Army problem. The figures show that in the year under review, average hours worked in a week by certain ranks were 48.4; for Army personnel in other ranks they were 51.4 and, surprisingly, over 10 per cent. of other ranks worked over 70 hours. Those figures relate to peacetime conditions. The proposed pay of a private grade IV is &#163;9,527 a year. We begin to see some of the problems that could result from the application of the national minimum wage rate, although we do not know what that rate will be.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Will my hon. Friend reflect that if the national minimum wage rate were set at &#163;3.80 an hour, it would represent a 48-hour week for that private grade IV, in contrast with the figures that he quoted?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Indeed, that is the concept that I was playing with. I quoted one set of figures and, without trying to bamboozle the Committee, I was about to try to summarise by saying that if the pay of a private soldier is about &#163;28 a day, the number of hours worked per day is more than eight and a half and the national minimum wage is about &#163;3.80 an hour, one can see why the Ministry of Defence might have problems.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Will my hon. Friend accept that in the case of service in Northern Ireland, which is an all-too-fixed part of military employment, there is another problem that would not be overcome by using the pay reference period, which is that even when off duty, service men and women may find themselves living in restricted conditions that cannot genuinely be considered off duty? For their own safety, they may be confined to barracks and it would be impossible meaningfully to compute the hours worked in those circumstances.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Indeed it would. That is one of the problems, but I am sure that my hon. Friend would readily acknowledge that there could be cases in the private sector where similar, but not identical, considerations arise. That is why Opposition Members have grave concerns about the practical applicability of the national minimum wage in all except the most straightforward situations.
<P>
I hope that I have said enough--I intend to say no more--about the difficulties I can foresee in calculating pay for hours normally worked, particularly for the lower ranks of the Army.
<P>
Another factor that particularly concerns the service authorities is the interaction of different pressures bearing on them. The national minimum wage was one such pressure, until the Minister lifted that threat, but there are others. I shall read the Whitehall tea leaves and quote--I am sure with approval--from a written answer given on 4 March under the previous Administration by my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Soames), who was then a defence Minister. The question, which was asked by my hon. Friend the Member for Salisbury (Mr. Key), related to work that had been carried out or commissioned by the Department and the Adjutant-General to assess the impact on the armed forces of a number of directions emanating from Europe. My hon. Friend replied:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Ministry of Defence takes its full part in government consideration of EU legislation. All relevant directives are examined within MOD to assess the potential impact on the armed forces, and the appropriate service authorities contribute fully to the devate.''--[Official Report, 4 March 1997; Vol. 291, c. 588.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
You bet they do, Mr. Atkinson.
<P>
That answer shows anxiety about the way costs and other problems will rack up, putting in danger the ability of the Ministry of Defence--which is unlikely to get more Government funding in the future--to sustain an active fighting force.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
We owe it to the 210,000 to 215,000 service personnel to ensure that they have the best possible support. They lead a difficult life, one that differs from civilian life. The Government set out to include them in the national minimum wage but have now changed tack. The new clause amendments would provide fairness and give the Minister of State--and the Secretary of State for Defence--a debating point in future negotiations with the Treasury.
<P>
The Minister of State was less than fair to my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham. We do not object to the principle of exempting service personnel, but we want to draw attention to a blatant anomaly: when the Government find a problem, they alter the rules to exclude a significant number of workers in the public sector, but when the private sector encounters a similar difficulty the Government say, ``Too bad, you can like it or lump it.'' We are worried that many will lump it and that employment in the private sector will decline as a result of pressures from the national minimum wage. That depends on the rate that is agreed, on the regulations and on how the pay reference period is expressed, but the principle is clear.
<P>
Those considerations apply to people in other public services as well, such as ambulance personnel, special constables and perhaps even uniformed police officers.

<P>

<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I do not want to hold up my hon. Friend's progress towards a conclusion--
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> That is a hint.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> No, quite the opposite. My hon. Friend's remarks are compelling. The Government's evidence to the Low Pay Commission offers almost no guidance as to how they intend the pay reference period to be calculated. The length of that period will make a great difference in the cases cited by my hon. Friend. Will remuneration for periods of intense service be averaged over a longer time? Will such people receive the national minimum wage on average over a long period, or will they receive that rate even in respect of relatively short periods?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> My hon. Friend has woken from his alleged slumbers to make a perceptive point. He was right: I am about to conclude. I am not one of those former Ministers who suffer from ministeritis. My hon. Friend seems to think that I am the Minister who can answer his question, but I too am waiting for the Minister of State's response.
<P>
I agree that the Low Pay Commission may find crucial the question of setting the appropriate pay reference period for people whose working patterns reflect emergencies or exceptional circumstances. Whether that would be possible in relation to service personnel is now behind us: the Government have made the anomalous decision to exclude them from the provisions of the Bill, and we should let the point rest.
<P>
The Minister started with a familiar attack. Perhaps he should have been an advocate, because he launched a flurry of assault on the Opposition for alleged inconsistencies. He sought to pick the eyes out of my entirely consistent remarks and those of my right hon. Friends the Members for Wokingham and for North-West Hampshire (Sir G. Young). We all expressed outrage at the Government's U-turn. I would not like to leave the Committee without a clear understanding of the enormity of the Government's climbdown.
<P>
The Guardian might almost be described as the parish magazine of new Labour. I always read it with pleasure because I like to see new Labour suffer. The Guardian is no longer uniformly uncritical of the Government and sees certain flaws and inconsistencies developing. A good friend of mine produced an interesting piece for it, which appeared in the first edition, although it may have been edited out of subsequent ones--perhaps the military censor has been at play. In it, Ann Perkins concluded that the
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``President of the Board of Trade, was yesterday forced to make an embarrassing U-turn by exempting Britain's 210,000 armed forces personnel from the minimum wage legislation.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor </B>(Solihull): Would my hon. Friend care to take note of the fact that the parish magazine to which he refers--namely, The Guardian newspaper, which is not nearly as interesting as the parish magazine that appears in each edition of Private Eye--is probably Labour's closest friend among the journals, and therefore gives the best insight into some of its problems?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I encourage the hon. Member for Daventry not to pursue that line.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The simplest thing for me to do is to end with two points that are already on the record. For convenience, I shall quote from the article, which said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``When the bill was unveiled in the autumn with only limited exemptions for workers under 26, it was hailed as a victory for Mrs Beckett, who said: `It will be a single rate that will apply to all regions, sectors and size of firm.'''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Well, it does not.
<P>
Even more blatantly, the President of the Board of Trade did not get beyond her second sentence on Second Reading before saying:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Bill will introduce for the first time in the United Kingdom, minimum wage protection for all workers''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
She added with a characteristic flourish of rhetoric that it would
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``begin to end the scandal of poverty pay.''--[Official Report, 16 December 1997; Vol. 303, c. 162.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It will not apply to all workers and there are good reasons for that. Conservative Members told the Government why it was appropriate to exempt those workers, but they have only now come to their senses.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for Daventry has made a powerful speech on the amendments and has exposed to the full the Government's embarrassment over their volte face on clause 34.
<P>
I want to elaborate on one or two points to which my hon. Friend referred but on which he did not dwell. He is right to make the point that there is no inconsistency in Conservative Members trying to exclude the armed forces. There are perfectly good reasons for doing so, to which the notes on clauses referred. The Government wanted, however, to deal with the matter through numerous Orders in Council. The circumstances of the armed forces make it increasingly difficult to see how they could have been brought successfully within the ambit of the national minimum wage. At least Conservative Members were consistent in recognising that, in so far as such circumstances exist for the armed forces, they are not unique and occur in respect of other aspects of Crown employment. One could, indeed, extend the argument beyond that, but I shall confine myself to Crown employment because we are dealing with clause 33.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge referred to active service, where it is easiest to conceive of inappropriate application of the national minimum wage. For the reasons mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry, the national minimum wage is incompatible with service conditions not just on active service, largely because of relatively low pay and long hours worked. Questions about the calculation and applicability of the rate would disappear if those of private rank earned 50 per cent. more.
<P>
A compelling example is initial training. At Bassingbourn barracks in South Cambridgeshire, private soldiers undertake a 12-week course, working 56 hours a week on average. I had already calculated--I would not flatter myself that I was able to do the sum at the prompting of my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry--that a minimum wage of &#163;3.80 an hour would mean that a grade IV private could work no more than 48 hours. Yet over 12 weeks--not a short pay reference period for weekly-paid employees--they work considerably in excess of that and the implied rate is considerably below &#163;3.80.
<P>
We do not know what the national minimum wage rate will be. More than once, we have been unable to pursue our arguments to their conclusion because of the absence of the Low Pay Commission's recommendations. Nonetheless, that figure seems reasonable for illustration. The rate would have to be very low for trainee private soldiers at Bassingbourn to be excluded. Some are 18 or younger and would therefore be separately affected by any young persons rate, but many would be greatly affected. Before the instructors say that I do not acknowledge their circumstances, I point out that if trainees work 56 hours a week, they will work 60 or more because they must not only supervise but prepare training.
<P>
In a range of circumstances--not just on active service--hours worked could mean that pay fell below the national minimum wage. Has the Minister gone down the path of effectively deleting clause 34 because of cost to the armed forces? He deliberately did not refer to that. Pay review bodies may be independent, but they do not operate in isolation. They are obliged to respond to evidence, and Ministers often press it upon them that they must operate in relation to affordability criteria. Do the Government intend to raise armed forces pay where necessary so that it is consistent with the national minimum wage, acknowledging the hours worked?
<P>
I want to make one more substantive point. It is by no means true that the circumstances I have mentioned do not apply elsewhere in public service. Trainee police constables work long hours. Even though they are better paid than privates entering the armed forces, their effective wage rate over that period might be reduced considerably.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Is not it the case that the commn factor in all those examples is not the pay levels but the very long hours that might be worked and sometimes the difficulty in determining when a person is working and when he is not? Has it occurred to my hon. Friend to consider, for example, the case of a lighthouse keeper, who might be considered to be on duty 24 hours a day, from the time he arrives at his post until he leaves--[Interruption.]
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> There seem to be many sedentary contributions from Labour Members. If someone will tell me what is being muttered, I shall be happy to give way.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Ms Candy Atherton </B>(Falmouth and Camborne): Perhaps you are not aware that, sadly, we do not have lighthouse keepers in this country any more. It is all done by automatic transmission.
<P>
<B>Mr Lansley:</B> The hon. Lady seems to be suggesting that you are not aware of that, Mr. Atkinson.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Perhaps Labour Back Benchers are suggesting that by abolishing the jobs where this problem exists, we would solve the problem.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Whatever I think about lighthouse keepers, they cannot by any stretch of the imagination be said to be members of the armed forces.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I was hoping, with your indulgence, Mr. Atkinson, to be able to talk about Crown employees generally.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that whatever the hours worked, one of the problems is that not only defining but physically recording those hours, perhaps in difficult situations, may well be onerous?
<P>
<B>Mr Lansley:</B> I do not think that we need to dwell on particular examples. We should consider the principles involved.
<P>
It is obvious--not least because of the way in which the provisions are to be applied in the private sector in relation to, for example, security guards, about whom we spoke in an earlier sitting--that where employees are working very long hours and overnight by virtue of their employment contract, there can be no question of the exclusion of those hours for the purposes of calculating the national minimum wage. If the Minister intended to use the provisions and design the regulations so as to exclude exceptionally long hours worked or hours which included overnight working, where the employee concerned might not be actively working throughout that period--we can all think of examples of that--he ought to tell us. That is not the inference that was drawn from earlier debates.
<P>
Two issues arise. Although the first is important, the Government's evidence to the Low Pay Commission is silent on it. It has arisen on several occasions and is particularly relevant to some Crown employees. It is difficult to know the Government's intentions with regard to defining a pay reference period. Is it to be relatively short and therefore designed to ensure that throughout the working time of most employees, they are being remunerated at or above the national minimum wage, or do the Government intend, where such circumstances arise, to allow for very long pay reference periods to be calculated, designed to average periods of pay well below the national minimum wage with other periods of increased remuneration? That will make an enormous difference to many employers, including those involved in Crown employment.
<P>
One interesting case is junior hospital doctors working as Crown employees. We all know that they work very long hours. I declare an interest in that my wife was a junior hospital doctor; happily, she no longer works those kinds of hours. I remember that on one occasion, she began work on Friday at 9 am and finished work on Monday at 5 pm, which beats even members of the Committee into a cocked hat. That is why I got no sympathy when recounting the tales of last week.
<P>
The BMA recently highlighted the fact that during many of those so-called overtime hours, the rate of pay applicable to junior hospital doctors falls to &#163;3.71, which may be below the national minimum wage rate. Averaging the overtime hours at that reduced rate over a longer pay reference period would produce a rate above the national minimum wage. However, doctors who are contracted for 40 hours may work 90 or 100 hours a week, and they will be paid at less than the national minimum wage for their many hours of overtime.
<P>
The notes on clauses, in connection with the original clause 34, mention the paramountcy of the requirements of the service. Hospital doctors may not be contracted to work longer hours but they feel that they work under an implied obligation to treat as paramount the requirements of their service. They work their contracted hours, accordingly to regularised shift arrangements, but they also work longer hours to cover for other staff or to meet exceptional requirements. That means that they often work even longer hours that are not taken properly into account.
<P>
Doctors are not low-paid employees, but their case shows how long hours can have a dramatic impact on the calculation of the national minimum wage even in respect of well paid, professional staff. The difficulty will be much greater for people in some of the lower paid categories of Crown employment, such as officers beginning their careers in the police service.
<P>
I cannot recite chapter and verse on the subject, but my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry raised a point about special constables that merits a reply from the Minister. How will the provisions apply to special constables? Will their allowances and expenses be treated as remuneration for the purposes of the national minimum wage? They are not excluded by clauses 45 and 46, nor by any other clause. It is unlikely that special constables will be remunerated at or above the national minimum wage.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Is not that just another example of the difficulty with voluntary and quasi-voluntary workers? To his credit, the Minister has agreed to reconsider that problem.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> The Minister has agreed to do that, although only in connection with charitable and voluntary organisations, rather than Crown employment. I hope that his review will cover the matter that I have raised.
<P>
Conservative Members have adopted a consistent approach to the problem. At out urging, and perhaps in response to some of the amendments tabled by my hon. Friends, the Government have accepted the need to change their approach. However, inconsistencies remain. Employers in the Crown service and the private sector will examine the Bill and notice that what is sauce for the goose is not sauce for the gander.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> My hon. Friend has observed the contradiction between the treatment of the armed forces and that of people in comparable employment. Is it not curious that the Minister of State has been done over by the Secretary of State for Defence but not by the Home Secretary?
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Yes, it is interesting that that is the case. I suspect that if the structure of pay in the police service were examined in a similar way to that in which my hon. Friend examined that of the armed forces, it would probably be found that the reason for the decision is that the Home Secretary does not anticipate that most police would be paid below the national minimum wage, whatever their hours of service, because of the structure of overtime in that service.
<P>
The matter begs the question whether the Secretary of State for Defence proceeded as he did because of the costs that would be incurred in the armed services were to pay the national minimum wage. If that explanation is correct, it highlights the way in which Ministers have chosen to save themselves embarrassment and difficulty by amending the Bill, while being perfectly happy not to offer the same opportunity to private sector employers who have analogous arrangements for their staff.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I am sure that my hon. Friend is right. Is it not most improper for the Minister to pretend that the Armed Forces Pay Review Body will come to the rescue of members of the armed forces who would otherwise be let down by his change of heart? The Minister is quite wrong to suggest that that rescue will occur. It will not if the policy is a money saving exercise.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I am most grateful to my hon. Friend.
<P>
If my suspicions are correct, the remedy lies in the amendment to new clause 9 tabled by my hon. Friends the Members for Daventry and for Solihull. That amendment deals with the need for Ministers to take account of the national minimum wage and to ensure pay comparability between civilian and armed forces employment. If Ministers deny the reason that the Opposition have suggested is behind their change of mind, they can put their response into the Bill, and thus assure the armed forces otherwise.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I shall deal briefly with the wider implications of one or two amendments that the Opposition tabled originally. I was especially impressed by the Minister's performance at the start of the debate on the amendments. It struck me that he has now become the Stevenage Borough of the Government--he is small and plucky, but ultimately defeated.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I am making an after dinner speech on Friday, so can I keep that one?
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I freely donate that joke to the Minister for future use. Before the Government produced their evidence my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry kept asking ``where is the Ark Royal?'' Transferring that analogy to the clause produces the unusual sight of a Government depth-charging part of their own flagship before it comes under enemy fire that is too withering. That is what they have done in their withdrawal this morning.
<P>
I do feel some sympathy for the Minister. I imagine that the Secretary of State has lost all the Whitehall battles about the matter. It is a bit much, and it is rather unsporting of the Secretary of State to leave him to swing in the wind on his own this morning, and not to turn up to support him. I feel that sympathy not least because, as my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge made clear, Opposition Members have been impressed by the passionate--although wrongheaded--way in which the Minister has advocated the principle of universality. It was clear that he believed in that principle. It was equally clear that his performance this morning contained less passion.
<P>
The Committee has already witnessed the creation of a new economic concept, the McCartney curve. It suggests that the higher an employee's, the more likely he is to be employed. That is a novel concept in economic theory. I should like to add to the McCartney curve the concept of the McCartney speed limit. When the Minister exceeds a specific number of words per minute, it is clear that he does not believe in what he is saying. He was going along at a cracking pace this morning.
<P>
Even with the Government amendments, some corrections should be made to the clause. It does not go far enough as amended by the Government. It would be improved if they were to agree to amendment (a) to new clause 9, which was tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry. Given that the Government have performed a U-turn, they might be more generous towards Opposition amendments than usual. They might be prepared to admit that this one would improve the Bill.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
It is clear that military and civilian personnel who are working in the same theatre of operations should not be artificially divided. Amendment No. 198 sought to eliminate the prospect of civilian disputes becoming part of military life. Even if that did not happen very often, the mere prospect of minimum wage legislation introducing the problems of normal industrial relations into military life would be horrifying. It would be bad for discipline and safety. Such a move would be inappropriate.
<P>
The amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry would ensure that, especially in times of emergency or war, the same conditions of service would apply to military and civilian personnel who were working together. I urge the Minister to take this ideal opportunity of ensuring that the long-running, niggling disputes that occasionally affect civilian work forces are not allowed to appear in the military sphere.
<P>
We are particularly sensitive at this time to the difficulties and dangers that our military forces are called upon to face. The Committee should ensure that it does not do anything that would make the day-to-day life of military personnel any more difficult.
<P>
The Government's smart execution of a U-turn has wider implications. Possibly the least convincing part of the Minister's performance was his attempt to explain why military personnel are unique. As far as I could understand from his torrent of words he seemed to suggest that, because they have a pay review body, they are unique among this country's work forces in not needing a minimum wage. That is absurd. Other groups and most of the public sector have pay review bodies. Given the Government's recent decisions, it is ridiculous to suggest that pay review bodies provide protection for those at the lower end so that they are always guaranteed a certain level of remuneration. Such a claim does not stand up to factual analysis.
<P>
It could be argued that the armed forces are unique because they face obvious dangers. Being prepared to put their lives at risk is a central part of their work. That is true, but it is not unique. Many groups, including public sector workers in the police, the fire service and in prisons, are prepared ultimately to put their lives at risk for the service of society. that is why we admire them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow Does my hon. Friend agree that, although exposure to danger might be an argument in favour of a group of workers receiving the national minimum wage, it cannot--even in McCartney theory--be considered an argument against their entitlement to the national minimum wage?</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> My hon. Friend makes a powerful point. Even if we accept the Ministers prejudices and dogma, it is still true that such groups should be the last, rather than the only, ones to be exempted. I should be grateful to the Minister if he would address that intellectual conundrum when he winds up the debate.
<P>
The last point that I want to make--I eagerly await the Minister's winding-up speech--is that he should realise that, in making that U-turn, he has driven a coach and horses through the principle of universality. Those of us who think that the Bill is wrong in principle and that the minimum wage is likely to cause damage will use the fact that the Government have made that U-turn to try to extend the exemption to other groups. I am delighted that the Government have made the first hole in the wall through which many other people will fall in the years to come.
<P>
<B>Mr Bercow:</B> I, too, eagerly await the Minister's response and, therefore, I shall be brief.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> Well, sit down.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> The Minister makes a reasonable request, with which I shall comply shortly. I shall not do so immediately because I want to savour the moment. Although my hon. Friends have made the points powerfully, they bear modest repetition.
<P>
Reference has been made to the Minister's motivation. It would be unfair to attribute his reaction to one motive exclusively. There is much talk about the minimum wage, but members of the Committee might consider it reasonable to deduce that the Minister's preoccupation has been not with the rights or wrongs of the minimum wage, but with the importance of preserving his maximum wage. While my hon. Friends were speaking, I checked the extent to which the Minister would have suffered if he had been forced to depart from the Front Bench and return to the Back Benches. Unless I am mistaken--I am happy to be corrected, if I am wrong--he would have suffered to the tune of &#163;31,125 a year.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We are debating the armed forces and pay.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Well, we are debating Crown employment, and what I have said seems relevant in that context--[Interruption.] If the Minister wishes to intervene, I should be happy to give way. That sum would have represented a substantial shortfall. Given that the Minister is rightly proud of the fact that he has grandchildren, it would be most unfortunate if he had far less to spend on their birthday and Christmas presents. I am glad that he is being spared that indignity. The Minister has come before us absolutely naked--the fig leaf of the Armed Forces Pay Review Body is the only means by which to cover his abject humiliation and embarrassment.
<P>
There has been some speculation about what has caused the decision. Clearly, the Minister will not pretend for a moment that it was his wish in the first instance. I recognise the diktats of collective responsibility under which the Minister labours, but they do not oblige him to state an untruth. The point of collective ministerial responsibility is that Ministers all stick together like a pack and say, ``We have reached an agreement.'' However, it does not oblige the Minister to claim that he believed something different from that which he actually believed.
<P>
The reality is that, until very recently, he believed that there should be exactly equal provision in the Bill for members of the armed forces as for every other category of worker. We know that because the Bill contained, with his approval, that provision; it enjoyed his consent and it had the support of his right hon. and hon. Friends, including the President of the Board of Trade. We do not know whether she knifed him at the last minue as part of a gamut of agreements with other ministerial colleagues, to which he still might not be privy. We think that the right decision has been made, although it is not without potential problems.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Daventry referred to the distinction that the Minister made between members of the armed forces and civilian employees. We recognise that distinction. Nevertheless, it would be unwise to suppose that the decision will cause no resentment. That is the prospect and, as a member of the Government, the Minister has a responsibility to take account of it and to respond.
<P>
It is not clear whether the Minister has tendered an apology to those people, whom we now discover are not to be paid the minimum wage, for leading them to believe that they would be paid it. Has he received any representations on the subject from members of the armed forces? We should be told how many representations he has received, what they were and by whom they were made. Have any been made during the past weeks or months, during which time there has been a spate of press coverage? Those are important matters. In a spirit of open government, the Minister should at least give us some of the background that led to the decision that he defends today.
<P>
The Government may have made the right decision, but the Minister has opened a can of worms. We know perfectly well that powerful arguments can be made for exemptions and exclusions elsewhere in the public service and in the private sector. There is no inconsistency, despite the Minister's earlier blatherings, in our supporting the exemption of the armed forces. We have said all along that they should be exempted. The Minister's attempt to distort the words of my right hon. Friend the shadow President of the Board of Trade was wholly unsuccessful.
<P>
The speed at which the Minister spoke reminded me of nothing so much as that seminal parliamentary occasion--I am sure, Mr. Atkinson, that you will indulge me in this--when the former Prime Minister, Harold Wilson, came to the House to announce the withdrawal of his utterly neutered and destroyed piece of legislation in relation to the House of Lords: the then Member for Wolverhampton, South-West, Mr. Enoch Powell, called out several times, ``Eat it slower.''
<P>
That applies precisely to the present situation. The fact is that the Government have caved in. There is no shame in that, but the Minister should admit either that he has changed his mind or that he has been forced to support a position different from that which he and his ministerial colleagues argued for with the Prime Minister and put in ministerial correspondence. I hope that he will not commit the equivalent of perjury in the witness box by saying something untrue at the Dispatch Box or in Committee. That would be wrong, and I feel sure that the Minister will not do so.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I think that, in that remark, the hon. Member is impugning the Minister's honesty. If I am wrong, the hon. Member should make it clear that he was not doing so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I am sorry, Mr. Atkinson, I did not hear you.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I took your remark to indicate that you were impugning the Minister's sense of truthfulness--that he would perjure himself. That is how I took your comment. If that was not the intention--I am sure it was not--perhaps you will make it clear to the Minister.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Oh no; far be it from me to impugn the Minister's honesty. I was expressing the hope and the conviction that the Minister--he has nothing if not an honest face--would not do anything of the sort. He will readily acknowledge, I am sure, that he has had to sign up to a position in which he does not believe, but which he judges worth doing because of other aspects of the Bill--[Interruption.]--and, as one of my hon. Friends so poignantly observed from a sedentary position, to preserve his employment, and the maximum entitlement that he can secure by its continuation.
<P>
The Government have belatedly got it right. They owe my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge and others of my hon. Friends some belated, modest, understated acknowledgement of our prior wisdom. It would be a most graceful and well-received gesture.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> As each clause goes by, the hon. Member for Buckingham immatures and immatures. Some of his comments were unworthy. The hon. gentleman is right that I feel passionately, but it is not only a passion. There is some intellectual rigour in the content of the Bill and in what we want to achieve. Our intellectual rigour has led us to convince the overwhelming majority of the British people, and industry and commerce, of the rightfulness of the social and business case for a national minimum wage.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman may fire blanks at me from his safe Conservative Back-Bench seat, but it is meaningless tittle-tattle and twaddle. I know about the rigours of surviving while bringing up a family on low pay; it lives with people. For that reason I feel passionately about doing something about low pay.
<P>
Captain Mainwaring and his dilapidated Dad's army behind him have kept us somewhat entertained for the past hour and a quarter--sometimes rather loftily and windily, because, of course, they come to the Committee with the faint hope that they will see before them a divided Government and a crestfallen Minister--someone who was on his way out of Government rather than up through it. So far, they have lost on all counts.
<P>
<B>Hon. Members:</B> Oh! Oh! Tell us more.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> Who wants to intervene? I will give way to Captain Mainwaring.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am most grateful to the Minister of State for likening me to Captain Mainwaring. Arthur Lowe nearly came to settle in my village, and I am a great admirer of his. Perhaps the Minister of State will answer this: remembering Captain Mainwaring and the situation that he confronted in 1940 and subsequent years, who won?
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> A Labour Government, that's who. I think that Captain Mainwaring would have voted for the then new Labour, as he might have done again last year.
<P>
There have been some genuine and well-placed salvos on the operation of the clause. I readily concede that the hon. Member for Daventry tabled his amendment not only to probe the Government but because he had a legitimate intellectual argument on the clause. My lack of reference to it in my opening speech had nothing to do with hiding the fact that he tabled amendments. I wanted to get on with my job in a businesslike way, and leave him to do the same. I shall respond to the general discussion of the points raised, and then to specific issues relating to the amendment to new clause 9. I apologise for taking a little time to do this, but it is important that the Government put their position clearly on record.
<P>
Opposition Members have explained the purpose of the amendments and their reasons for continuing to press them, but many of them are not relevant to the new clause. Amendments Nos. 233, 234, 231 and 198 relate to the old scope for enforcement. Amendments Nos. 243 and 245, and new clause 3, tabled by the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge, seek to achieve an effect similar to that of the Government's amendment, but in a more convoluted and complicated way. I reject them in favour of our own amendments for the simple reason that they are unnecessarily complex and there is no need to use Orders in Council.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman raised issues relating to service personnel and others working with them. Service and civilian personnel each have their own special conditions of service. In the armed forces there is an X factor--12 per cent. of basic pay for regulars--which provides for the special conditions of the armed forces. Civilians may be entitled to receive overtime or other allowances not available to the armed forces. These differences are accepted and, any special requirements in war or emergency, were a matter for the Government at the time. Reservists get a zero X factor at home, a 5 per cent. X factor in training, and a 12 per cent. X factor in operations. Civilians do not receive this X factor because of their ability to earn overtime and for other reasons.
<P>
The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge spoke about the Royal Navy and the Royal Fleet Auxiliary. The latter works alongside and under the direct control of the Ministry of Defence under the requirements of the Merchant Shipping Act 1988. Petty officers and ratings also have the right to join the National Union of Marine, Aviation and Shipping Transport Officers and the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers and are permitted to take industrial action on a range of issues which do not apply to the staff of Royal Navy establishments. They work alongside them, but have distinct and different terms and conditions of service from those applying to the armed forces. That has been, and will continue to be, a constant feature, whether or not there is a minimum wage.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I do not seek to challenge the Minister on that point or to make life difficult for him, but in the interests of good industrial relations, would he undertake to bear in mind in future discussions the possibility of approximating those terms of service, where appropriate, rather than perpetuating arbitrary differences that may no longer be justified?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> The hon. Gentleman made a similar point about the Gulf war and the Falklands war and asked about special provisions. No special arrangements of the type he wants were made during those wars. The armed forces already get paid and operational requirements are taken into account; I have detailed the financial packages for civilians. The Government are doing nothing in that regard that was not done by all previous Governments.
<P>
The amendments do not disturb the present arrangements; indeed, their purpose is to ensure that there is no disturbance. All personnel within the Ministry of Defence will be covered by the terms of the current pay review body, except in circumstances relating to civilians, who will be covered by the terms of the national minimum wage. Little or no disturbance will therefore take place, because the Government are now convinced that the Armed Forces Pay Review Body will not have a detrimental effect on armed forces personnel or the operation of the national minimum wage.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman made some general points about other groups, including the corny one about families and whether they constituted a special category in the same way as, for example, a corporal who has to work in dangerous situations such as south Armagh or behind the scenes in the Gulf war. We debated this almost exhaustively in our debate about family members. Hundreds of thousands of family members work in family companies and would therefore be entitled to the national minimum wage.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The notes on clauses state that the normal employer-employee relationship does not exist in the armed forces. Is not it patently obvious that the normal employer-employee relationshp equally does not exist in a very small business where, for example, the employer is the husband, and the employee is the wife?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> How far does the hon. Gentleman want to take that? What about the cousin, the second cousin, the son and the daughter? Does he want a provision that family members do not get paid or are left with poverty wages? It is the nature of family businesses that family members assist each other. That does not mean, however, that people working in a family business and contributing to its success are not entitled to proper pay and conditions. That would be nonsense.
<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry raised the point about special constables. Again, we have discussed the general issue of volunteering; special constables are unpaid volunteers and there is no statutory provision in regard to their payment, although they qualify for expenses. They will not be covered by the national minimum wage.
<P>
In general, the Opposition's amendments support the Government. The Opposition say that they agree with what we are doing although they dislike the way in which we are doing it; that is unfortunate for them and fortunate for us.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I am trying to push things on. We have a programme of clauses to get through and I am trying to catch up, although that means I am going more quickly than I would have liked. I give an undertaking to the hon. Gentleman that I shall write to him on the legitimate questions to which I did not have time to respond. I ask my hon. Friends to reject the Opposition amendments and to support the Government amendments.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Amendment made: No. 254, in page 21, line 41, after `Act', insert `subject to section (Armed forces (No. 2)) below'.--[Mr. McCartney.]
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 246, in page 21, line 41, leave out `or for the purposes of '.
<P>
This is somewhat of a tail-end to a discussion that has concentrated on the armed forces but also includes the general status of Crown employees. We have made our position clear on that matter; there is no contention about it in the Committee.
<P>
The purpose of the amendment is to probe the either innocent or sinister-sounding words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``for the purpose of a government department''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I understand what employments is--that is a straightforward relationship. I am not quite so clear what employment for the purposes of a Government Department might be, because the clause does not define that employment in relation to the employer--the Crown.
<P>
Someone could be working for the purposes of a Government Department but not in Crown service at all. A friendly journalist might be doing something and not know that he was working for the purposes of a Government Department--perhaps to prevent error--but could be said to be working for its purposes.
<P>
Perhaps more seriously, some hon. Members may recall recent press comment about practices that may or may not have taken place--I shall say no more than that--on the trawler Gaul in relation to the use of merchant seaman to conduct operations on behalf of the nation some years ago.
<P>
All I want to know is what the provision means--I suspect a legal term of art may be involved--why it is necessary, whether it is appropriate and whether it may lead to problems. In that probing spirit, I also invite the Minister to explain the somewhat complex relations between Government Departments, which we know, love and recognise, non-departmental public bodies, agencies--next steps agencies and otherwise--and other persons who are working to the Crown, without necessarily working as employees of the Crown.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> I would not want to pretend that it is easy to define a Crown employee; neither would I want to enter into a complicated legal or historical debate when we have only two minutes of the sitting left. The principle behind the clause is simple enough--it is to ensure that all Crown employees are subject to the same provisions as are other employees and workers.
<P>
Ther hon. Member for Daventry raised the question of the employment status of people who may work directly or indirectly for the Crown. I am sure that in the case of some agencies the contract of employment is with the agency; some people working in an agency will be on secondment from the Crown; there are myriad arrangements. The principle is that whatever the arrangements, and whatever the employees' status, they will be entitled to the national minimum wage.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Is the Minister in effect saying that everybody will be included within the national minimum wage except those in Crown employment, and that if Crown employees--save the armed forces, which we have already discussed--are included, everybody will be covered? In other words, if there is a difference of interpretation about whether employment is Crown employment, people will be covered one way or the other.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> That is basically it. One exercise we have performed in drafting the Bill is to ensure that there are no loopholes, deliberate or otherwise, and that all employees will be entitled to the national minimum wage. I hope that, given that explanation, the hon. Gentleman will accept the clause, so that we can move on.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 33, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Clause 34 disagreed to.
