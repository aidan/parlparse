<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Mr. Mike O'Brien):</B> I beg to move amendment No. 29, in page 4, line 3, after ``and'' insert ``any part of''.

<P>
This is a technical amendment to make the reference to the Scottish Administration properly reflect the reference to Ministers of the Crown and Government Departments.

<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes </B>(Southwark, North and Bermondsey): Subsection (6) provides for a judicial review, to which the Minister referred earlier, and represents new ground in extending the legislation. Has a judicial review taken place on such matters before? Administration remedies are usually the result of judicial review. It would be helpful to have a list of previous judicial reviews and, in tabular form if that is the easiest way in which to present the information, whether they succeeded.

<P>
I have two reasons for asking that question. First, human rights legislation is about to be directly incorporated, and a general anxiety has been expressed that that will result in additional burdens because of possible legal actions. As we have debated both here and elsewhere, remedies for such issues were previously found either indirectly, through the European convention, and, eventually, Strasbourg, or through administrative law remedy in this country. It would be helpful to make it clear that the provision does not represent new ground and will not open up a new raft of litigation opportunities.

<P>
Secondly, the subsection provides for the award of damages for contravention, and, again, it would be helpful to have an idea of the parameters. People who feel that they have been discriminated against usually want not to win huge damages but to have their cases vindicated and upheld and their names cleared. They want to feel that they have a remedy. However, some people, quite reasonably, want damages. Has an estimate been made, by civil servants or others, about the possible implications of the provision? An extension of the law means provision for damages, and someone must have done some research, whether academic or otherwise, on the likely implications. My hon. Friend the Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine (Sir R. Smith) and I have no problem with the substance of the clause, but we would like to discuss some drafting issues, as we discussed previously when debating the amendments, and it might be helpful to try to anticipate the possible impact of the clause.

<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I understand that a smaller number of cases have arisen under section 76. We believe that they are fewer than six, but I shall make some inquiries. I am not sure about the extent to which detailed information held is accessible on those six cases, but I shall put what I can in writing to the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey (Mr. Hughes).

<P>
The current level of awards in non-employment cases may be a guide to the likely level of awards in new cases. In cases represented by the Commission for Racial Equality in 1997 and 1998, awards averaged £1,000, settlements averaged approximately £2,000, and pre-litigation settlements effected by CRE officials averaged approximately £6,000. Given that we are dealing with a relatively small number of cases anyway, such maximum and minimum figures are comparatively small in the context of general Government expenditure.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> That is helpful, but perhaps the Minister would care to reflect on one issue that he mentioned. He said that sometimes people who seek remedy in the context of employment-or, as in this case, the extension of employment, because it relates to office helpers-do so because they feel that they are being forced out of an office. They decide to bring a case for constructive dismissal, for which damages, in normal employment law terms, can be quite high.

<P>
I anticipated the Minister referring to relatively small, four-figure rather than five-figure sums. However, there may be cause to consider whether parity or fairness is needed in the range of remedies for people who, in their workplace or their work, feel that they are being driven out by harassment, or discriminated or prejudiced against by their employer or manager.

<P>
I am not offering a solution; I am simply anxious to ensure, as someone who used to practise employment law, that the system is seen to be fair. Huge damages should not be paid in sex discrimination cases, for example, if much smaller damages are paid in race discrimination cases-and much higher damages than either set of cases are awarded for other forms of unfair employment practice.

<P>
I do not expect the Minister to respond now. With the assistance of his colleagues in the Department for Education and Employment, we may be able to ensure that, by the time the provision is implemented, the guidelines, advice and information given to the courts and the tribunals, which make the decisions, at least provide a sense of parity throughout the different categories of possible action.

<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<P>
Clause 2, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<H4><center>Clause 3</center></H4>
<H4><center>Police: extension of liability of chief officers etc.</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 51, in page 4, line 26, after ``done'', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`or omitted'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendment No. 52, in page 4, line 27, leave out
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`, or purported performance,'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> The genesis of these probing amendments is the Law Society of Scotland. They were tabled at the instigation of my hon. Friend the Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine; perhaps he should be speaking to them.

<P>
Clause 3 is an important consequence of the Lawrence inquiry covering an important area of law. It brings the actions of police forces and officers within the Bill's provisions. Amendment No. 51 would enable vicarious liability for the actions, as well as the omissions, of chief officers of police.

<P>
The clause as drafted suggests to us that chief officers of police would be vicariously liable for the actions of a person holding an office defined as a relevant police office, but would not be so for such a person's failure to act. By definition-this again is one of the lessons from Lawrence and elsewhere-omissions are as important as commissions. It is often as important to deal with failure to act as with action. I understand the technical point that it could be argued that a chief officer of police is responsible for the actions of subordinates, but the truth is that they must also be responsible for the omissions of subordinates. I should be grateful for the Minister's response as soon as possible.

<P>
Amendment No. 52 would remove the words ``or purported performance''. The new section 76A would read:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>For the purposes of section 32-

<P>
(a) the holding of a relevant police officer shall be treated as employment by the chief officer of police  and

<P>
(b) anything done by a person holding such an office in the performance  of his functions shall be treated as done in the course of that employment.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment is an attempt to be fair in the other direction and to ensure that a chief officer is held responsible only in relation to what a police officer should be expected to do. An officer on duty may have had too much to drink, acted improperly and then got into an argument while he was no longer carrying out any work functions-during his dinner hour, perhaps. Though he remained in uniform and committed a breach of the Act in other respects-using bad language, discriminatory language, abusive behaviour and so forth-it would not be reasonable to hold the chief officer responsible, because the breach had nothing to do with police work.

<P>
The amendment poses the legal issue of avoiding liability when people go on frolics of their own. It is relevant to the clause. I hope that that is clear and I look forward to hearing the Minister's reply.

<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Secretary, Privy Council Office (Mr. Paddy Tipping):</B> Amendments Nos. 51 and 52 are very clear. The hon. Gentleman has introduced them well and the Law Society of Scotland supports them. We have had an opportunity to reflect on the amendments and we understand with respect to amendment No. 51 that the phrase ``anything done'' includes both acts and omissions. Section 78 of the Act provides a general interpretation and states that acts include omission. The ``anything done'' wording in section 76A is the same as that in section 32(1) of the Race Relations Act, which deals with the vicarious liability of employers. We believe, as I said, that the phrase catches omissions as well as acts. We are confident that we have covered the act of omissions. I hope that that satisfies the hon. Gentleman.

<P>
Amendment No. 52 is basically about frolics, to use the hon. Gentleman's example of a police officer acting on his own in his lunch hour, having had too much to drink. The amendment would give the chief officer some defence. However, the current provision is no different from section 32, which applies generally to employees. Indeed, the wording is the same as section 88 of the Police Act 1996, which makes a chief officer liable for the torts of his office. The same wording is appropriate here. If a police officer is acting in the ``purported performance'' of his duty, the chief officer is held responsible.

<P>
Under section 32, it is a defence for the chief officer of police to prove that he took such steps as were reasonably practical to prevent the police officer from doing an act or acts of that description-in other words, that he took reasonable steps to stop frolics.

<P>
If the chief officer of police did not take steps that were reasonable in the circumstances, there should be no protection for the chief constable. In both cases, the amendments are unnecessary. The acts of omission are covered and so are the frolics.

<P>
I hope that the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey will think about what I said. It is possible that his hon. Friend the Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine will want to talk to the Law Society of Scotland about it. In the light of our advice from that body, and having had an opportunity to consider the matter, we are confident that the clause adequately covers the points made by the hon. Gentlemen. I hope, therefore that the hon. Gentleman will ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> The answer to the first question is satisfactory; we shall double-check the amendment. The original legislation was subsequently amended, too.

<P>
I understand the Minister's reply to my second question. His position is defensible, but I am worried that the obligation is on the chief officer to take all reasonable steps to prevent something happening that would come within the provision if the officer under his command was involved. That is reasonable in one sense, but to take my previous example, a chief officer would have rules and exercise discipline. People would be expected not to drink on duty, not to misbehave, and so on. We need to be sure that the chief officer will not be clobbered because he has not addressed such activities. Provided that chief officers of police have proper disciplinary arrangements and rules for the conduct of their subordinates, they will be covered by what the Minister said. It would not be reasonable to cover someone who had not turned his mind to a particular activity that an individual then carried out. I think that we are on all fours on the matter. My hon. Friend will speak directly to the Law Society of Scotland and, if necessary, we can pursue the matter with the Minister outside the Committee Room and table a further amendment later if needs be. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. David Lidington </B>(Aylesbury): I beg to move amendment No. 35, in page 5, line 11, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(7) It shall be a defence in any proceedings under this Act for a chief officer of police to prove that an alleged act of discrimination occurred as a result of, or in pursuance of, any policing objective set by the Secretary of State under section 37 of the Police Act 1996.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The amendment would provide a statutory defence in proceedings under the measure for a chief officer of police who could prove that an alleged act of discrimination occurred as a result of, or in pursuance of, a policing objective which had been set for him by the Home Secretary under the Police Act 1996.

<P>
We dealt at length with the subject to which the amendment relates in our debates on indirect discrimination so I shall be brief. The Minister knows that senior officers have expressed their anxiety that the Bill could have unintended consequences and that litigation could be brought against them which would inhibit their freedom to use sensible, intelligence-led policing to secure the objectives set for them and their force by the Home Secretary and by the chief officers and their area commanders.

<P>
A hypothetical case would be that of the Home Secretary having laid it down as a national priority that the police should concentrate on seeking to reduce street crime. In a particular area a chief contable of his area commander may decide that the best way to meet the target is through surveillance and stop-and-search operations, but a disproportionate number-far more than its size as a proportion of the local population would lead one to expect-of those stopped or kept under surveillance were found to be from a particular ethnic group. The Minister has previously always asserted that the police have little to fear, provided that they stick to the rules laid down by the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, but the Government have conceded that there is a risk of litigation, at least in the first period of enactment, to test the implications and meaning of the Bill. There is a case for defending the police against spurious litigation so that they do not have to worry about it when trying to follow the priorities set for them by the Home Office. As the Home Secretary of the day sets the priorities, it is a matter of justice that he should defend them and that Ministers should defend any discrimination arising from their implementation-rather than leaving chief constables to fight their corner in court. However, I shall not press the amendment to a Division.

<P>
<B>Mr. Shaun Woodward </B>(Witney): Given that this is a race relations Bill, how significant is it that the amendment is not supported by the National Black Police Association or the Association of Police Authorities? Perhaps the hon. Gentleman would tell us what consultations he has had with them.

<P>
<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> I have consulted the National Black Police Association, to which I spoke as recently as today. It has doubts about the amendment, but recognises that the concerns that I have expressed in the debate are shared by many police officers who are not in any sense racist, who want racial discrimination to be countered and who want a successful policy of equal opportunities, but who do not want spurious challenges to legitimate police authorities. My conversations with police officers have been along those lines. One police area commander told me that quite a few people had been stopped in a campaign against street robbery and that a disproportionate number were from a British-Asian minority. Having reviewed his practice in the wake of the Macpherson report, he was disturbed by that; he was also put under much pressure from his local racial equality council and from ethnic minority leaders in the area about the situation. So he-rightly-went to the trouble of reviewing the matter case by case and having a full assessment done. That research showed that the relatively small number of individuals involved, who were mostly from that British-Asian minority, were being stopped because the police had good reason to believe, from intelligence information or from the individuals' history, that they were involved in the types of crime that they were targeting.

<P>
If the Bill is to command the widespread support that the Home Secretary has frequently said that he wants it to, it is of the utmost importance that such fears are sensibly tackled. They have been expressed by decent police officers who have no wish to put a spanner in the works of anti-racist legislation.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> It is right and unarguable that Ministers take responsibility for ministerial policy. However, the amendment is overly wide, and so suffers from the same danger as an earlier amendment, which the Government said that they would reconsider. For example, it would be a defence-a wide defence-under the amendment for any
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>chief officer  to prove that an alleged act of discrimination occurred as a result of, or in pursuance of, any policing objective.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Home Secretary sets policing objectives and a force normally then sets its objectives. Then there are divisional objectives all the way down the tree. It would be unreasonable for people to say that they were not guilty under the Act because they were prioritising and so dealing with street robbery, burglary or drugs enforcement. Chief officers could use the defence offered by the amendment to say that their actions were a result of what the Home Secretary gave them as an objective.

<P>
In legislation, we must be careful to be precise when offering defence, in the same way as we must be when offering opportunity for challenge. The amendment fails that test. It is dangerously wide, so it is not surprising that there are objections to it, as referred to by the hon. Member for Witney (Mr. Woodward) and others. It would seem to give an opt-out or-I shall make a pun and shall not make it again-a cop-out for senior police officers, so it should not be supported.

<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I note that the hon. Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Lidington) said that the amendment was probing. If he had not done so, I would describe it as a wrecking amendment. Ministerial priorities are broad and cover a great deal of policing. If we accepted the amendment, we would undermine a key recommendation of the Lawrence inquiry and one of the key purposes of the Bill.

<P>
I accept that the hon. Gentleman has provided me with an opportunity to reassure police officers that I hope that I can take. Intelligence policing is to be encouraged and will not be prevented by the Bill. If the inspector mentioned by the hon. Gentleman questioned his officers about why they stopped people who were disproportionately from ethnic minorities, and if they could justify that within the terms of the ordinary requirements of proper policing, he and they would be doing the right thing. That should not be a problem for the inspector or the other officers, and the inspector should be able to deal with it.

<P>
However, it is right that an inspector who identifies the fact that a disproportionate number of people from ethnic minorities has been stopped and searched asks questions about that. If the Bill prompts people to ask such questions and ensure that those actions are justified, it will have served part of its purpose.

<P>
The Government's view is that the clause is wide enough to apply virtually to all police work. The Home Secretary's policing objectives-or ministerial priorities-must be general to apply across the police service and provide a framework within which police forces can deal with local needs. For example, the priorities for 2000-01 are
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>to reduce crime and disorder in partnership with local authorities, other agencies, other local agencies and the public<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>to increase trust and confidence in policing amongst minority ethnic communities.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
The Home Secretary does not intend those priorities to absolve police officers of their responsibilities in respect of racial discrimination. It would be absurd for the second of those priorities to provide a defence to free police officers from liability. The first of those priorities covers large parts of police work. Under the proposed defence, it would be virtually impossible for chief officers to be held liable for any discriminatory action, and it would also be very difficult for the courts to determine what police activity fell within the scope of the priorities.

<P>
That is why I am pleased that the hon. Member for Aylesbury will not press the amendment. As I said, it is close to being a wrecking amendment, but I hope that he intended it to allow me to give some reassurance to police officers. I hope that I have given that. However, I cannot say that officers will somehow be absolved from the requirement not to discriminate racially, because that would be untrue. The clause reflects the Home Secretary's intention, and many police organisations support the idea that the police should be subject to the race relations legislation.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> As I said in my opening remarks, I will not press the amendment to a Division. My intention has always been to probe the Government's approach and seek the reassurances that the Minister gave. Given the impact of the Pepper v. Hart judgment, it is important to have those detailed assurances on the record. The Minister's assurances have satisfied my objective, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 36, in page 5, line 30, after second ``officer'' insert ``or other person''.

<P>
The amendment is technical and deals with the position of Kew constabulary, in which the person with direction and control of the force is not a police officer but a board of trustees. The amendment provides for a non-officer to have vicarious liability for the acts of non-regular officers. I commend the amendment to the Committee, for the benefit of the Kew police force.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I rise for two purposes. First, I defend the interests of my hon. Friend the Member for Richmond Park (Dr. Tonge), who looks after Kew and who will be delighted to know that her patch is covered. Secondly, I have a couple of questions about the breadth of the clause. Although the Minister tempts me to ask them, I will wait until the stand part debate.

<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I will now ask my two questions. Some people are surprised to learn of the number of police forces, because there are more than just the 43 police forces in England and Wales, the Scottish police forces and the Royal Ulster Constabulary. There are other forces, such as the British Transport police and so on. It would be helpful for the record if we could establish to which police forces the provision applies. I realise that they are defined generically in the police legislation, which has been amended to include titled and retitled. It would be helpful if the Minister could give us a list of the police forces that are not the mainstream forces in the four United Kingdon countries. That is why one could have spoken in the debate on the previous amendment. The situation is rather anomalous. For example, the police in the royal parks in London and others are swept in. It is sometimes slightly complicated for the citizen to know where authority lies.

<P>
Secondly, will Ministers set out the implications of new section 76A(4), which is the provision for payments out of the police fund? I ask that question because the issue of cost to police funds always arises when policing is discussed. The provision says that any compensation, costs or expenses awarded as the result of an action against the chief officer of police-in the case of the Kew police, the trustee-would come not out of public funds, in the general sense, but out of dedicated police funds.

<P>
Will the Minister explain what the police fund is, where it gets its money from and what the procedure is for its administration? I think that I know the answers, although I do not pretend to be an expert. I am really attempting to get some reassurance for the police or anyone else reading the provision who thinks that it constitutes a potential drain on the revenue given to police services by Government or the precept raised from local people, and that the money should come out of another fund. I raise that, because we are all aware that one of the big issues today is the consequences of the more litigious society-I think that that phrase was used in this Committee-in which increasing numbers of people are taking actions against health trusts and health authorities. From my constituency experience, I know-as I am sure other hon. Members know-that an increasingly large proportion of health authorities' and health trusts' budgets goes on meeting costs from claims for damages. We need some reassurance that that will not impact in any way on the allocated money given by Government or from precept to police services to carry out basic policing functions.

<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right to say that there are many police forces that we do not remember. In fact, there are 28 non-Home Office police forces, including the parks police, the British Transport police, the Epping forest rangers and the Northern Ireland airport police. We could go on. All those forces carry out a public function, even if they are employed by a private organisation. For example, I understand that some of the police officers who work for nuclear installations are privately employed. None the less, the provisions will cover those officers. We intend the legislation to embrace all police officers, in so far as they are carrying out the public functions of policing.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> Will the Minister let us have-it not on the record, by correspondence-an up-to-date list? Will he confirm that forces can be added and taken away only by amendment of primary legislation? Will he also confirm that a neighbourhood warden force or neighbourhood policing force set up by a borough under the new Home Office guidance will not be swept in? People need to know where they stand.

<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> If an organisation is carrying out a public function, and is sponsored by a public authority, it will be covered by the legislation. If I remember rightly, police forces are covered by the Police and Magistrates' Courts Act 1994. I think that they are listed in the directory. I remember my hon. Friend the Member for Thurrock (Mr. Mackinlay) speaking eloquently on those issues, and making sure that they were properly covered, all those years ago. He discussed the matter with me in a private conversation about the Bill, and I reassured him that all police forces were covered.

<P>
Compensation will be paid by the police from their funds, which is entirely proper. Chief constables should be aware that discrimination by their officers will affect the force's budget. However, I do not expect compensation to be a drain on funds. Chief constables and the commissioner will ensure, as far as they can, that racial discrimination does not occur. That is the objective of the Bill. If discrimination occurs, compensation must be paid. The chief constable or commissioner will have to take account of that in setting budgets.

<P>
On the litigious approach, our courts have been much more robust than those in other countries in dealing with promiscuous litigation-people who sue others for the sake of it. I hope that that aproach will continue, and police forces will be able to go about their proper and lawful business in a non-discriminatory way, without being burdened by unnecessary litigation. Within a relatively short period, our courts will make the boundaries clear and set precedents, which should clear up any doubts that police officers may have about the terms of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I have one last question. Is the technical definition of the police fund the moneys available to the police? If it is a term of art, it would suggest that there is an insurance fund, an indemnity fund or a fund held for the purpose of paying and meeting claims. If not, the money would come directly out of money that would be spent on other things.

<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Indeed, it means the amount of grant that a police force is given, and perhaps money raised by council tax in the local area. It is treated in the same way as an incident involving a police car or a police officer doing something tortious. In certain circumstances, a chief constable may become vicariously liable, and he or the commissioner may have to make a payment. That money would come from the police fund-the amount received in the police standard spending assessment and from council tax.

<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<P>
Clause 3, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<H4><center>Clause 4</center></H4>
<H4><center>Criminal investigations and proceedings</center></H4>

</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 24, 53 and 25.

<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> This set of amendments relates to clause 4, which inserts among others, proposed new subsections (4C), (4D) and (4E), provides for the court to grant a stay-which, in Scotland, is called a sist-of the Race Relations Act proceedings when there is a risk of prejudice to criminal investigations or proceedings. The policy aim is to strike a balance between ensuring that proper civil remedies are available for those who have suffered discrimination and that criminal offences are properly and effectively prosecuted without delay or prejudice to the prosecution case. All the amendments relate to balance and are aimed at getting it right.

<P>
I shall explain the purpose of the Government's amendment and then respond to the other amendments. Our amendment will simplify the complicated provisions under clause 4, which currently draw a distinction between the considerations that the court should take into account when deciding whether to grant a stay or sist, depending on whether the decision to institute criminal proceedings has, or has not, been made. In doing so, they create some complex provisions, which were commented on in another place.

<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
We have re-examined the provisions in the light of those discussions and have decided that they can, and should, be simplified. Clear and comprehensible provisions will be of benefit to public prosecutors, public investigators, claimants and the courts alike. The Government's amendment will achieve simplification. One test will have to be applied in respect of the granting of stays, whatever stage a criminal investigation or proceedings are at. It must be considered whether there would be a prejudice to an investigation, a decision to institute proceedings, or proceedings themselves, if the civil proceedings went ahead before the relevant criminal process had taken its course. It will be for the applicant for the stay-a public prosecutor, for example-to make out the case to the court. That will be the right test to apply.

<P>
As before, a stay or sist will not remove the availability of a remedy. Proceedings that have been stayed can be resumed when the grounds of the stay are no longer present, which brings me to amendments Nos. 24 and 25. The intention behind them is to ensure that, when a court stays Race Relations Act 1976 proceedings because of prejudice to a criminal investigation, a decision not to prosecute or criminal proceedings, the stay is only temporary, not permanent. That is a reasonable and laudable aim and the Government support it. Victims of discrimination should not be barred permanently from bringing proceedings-certainly not if the risk of prejudice to criminal investigations or proceedings has passed. However, the Government do not believe that the amendments are necessary for that aim to be achieved.

<P>
It is the very nature of a stay-or a sist-that it is temporary, not permanent. It does not dispose of the proceedings, but merely imposes a temporary halt on them. Proceedings can always be continued it the stay is lifted by the courts and parties to the proceedings have the right at any point to apply for a say to be lifted. That is set out in the civil procedure rules. Under the Bill, as drafted, the court could-as set out in the civil procedure rules-either stay proceeding generally or stay them until a specified time or event.

<P>
In either case, it will always be open to the parties to the proceedings to apply at any time for the stay to be lifted. It will always be open to a party to the proceedings to make representations to the court about a particular date or event until which time the court should grant the stay. For example, if criminal proceedings were expected to be concluded on a particular date, that could be the date on which the stay ceased to interfere with the civil proceedings.

<P>
The court will, under the Bill as drafted, consider each case on its merits, taking into account the information before it about why a stay was needed, any representations made to it about the length of the stay and its overriding objective of dealing with cases fairly. The Government have confidence that the courts will use that discretion properly and do not believe that there is any need to fetter such discretion by, for example, requiring a court to set specific time limits after which the parties must return to court. That will be appropriate in some cases, but in other cases it may be appropriate to leave it to the parties to request a lifting of the stay at a suitable time. So, for example, civil proceedings may be instituted or a stay might be ordered by a civil court or courts generally. In such circumstances, the criminal proceedings could go ahead.

<P>
The outcome of the criminal proceedings could well satisfy the initial applicant for a stay, who does not wish to continue with the proceedings. We would not want to put such applicants in a position when, in effect, by a specific date they had to continue with the proceedings or pay the cost of withdrawing them. It might be that, for their own reasons, they would wish merely to discontinue.

<P>
I hope that, knowing that a stay is not by its nature permanent, and that it would be open to the parties to any proceedings that had been stayed or sisted to apply for it to be lifted at any point, the hon. Members for Southwark, North and Bermondsey and for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine will not press their amendments.

<P>
Amendment No. 53 would require a court to grant a stay in all cases where there are related criminal and civil proceedings. As we have discussed, the Government believe that it should be possible for civil actions to proceed when there are related criminal proceedings, provided that the court is satisfied that continuance would not result in prejudice to criminal proceedings or investigations. Claimants in a civil case would have no right to action until any criminal action had been dispensed with, even if there was no possibility of it prejudicing the criminal action.

<P>

<B>Sir Robert Smith </B>(West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine): Will the Minister contemplate how the court can second-guess the proceedings of the civil case? It might not look as if it will conflict with the criminal case and then proceed into territory where the criminal proceedings will be damaged.

<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The issue arising from a civil case might well not have a direct bearing on the criminal action itself. It may relate to part of the process of investigation or an incident occurring during the course of it, and may not in any way impact the outcome of a criminal case. A civil judgment that does not bear on the outcome of the criminal action, that can be proceeded with and does not prejudice the criminal action in any way, can be resolved in one way or another without causing a problem to the criminal case.

<P>
The Government do not believe that a limitation on the rights of civil complaints is necessary or desirable and I hope that hon. Members will feel able to withdraw the amendment, having heard my explanation.

<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> It is welcome that the Government have reduced 20 lines to 10. It confirms my belief that parliamentary draftspeople are not perfect because they discover that they can correct themselves under a bit of pressure. The more we can put pressure on them to reduce the complex interrelationship of the legislation, the better. The Minister is right about that and I hope that he will encourage them to do so even more. The fewer cross-references we get, the better.

<P>
The Minister dealt reasonably with the point raised in amendments No. 24 and No. 25. I understand his explanation that since, by definition, a stay is a temporary phenomenon, it can be lifted at any time. I also now know that it is called a sist in Scotland; my hon. Friend the Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine, being intelligent, knew that all the time.

<P>
The question that remains is that raised by my hon. Friend in his intervention. Two protagonists have made representations to, I suspect, all members of the Committee. One is the Law Society of Scotland and the other is Justice. Amendment No. 53, if applied to the Bill as amended-if it is-by amendment No. 37, would take what will be subsection 4D and, as the Minister said, make it not discretionary, but mandatory. I understand the response, but I am still troubled that the Government may not have anticipated the example given by my hon. Friend the Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine. There is a moment at which the judge or sheriff makes a decision as to whether to proceed on the basis of the information available. They are not to know what may happen later. There is a danger that if one makes the judgment discretionary, the development of the other proceedings could have an adverse effect on the first. I do not say, and nor does my hon. Friend the Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine, that they should not be entitled to stop proceedings to get on with other things and let the other proceedings move to a conclusion. I was simply concerned that it may be necessary to come back to a decision more than once to avoid prejudice.

<P>
I step back to make the more general point to put that in context and to ask a question. Since before I was first elected I have been concerned about the interrelationship between civil and criminal proceedings and other activities that inquire into events. The clearest focus that I can give is not a race relations or race discrimination matter but the sinking of the Marchioness and its aftermath. There have been civil proceedings, criminal proceedings, inquests and now a publc inquiry, for which we are grateful. We still do not have a coherent interrelationship between those matters.

<P>
Towards the bottom of the Home Secretary's in-tray when he came into office were proposals that had been drawn up by civil servants to try to get to grips with that muddled interrelationship. The Lawrence case is another obvious example. Criminal proceedings clearly happened, but did not get anywhere. Civil proceedings are happening now. There has been an inquiry and there was clearly an inquest. Can the Minister tell us, preferably now, but otherwise on clause stand part, whether the Government have made any progress in trying to bring this together in the wider context, not just in the narrow choice between civil and criminal proceedings, to which the amendments relate?

<P>
This is a real issue of concern. It is an issue of frustration for citizens who have to juggle not just lawyers and legal proceedings that they may not feel comfortable with, but their emotions. Painful personal matters are often involved, whether is is a case of discrimination or worse. They often have to go round the circuit repeatedly and relive the events that they would rather were dealt with and out of the way. I need not elaborate for the Committee that the system oftens wins and prevails over the interests of the individual as he sees it. If the Minister could give me and, through me, many others, some comfort that these matters are on the early action agenda at the Home Office, it would be helpful.

<P>
The Home Secretary announced relatively recently-within the past year, I think-that some proposals would be brought forward. I guess that it will be a Green Paper, rather than anything more substantive. Can the Minister confirm or elaborate on that? I hope that it is appropriate to raise the matter here to save raising it later. This was a real concern in the Lawrence case and it has been of concern in many other cases. We should make the law and the inquiry system more user-friendly and effective in producing remedies.

<P>
<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> I should like to put two brief questions to the Minister. The first concerns the test that must be met if the court is to grant a stay of proceedings. Obviously the language of the Government amendment differs from the language in the Bill that it seeks to replace. I happily confess to not being a lawyer but, to my layman's reading, it looks as if the test is being altered somewhat. Will the Minister clarify that? Under the clause, a stay must be granted unless the court is satisfied that the Race Relations Act proceedings
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>would not prejudice any criminal investigation and would be unlikely to affect any issue which might arise in the criminal proceedings.<P>
</UL></FONT>
The new test imposed by the Government amendment is that the court must be
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``satisfied that the continuance of the proceedings  would not result in the prejudice alleged.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The new test seems much more concise than the current language. Have the grounds on which a court is able to grant a stay been narrowed by the Government amendment, or is it simply a draftman's more eloquent and succinct language, which conveys the same meaning?

<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
My second question develops a point mentioned by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey when he pointed out that the stay was granted by the discretion of the court and that it could be revisited at any time. We are all familiar with criminal proceedings that drag on interminably, especially if they go to appeal. In theory, a stay of proceedings under the Race Relations Act could be granted and could remain in force until an appeal has been heard through all possible stages. Does a general rule apply-for example, that the stay would automatically lapse at the conclusion of the first trial? Would a new application have to be made in the event of an appeal? How are the judges expected to exercise their discretion in this respect?

<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey asked about the circumstances in which a stay might be granted. An application can be made for a stay whenever there is a risk of prejudice during the course of a civil action or criminal cases. If it became clear at any point during a criminal prosecution or in relation to evidence presented to a civil court that prejudice to the trial was a possibility, an application for the stay of those proceedings could be made. That would allow the matter to be dealt with in the criminal courts.

<P>
The hon Gentleman rightly identified the concerns of those involved in complex, high-profile and stressful circumstances-Hillsborough, the Lawrence inquiry and the Marchioness inquiry-when there is often an interaction between civil, criminal and public inquiries, inquests and a series of other procedures. Highly complex issues are often involved for those wishing to bring matters into the open. In criminal courts, the burden is to prove ``beyond reasonable doubt''; in civil courts it is ``on the balance of probabilities''; and, in inquiries, evidence may simply have to be adduced. It is a complex matter and I am not sure that there is a simple solution. It will be for the law commissioners to examine at some point.

<P>
To answer the hon. Gentleman's question, I am not sure quite how far we have advanced in respect of resolving the issues. It may be best for me to write to him and set out exactly how we stand on these matters at present. As I said, I doubt whether they will readily be resolved. The Lawrence family, for example, first sought criminal proceedings, but then had to opt for an open judicial inquiry. The people involved may justifiably request different proceedings. Much work remains to be done.

<P>
The hon. Member for Aylesbury asked about the test that we would apply, which is worded:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>unless it is satisfied that the continuance of the proceedings under subsection (1) would not result in the prejudice alleged.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If a prosecutor thought that a matter brought before a civil court might prejudice the outcome, he need only raise that issue before the civil court to obtain a stay. The court and the judge would have to be satisfied that the continuance of the proceedings would not result in the prejudice alleged. The prosecutor would need to show that there was a case, and the judge would have to satisfy himself on the basis of the test.

<P>
By simplyfying the provisions in our original proposals into a single test, it may appear easier for cases to be stayed when the decision to institute criminal proceedings has not been made. However, in practice it will still be for the applicant-the public prosecutor-to make out to the satisfaction of the court that there is a possibility of prejudice. If the court is not satisfied, it will not grant the stay. On balance, we believe that simplification is consistent with maintaining the primacy of criminal proceedings, so that where a liberty is at stake there should be no prejudice to the outcome of the proceedings.

<P>
The hon. Member for Aylesbury asked about appeals. It would be a matter for the court to determine at what point a stay or a sist was lifted. The courts might take an initial view that after the first-instance trial the stay ought to be lifted; they might even make an order to that effect. If a prosecutor made an application, it would then be a matter for the court to consider whether, given that an appeal is in progress, the stay or sist should be reinstated. That would depend on several things, and it would be entirely a matter for the court. If, at the end of a criminal matter, a judge said that the issue should be referred to a higher court, it would be a material matter for the civil court to decide whether the stay should continue. If, on the other hand, it seemed that a matter had been satisfactorily resolved and that the appeal was frivolous or had little likelihood of success, the civil court would bear that in mind when weighing the test before it. The hon. Member for Aylesbury asked me whether the process would be automatic; it would not be, because it would remain a matter for the civil court.

<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>

<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 38, in page 7, line 8, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`or would reveal the reasons behind a decision not to institute, or a decision not to continue, criminal proceedings'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The amendment is necessary to improve the Bill. It was improved too much on Report in the House of Lords, which inadvertently lost the provisions that are reintroduced by the amendment.

<P>
We need to make it clear that the court should not draw adverse inferences from the failure of a public prosecutor or investigator to reply to a section 65 questionnaire, if the respondent reasonably believed that to reply would be likely to reveal the reasons behind a decision not to institute or to continue criminal proceedings. The need to prevent the Race Relations Act from being used to getting behind decisions not to prosecute is acknowledged by the Committee and is dealt with through the exemption under section 19D.

<P>
Notwithstanding the section 19D exemption, a claimant with a case against the public investigator or prosecutor on other grounds could, through a section 65 questionnaire, seek information about a decision not to prosecute. Under the provision as drafted, the court is not prevented from drawing adverse inferences from a failure to reply when the respondent reasonably believes that a reply would reveal the reasons behind a decision not to prosecute. That eventuality was dealt with previously under the Bill when it was introduced in the other place, but was lost when we simplified the provision on Report. Such a provision needs to be reinstated and the amendment will achieve that.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> Thank goodness for a two-Chamber Parliament; may the right hon. Member for Chesterfield (Mr. Benn) be reminded regularly of that. If we did not have such a system-whoever sits in the second Chamber-many Bills could go wrong. At least it reduces the chance of that happening. Perhaps we should also be aware of the existence of the word processor.

<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 26, in page 7, line 13, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(4D) Without prejudice to subsections (4A) and (4B), the person aggrieved may re-serve on a subsequent date any questions to which the respondent has not replied in reliance on subsection (4B), and the prescribed periods referred to in subsection (3) shall not apply provided the questions had been served initially within the prescribed period.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The object of the amendment is to enable the victim of discrimination to seek replies to questions that are relevant to the alleged acts of discrimination when initially the respondents were able to avoid replying on the grounds that to do so could prejudice a criminal investigation or criminal proceedings. The amendment would prevent the same grounds being relied on to avoid answering any or some questions, but if there ceases to be a risk of prejudice to an investigation of proceedings, the police officer or prosecutor should be expected to provide answers. If they failed to do so, they would risk the court drawing an inference.

<P>
We all know that, as cases continue, matters that appear to be central to an investigation are overtaken by other events, evidence and so on. It is important for the system to have the flexibility to re-serve a question if it were necessary to avoid the prejudice that the discrimination is meant to deal with. It is a way in which to ensure that opportunities are not lost, if they are needed to protect people against discrimination. The issue is not wide, but it raises certain points. I hope that it will achieve a positive response. If the amendment needs to go through the word processor in the Home Office, I should be happy for it to do so.

<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> A word processor will not be necessary and nor is the amendment. The provision already enables the applicant to do what the hon. Gentleman wishes. The clause is drafted in such a way that it applies only if the respondent has a reasonable belief at the time that the court is considering whether to draw an inference that there is likely to be prejudice of one of the types set out in the Bill. The amendment is reasonable and laudable. We do not seek to prevent a respondent from replying to a section 65 questionnaire for a prolonged period, only when there is a likelihood or risk that the court will draw an adverse inference. Once that period has passed, respondents would be obliged to reply to a section 65 questionnaire in a reasonable time.

<P>
There is no distance between the Government and the hon. Gentleman. We do not need the assistance of a word processor. We need an interpretation of the legislation that will lead us to the same conclusion: that we have achieved what he seeks. Therefore, I hope that he will agree that the amendment is not needed.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> It may be inappropriate for an Opposition politician, but I shall not be cynical. Instead, I shall accept that there may be logic in the Government's argument. I shall go away, double check and take advice, and I shall take comfort if the objective has been met elsewhere. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B> Mr. Lidington:</B> I have a brief point about the Minister's comments that was covered in the other place. It concerns proposed new section 57(4A) of the Race Relations Act 1976, which will make a remedy other than damages unobtainable in a case when the court thinks that to proceed would prejudice a criminal investigation or institute criminal proceedings. Nevertheless, damages may still be awarded. The inference of that is that damages could be obtainable even if the court believed that to award damages could risk prejudicing a criminal investigation or instituting criminal proceedings.

<P>
From my reading of debates in the other place, I understand that the Government take the view that a balance must be struck and that it would be wrong to deny anything, even damages, to someone entitled to a remedy. Surely there is a point of principle. If even the award of damages might prejudice criminal proceedings, it should not be available. In the public's view, a civil award of damages often signifies guilt or innocence; I hesitate to use the word ``guilt'', as it means something different in the context of a civil case.

<P>
Lord Cope moved an amendment to tackle the problem with the provision. I hope that the Minister will respond now or write to me about the matter, which causes me some nagging concern.

<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> We take the view that a balance must be achieved. The Government reached the conclusion that damages and declarations ought logically to be treated in the same way under the provision. If, as we believe, there is no need to restrict the court's ability to award damages, there should be no need to restrict the court's ability to make a declaration.

<P>
On Report in another place, we tabled an amendment to remove the restriction on the court's ability to make a declaration. The main concern should be to ensure that the provision achieves a proper balance, and that it does not prejudice the outcome of the investigation or the prosecution process.

<P>
The Government propose to leave unamended the test that should be applied when the court considers granting injunctive relief as that is the proper test in those circumstances. It is unlikely that the award of damages or a declaration would prejudice criminal proceedings or investigations once discrimination had been found. Remedies such as injunctive relief would require action to be taken in respect of evidence that has been, or is in the process of being, gathered that could compromise a criminal investigation or proceedings. Other remedies, such as the award of damages, would not have that effect and would not prejudice the way in which proceedings continued.

<P>
When there would be a prejudicial effect from the finding of discrimination, we propose that, rather than preventing a claimant from obtaining a finding or a remedy, the courts would be able to stay the proceedings. For example, if, in the circumstances that the hon. Gentleman cited, it was anticipated that damages were likely to produce a belief in the public mind that someone had been found guilty of an action, or the police had been identified as acting improperly, as a result of civil proceedings, the prosecutor could, at any stage, ask for a stay or a sist.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take Government amendments Nos. 42 to 50.

<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The amendments provide for claims under the Race Relations Act to be heard by an immigration appellate authority as part of the one-stop appeals procedure established by the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999. Existing arrangements under the Race Relations Act provide that claims are heard in a designated county court or, in Scotland, a sheriff court.

<P>
The Government want to ensure that in immigration and asylum cases all outstanding issues relating to the decision should be considered by the immigration appellate authorities at one time, to avoid the delays attendant upon successive and separate rights of appeal.

<P>
The arrangements set out in clause 5 will allow claims of unlawful race discrimination to be considered with human rights issues and other matters relating to an immigration decision in a fair hearing before an independent appellate authority. When an immigration claim is upheld, the matter will be referred to a county or sheriff court to assess any damages. However, the creation of another route within the Race Relations Act for the hearing of a race relations complaint carries a risk that each review body will consider the complaint and reach different conclusions. The amendment prevents a county or sheriff court from overturning a decision of the immigration appellate authorities in respect of an immigration claim, ensuring a swifter outcome to that claim.

<P>
Although the Government welcome the opportunity to provide that race relations complaints are considered swiftly and are given a fair hearing, we also recognise the need to ensure that the system is not used abusively, with the sole intention of delaying the enforcement of an immigration decision.

<P>
The amendment achieves that by preventing a further appeal to the county or sheriff court after an immigration claim has been heard and dismissed by the immigration appellate authorities. It also prevents the county or sheriff court from reviewing the immigration decision to which a claim relates. The purpose is to deter a person from withholding a claim from the immigration appellate authorities in order to pursue the matter in the county or sheriff court once their right of appeal under part IV of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 has been exhausted.

<P>
The amendments to clause 5 include a consequential amendment concerning the power to grant leave to appeal outside the normal time limits for lodging an appeal to the immigration appellate authorities. The amendment ensures clarity regarding the restriction on the lodging of the claim to the county or sheriff court under section 57(A)(1). Without the amendment there would be conflicts about whether a claim to a county or sheriff court had been validly lodged in the event that the time for lodging an appeal to the immigration appellate authorities was extended in any circumstances.
 
<P>
Amendments to clauses 5 and 9 and detailed consequential amendments to schedule 2 extend the arrangements in respect of immigration claims to appeals under the Special Immigration Appeals Commission. The commission was established to provide a full right of appeal in cases with a national security element where sensitive material may need to be brought before a court. Appeals to SIAC fall under the one-stop process established by part IV of the Asylum and Immigration Act 1999 and it makes sense for immigration claims in respect of national security cases to fall under the same procedures.

<P>
The amendments to schedule 2 introduce several other measures, including provision that person making a claim to the immigration appellate authorities be denied access to the assistance provided by section 65 of the Race Relations Act for obtaining information from the respondent about the alleged act of discrimination. This will ensure that the same procedures are followed in an immigration claim made to the immigration appellate authorities as in any other immigration case. It will keep the administrative processes efficient in terms of obtaining and maintaining a faster system. The consequential amendments include a provision in respect of immigration claims to the county or sheriff's court made outside the framework for appealing to the immigration appellate authorities.

<P>
The amendment provides that such claims be subject to the same six months' time limit by the Race Relations Act for the lodging of non-immigration claims. I repeat that there should be little incentive for claimants to adopt this route as the amended clause 5 prevents the county or sheriff's court from revealing the immigration decision to which a claim relates. However, it will provide an avenue of redress for those who wish to complain of discrimination by the Immigration and Nationality Department in reaching a decision. it will not affect the way in which cases are disposed of by way of an immigration decision but it may be a matter that it might be wise to have considered.

<P>
An important amendment is the application to immigration appeals of the certification procedure for an action expressly authorised by a Minister of the Crown. This provision is in section 62(2) of the Race Relations Act. The amendment ensures that where a Minister certifies that he has approved certain arrangements, that certificate shall be conclusive evidence. In addition, an amendment to schedule 4 of the Act which inserts a new section 9A allows the Secretary of State to certify an immigration claim if in his opinion it was manifestly unfounded. In such circumstances, it would only serve to delay the enforcement of an immigration decision if a person was allowed to pursue an appeal to the immigration appeals tribunal where an ajudicator was satisfied that the action concerned had been correctly certified. The amendment provides that in these circumstances there is no further right of appeal to a tribunal. The amendments are consistent with our policy of producing what we wish to be a firm, fast and fair immigration system.

<P>
<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> The amendments seem sensible on the whole. They are designed to preserve the integrity of the Government's one-stop appeal process for immigration and asylum hearings. My question concerns the extent to which the possibility of appeals on the ground of racial discrimination might add to the work load of the immigration appeal tribunal and what assessment, if any, the Government have made of the impact of appeals using that route on the resources that the tribunal would need to carry out its work.

<P>
The Government's financial impact statement appended to the explanatory notes to the Bill stated in paragraph 85 that one consequence of the Bill is likely to be
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>significant costs to the legal aid budget arising from cases starting in the Immigration Appellate Authority.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the number of cases is difficult to predict.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I wonder whether the Government's thinking on the matter has advanced since publication of the notes.

<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> Like you, Mr. O'Hara, I noticed that the word processor had failed to perform an effective exercising function. The amendment would replace a subsection consisting of some 13 lines with about three times as many.

<P>
<B>Sir Robert Smith:</B> The amendment has 59 lines.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> My hon. Friend had nothing better to do in the previous debate than add up the number of lines in the amendment. That amendment is only the first of a draft that the Government have tabled.

<P>
I want to ask the Minister two questions. The first concerns the general proposition and the second concerns the last amendment in the group. In part, both questions touch on the issue raised by the hon. Member for Aylesbury.

<P>
As I understand it, the Government are proposing that, where the only appeal process in the system provides a remedy, that process must be used in the first instance. I agree that that is the correct next step, and I have always been of the view that we needed to consolidate the appeals system and structures contained in the previous legislation. The system and structures were often used to the full-to use a neutral phrase-by applicants. That is understandable if the alternative was to return to a place to which one would rather not return.

<P>
Let us consider the case of an appellant who appeals against a decision that he believes to be discriminatory. He goes through the appeal process, but the appellate authority decides that the original decision was lawful, and the appellant is not vindicated in respect of any of the issues that were raised, including discrimination. What course of action is open to the appellant? I assume that he could take judicial review proceedings, which cannot be excluded by a streamlined appeals procedure. Just as one can bring a tribunal matter before the court system, it must be possible to bring such a case before the High Court, on the basis that the original decision, or the decision on appeal, was wrong in law.
 
<P>
It would seem, therefore, that there are two ways in which a person could argue that, on the basis of the facts, a decision was wrong in law. I should be grateful for a simple answer from the Minister, in which he paints a picture of the processes involved, rather than giving a verbal explanation of the change.

<P>
My second question relates to amendment No. 50, which would amend schedule 4 of the Race Relations Act 1976 by inserting a paragraph at the end. I believe that the rest of that schedule relates to the Sex Discrimination Act 1975, to which the amendment would add a paragraph on racial discrimination. The Minister alluded to the circumstances in which the Secretary of State can intervene to say that a claim is manifestly unfounded. According to my understanding of the amendment, were the Secretary of State to certify that a claim relating to an appeal was manifestly unfounded, that would relate both to the claim in general and-where it is part of the general claim-the claim of racial discrimination.

<P>
I want to explore how, when and why Secretaries of State would intervene. I am aware that letters have been written and decisions taken on this matter in the past, but I am unaware of the prevalence or the process. Effectively, the decision is an administrative one when the Minister acts in a quasi-judicial capacity to bar other procedures. I would therefore be grateful for an explanation from the Minister as to when the provision would bite and whether it can be challenged anywhere in the legal system.

<P>
I do not object to the amendments. However, it is essential to ensure that we have an efficient appeals system in which people can put their cases on the grounds of discrimination, or on other grounds. We must not preclude the normal remedies that people expect to be applicable.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I thank the hon. Member for Aylesbury for his support. The application of the one-stop appeals procedure to complaints involving immigration and asylum applicants will avoid unnecessary delays in the immigration system, thus reducing the burdens on IND. In practice, we expect that race issues will form just one of a series of grounds for appeal, all of which will be considered together by the immigration appellate authority. It is likely that we will add it to the list, but sometimes the list is quite long and sometimes it is focused on a narrow issue-we shall have to wait to see what happens. We do not anticipate that a person would normally seek to determine the outcome of their immigration status by making an application in relation to the race relations legislation. Even if a finding were to be made against IND, that might result in damages but would not necessarily affect the person's immigration status.

<P>
The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey asked whether judicial review would still be available under the one-stop procedure. The answer is yes. Judicial review is always a possibility; we cannot exclude it. If the immigration appeal tribunal or the Secretary of State behaved in an improper way it would clearly be open to an appropriate court to deal with that. In many immigration cases, the Minister is judicially reviewed at least to the single judge level. At that stage, most judicial reviews tend to get filtered out-many are frivolous. Others, however, go past the single judge level and are dealt with at the divisional court.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked about the position of manifestly unfounded claims in relation to amendment No. 50. Such cases are subject to a fast-track appeal system and can be dealt with very quickly by the appellate authorities. He asked whether that may involve the possibility of judicial review. Again, the answer is yes; there is always that possibility. We cannot prevent the courts from exercising their normal powers to oversee administrative decisions.

<P>
In my experience-I say this as the most judicially reviewed Minister in the Government, although no doubt my hon. Friend the Minister of State, Home Office the hon. Member for Hornsea and Wood Green (Mrs Roche) will eventually overtake me-the single judge tends to adopt a fairly robust approach in such cases if the decision that is brought before him has been properly arrived at. It is not an enormous problem for us nowadays, especially as the High Court tends to deal with immigration cases quite quickly. If they go past the single judge level to the divisional court, however, they may take longer. That would happen if a single judge had determined that a legal issue was in dispute. Having dealt with those points, I hope that hon. Members will now be able to support the Government's amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> No one would argue that the issues touched on here are important in term of rights, entitlements and procedures. I will, without formally opposing or forcing a division on the amendments, reserve our position on them. My hon. Friend the Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine and I will take further advice on the matter. I do not pretend to be an expert, having been spared serving on the Standing Committee of the Immigration and Asylum Bill. I was not transferred to this brief until the end of its deliberations, so I am expert only on the final amendments that were tabled to it on Report. I am also aware of the general provisions of that Bill. We shall examine this matter further and may wish to come back to it later. I am grateful for the indication that both procedures will remain capable of judicial review; that must be right.

<P>
I have a further reflection on the matter, which may need to be examined in greater detail, and to which I shall refer again later in the context of human rights legislation. It is that there may be a case for creating more clearly a division of the High Court that deals with administrative and/or immigration and asylum matter. The courts have developed areas of expertise-for example, in commercial courts and family courts. One does not have a specialised area of administrative law, as that applies across the whole range of public policy and lawmaking. None the less, although there may be a de facto nomination of individual judges to deal with matters such as these, the law has changed a great deal and other considerations and interrelationships apply. There could, therefore, be a case for suggesting to the Lord Chancellor and colleagues in other Departments that we should re-examine the way in which we organise these matters. That may not principally be a matter for the Home Office, although it could have Home Office input.

<P>
We need-to borrow a term used elsewhere-fair decisions to be made as fast as possible by competent and experienced authorities, whether they are cases before tribunals or judges. We must ensure that those people are fully qualified to make those decisions. It may be wise to think through the judicial structures, as well as those of the tribunals and administration.

<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I want to make a couple of general points, because this is the last time that we shall discuss matters relating to immigration and asylum in relation to the individual clauses.

<P>
I shall hark back to our debate on clause 1, one of whose provisions concerns the exception that prevents challenge on the basis of discrimination when dealing with the immigration and nationality functions of the Home Office. The provision made specific reference to nationality and to ethnic and national origins. I want to put down a marker that the proposals raise issues across the range of IND functions and decisions made by officials, Ministers and the adjudication tribunals. We need to ensure that we do not preclude one of the most sensitive areas of decision making-in relation to its impact on people of different ethnic, national and racial and other origins-from being exempt from the normal adjudication that guarantees equality of treatment and fair play.

<P>
I do not want to repeat the debate that we had the other day. I understand the complexities that are involved when one carries out intelligence-led investigations into illegal immigration or importation practices. None the less, wide policy issues are involved. A combination of exclusion provisions and tight legislative restrictions may mean that an area is effectively removed from challenge on the basis of race relations legislation.

<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
The provisions emerged relatively late in the day and have improved the precision of the immigration appeals procedures, and the comments of Ministers the other day suggest that we are likely to return to this matter on Report. We welcome the changes that the Government have accepted in other areas, but in this regard we still need to establish whether it is proper to have as much of an exemption. I have not come to a final view. I do not pretend that there is an absolutist position. My hon. Friend the Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine and I will reconsider the matter, take advice and establish other people's responses to our debates. We must ensure that people are not precluded from asserting their rights to the same treatment on the basis of equality as is provided for in other areas.

<H4><center>Clause 6</center></H4>
<H4><center>National security</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> No amendment has been tabled to the clause, which deals with national security implications. It will not be possible for a respondent to rely on the national security argument as an automatic defence, which is welcome, or to pray in aid national security as a defence for a claim involving racial discrimination, which is also welcome.

<P>
The general defence will be removed, but a specific defence will be available. If someone makes a complaint, the respondent-the Department or public authority, as defined in earlier provisions-will be able to argue that a particular act of discrimination was justified for the purposes of safeguarding national security. Where do Ministers expect such provisions to bite and what differences will there be in practice? Will claims that were not previously possible be permitted? I do not have a problem in this regard, but it is important for the legislation to contain a national security provision. My hon. Friend the Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine and I believe that such defences must be justified in every case. We must be careful not to establish a system in which it is sufficient to plead an argument on behalf of a public authority. That should not be the end of the debate.

<P>
The second part of the relevant provisions are contained in clause 7. How much could be revealed in this context, and what do Ministers expect the procedure to be? I realise that clauses 6 and 7 trespass on the same territory, and that some of the matters that we discuss now may not need to be discussed again when we debate clause 7. I thought it appropriate to raise them at the earliest opportunity.

<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The hon. Gentleman will be interested to know that the clause is in fact a liberalisation measure. It remedies an ECHR incompatibility in the Race Relations Act 1976 by removing the power of a Minister of the Crown to issue a conclusive national security certificate in cases brought under the Act. Conclusive national security certificates were found by the European Court of Human Rights in the case of Tinnelly and McElduff to be incompatible with article 6(1) of the ECHR.

<P>
The clause also changes the national security defence such that it will no longer be sufficient to argue that a discriminatory act was done for the purposes for national security. The act must also be justified by that purpose. The provision will enhance people's ability to assert their rights without endangering national security. It will ensure that the system provides precisely what the hon. Gentleman suggests-an exemption when that is required but that that exemption is the minimum that is necessary to protect national security. That is what clauses 6 and 7 are designed to do.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> That was a wonderful speech, but, as far as I could tell, it left no one any wiser. Having given him rather an easy time for the past few hours, I shall press the Minister further to explain what the difference will be. I thought that I had made it clear that the clause was a liberalisation measure.

<P>
The clause amends the generic blanket defence, requiring a particular defence. What sort of cases would be allowed to proceed now that will not be allowed to proceed in future? I understand that the Government approach the matter in light of the ruling that blanket defences are unacceptable, and I understand how the European convention has impacted on current legislation, but I am trying to establish the practical difference for the employee of GCHQ-an obvious example-or the Ministry of Defence, for example. Someone working in the armed forces, perhaps on a nuclear submarine, might, for example, bring a case relating to promotion, alleging discrimination in the choice of person to take on a particular job. I understand that sensitive matters may be involved, but I am trying to estbalish how the change will advantage people in any of those categories.

<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The hon. Gentleman has me on the run, as it is difficult to identify examples. In 25 years, the procedure has been used in one case, which does not seem to have gone terribly well. In 1998, the European Court of Human Rights made a judgment on the case of Tinnerley and McElduff, both from the United Kingdom. The case related to the issue of such a certificate under the Fair Employment (Northern Ireland) Act 1976, which halted proceedings for discrimination on the grounds of religious belief or political opinion.

<P>
The court held that the issue of the certificate breached the applicant's article 6 right of access to a court, as the conclusive nature of the certificate prevented a judicial determination of the merits of the underlying discrimination case. In such circumstances, which involve an issue of religious belief or political opinion, the provision is likely to apply. Giving examples proves slightly difficult, as in practice such cases seldom arise. Although, in a sense, the provision should be in most Bills in order to protect our national security, I doubt that many cases in the next 25 years will bear deeply on the issue.

<P>
It is feasible that an issue of racial discrimination would have to be justified by a Minister. He would have to show, if he had a certificate, that national security was involved. I doubt whether there will be many such cases, but the hon. Gentleman could argue that it is important to get the principle right even if there is only one such case, and of course he would be correct. However, we must also ensure that there is a national security provision, which I believe we have achieved. I cannot take the matter much further; he has me on the run.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I am grateful to the Minister. We may have heard of the one and only case that is of interest. His response is better than those we have heard in Committee even this year, when, although there have been no relevant cases, the Government have still said, ``We need this power. It is very important.'' At least there is some vindication for that in this context. We have again attested to the benefit of the European convention. We are grateful that we have moved in such a direction and will monitor with interest the number of applications over the next 25 years.

<P>
I have a specific question that would more appropriately be raised in debate of clause 7. For the time being, though progress is limited, I shall look forward to hearing any examples that people may share with us or others.

<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I have just thought of the sort of case that might need such a certificate. Let me run through it.

<P>
If the person in a national security case alleges that a decision was made by way of racial discrimination, a Minister could look at the circumstances and conclude that there is no evidence. However, if the case were to proceed elsewhere on that basis, substantial delay in determining it would result, perhaps affecting the expelling of a person from the country. The person would be able to argue before a civil court that they could remain in this country in order to pursue a race relations claim. In those circumstances, the Minister would have to justify that as a national security case, but would not have to deal with all the arguments. He could simply provide the certificate to show that the case was one of genuine national security and that there was a justification for his decision.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> The debate has been useful. Liberal Democrat spokesmen on defence and foreign affairs dealt with this matter at the time of the Scott inquiry. They considered it at length and evaluated it, and I shall certainly talk to them again before Report. Content with flushing out the Government's intention, I am content to leave the matter for now.

<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<P>
Clause 6 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<H4><center>Clause 7</center></H4>
<H4><center>National security: procedure</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> My specific question, which relates to new section 67A, concerns the implementation of clause 6 and the provision for allowing the rules to be set out and inserted into the 1976 Act. Clause 7 enables
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a court in which relevant proceedings have been brought, where it considers it expedient in the interests of national security<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
to exclude various people from the court and the hearing, including the claimant or their representative. My question is about consistency and clarity of legal procedure. Again, it harks back most recently to debates in which the hon. Member for Aylesbury and I took part on the Terrorism Bill.

<P>
There have-at least in recent times-always been powers to exclude people from certains hearings in the interests of national security, certainly in the context of terrorism. There should be a common procedure and way of testing its validity across different areas of judicial practice. My concern is that a court, in any context, should be able to use these powers in only one way. Everyone should know that the same rules apply and that the courts follow the same procedures-they have to give the same notice, they must offer the same opportunities for legal argument before exclusion and there must be the same powers of challenge and so on.

<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
Is that the case at present? I deduce that it is not. My deduction is that the measure provides for the drawing up of court rules that are made under the white book. I do not think that it is the same as the procedures that we discussed in the context of the existing terrorism legislation and the Terrorism Bill that replaces it. I do not see why it should not be the same; nor do I see, in the context of a UK-wide Bill, which the Terrorism Bill is supposed to be, why different criteria should apply in Scotland, Northern Ireland, England or Wales.

<P>
If a court is persuaded that a claimant or defendant's representatives should be excluded, common rules and procedures should apply. Practitioners, students and those who might be affected should be able to check procedures and remedies in procedure or practice books.

<P>
If any of us were in court and were told that proceedings had to be in camera because a matter of national security had arisen, surely there would have to be a trial within a trial before the court could proceed; otherwise, someone would clearly be prejudiced. I should be grateful to know that that right remains and that it will not be excluded by the clause.

<P>
<B>Sir Robert Smith:</B> I want to reinforce some of the concern that has been expressed about the clause. The Law Society of Scotland expressed concern about the whole clause, but especially about subsection (2), which deals with the power of the Attorney-General, or the Advocate General in Scotland, to appoint representatives. It felt that, as a member of the Government would appoint the representative, the subsection might conflict with the ECHR on the right to an impartial trial. It was not clear who that representative would be.

<P>
The notes on clauses offer the precedent of the Employment Relations Act 1999, which dealt with employees of the security service, although the terrorism legislation might have been more relevant as it deals with the courts. Much concern has been expressed about sections of that Act, but at least it could be argued that it was a closed situation because it dealt with employees who knew that their rights would be changed as a result of their working in the security services. Under this clause, however, we are considering the relationship of any citizen to a public body and how that affects the citizen's rights. The scope is wider, so it needs to be looked at carefully. I seek some reassurance about compatability with the European court.

<P>
It is obviously nice to know clearly where we stand in Scotland, and that we will have a different court procedure from that in England and Wales, but will the Minister clarify where the boundary lines lie with the ECHR? How does the ECHR affect decisions taken in a Scottish court on a reserved matter? The processes in the Scottish court are obviously not reserved and therefore are subject to direct challenge in the courts under the ECHR. When challenged on reserved matter, Ministers would be advised to propose amendments. Is the Minister confident that there is not a conflict with the ECHR? Perhaps he will address the argument of my hon. Friend the Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey, and relate it to court proceedings rather than an employment tribunal.

<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> May I first clarify my earlier comments? We have checked the case that came under the provisions in relation to national security matter. It appears that the case that went to the European Court of Human Rights was not that in which the certificate was issued. The case that went to the European Court of human Rights, and gave rise to the decision, was under the Fair Employment (Norhter Ireland) Act 1976. It has been used only once in the past 25 years, so the number of such cases is not large.

<P>
As I indicated, clause 6 removes Ministers' powers to issue a conclusive national security certificate in relation to non-employment cases, thus enabling such cases to be brought in the civil courts. The effect of clause 6 is clear. However, if clause 7 were omitted, a court hearing cases that dealt with national security matters would not be able to take important measures to safeguard national security, such as keeping secret all or part of the proceedings. Under clause 6, it is possible, in certain limited circumstances, to bring a case under the Race Relations Act 1976. If the Minister fails to justify the national security provisions, the matter may come before the court. However, that does not deal with the question of bringing confidential matters before the court. Will such matters of national security be open to the applicant to hear and form a view on? Will he be able to pass on to other people information that might endanger national security? Clause 7 ensures that procedures are available to protect national security, so we do not throw the baby out with the bath water. Issues that are clearly of a sensitive nature must be protected. We were especially anxious to comply with article 6 of the convention, and to ensure that safeguards are in place.

<P>
The special advocate procedure, which was introduced in the Special Immigration Appeals Commission legislation, enables the appointment of a special advocate by the court. That person would be a senior and independent counsel, who did not owe allegiance directly to the client. In the relationship between barrister and client, the barrister must disclose to his client relevant information that may affect the case. However, the special advocate procedure is different. An independent barrister-usually a senior barrister-is appointed, who will speak on behalf of the client, argue his case and take instructions from him, but will be under no obligation to disclose to him matter of national security that may be heard by the court. A barrier is placed between the special advocate and the client. That my have some prejudicial effect on the client, as he will not know everything that is heard by the court. However, that is for good reason. The European convention on human rights is a balanced piece of legal artwork-that is as it should be, given that British lawyers wrote it in 1951. The balance within article 6 can be struck so that issues of national security can be held in confidence, provided that that is justified, and provided that the circumstances of the applicant are not unduly prejudiced. The special advocate procedure provides protection for the applicant.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Sir Robert Smith:</B> The Minister talked about a court appointing a special advocate. I may have misread the provision, but presumably it would be the Advocate General or the Attorney General in this case.

<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right. If I remember rightly, the Advocate General or the Attorney General would in such cases appoint the special advocate. I seem to remember it from when I was dealing with the Special Immigration Appeals Commission Bill. The special advocate is an officer of the court, with a duty to the court. His duty is not to his client but to the court; his duty is to represent his client on behalf of the court. He is appointed not by the court, but, as the hon. Gentleman rightly said, by the Attorney General or the Advocate General for Scotland. In those circumstances, a special advocate is accountable to the court and not to the client.

<P>
<B>Sir Robert Smith:</B> So he is accountable to the court and not accountable to the Advocate General or the Attorney General.

<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> That is right. He is accountable to the court in the same way as a Crown prosecutor is accountable to the court for ensuring that he delivers justice when he prosecutes a case. The special advocate will be accountable to the court for ensuring that he defends the applicant's interests and rights-indeed, he will be able to obtain information from him-even though he will not take instructions from the applicant, as instructions will come from the court. He will in effect be an officer of the court, appointed to ensure that the applicant's interests are protected.

<P>
One could make a comparison with a guardian ad litem, who is in a position of trust to act on a person's behalf, even though he does not always have to do what that person requires him to do or communicate information that it may be improper to pass to his client.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for dealing with most of the points. One thing that, probably inadvertently, he did not pick up was my question about whether we have-or, if we do not have, could have-a common set of court rules that are applicable across the areas where this issue arises. I gave an example earlier. The clause allows rules, but it is not clear whether the rules would be the same. I asked the Minister the supplementary question whether, if the court said that it wanted to go in camera and ask for the claimant to withdraw, there was an opportunity for that to be argued internally before the procedural decision was upheld and followed by the court.

<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I am not sure whether it is possible to organise an identical set of procedures and rules. To some extent the White Book will apply if national security matters that might involve similar procedures come before the divisional court or the High Court. However, in the case of the Special Immigration Appeals Commission, we hope that the procedures will be more straightforward. The same protections would exist. Instead of trying to apply a set of rules that might be effective in the divisional court or another court to the simpler and more straightforward situation of the special immigration appeals tribunal, which may meet only four or five times a year, there are arguments for keeping the rule-making separate. The rule-making will be public and one rule will be based on another, but it may not be necessary for SIAC to have all the extra procedures that are no doubt necessary for the divisional court or the High Court.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I ask the Minister to look at that again. I understand the points that he is making, but it would be preferable for those who want to know the procedure and who may be involved if, as far as possible, the procedure for arriving at the decision to exclude somebody and for the affected person's rights to challenge that decision was similar. In a way, special appeal tribunals follow more of a lay procedure. That does not mean that the divisional court of the High Court must have complicated procedures, but a common procedure would be good. I am happy for the Minister to take the matter away and to talk to colleagues in the Lord Chancellor's Department.
