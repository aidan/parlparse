<H4><center>Functions of the Secretary of State</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Hawkins </B>(Surrey Heath): I beg to move amendment No. 31, in page 2, line 24, at end add—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(5) The Secretary of State shall lay before each House of Parliament the conditions on which he makes any payment under this section.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I welcome you to the Chair, Sir David. We are glad to be under your chairmanship this morning. This is a probing amendment. It would require the Secretary of State to lay before Parliament the conditions under which he makes conditional payments to a person for the purposes of fulfilling the functions listed in clause 1. What sort of payments may be made under clause 3 and for what purpose will they be made?
<P>
When discussing taxpayers' money, it is vital to discover exactly how much the Government envisage might be paid out, as well as to whom it will be paid. Will it be paid only to local boards or is there a list of people to whom payments will be made including, for example, those in the voluntary sector? Given that subsection (2) allows for ``any payment'' to be made to ``any person'', we must know such details. It would also be helpful if the Minister could explain what conditions will be attached to such payments. Will they be permanent transfers of cash or will they be in the nature of an interest-free loan? Most importantly, what sort of public or parliamentary scrutiny will be given to the payments? It would be helpful if part of the conditions under which payments were made was subject to proper scrutiny. I am sure that the Minister can give detailed answers to such questions.
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Home Office (Mr. Paul Boateng):</B> I join the hon. Member for Surrey Heath (Mr. Hawkins) in welcoming you to the Chair, Sir David, on this bright and sunny morning, especially as you bring such glad tidings about our future sittings.
<P>
This is a significant amendment in that it seeks clarification that I am only too happy to give about the funding arrangements. Clause 3 is important because it will change fundamentally the current arrangements under which area probation services receive a grant. At present, 80 per cent. of the services are funded by the Home Office, while the remaining 20 per cent. are funded by local authorities. Such arrangements have been cumbersome to administer and they significantly blur the lines of financial accountability. We want to allow the Secretary of State to make payments to whoever he considers appropriate to deliver the functions that are set out in clause 1 and which we debated extensively at our previous sitting.
<P>
Local boards will be funded. However, the hon. Gentleman was right that, under the clause, payments can be made to other organisations, including the voluntary sector to which work has been contracted out. The clause gives the Secretary of State the opportunity, if it is needed, to control how the money is spent by setting conditions, regulating the purpose for which sums may be used and requiring payments to be made in certain circumstances. Those powers could be used to ring-fence expenditure to ensure, for example, that local boards spend a minimum amount on staff training or research. The advantages are clear—it is a national service and we would not want undue and unhelpful discrepancies in relation to amounts of spending on staff training. Indeed, certain types of training might be regarded as important at particular times. The hon. Gentleman asked for examples of where a ring fence might be appropriate. In relation to drug treatment and training orders, for example, infrastructure development requires the application of specific sums of money. Where that is a priority, it will be necessary to ensure that money is spent on the purpose for which it is intended.
<P>
The hon. Member for Surrey Heath asked about repayment, which is most likely to arise where a significant amount is required to be spent on capital infrastructure. It is important that the probation service should develop information technology that will enable it to work effectively with other partners in the criminal justice system. Capital spending may be necessary, and it can be made clear that the organisation that received funding for the purpose, whether a local board or a contractor, will refund the cost of the equipment if it stops doing the work for which it was provided. That is an example of the circumstances in which repayment might be necessary.
<P>
On the level of funding and the sums to be expended, an extra £127 million was found for the probation service during the comprehensive spending review period, which is worth £159 million when grossed up to include the local authority contribution. Those are considerable additional sums, which are justified by the increasing work load of the service and its capacity to respond to it. It is important that funding arrangements are subject to proper accountability, which clause 3 provides.
<P>
I understand the probing nature of the amendment, but it would put a needless constraint on the Secretary of State's freedom to manage the new service effectively. Ring-fencing is eminently sensible where it is necessary to support initiatives to deliver specific Government policies, of which accredited offender programmes might be another example. The amendment would make that more difficult and cumbersome.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> It sounded as though the Minister was about to deal with this point towards the end of what he was proposing to say. He will appreciate that the wording of the clause is remarkably wide. It gives the Secretary of State unfettered power and is much more open than is usually seen in statutes. Does he contemplate or will he leave the door ajar for any kind of parliamentary scrutiny? Might the clause be amended by a Government amendment in another place?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> No, I do not think so. I believe that the flexibility is necessary. Expenditure by Government Departments in that way is always subject to proper accountability to Parliament through the Audit Commission, the National Audit Office and so on. The NAO has proved very effective in the past. Civil servants and Ministers always have its strictures and supervision in mind and no special measures will be needed in this regard.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his response to my intervention. This is a matter to which we may need to return on Report, and perhaps in another place. I repeat that I find it a remarkably widely drawn power when one is speaking of taxpayers' money. The power to make any payment to any person for any purpose is rather wider than one is used to seeing in statute. However, I shall not press the matter to a Division today because it was a probing amendment. We have heard what the Minister has said, but those who come to look at the proceedings may not regard his reply as particularly reassuring in the context of potentially large sums of taxpayers' money. To assist the Minister and his officials, we have pointed out that this is a subject to which we may return, and they may wish to think again. However, for today I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 3 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 4</center></H4>
<H4><center>Local boards</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 32, in Clause 4, page 3, line 1, leave out subsection (6).
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 110, in page 3, line 2, at end add
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`, which may only be made if a draft of the statutory instrument containing the order has been laid before and approved by resolution of each House of Parliament'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> Amendment No. 32 seeks to delete subsection (6) of clause 4. It is in a rather different category from the previous amendment. We are not merely probing; we believe that these are very serious matters. Clause 4 provides that the boundaries of the local boards shall be the same as for police forces. Reference was made in our first sitting to the fact that there was some logic in having coterminosity, as it is called, for the boundaries. However, the subsection would allow the Home Secretary to redraw boundaries of probation service boards simply by order. Clause 58 makes it clear that that will be a negative resolution power.
<P>
Although the Bill has used the model of police force areas for the local probation boards, the Police and Magistrates' Courts Act 1994 dealing with the police does not contain a similarly sweeping power for the Home Secretary to alter the boundaries of police force areas, and we do not believe that the Home Secretary should be given such a power in relation to the probation service board boundaries.
<P>
The 1994 Act provided for an order-making power for the Home Secretary to alter police force area boundaries, but that power is only exercisable on the request of police authorities or if it appears to the Secretary of State of the day expedient
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>in the interests of efficiency and effectiveness.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In that event, under the 1994 Act the Secretary of State would first have to give notice to local councils and others of the changes that he proposed to make in relation to a police force area boundary, and to set out his reasons. The power of the Secretary of State to change the boundaries in relation to police force areas on his own initiative is a negative resolution power.
<P>
We have looked carefully at the 1994 Act. It would be far better if the proposals put forward in the Bill in relation to probation service board areas were exactly the same as those in the 1994 Act. It is for the Minister to justify his reasons for a change that would appear to give the Home Secretary of the day, if the Bill become law, a much more unfettered power in relation to probation service boards.

<P>

<B>Mr. John Burnett </B>(Torridge and West Devon): I also take the opportunity to welcome you to the Chair, Sir David. It is good to see you here today.
<P>
I have a great deal of sympathy with what the hon. Member for Surrey Heath has said. It is a mistake to give the Home Secretary this unfettered power. Our amendment No. 110 has a similar effect, except that we are changing the procedure from negative to positive. We agree that it is sensible that police boundaries should be coterminous with probation service boundaries. That has, in effect, happened throughout the country.
<P>
Regional identity is very important for all parts of England, but it is particularly important for those of us in regions such as the one that I represent—the far south-west. Circumstances in areas such as Devon and Cornwall simply do not mirror circumstances further to the east. We have already combined probation service areas with those of the police. There is a tendency for Governments to centralise, and that tendency should be checked. There should be checks and balances to it. The effect of the Bill as it stands is not satisfactory. It is not in the best interests of justice and it is certainly not in the best interests of the public.
<P>
We hope that the Government will reconsider. They might not wish to go quite as far as amendment No. 32, moved by the hon. Member for Surrey Heath, but if they are not prepared to go that far, let us hope that they sympathise with our amendment No. 110.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I have listened very carefully to the arguments made by the hon. Members for Surrey Heath and for Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Burnett). Their concerns are misconceived, and the suggestion that the Secretary of State is taking on yet more powers without an effective check is profoundly misplaced—not least because the Secretary of State currently has the power to change the boundaries of the service without recourse to any resolution, negative or affirmative. I do not know whether the hon. Gentlemen appreciate that.
<P>
The powers that are proposed will be subject to parliamentary scrutiny by virtue of the negative resolution procedure, which has always proved adequate in the past as a way of ensuring—
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I hope that the hon. Gentleman will agree that the fact that the Secretary of State has carte blanche is not in itself necessarily a reason for denying the effectiveness of these amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> No, but it is necessary to take that into account when seeking to allay the fear that has been expressed by the hon. Gentleman of some sort of centralising tendency, or centralising agenda, underlying these proposals—one that seeks to avoid accountability and scrutiny. I would argue that the reverse is the truth.
<P>
The unamended clause would greatly strengthen the position of the probation service. It is the Government's aim to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the criminal justice system, and one important way of doing so is to ensure that the various agencies working within the system have common boundaries. That is why the Bill specifies, in clauses 4 and 5, that initially the boundaries for local boards should be the same as those for police areas outside London, plus some additional area corresponding with the Metropolitan police district and the City of London police area, giving us 42 local boards, 34 of which will be the same as current probation service areas, whereas the remaining 20 existing areas will undergo amalgamations to form eight new areas. Devon and Cornwall are the beneficiaries of that. I know that because I met a group of senior probation officers in Torquay who were preparing for that change and looking forward to it. They saw it not in any way as something negative but as an opportunity to extend their work in a valuable coterminosity with the police.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I hope that I told the Committee that we agree with coterminosity with police areas. However, I hope that the Minister will agree that any further change unilaterally changing the boundaries for the probation service should be considered very carefully, and by Parliament.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> It will be and could be, if that were Parliament's wish. Our view is that we must look at the criminal justice system as a whole. Interestingly, there are important areas of joint working between prisons and the probation service. It is possible for the Secretary of State to change prison regions unilaterally. Having served on the Committee of the Police and Magistrates' Courts Act 1994, I do not think that we should necessarily look to that as an example of how best to order the probation service. I can assure the hon. Gentleman, from a previous incarnation as a police Minister, that that Act has not proved to be an unalloyed advantage for the efficient administration either of the police or of magistrates courts. It would, therefore, be unwise of this Committee to hark back to the 1994 Act as an example that we should follow in relation to this piece of legislation. What we are doing here is creating something new, something fit for the purpose that builds on the existing experience and the needs and requirements of the probation service and of the criminal justice system as a whole.
<P>
The amendments would make any rationalisation of boundaries that may be useful and felt to be necessary in future, difficult. It is not necessary to have a parliamentary debate on the changing of boundaries. It is not a matter of principle requiring a debate on every occasion. It is a matter of organising the service in the most efficient and desirable way, in terms of the particular need in the area and in the service as a whole. Local consultation would always be undertaken before such an order was made. Experience shows, as in Devon and Cornwall, that local involvement, when properly conducted, leads to change that has the ready acceptance and enthusiastic embrace of all parties. That is the spirit of the clause, which is why I cannot—having heard and respected the argument—accept the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I have listened carefully to the Minister's response to my remarks and those of the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon. I am not convinced by his argument. When he referred to the Police and Magistrates' Courts Act 1994, it occurred to me that the Government's approach to legislation introduced by the previous Government is often the same. They say that none of it is effective, unless, for the purposes of an individual argument, they want to say that they will be even tougher, and build on it.
<P>
Last week, I happened to see a school production of ``Animal Farm'', in which my eldest son appeared. All Committee members will remember the concept of ``two legs bad, four legs good'', and that the commandments tended to be changed as the pigs became more like humans. That kind of Orwellian approach is noteworthy in this Government. In the Police and Magistrates' Courts Act 1994, which we believe that the Bill should parallel, section 14(3) clearly states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Secretary of State shall not exercise his power under subsection (1) of this section—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
which relates to changing the boundaries—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>to make alterations unless either—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) he has received a request to make the alterations from the police authority for each of the areas (other than the metropolitan police district) affected by them, or<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) it appears to him to be expedient to make the alterations in the interests of efficiency or effectiveness.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Whatever specious views the Minister may have on the rest of the 1994 Act, he has not advanced an effective argument to explain why this part of the Bill should not exactly mirror section 14. It is therefore important to press the amendment to a Division.
<P>

<H4><center>LOCAL BOARDS</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 56, in page 41, line 12, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(3A) In making appointments under subparagraph (3), the Secretary of State shall consult:
<P>
(a) each county, borough or district council in the area of the local board;
<P>
(b) each magistrates' courts' committee in the area of the local board;
<P>
(c) the police authority responsible for the area of the local board;
<P>
(d) the chief constable responsible for the area of the local board;
<P>
(e) the resident judge in each Crown Court centre in the area of the local board;
<P>
(f) each Youth Offending Team established in the area of the local board;
<P>
(g) such other persons as he thinks fit.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 57, in page 41, line 18, after `area', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`; and in particular, the Secretary of State shall ensure that at least one member of the board shall be from each of the following categories—
<P>
(a) a member of a county, borough or district council in the area of the board;
<P>
(b) a justice of the peace resident in the area of the local board;
<P>
(c) an officer of a Youth Offending Team established in the area of the local board.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 58, in page 41, line 20, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(7) The Secretary of State shall ensure that the members of the board appointed by him are appropriately qualified to carry out the functions conferred on them by this Act.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> Schedule 1 gives the Secretary of State sweeping powers. It provides that he can appoint to a local board whoever he wants. The amendments would require advance consultation before such appointments are made. We feel strongly that the Government should take that proposal on board. A couple of weeks ago, the Government were hugely embarrassed because the independent commissioner revealed how they have packed local national health service trust boards with Labour cronies. It has been the subject of extraordinary criticism that, since 1997, a large number of Labour councillors—284, I think—had been so appointed. The independent commissioner said that the situation had deteriorated substantially since 1997.
<P>
It is no good Labour members of the Committee murmuring and twittering. It is a fact that the independent commissioner said that, since 1 May 1997, their cronies have been appointed to NHS trust boards in large numbers. [Interruption.] Nor is it any good the hon. Member for Weaver Vale (Mr. Hall) referring to 18 years. The independent commissioner says that that situation has deteriorated substantially since 1997. If the hon. Gentleman does not agree, he should read the commissioner's report. We want to stop the Government taking such action. We hope that they will think carefully about the matter, because they will be in serious trouble in another place if they do not.
<P>
We want to ensure that the Bill requires there to be consultation with a wide range of bodies before such appointments are made. Amendment No. 56 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In making appointments under subparagraph (3), the Secretary of State shall consult:<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) each county, borough or district council in the area of the local board.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That makes common sense, and I shall be fascinated to hear whether the Minister suggests that there is anything wrong with that proposal. We also want the Secretary of State to consult
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>each magistrates' courts' committee in the area of the local board.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Once again, how could a sensible Government deny that that would be a practical move? The amendment would ensure that the Secretary of State consult
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the police authority responsible for the area of the local board.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Given the close links between the police and probation service, which the Government were at pains to stress on Second Reading, surely such a provision would be unarguable. When consulting the police authority, we also want the Secretary of State to consult the chief constable.
<P>
In addition, we suggest that the Secretary of State should consult
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the resident judge in each Crown Court centre.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That provision would be a vital safeguard, because probation officers make reports to judges and magistrates. The amendment would oblige the Secretary of State to consult 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>each Youth Offending Team established in the area of the local board.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Hopefully, having accepted that he should consult all those bodies listed in the amendment, he might wish to consult other people, so we have included a catch-all provision, which states that he should consult
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>such other persons as he thinks fit.
<P>
</UL></FONT>Amendment No. 57 suggests a additional safeguard whereby the
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Secretary of State shall ensure that at least one member of the board shall be from each of the following categories—
<P>
(a) a member of a county, borough or district council in the area of the board.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I shall be interested to hear whether the Minister will accept that it would be sensible to have at least appointee from the local council. The amendment would make at least one appointee a
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>justice of the peace resident in the area of the local board.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Minister would find it difficult to persuade the Magistrates Association that that would not be a useful provision. The amendment would also ensure that an appointee was
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>an officer of a Youth Offending Team established in the area of the local board.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Again, it would be difficult to argue that such a specific appointment would not be useful.
<P>
Amendment No. 58 suggests that the Secretary of State must have an obligation
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>to ensure that the members of the board appointed by him are appropriately qualified to carry out the functions conferred on them by this Act.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I have no alternative but to refer again to the reason for our concern. One of the particular criticisms about health trust boards in the period since 1997 was that the independent commissioner felt that many of the Labour councillors who were appointed had no appropriate qualifications and experience. Not all those appointees were Labour councillors. Indeed, one was a manager of a Labour club in the Prime Minister's constituency. It was an independent commissioner who said that trust board appointees had no relevant qualification or experience and it seemed that the only reason for their appointment was that they were Labour supporters.
<P>
We are nearing the sort of system that used to take place in Warsaw pact countries before the collapse of the Berlin wall. Unless safeguards are built into the Bill, the culture of cronyism will bring us to the dangerous situation in which the Government believe that they can behave like Ceausescu. We are not making idle arguments; our concerns our serious. As he travels throughout the country, the Minister will find it difficult to say to organisations such as the Magistrates Association, ``We do not want a magistrate on each board. That is not necessary. It is not necessary to consult the resident judge or the police authority.'' We feel strongly about the amendments. Schedule I needs to have such safeguards built into it because of recent experience.

<P>

<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I shall put the hon. Gentleman's bile and bitter gall down to the pressures of too many late nights. Members of the Committee—some more than others—understand what it is like to be in opposition and to argue on a sticky wicket, and we shall not hold it against him. However, making references to Ceausescu and Orwell in the space of 39 minutes seems to be pushing it a bit.
<P>
We are committed to ensuring that local communities have a link with probation that will strengthen the service, strengthen local law enforcement and crime prevention and build up a community of interest in public safety and rehabilitation that is vital to the success of both endeavours. That is our purpose and intention. Schedule I sets out the principal rules that relate to how local boards will be constituted and will operate, and requires a board to have a chair, a chief officer and at least five other members. We would expect to appoint a total of 15 members to each board. Importantly, the schedule allows the Secretary of State to make regulations relating to the tenure of appointments, and the appointment of a secretary and treasurer to each board, and allows board members to be paid for their work. The reflection of the local community on the board will enable it to understand the needs of the community and deliver a criminal justice service that meets those needs. Such matters are best left to regulation.
<P>
We intend to ensure that on each board there will be a chair, a chief officer, a judge, four magistrates, two elected local authority members and six other representatives of the local community, chosen to reflects its diversity and mix of skills. The judge will nominated by the Lord Chancellor and the chief officer appointed through a separate process. We intend all the other board places to be submitted to an open recruitment process. We shall advertise for board members in national and local newspapers, and we are working with the Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments to design a selection process that will be based on applicants demonstrating relevant skills and experience. We have involved the OCPA on a voluntary basis because it is important that the selection process is open, fair and above reproach. We believe that that will be the case, and that the hon. Gentleman's fears and fantasies are utterly unfounded.
<P>
If one considers the effect of the amendments, there is nothing to commend them. In relation to amendment No. 56, we are already following the advice of the OCPA. The cumbersome consultation process envisaged by the hon. Gentleman would not improve the selection process; indeed, it might make it more difficult to ensure the right mix of people. Even the most objective observer of the old-style NHS boards would not pretend that they were representative of the local community. They are now much more representative and effective vehicles for NHS modernisation.
<P>
The matters addressed by amendment No. 57 are more properly dealt with by regulation. We shall make sure that those regulations are used to ensure that we have the best people for the job, and draw on the pool of local skills and talent to enhance, dignify and raise the public profile of the probation service. The regulations will be subject to negative resolution. There will be an opportunity for parliamentary scrutiny and debate when the regulations are laid. Schedule 1 makes it clear that the regulations need to provide, as far as is practicable, that the appointees will be representative of the local community in the board's area and will have lived or be involved in it.
<P>
<H5>10.15 am </H5>
</P>
<P>
Both Government and Opposition members of the Committee were concerned that under the previous Administration some members of NHS trusts did not live in the area and had no obvious connection with it. It was necessary to address that, and we have done so. All those matters are properly dealt with under regulations. There will be ample opportunity, if the House chooses to exercise its rights, to debate and discuss them.
<P>
As for amendment No. 58, let me stress that we want as many people as possible to offer themselves for consideration for membership of the boards. The amendment would narrow the field. A reasonable person, when considering schedule 1 and amendments Nos. 56, 57 and 58, having heard the debate this morning, would come to the conclusion that the Opposition's concerns are utterly without foundation and that, far from helping, the amendments would hinder. For that reason, I shall strongly urge my hon. Friends to reject them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> The Minister's reply, in which he spoke of a reasonable person listening to the debate, ignores what a reasonable person would think if they read not only the debate but the report of the independent commissioner in relation to NHS trusts. It does not bear out what the Minister has been saying this morning and shows that our fears are entirely justified. In the light of that exceptionally hard-hitting, independent report, the Minister's words are beyond belief.
<P>
I am relieved to hear from the Minister that he and his fellow Ministers will involve the Commissioner for Public Appointments. In the light of the hostile report in relation to NHS trust boards, they did not have much choice: their cronyism has been revealed following the hard work of my hon. Friend the Member for Altrincham and Sale, West (Mr. Brady).
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I have been listening to the hon. Gentleman with great care, as have other members of the Committee. He has castigated Labour Members for bringing about an alleged imbalance in the political composition of NHS trusts. If he cares to read the commissioner's report on public appointments to NHS trusts and health authorities, at page 15 he will see her examination of the only figures available to her in relation to the previous Government and the composition of their appointees to NHS trusts. She found that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>17.1% of appointees were politically active (13.9% of appointees declared activity for the Conservative party, and 2.3% for the Labour party).<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The hon. Gentleman is in no position to castigate us. He should examine his record first.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> That was a long intervention. The Minister's selective quotation came from the only part of the report that supports his argument. He ignores entirely the severe criticism to which I referred earlier and the independent commissioner's view that matters have become much worse since May 1997.
<P>
<B>Angela Smith </B>(Basildon): It does not say that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> It does. The hon. Lady can intervene from a sedentary position all she likes, but that is what the report says. We feel very strongly that all the amendments are vital and we intend to press them all to a vote.

<P>

<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> On my first opportunity to speak this morning, may I welcome you to your place in the Committee, Sir David. I apologise that I was late, but my excuse is that I was at a breakfast for Nelson Mandela at the London School of Economics, as I explained beforehand.
<P>
I am trying to come up to speed with the Committee's deliberations. I shall speak briefly because the amendments are fairly self-explanatory. The purpose of each is to attempt to dilute the power of the Secretary of State. That might upset the Minister. This part of the schedule gives the Secretary of State powers to take over the running of probation boards, to interfere in their running and to decide what their plans should be and whether they are living up to them. I find it difficult to see where the role of Her Majesty's chief inspector of the probation service fits into this. The amendments seek to give the chief inspector a greater role by diluting the powers of the Secretary of State or giving the chief inspector advisory powers.
<P>
Amendment No. 111 suggests that the Secretary of State should receive advice from the chief inspector. It would ensure that the inspector were more involved in the supervision of the local board and became part of the information, advice and consultation framework.
<P>
Amendment No. 112 would also ensure that the chief inspector was in the loop to receive information and, therefore, as someone responsible for monitoring the working of the board, would receive automatically a copy of the report that the chairman had sent the Secretary of State.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 115 and 116 would also ensure the involvement of the inspectorate in the supervision of the probation boards.
<P>
Amendment No. 118 is concerned with the annual plans of local boards. Again, it seems to be sensible to involve the inspector in this process.
<P>
Strangely, we now jump back to amendments to clause 5. Here, instead of just involving the inspectorate the amendment seeks to delete the reference to the Secretary of State. We believe that whether the provision of services by a local board is adequate should be, in the first instance, for the inspectorate to determine and to advise the Secretary of State. These are probing amendments. I should be interested to hear the Minister's response as to the role of the inspectorate if this is not to be a fundamental part of that role.
<P>
Amendment No. 125 concerns the Association of Chief Officers of Probation. Clause 10 appears to give the Secretary of State arbitrary powers to decide that a board is failing to carry out its functions and then, having exercised those arbitrary powers—we have no criterion for how the Secretary of State would make such a decision—the Secretary of State having appointed board members can then move in and remove them, individually or collectively, and even appoint another body to run the local probation service.
<P>
We believe that it would be helpful to insert an amendment here to insert after ``appears to him'', which is very arbitrary language and very unclear,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>on receipt of a report to that effect from the chief inspector of the National Probation Service<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
in order to set some criteria for what would trigger that level of involvement on the part of the Secretary of State.
<P>
All the Liberal Democrat amendments in the group are probing amendments. We wish to find out how the Minister sees the role of the chief inspector and whether the chief inspector will have any teeth when it comes to overseeing the running of the board, or whether the heavy-handed Secretary of State will constantly interfere in an arbitrary fashion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> We have a great deal of sympathy with the proposals by the hon. Member for Taunton and we think that she is wise to probe these matters. Our amendments Nos. 41 and 42 are consequential one on the other. Amendment No. 41 is directed towards the same issue as amendment No. 65. Amendment No. 41 would oblige the Secretary of State to have regard to the chief inspector's views if he were to exercise the powers in clause 5(8) to determine whether any provision made by a local board is sufficient. The chief inspector is bound to have views on any such matter. We find it surprising that the Minister should argue that the Bill should not include a requirement for the Secretary of State to consult the chief inspector and have regard to his views. No doubt we shall hear from the Minister about that. I am sure that we shall return to these matters.
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Amendment No. 112 is the only one of the hon. Lady's amendments that causes us slight concern and I am sure that she will keep matters under review. The amendment proposes that regulations should require the chairman of the board to report to the chief inspector. The inspector's job, of course, is to inspect rather than receive reports. However, I do not say that in a critical spirit because we are all trying to probe and find out the Government's intention. In due course, the Government, having thought about these matters, may well table their own amendments. I hope that the Minister will say that he is at least keeping matters under review and that he will leave the door ajar for amendments along the same lines as ours, as we think that they would improve the Bill.
<P>
We are seeking to ensure that the inspector has a real role. I entirely agree with the hon. Member for Taunton about that. I hope that the Minister will take the amendments in the spirit in which they were intended as they address matters to which we will inevitably have to return. I hope that the Minister will further elucidate exactly what further involvement of the chief inspector and the Secretary of State he has in mind.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I shall not detain the Committee long, however, I wish to endorse what my hon. Friend the Member for Taunton has said. Of course the chief inspector should have a role. We want to recruit someone of eminence. We want people to apply for that role—not only eminent people but those with a distinguished record behind them. We want to attract people who have a lot to offer the probation service. Such individuals will not want the job unless they are allowed a substantial input into what will be their service. The amendments are important. They are intended to dilute the power of the Secretary of State and introduce some vital and important checks and balances into the system.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> The chief inspector's role is vital. It is primarily an advisory one. That is what it is about. We are blessed in our current chief inspector by the wisdom and integrity that he brings to the job. Ministers rely on his advice. They seek it where appropriate, which is often. That advice is always forthcoming from a position of independence and a lack of responsibility for the day-to-day management of the service, for which the Home Secretary and Ministers are accountable to Parliament. That is the value of the role of the chief inspector, who in that sense is independent of Ministers and of day-to-day responsibility for the service. That independence combined with unmatched integrity has to be protected.
<P>
The amendments, although no doubt well meaning, have a misconceived root in the belief that somehow, in order to improve the service, the Secretary of State's role has to be diluted. That is misconceived. The emphasis on the role of the chief inspector is entirely proper, but we need to be clear that it is an advisory role.
<P>
Turning to amendment No. 125, it is extremely unlikely that the Secretary of State would use his powers under clause 10 without seeking the advice of the chief inspector. However, it would not be appropriate to limit the Secretary of State to acting only on receipt of a report. He may want to take remedial action between receiving a report and making an order. As far as amendments Nos. 65, 41 and 42 are concerned, the Secretary of State decides whether boards have made proper provision to carry out their functions. The inspectorate has a vital advisory role, which should not be confused with statutory responsibility for the service as that rests with the Secretary of State.
<P>
We oppose the amendments because they are based on a fundamental misconception of the proper role of Ministers and chief inspectors. Amendment No. 111 would undermine the Secretary of State's ability to determine who should be a board member. The Secretary of State is responsible to Parliament for the performance of the national service, and should have the authority to dismiss members of local boards if he is not satisfied that they are performing to the require standards.
<P>
Amendment No. 112 is based on a misunderstanding of the role of the chief inspector If the Home Secretary needs advice in relation to board members he will certainly ask for it. He has the relevant information, which he will of course provide if the chief inspector needs it for the performance of his functions. The amendment is therefore unnecessary. There will of course be a constant flow and exchange of ideas, views and opinions between Ministers and the chief inspector, but the hon. Member for Taunton should distinguish between their respective roles.
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> If the inspector does not have an advisory role in the chain that might ultimately lead to the Secretary of State deciding to dismiss a board member whom he had appointed, what will prevent a future Secretary of State—perhaps a member of another party, and less benign than the current Secretary of State—from exercising arbitrary political decisions and dismissing board members or an entire board?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> In respect of such matters, the Secretary of State would, where necessary—it seems inconceivable that it would not be necessary—invariably seek the advice of the chief inspector. However, it is the responsibility of the Secretary of State, to whom the information is available. The roles are different—Secretaries of State are subject to the law and judicial oversight on the reasonableness or otherwise of their actions in the usual way. In relation to amendments Nos. 112 and 115, the Secretary of State is accountable for the performance of the service and should be able to direct local boards without reference to an intermediary. Requiring the chief inspector to act as an intermediary—as a filter or conduit for directions—would not be welcomed by chief inspectors or Ministers, as it would blur the lines of accountability.
<P>
On amendment No. 116, there is no need for a special power to allow the chief inspector to require information from boards. I assure the hon. Lady that, whenever the chief inspector needs such information, he can rely on the Secretary of State to direct the board to supply him with it.
<P>
The hon. Lady puts great store—and, rightly so—in the integrity and probity of the chief inspector, but she misunderstands the nature of the relationship between the chief inspector and the Secretary of State and the importance at all times of making clear the line of accountability and maintaining the independence and day-to-day operational responsibility and decision making of the chief inspector.
<P>
As for amendment No. 118, the annual plan is part of the mechanism through which the Home Secretary can ensure that boards are fulfilling their functions. I regard that as important. It involves the approval of the plan and monitoring performance to ensure that it matches what the plan set out to do. That must be the responsibility of the Secretary of State, who is answerable to all Members of Parliament. It would be wrong to give that responsibility to the chief inspector because Parliament must be sure that it can call the Secretary of State to account.
<P>
Flexibility on the part of the Secretary of State is important, which is why amendment No. 125 is not acceptable. It is too inflexible. It would not give the Secretary of State the opportunity to take such action as he deemed necessary. He would be able to do so only on receipt of a report from the chief inspector. That would be cumbersome and unhelpful. It is unimaginable that serious and significant steps of the sort envisaged under clause 10 would be exercised without the close involvement of the chief inspector. However, it would be equally wrong to require legislative provision as is proposed, because it would undermine, not enhance, the role of the chief inspector, the effective management of the service and the direct line of accountability that we are creating for the Secretary of State. I ask the Committee not to press the amendments to a Division.

<P>

<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> Careful note is taken to the Minister's response to the amendments. The amendment was tabled to find out how the Minister regards the role of the chief inspector. I made careful note of what he said. He began by saying that it was unlikely that the powers under clause 10 would be used without the advice of the chief inspector. He then said that it was inconceivable that the Secretary of State would not seek such advice and followed that remark by describing the situation as unimaginable. It is useful to have such various arguments on the record.
<P>
The role of the inspector is primarily advisory and the operational responsibility and decision making lies with the Secretary of State. It was worth debating how much the Secretary of State would have due regard to the advice of the chief inspector and how much the chief inspector would be into that loop. However, given the Minister's response, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 59, in page 41, line 30, after `office)', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`; but no member may be appointed for a period longer than five years, nor may any member serve continuously as a member of a local board for a period of more than 25 years.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This is a probing amendment. It would restrict each appointment of a member of a local board to five years with a 25-year maximum. We hope that it will enable the Minister to say how long the appointments or reappointments of board members will last. It would be useful to discuss that matter, given that Hansard reports of Committee proceedings and debates in the Chamber cam be referred to under Pepper v. Hart if an explanation of anything that is uncertain in the Bill is necessary. I am sure that the Minister will elucidate what the Government have in mind. Perhaps, with this probing amendment, we shall make the Minister, and those who advise him, think that it might be better to state the period of appointment in the Bill and table such an amendment.
<P>
The Committee will be aware that it is common, although not universal, for maximum periods of appointment and service following reappointment to be stated in legislation or regulations. A similar provision would do no harm to the Bill. I stress that this is a probing amendment. We shall listen with interest to the Minister's response, but we hope that he will at least be prepared to leave the door ajar by saying that he will consult his officials and consider whether it might be helpful to include provisions on the length of service and the maximum period of reappointment.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> It would not be helpful to include any such provision in the Bill. I should be interested to know whether the hon. Gentleman can draw to the Committee's attention any example of comparable legislation that includes such provisions. Traditionally and properly, such matters are dealt with by regulation, for obvious reasons.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I think that I mentioned that such provisions are often included in statutes or regulations. The point would be dealt with if the Minister says that such provisions will be included in a subsequent statutory instrument.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I am happy to deal with the point in that way. That is precisely our intention, but I am equally happy to say how we shall deal with such matters. We think that board members should be appointed for a maximum of two consecutive terms of three years, but we are interested in hon. Members' views on the length of appointments. Membership might have to be extended exceptionally, perhaps if someone is appointed mid-term or a need for continuity arises, but we think that a six-year maximum is right. We expect to include such a maximum in a regulation. That will provide the flexibility to adjust the framework in the light of experience.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I accept that the Minister is considering introducing such regulations, He has said that he is interested in hon. Members' suggestions, which is helpful. We can return to the subject on Report and in another place and we shall have an opportunity to consider any regulation that the Government may introduce. In the light of what the Minister said I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 113, in page 42, line 2, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`with due regard to the remuneration of members of the Police Authorities'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Paragraph 5 of the schedule deals with board members' remuneration. The amendment would introduce parity, or at least a relationship, between the remuneration of police authority and probation board members. One of the purposes of the Bill is to make police authority and probation board areas coterminous. Given that it is likely that those boards will be fishing in the same pool of people and that those who might want to serve on them will have similar interests, it is important to ensure that there is a relationship between their remuneration so that probation boards do not become Cinderella boards. The amendment does not specify the amount of remuneration—it would not be appropriate or practical to do so—or the ratio between police authority remuneration and probation board remuneration. The amendment merely states that there should be due regard to the remuneration of those on police authorities.
<P>
This is a simple amendment, which, for the first time in this Committee, the Minister might feel able to accept.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I shall be brief. I agree with the hon. Member for Taunton that it is useful to raise this matter. We shall hear the Minister's response in a moment. I especially agree with the hon. Lady's comment that, given the nature of such appointments, the Government will inevitably look at the same group of people—or, as she put it, fish in the same pool—for potential appointees. That makes the amendment especially relevant.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I know that the hon. Member for Taunton has been to breakfast with Nelson Mandela, but I am afraid that I must bring her down to earth with a bump. I cannot accept the amendment, but she makes an important point. We must give careful consideration to the remuneration of board members. I have not reached a fixed conclusion on the level at which it should be pitched. It will be important to consider remuneration in analogous bodies. However, we should remember that serving on a police authority is a different job, and that other analogous bodies exist. A person can serve on a bench without remuneration at all, while those who serve on NHS trusts receive another level of remuneration. All are relevant to the pool, from which, as she rightly says, we all fish. My officials and I shall take account of her views in the process of arriving at a figure, but it would not be helpful to create a statutory link with police authorities, which are different organisations.
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> Perhaps I was getting carried away. I am sure that the Minister was tempted to concede, but the natural tendency, on taking ministerial office, is to say no. I am pleased that the Minister will consider my argument, and I am sure that a similar provision to that which we proposed will result.
<P>
I reiterate that the amendment is not binding. It refers to having ``due regard''; it does not stipulate a ratio. Probation boards have more similarities with police authorities than with NHS trusts. Having heard the Minister's thoroughly warm words, I know when to give up. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 114, in page 42, line 45, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(4) The Secretary of State must ensure cashflow to boards by dispersing the allocation fund in a timely manner so that boards can meet contractual liabilities'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 117, in page 43, line 17, leave out subparagraph (3).
<P>
No. 126, in clause 10, page 5, line 32, leave out subsection (5) and insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(5) The Secretary of State must be satisfied that sufficient resources have been made available to the Probation Board to ensure that it can perform its functions'.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Burnett:</B> The amendments introduce some good business practice into the Bill.
<P>
I shall start—perversely—with amendment No. 117, which is too sweeping for my taste. I am cautious on economic matters and I accept the purpose behind paragraph 13(3)(b). It is a sensible provision. I approve of it because agencies and Government bodies should not borrow money hither and thither, unfettered and uncontrolled. However, will the Minister look at paragraph 13(3)(a)? It seems slightly crackers to me. The board must be situated somewhere. It must hold some land, whether it be freehold tenure, under lease or under licence.
<P>
Amendment No. 114 is a sensible business housekeeping provision. Naturally, there must be adequate cash flow for the board to meet its contractual liabilities. I hope that the Minister will recognise that. As for amendment No. 126, the Secretary of State must be satisfied that sufficient resources have been made available to the probation service to ensure that it can perform its functions. The provision is sensible and is in the interests of the smooth and good running of that service.
<P>
<B>Mr. Amess:</B> Unless our procedures are changing dramatically, it is extraordinary for the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon to table an amendment and then to describe it as sweeping. I am getting used to the Liberal Democrats saying one thing and meaning another, but he should be more careful when tabling amendments. He must be serious about them and be prepared to defend them. He said that he was cautious about economic matters, so does he want the boards to borrow money or does he not?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I can only echo the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Southend, West (Mr. Amess). There may not be complete agreement between the hon. Members for Taunton and for Torridge and West Devon, but I have never heard anyone who tabled an amendment saying that it was too sweeping for his taste. Nevertheless, as usual, the hon. Gentleman has made some serious points. He has got it wrong about borrowing money. It is not sensible for probation boards to be given such a power.

<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> The hon. Gentleman's problem is that his amendment would delete paragraph 13(3)(b). If it were accepted, the probation board would be allowed to borrow money by way of overdraft or otherwise. The Liberal Democrats have not carefully thought through the amendment. The Government are more sensible in introducing a safeguard. There will not be many occasions in Committee when I am more in support of the Government's proposals than the Liberal Democrats' amendments, but this is one such occasion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> The hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon has learnt what Labour Members have known for some time: the parliamentary road from Basildon to Southend, West is paved with ill will and malice. We know that, and he has discovered it. We will treat the intervention of the hon. Gentleman, the Member for Southend, West—of whom I am quite fond in a way—as it deserves. We will treat the contribution of the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon with the seriousness that it deserves. He makes some important points and I will reassure him. We are talking about a national service. We now have a national service for which the Secretary of State is responsible and which is to be administered in a way that ensures responsibility and accountability. We are talking, therefore, about a national service in which property vests not in the local board but in the national service. The Secretary of State then makes provision for the local service.
<P>
Amendment No. 126 is an interesting one, but I have to tell the hon. Gentleman that it is in the nature of Secretaries of State to believe that the resources they have made available to their services are satisfactory. That is in the nature of the beast and they do not feel the need for direction by an amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> On paragraph 13(3)(a), does the Minister believe that the words ``may not hold land'' will enable the board to house themselves, under licence or otherwise, in premises?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> The hon. Gentleman need have no fear about that. The Secretary of State will house them in appropriate premises. Those premises may vary. Some of them may be held freehold by the Secretary of State. Other premises may be held on licence. In some parts of the country the service is delivered through location in voluntary organisations that are occupied by licence. In other places there are mobile locations. There will be a variety of locations from which the service will be delivered. It will be for the Secretary of State to house the service in appropriate premises at appropriate locations.
<P>
This is an attractive way of proceeding because it frees local boards from the responsibilities and burdens of estate management. They can focus their attention on important matters of rehabilitation and crime reduction and prevention. That is why I think that amendment No. 114 is unnecessary.
<P>
However, the hon. Gentleman is right to draw our attention to the importance of ensuring that payment is prompt and punctual. That is one of the reasons why the reform and modernisation of the service is so important. In the past, the payment of grant money to probation committees has not always been punctual. This has not been a problem as they have been able to rely on their local authority, through which the payments have been channelled.
<P>
We appreciate that once the financial tie with the local authority is broken, it will be vital to boards that they receive funding on time in order to fulfil their financial obligations. I can assure the hon. Gentleman that we are working on that. Indeed, I had a meeting with the civil servant concerned yesterday to take him through the modernisation process. We are working with service representatives to design systems that will do just that. There is no need for it to be set in legislation. I hope that he feels I have dealt satisfactorily with the issue of ownership of property. The Bill, as drafted, allows for borrowing of money with the approval of the Secretary of State. I cannot imagine any circumstances in which we would want them to be able to do so without such approval. It is important to ensure that the Secretary of State has the flexibility to carry out his functions appropriately. That is why it is important to ensure that he is able to make the necessary directions to have inspections carried out and to obtain the information that is required in relation to any one board. I find amendment No. 126 difficult to understand, as it is hard to see why we should want to remove the power to revoke a particular arrangement. If an arrangement is found not to work effectively, surely it is important that it should be revoked. The amendment is misplaced.
<P>
I repeat the point I made at the outset, the Secretary of State will ensure that the service for which he is responsible is adequately funded. He has every reason to want it to be adequately funded since he is accountable for it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his assurance. I am not capable of boring the Committee with a long and arcane dissertation on land law but the words in paragraph 13(3)(a) ``may not hold land'' are pretty all-embracing and it looks as though the board will be occupying premises as invitees or something like that, not even as licensees. Anyway, I am grateful to the Minister for the reassurance he has given on the other matters raised and for those reasons I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 60, in page 43, line 36, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(3) The local board shall publish the plan (or any modified plan) prepared under this paragraph in at least two newspapers circulating widely in its area, and otherwise as It thinks fit or as the Secretary of State shall direct, and shall make it available for public inspection during ordinary office hours, either at the board's offices or at some convenient place appointed by the board.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss amendment No. 61, in page 44, line 6, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(c) arrange for the accounts to be published'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> The amendments relate to the annual plan. Paragraph 15 to schedule 1 states that the local board must prepare the plan and sub-paragraph (1)(b) states that they should send a copy to the Secretary of State. Therefore, it is important that local people, who are bound to have an interest in the work of the local probation service, should have the opportunity to see the plan, too. I am not sure whether the Minister has appreciated this, and I shall explain for the benefit of the rest of the Committee, that the wording we have chosen in amendment No. 60 will be familiar to the Government and certainly to some of the Minister's colleagues. We took that wording from part of the Government's own Political Parties Elections and Referendums Bill. In clause 139(2), the same words are used for arranging the opportunity for people to see one of the registers under that Bill. We hoped that by choosing wording from one of the Government's current Home Office Bill we could persuade the Government to look at this. We recognise that the Government may not be able to accept this amendment today, but we hope that the Minister will at least say that he shares our view that it is important that local people should have a right to see the plans that the local probation board will be putting forward. Therefore, they can make representations on them to members of the board and to others and, if necessary, even to the Secretary of State. Since this paragraph sets out a requirement that a plan should be prepared and that the Secretary of State should look at it and, if necessary, direct that it should be modified, local people should have some input.
<P>
This should not be a matter of partisan conflict. The Minister may well say that he does not necessarily want that obligation to be included in the Bill, but I hope that he will consider it. All political parties have an interest in the public playing a part. It may help, for example, to bring forward candidates as possible appointees for future boards. That fits in with the discussions we had earlier on other amendments. I hope that, without detaining the Committee for too long, the Minister will at least leave the door ajar for further consideration of something along the lines of amendment No. 60.
<P>
Amendment No. 61 would require the board to publish its accounts in exactly the same way as its annual report to the Secretary of State. Again, there is a genuine public interest in the accounts being seen to be available since we are talking about taxpayers' money. We cannot see any good reason why they should not be published. I hope that the Minister will be prepared to consider the amendments with his officials and perhaps table Government amendments that will achieve the same ends, either on Report or in another place.
<P>
These are important matters and we hope that the Minister will respond to them in the spirit in which they are proposed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I see and accept the strength of the argument that is made for public involvement, knowledge of the plan and a sense of ownership. At least the summary of the accounts ought to be contained within the report and thereby be made available. We must ensure in relation to the plan—it is important because it is the means by which the Secretary of State holds the local board to account—that the public have a sense of engagement. I shall make sure, in one way or another, that they do and I undertake to reflect on how best to bring that about. We need to look at how a synthesis of the annual report, plan and accounts can best be brought into the public domain. A way must be found that is capable of stimulating some interest and even debate and which also makes possible cross connections with the police plan and the strategies of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 that are also part of the criminal justice partnership.
<P>
It may be that this matter can be dealt with by way of directions. Paragraph 14 to schedule 1 makes that possible. I shall write to the hon. Gentleman before Report to tell him how we believe that our shared objectives can best be realised.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I appreciate that helpful response and the way in which the Minister has said that he will take the points on board. Perhaps he will write, not only to me, but to all members of the Committee since this is a matter of general interest. I am glad to hear that he may be able to accept, if not our wording, then something akin to it. We look forward to hearing from him in due course and in the light of his assurances as to his intentions, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> I beg to move, amendment No. 119, in page 43, line 43, leave out from `report' to end of line 44.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss amendment No. 122, in clause 7, page 4, line 23, leave out from `report' to end of line 24.
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> I hope that we shall not need a lengthy debate on these fairly small amendments. I was a member of the Committee that considered the Local Government Act 1999, which dealt with best value. During those proceedings, we had a debate about exactly the same powers being given to another Secretary of State. Our amendments were not accepted at that time, although I am optimistic that this time there may have been a change of mind.
<P>
In that legislator, the powers determined not only what information should be given in best value annual reports and when they should be published, but also what form they should take. I suspect that almost the same wording is used in schedule 1. The wording of our amendments is similar to what it was then and the arguments are the same. If the powers in the Bill are conferred on the Secretary of State, on top of those he already has, he will have no time to breathe, sleep or do anything else. We are helping him by saying ``This is one power it will be very easy to deny yourself''.
<P>
Amendment No. 122 is consequential on amendment No. 119 and refers to clause 7. As I said, we were unsuccessful with a similar amendment to a previous Bill, but a different Secretary of State is involved in this case and I have often heard him say in the Chamber that he is of a liberal mind and wants less power rather than more.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> the hon. Lady has referred to the matter slightly tongue in cheek, but she will recall that the Secretary of State has frequently attacked Hampstead liberals, so it appears that there is some difference of view.
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> I have always taken that to mean that he likes, say, south-west England liberals even if those from Hampstead do not have a particular place in his affections. I have often heard him say that his natural inclination is towards giving power away, so the amendment will allow him to give vent to that by denying himself a higher level of interference in local boards. It is a simple amendment and I should be thrilled if the Minister felt able to accept it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I echo what the hon. Member for Taunton has said. It seems extraordinary that the Secretary of State is taking to himself, and to every future Secretary of State, so many powers. As the hon. Lady has rightly said, here are some that the Secretary of State does not need. The Government have acquired an extraordinary reputation for control freakery on all aspects of everything. One does not have to take the word of Liberal Democrats or Conservatives on that; it has become clearly established in public perception. All the newspapers, whether from the left or the right, even those that during the Labour party's years in Opposition consistently supported it, now attack the Government for their control-freak tendencies. Here is a small example where the Government could say ``The Secretary of State really does not need these powers.''.
<P>
I got the impression that the hon. Lady was merely probing, but I suspect that we may need to refer to these matters in another place. Even if we do not pursue them to a vote today, I hope that the Minister will be able to indicate that he will keep them under review and perhaps consult his of officials on whether the Secretary of State needs to direct absolutely everything that forms the report.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> I am quite satisfied that the Secretary of State does need the powers. It beggar's belief to the hon. Member for Taunton and the hon. Member for Surrey Heath caricature the Government and the Secretary of State in the way that they—but 'twas ever thus.
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> Perhaps, if the Minister thinks that we are being unfair, he will tell us how many new powers are given to the Secretary of State in this Bill alone. I am sure that either he or his officials must have counted them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> Enough to do the job. That is the only answer that the hon. Lady needs. We have better things to do with our time than to count the Secretary of State's powers.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I appreciate the spirit of the Minister's argument, but the Hansard reporters cannot hear what is being said.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> Perhaps Hansard will not be missing much after all.
<P>
I shall deal with the serious substance of the hon. Lady's argument. We are setting up a unified national service, which demands a level of consistency among its constituent parts. One way to achieve that is by requiring information to be separated in each board's annual report in a standard form and to be produced by a set date. That is not unreasonable. It will not inhibit the capacity of a board to present such information in an attractive way that responds to local needs and concerns. The board will be judge of how best to present the report, in terms of its design and its content.
<P>
However, there must be a certain minimum content. The report must be presented in a standard way to enable the public and the Secretary of State to compare the performance of different services. It is important to ensure that members of the public who read the information—perhaps for the first time, and who do not have the detailed information that is available to the Secretary of State—can judge the performance of their local board and compare it with the performance of other boards. I am talking about transparency and accountability, not control freakery.
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> I am not convinced of the Minister's argument. I was amused, however, by the measure of support from the Conservative Front Bench because I often worry about the Government's control-freak tendency and feel that they may be building on an 18-„year legacy left to them by the previous Government.
<P>
However, I am delighted to accept support from wherever it comes, even though it is sometimes from surprising quarters.
<P>
The Minister said that he had better things to do with his time than to count the extra powers given to the Secretary of State under the Bill. He has made our point for us: there are so many powers that it would take him too long to count them. If there were only one or two new ones, it would take him only a matter of seconds.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> How many are there?
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> I have not counted them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boateng:</B> Why not?
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> I have better things to do with my time. There are too many powers, but I suspect that, after our sitting, someone will count them.
<P>
Now is not the appropriate time to have an in-depth debate on such matters, but during our discussions on many other Bills, we have debated how a national service with national standards can meet the expectations and legitimate demands of the Government for common standards throughout England and Wales, yet still be responsive to local needs and provide a locally based service. I am sure that the Minister accepts that there is always an in-„built tension in any service, whether it be the health service, the probation service or the police service, but there is obviously a difference between us about where to draw the line. Giving effective powers to the Secretary of State to decide the form of the reports is drawing the line too close to central control. I am sure that we shall return to the matter but, for the moment, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Further consideration adjourned—[Mr. Mike Hall.]
<P>
