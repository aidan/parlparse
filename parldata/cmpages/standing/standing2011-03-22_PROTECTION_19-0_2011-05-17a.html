                           </strong> Good morning on this, our last day in
Committee. New clauses 19 to 22 and new schedule 2 put into effect our
intention to bring the current functions of the Criminal Records Bureau
and the Independent Safeguarding Authority together in one new body, to
be known as the disclosure and barring service. It will be responsible
for the barring regime and the disclosure of criminal records and is in
line with the Government’s review of the vetting and barring
scheme, which recommended that a single body be formed to undertake
those duties. The National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Children supports the merger of the CRB and the ISA, and says that it
should make the vetting and disclosure system more efficient and
improve flows of information about individuals who may pose a risk to
children and vulnerable adults. It is logical and
sensible.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000050">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
a result of establishing a new non-departmental body rather than a new
Home Office agency, decisions about barring individuals from working in
regulated activity will continue to be taken independently of
Ministers, which is as it should be. The new clauses and the new
schedule would provide for the establishment of the disclosure and
barring service as a new body corporate and for the dissolution of the
Independent Safeguarding Authority. They would further provide for the
transfer to the disclosure and barring service of the functions of the
Independent Safeguarding Authority and the Criminal Records
Bureau.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000051">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Provision
is also made for the transfer of the staff of the two existing
organisations, as well as their property, rights and liabilities. The
TUPE regulations will apply to staff transfers, and the terms of the
transfer will be set out more fully in a staff transfer scheme. It is
our intention that both the existing sites for the Independent
Safeguarding Authority and Criminal Records Bureau in Darlington and
Liverpool will remain in use and retain their current functions. The
new disclosure and barring service will bring together into the one
body the important linked functions relating to criminal records and
public protection. It will maintain the independence of the barring
regime and provide the freedom to manage and deliver the overall
service.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000052">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendments
223 and 241 would make consequential amendments to the clause, and
provide for the extension of certain provisions under part 5 of the
Bill to the Crown dependencies and the long title. Bringing together
the Independent Safeguarding Authority and the Criminal Records Bureau
in such a way is a logical step forward. The new disclosure and barring
service will result in a more efficient and effective service to
employees and employers, as well as volunteers and voluntary bodies. On
that basis, I commend the amendments to the
Committee.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000053">&#160;</a>

                           </span> Good morning, Mr
Streeter and members of the Committee. As we said at the beginning of
our sitting on Thursday, the major structural change creating the
disclosure and barring service was set out in the review 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 715<a class="bkMark" name="Column715">&#160;</a>
                           </div>on vetting and barring that the Government carried out earlier this
year. They said that they were minded to pursue that option. However,
the Minister quoted from the NSPCC briefing on this group of
amendments, in which it
says:<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000054">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“Since
the launch of the report in February, Government has not said anything
publicly about what the merger between the ISA and CRB would involve.
The legislative changes required to underpin a merger were not
contained within the Protection of Freedom's Bill when it was first
introduced.”<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000303">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>It
is extremely regrettable that such a major, albeit welcome, change to
the structure has been introduced in a rushed way at the end of the
Committee’s
deliberations.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000055">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
am disappointed that we have not had an opportunity, as we did on all
the other clauses, to consider the change informed by the excellent
research produced by the House of Commons Library in its research
papers, and the explanatory notes that are produced to help us
scrutinise Bills more effectively. I also understand that no impact
assessment has been produced on the change, which is very
disappointing. The Committee is obviously at a bit of a disadvantage in
trying to give it effective
scrutiny.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000056">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
spent most of one whole day looking at vetting and barring without
really having an opportunity to consider the effects of the new
structure that will be created and to think through what that will mean
for some of the earlier clauses that we debated at length, which is
disappointing. We would welcome a response from the Minister on why the
proposal has been tucked in right at the end of the Bill. If the
Government were minded to take such a course of action in February,
they could have indicated that to the Committee, which would have given
us the opportunity to raise our concerns as we went through the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000057">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
am also concerned that we have received a great deal of written
evidence from interested parties and had the Public Reading stage of
the Bill—it has been helpful to look at all those
remarks—but, of course, no comments have been made on the group
of amendments, either in written submissions or in the Public Reading
stage, which is
disappointing.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000058">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
have several questions for the Minister on the group of amendments,
because of the lack of information before they were tabled. Government
amendment 223 seems to be consequential on the creation of the DBS.
Will she explain exactly what the amendment will do? Does it restrict
the amount of the Bill that will apply to the Channel Islands and the
Isle of Man? Do the ISA and the CRB currently cover the Channel Islands
and the Isle of Man, and do their Administrations help pay the cost of
the ISA and the CRB at the moment? Do the same vetting and barring
arrangements apply to the Channel Islands and the Isle of
Man?<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000059">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Government
new clause 19 will create the DBS. The proposal was first put forward
in the Home Office’s review of the vetting and barring scheme,
and it was flagged by the Government as a way forward that they were
minded to accept. I have already set out that it is difficult
effectively to scrutinise the proposal, given the late tabling of the
new clauses, the new schedule and the amendments, but will the Minister
explain in more detail the current legal entity of the ISA, which I
understand is a non-departmental public body, and the CRB, which is an
executive agency? Will the Minister explain why it is appropriate for
the new body to be a 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 716<a class="bkMark" name="Column716">&#160;</a>
                           </div>body corporate, and what that means for the structure that will be
created? May we have further information about why it will not just be
a non-departmental public body or an executive
agency?<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000060">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
body that is to be created will be a body corporate, so is it possible
that its creation might be the first stage in the privatisation of the
DBS? Down the line, might the service be outsourced to the private
sector? What consultation took place with employees and trade unions
before the amendments were tabled a week ago to abolish the CRB and the
ISA? Given that no impact assessment has been released and that there
was no discussion of the proposal in the oral evidence or written
submissions, can the Minister confirm that no jobs will be lost with
the creation of the DBS? Can she also confirm whether there has been
any formal consultation with the trade unions that represent employees
at the ISA and the
CRB?<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000061">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
has not been an impact assessment, so can the Minister set out the
actual costs of merging the two bodies? What are the IT costs? What, if
any, redundancy costs has the Minister identified? On property and
relocation, the Minister said in her opening remarks that both sites in
Darlington and Liverpool would remain open, so there is no obvious
reduction in costs from moving to a single site. Will the Minister
explain whether there will be any cost savings in the merger? How will
the process be streamlined if we are to have two sites running in
Darlington and Liverpool? Will there be one management system for the
DBS, and how does the Minister envisage that that will
operate?<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000062">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">What
does the Minister think the cost savings will be once the merger is
complete? Has the ISA been consulted on this change? Why were the ISA
and CRB not invited by the Minister to give evidence to the Committee,
because it was clearly in the mind of the Minister that at some stage
the proposal would be brought before the Committee to
consider?<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000063">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">When
does the Minister expect to have the DBS up and running, and can she
explain the position on Northern Ireland? I understand that the
CRB’s equivalent—Access Northern Ireland—will
stay. Will the DBS system operate alongside Access Northern Ireland,
which will keep its separate
system?<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000064">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Government
new clause 20 gives the Secretary of State powers to transfer any
functions of the ISA to the DBS. The Bill allows for the gradual
transfer of functions. For how long will the two bodies run in
parallel? Will the ISA and the CRB run alongside the DBS? When the
security industry body was set up a few years ago, there were many
problems at the beginning with delays in taking information forward and
in checking people who provided security at nightclubs and pubs. I am
concerned that there may be a similar problem when this new body is set
up. One way of dealing with that would be to run the two schemes in
parallel.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000065">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
NSPCC’s submission said that it was worried about delays and
confusion arising from the handover. What measures has the Minister put
in place to ensure an orderly transition? None of us wants to see
delays and missed
information.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000066">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On
IT systems, what measures have been taken to develop a single system?
What problems have been identified and envisaged? How long does the
Minister think it will take to set up a single IT system, and what is
the expected cost of that
system?<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000067">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Will functions
currently exercised by the Secretary of State be transferred to the
DBS? The Secretary of State has powers to decide the level of fees, and
we have seen in the written evidence a great deal of concern from the
voluntary sector about additional costs that it may incur because of
fees. The trade unions have also expressed worries about poorly paid
employees being asked to meet the costs of additional charges. Has the
Minister given that any thought, and will the Secretary of State retain
the power to levy fees? The cost of the merger might be high; will it
be met by those who require CRB checks? Will there be an increase in
the fees that they are asked to pay to meet such
costs?<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000068">&#160;</a>

Secretary of State must interact with the police when deciding what
information to disclose, as we have heard throughout our discussions on
vetting and barring. Have the police been consulted on the new
provision? How will the Minister ensure that the DBS does not inundate
the police with requests to ease its own investigative work
load?<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000069">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Government
new clause 21 addresses the Secretary of State’s power to make
orders under clause 20. Will the Minister set out the limits of that
power under subsection (1)? What if an order contradicts
other primary legislation? Will a further resolution of both Houses be
required under subsection (2) before any powers are handed over to the
DBS?<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000070">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Can the
Minister give an example of one of the hybrid instruments to which
subsection (4) refers? When would such an instrument be used?
Subsection (5) refers to Acts passed by the Northern Ireland Assembly
or the Welsh Assembly. What if such Acts are not compatible with the
responsibility for the DBS to remain in Westminster? Can any of the
devolved bodies usurp its role?<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000071">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Government
new clause 22 allows for the transfer of property and staff to the DBS.
The DBS will be a separate legal entity, so can the Minister confirm
whether that will mean that property will be transferred away from the
Government? Will the DBS be able to dispose of that property? Will all
staff be transferred? The clause allows for a fund to compensate any
person whose interests are adversely affected. Can she tell us how much
is in that fund and what assessment has been made of the likely demands
on it? Can she give an example of a typical
payout?<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000072">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Will
the Minister say a bit more about Government amendment 241 and its
effect? New schedule 2 sets out in more detail the procedures for
establishing the DBS. Will she explain in what circumstances under
paragraph 17(1)(c) the DBS might need to borrow money? In
addition, paragraph 17(2)(a) refers to “gifts of money”.
Will she say why that provision is included?<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000073">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Will the
Minister set out clearly how the body will be different from the ISA
and the CRB, so that we are clear about what is being established?
Finally, what will be the effect of the measure on the employment of
staff? What is the key issue when members of staff move to the new
body? The Minister has indicated that TUPE will apply; will there be
any changes to employment status that we should be aware of?<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000074">&#160;</a>

those questions are technical and detailed, which is a result of the
Government’s failure to set out the measure clearly when the
Bill was introduced. Much of the information could have been provided
in a written form, either in an impact assessment, as I have said, or
in explanatory notes, which would have assisted Committee members in
properly considering the Government’s new

                           </span> I apologise for not being here
at the beginning of the sitting. It is nice to see the Minister in her
place. I am not sure whether she was in the car behind me—it
took us an hour to get here from the station. She was beeping the
horn—I am not sure whether to make the taxi go faster, but it
certainly spurred us all on to make sure that we got here more quickly
than we might have.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000076">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I shall make
a couple of comments on Government new clauses 19 to 22. The hon.
Member for Kingston upon Hull North has spoken about Northern Ireland
and I want to discuss that aspect and ask the Minister a few questions.
I am grateful for the opportunity to speak about the new clauses, and
the schedule in particular.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000077">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It seems a
most sensible idea to combine the functions of the CRB and the ISA into
a disclosure and barring service. The CRB and the ISA currently work
closely together, with the CRB providing a back office function for the
ISA on flow of conviction data. The CRB provides a disclosure service
for England and Wales. In Northern Ireland that function is provided by
AccessNI. The new body will provide a barring service only for Northern
Ireland, notwithstanding that there are, and will need to be, close
links between both disclosure bodies. That was hinted at by the hon.
Member for Kingston upon Hull North. As the Minister indicated in the
last sitting, this co-operation is in everyone’s interest, given
the level of population movement across the UK, which is greater today
with the movement of people looking for
jobs.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000078">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
want to ask the Minister a number of questions about this, so I ask for
her patience. I am happy if her officials want to write to me on these
issues, if that is easier for her. First, will she put on record the
expectation that there should continue to be a Northern Ireland board
member on the new body, who will bring their expertise on Northern
Ireland to the table? I am keen to ensure that that happens, because it
will add to the process and give some collective responsibility to
those board members in how the process works.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000079">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Does the
Minister agree that there needs to be close collaboration with the
Northern Ireland Executive in the development of DBS arrangements? I
hope she would acknowledge that the Northern Ireland
Administration have provided a large input into developments, which has
facilitated the ISA’s operation in Northern Ireland to date. I
want to put on record my thanks to the Minister for the co-operation
that there has been with the Northern Ireland Assembly to ensure that
this process moves smoothly. That has been welcomed by many, both by
those who represent Northern Ireland in this House and by those in the
Northern Ireland Assembly, who have been directly involved in the
process.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000080">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Secondly,
how will the continuous updating service be delivered in Northern
Ireland? Will it be contracted out to the DBS? I imagine that it would
make sense to link existing infrastructure and systems. Does the
Minister 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 719<a class="bkMark" name="Column719">&#160;</a>
                           </div>agree that both the ISA currently, and the DBS as it comes into
operation, will gather valuable information across England, Wales and
Northern Ireland on the types of referrals and the nature of barring
decisions? That would be invaluable in providing evidence of risk by
role, sector and region. I ask for her assurance that that information
will be publicly available in annual reports and used to develop and
inform arrangements by evidencing risk. I would also like some idea of
the trends in Northern Ireland on referrals and barring. I am not sure
whether that information is available today. If it is not, it would be
helpful if it could be furnished to me at a later
date.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000081">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
am also glad to note that the non-departmental public body will have
the usual arm’s length relationship with the Government. One of
the issues in the past was barring decisions being overseen or agreed
by Ministers. I hope that the Minister endorses the need for the
operational independence of the service. Again, I seek her response to
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000082">&#160;</a>

will the Minister give me some information on the cost of checks
provided by the DBS? I want the Minister’s assurance that checks
for volunteers will continue to be free for both applications and
continuous
updating.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000083">&#160;</a>

                           </span> First, I echo the
remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull North about
how late in the day these amendments have come. When we were
considering some of our earlier points, we did not have the opportunity
to think through what the consequences of the amendments might be. My
concern is not based on the fact that the ISA is in Darlington and that
there may be a consequence to employment in my constituency. I can
assure everyone that that has not entered my head once during these
deliberations.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000084">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">My concern is
about the management of the ISA. When Sir Roger Singleton and one of
the managers of the ISA gave evidence, I was struck by the
manager’s in-depth knowledge of how the ISA operates. She had a
careful understanding of the decision-making process, the appeals
procedure and the investigatory function of the ISA. Although the
proposal is sensible, one of the potential pitfalls of the merger may
be that some of the management expertise at the ISA is lost, if certain
management functions are merged too quickly without fully thinking the
process through with the CRB. Although the two bodies sometimes deal
with similar individuals, and they have a common purpose, they fulfil
different functions. It would be very damaging if skills at the top of
the ISA were lost, so I want reassurance that the Minister will take
that possibility on board and make sure that it does not happen when
the two organisations
merge.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000085">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> There is an extensive list of points to come
back to. I will answer the hon. Member for Darlington first. It is our
ambition to retain and capture the expertise built up in the very

her officials for the briefing on Thursday afternoon. I appreciated it
very much, but I still think that it is rather unfortunate that it was
at the tail end of the Bill and that all the written submissions and
the evidence sessions took place without our knowing what the
Government were planning to bring forward. That was my
point.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000088">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I understand that, but the provision was
always in our view and it was a recommendation in the vetting and
barring scheme review. I know of the hon. Lady’s concerns about
the tabling of the amendments coming after the majority of our debates.
However, the NSPCC says that the merger of the CRB and ISA should not
have any implications for the elements of the disclosure and barring
processes that are set out in legislation. The provision is essentially
about the organisation of the functions rather than their substance. We
signalled in our remodelling review that we would bring together
functions of the ISA and the CRB, but it was not possible to include
the necessary provisions in the Bill when it was
introduced.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000089">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
have brought forward the new clauses as quickly as we could, and
discussing them at this point does not alter anything that was said
when we were considering the provisions in part 5. That is an important
point. If something of importance was affecting what we are legislating
for, that would perhaps be an issue, but although the provision is
late, the organisational functions, which are supported on all sides as
logical and sensible, remain logical and, indeed,
sensible.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000090">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Lady asked about the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man. The
clause enables the provisions in chapters 1 and 2 of part 5 of the
Bill, which are mainly provisions to reform the vetting and barring
scheme and the criminal records regime, to be extended to the Channel
Islands and the Isle of Man by Order in Council. The decision to extend
those provisions is a matter for the islands themselves. The provisions
in part 5 of the Police Act 1997 have already been extended
with appropriate modifications to Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of
Man.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000091">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Lady also asked about the current status of those islands. In
relation to the vetting and barring scheme, the clause follows the
example in subsection 66(4) of the Safeguarding Vulnerable
Groups Act 2006, which enables the Act to be similarly extended,
although the power has not yet been exercised. I hope that that answers
her queries about the Channel
Islands.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000092">&#160;</a>

hon. Lady asked about impact assessments. The published impact
assessment provides assessment of the policy proposals as they stood at
introduction. The impact assessment is currently being revised and it
will be submitted to the regulatory policy committee for scrutiny in

Government’s amendments, including the ISA-CRB merger. It will
be published in time for introduction in the Lords, so it will receive
full scrutiny there, although I accept that in the hon. Lady’s

                           </strong> I will look at that point for the hon. Lady.
It obviously depends on the timing of Report. If the Bill were to come
back tomorrow, the answer would probably be no, but if there is an
extended period we can consider the possibility of bringing the process
forward.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000098">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Lady asked why there would be an NDPB. The answer is so that the
functions can be taken at arm’s length; it is crucial that there
be no influence by Ministers in the decision-making powers of the ISA
and that there is absolute
separation.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000099">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Lady asked several questions about staff and their
representatives. There will be full consultation with staff in both
organisations. They will be engaged and kept informed as work
progresses to implement the DBS. The Home Office and other Departments
will work closely and collaboratively with the chief executives and
senior management teams of both the CRB and the ISA, as well as with
employee representatives to ensure that there is active engagement and
that information and messages are
shared.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000100">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
I said, TUPE will apply to staff at the CRB and the ISA as part of the
staff transfer scheme. As for whether staff will be transferring to the
new organisation, we will be reviewing the structure of the senior
management team, but other staff are expected to transfer to the new
body. The terms and conditions of staff transfers from the CRB and the
ISA to the new organisation will be progressed in accordance with the
Cabinet Office statement of practice. Transferred staff will become
employees of the DBS, which, as the new employer, will be bound by the
contracts of employment as they existed prior to the transfer.
Continuity of service will be
recognised.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000101">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">For
more general information, CRB employees are currently civil servants
and they will transfer on the terms and conditions in place immediately
prior to the transfer. They will no longer be civil servants, but
public servants. In the instance of questions being asked by staff
about whether they will have to reapply for their own jobs and how
employees from the CRB and the ISA will be appointed to posts within
the new organisation, for the vast majority of posts there will be a
direct crossover between roles in the existing organisation and the new
organisation. We want to make the process as

                           </div>simple and as straightforward as possible. In cases when a direct
crossover might not prove possible, there will be a transparent and
fair process to link existing roles with comparable new
roles.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000102">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                           <em>]</em> Perhaps not. For the avoidance of
doubt, our intention is to enable the new organisation to be part of
the principal civil service pension scheme. Employees of the CRB and
the ISA would transfer to the new organisation with their existing
pension rights. However, that requires an application to the scheme,
which will be submitted and progressed in accordance with Cabinet
Office and Her Majesty’s Treasury guidelines and
procedures.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000103">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Lady asked about the limits of the order. The Secretary of State
is limited in her order-making power under new clause 21. The power may
be used only to make orders to transfer ISA functions to the DBS, so it
has a very narrow focus. Under new clause 20, orders may
transfer functions of the Secretary of State only in relation to part 5
of the Police Act 1997, the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006 and
the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups (Northern Ireland) Order 2007. The
hon. Lady asked whether there might be a conflict between an order and
parts of the legislation; there will not be such a
conflict.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000104">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
new disclosure and barring service will carry out all the barring
functions for both England and Wales and for Northern Ireland. The DBS
will also carry out what are currently CRB functions, and Access
Northern Ireland will continue to carry out its functions. That answers
the hon. Lady’s point about Northern Ireland, but I will refer
again to Northern Ireland when I respond to the hon. Member for
Strangford.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000105">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">When
the CRB and the ISA are merged, there will be one management team for
the new organisation. That will streamline the decision-making process,
as there will be only one decision-making management team for
disclosure and
barring.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000106">&#160;</a>

circumstance that the question might arise—we do not envisage
that happening; the provision is included solely for the avoidance of

                           </div>of gifts, are standard for non-departmental public bodies. Indeed,
similar provisions were made for the ISA in the Safeguarding Vulnerable

                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Lady asked whether the property is held by the Government; who
owns it and who can sell it? The CRB currently occupies property
provided under a public-private partnership agreement, which is
therefore not Government property. When the CRB is merged into the DBS,
the new body can occupy property that it leases or rents as a
non-departmental public
body.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000112">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Lady asked about IT systems. The IT systems operated by the ISA
and the CRB are currently being assessed with a view to their moving to
a single system. We expect any such system to be subject to a key test,
and there are plans to do that in late summer. The same point relates
to contract expiry dates, the formation of the new body and allowing
the new body to let new contracts rather than trying to manage
different contracts in each bit—if the hon. Lady understands
what I
mean.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000114">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On
the hon. Lady’s last query, the Channel Islands and the Isle of
Man do not pay for the ISA as the 2006 Act does not extend to them.
However, they pay fees for CRB applications, because part 5 of the 1997
Act has been extended to them. Fees for CRB applications are set on a
cost-recovery basis. Will the hon. Lady remind me which points I have
omitted from my
response?<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000115">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> One of the big problems is that it is difficult
to get figures from the Minister on what cost savings may occur once
the merger has taken place. Is she expecting any savings? Does she have
any idea about the actual cost of the merger and what savings might
result?<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000116">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">On
the IT system, does the Minister have a budget for setting up the new
system that would merge the two systems that operate currently? It
would be helpful to have some hard figures on what the change will cost
in the light of the continuing refrain from the Government that they do
not have any money. I am interested to know where the money is coming
from for these proposals. Does the Minister think there will be some
savings?<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000117">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I thank the hon. Lady for reminding me of
the two points that I forgot. I will try to come back to her on the
figures; if I cannot do it in Committee, I undertake to write to her as
soon as we have them. The two bodies are coming together because it is
a logical conclusion of all the things that we have done to make a
better and more streamlined system. Together, they will retain
expertise—the hon. Member for Darlington’s
point—and make a better single body, able to deal in a more
streamlined way with employers, employees, volunteers and voluntary
organisations. I hope to come back to the hon. Member for Kingston upon
Hull North, but if I cannot, I will write to
her.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000118">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Member for Strangford asked a number of questions about the
provisions, and I will address them in turn. First, he asked whether
someone with experience 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 724<a class="bkMark" name="Column724">&#160;</a>
                           </div>of safeguarding issues in Northern Ireland would be appointed as a
member of the disclosure and barring service. I am pleased to
acknowledge the helpful role played by both Access NI and the Northern
Ireland Executive in developing the provisions in part 5 of the Bill
and applying them to Northern Ireland. New schedule 2 provides for
consultation with the Northern Ireland Administration on membership of
the new disclosure and barring service. We will be happy to ensure that
we include a suitable member to represent the particular circumstances
of Northern Ireland. <em>[</em>
                           <em>Interruption.</em>
                           <em>]</em> I did not
hear what the hon. Member for Strangford
said.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000119">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Secondly,
the hon. Gentleman asked how the continuous updating service will be
delivered in Northern Ireland. For our part, we would be content for
the disclosure and barring service to deliver the continuous updating
service in Northern Ireland too. We are currently discussing the
details of that, including the costs, with officials in the Northern
Ireland
Administration.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000120">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Thirdly,
the hon. Gentleman asked about the provision of barring information. I
assure him that appropriate arrangements will be in place, both for
sharing relevant information and for ensuring that appropriate barring
information is available in respect of Northern Ireland. On operational
independence, which I have covered to some extent already, I assure the
hon. Gentleman that the new disclosure and barring service will retain
full independence in decision making. He will have noted that new
schedule 2 enables the Secretary of State to give directions to the new
body in relation to the exercise of its disclosure functions, under
part 5 of the Police Act 1997. Those functions are currently the
responsibility of the CRB, although not in respect of the core role of
decision making on barring, which is a separate
entity.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000121">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Finally,
the hon. Gentleman asked about the cost of criminal record checks
provided by the new disclosure and barring service. The hon. Member for
Kingston upon Hull North raised the issue as well. Criminal record
checks will continue to be issued free of charge to volunteers. As it
was, it continues to be. No final decision has been reached on how the
costs of the continuing updating service will be apportioned. We bear
in mind the needs of volunteers, and the need for volunteers to come
forward.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000122">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On
setting up the organisation, I have only brief information to give the
hon. Lady. There will be no change to sites or operational
infrastructure as a result of setting up the DBS. We expect the cost to
be minimal. The IT contracts of both the ISA and the CRB are due to be
renewed in any event, as I have tried to explain, so the merger will
not add to IT costs. The contracts are up for termination anyway, so a
new contract will be let as the existing ones finish in the near
future.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000123">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We had a long
debate on the retention of DNA and the evidence supporting six years
and three years. We proved that retention for three years is justified,
but there was no unequivocal evidence to prove whether six years is
more desirable. We argued at that time that the introduction of a
six-year period would allow us to obtain the empirical information that
we needed to make a decision about the time limit. To whose freedoms
does the title of the Bill refer, because people may suffer as a
consequence of our taking this giant leap of introducing a cut-off
period of three years for the retention of biometric details?<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000143">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Consequences
have driven many of the measures today. Looking back, the previous
Government did not come in with the intention of retaining innocent
people’s DNA, introducing control orders, or taking biometric
details from children in schools. However, the consequences of events
and public opinion forces certain decisions to be taken. As the years
go by, I am sure that there will be events that cause the coalition
Government to reconsider some of their
decisions.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000144">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In

three to defy their parents. There will certainly be a freedom for
three-year-olds, but I am not

                           </div>sure that parents see that as a freedom, because the Bill will say to
them that their three-year-old may defy them over that child’s
biometric details. That is an interesting consequence of a freedom, and
it calls into question the title of the Bill—whose freedom will
it protect?—because we want to protect the freedom of parents to
be parents, and not to interfere in such a
way.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000145">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We
have discovered that the protection of freedoms is limited in relation
to CCTV, because only a small fraction of CCTV cameras are covered by
the Bill. For all that we have heard the headline-grabbing statements
about the intrusion of CCTV into people’s private lives and the
extent of surveillance of people by CCTV, when we got down to the
detail we found that the Bill covers very few of the CCTV cameras about
which people are concerned. CCTV cameras in the hands of private
organisations cause concern among the public, and not those in the
hands of public organisations, which are more accountable for what they
do with their information. But it is against the use of CCTV by public
organisations that the Protection of Freedoms Bill seeks to provide
protection.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000146">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We
had a similar situation with the freedom of people to protect
themselves from rogue parkers, because of the protection given to rogue
clampers. I cited the example of the Cator estate in my constituency,
where residents were told that they could no longer use a simple system
of clamping to protect themselves from people causing great problems in
their community. They are now unable to protect themselves in the way
that they had done for some time without causing any of the problems
that the Bill seeks to address. I know we all want to deal with problem
clampers, but I wonder whether we have created a problem of rogue
ticketers.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000147">&#160;</a>

freedoms to some people and taking away others from

Committee on behalf of the Opposition Whip, who made the cardinal
mistake of cajoling me into becoming a member of a Committee that is
scrutinising a Bill in which I have a policy interest. I shall not
detain the Committee overlong, but there are some serious issues that I
think could strengthen the freedoms in the Bill, to build on the theme
unusually developed by my colleague while covering the previous
clause.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000172">&#160;</a>

time in my life, I regret not being a Minister today, as I do not have
his excellent Bill team to assist me in making my argument. I hope that
he is tolerant with me if I veer off the path a little. I thank the
Clerk, who has brilliantly allowed me to speak to all my new clauses in
the same sitting and has put them in very logical
order.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000173">&#160;</a>

basket of new clauses has two main themes. The first group, new clauses
2, 3, 4 and 6, deals with a failure of regulation, whereas new clauses
10 and 11 cover new measures to deal with intrusions of privacy. The
first group allows me to talk to both Opposition Front Benchers and
Ministers about the weaknesses in the regulatory arrangements under the
Data Protection Act. The consequences are threefold: first, people
cannot be sure that their information is safe and held in a responsible
way; secondly, people do not have the requisite degree of control over
when and how their information is gathered and used; and thirdly,
people cannot seek sufficient redress when they suffer from the misuse
or loss of personal
information.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000174">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
am not along in holding that view: privacy advocates in the UK and EU
privacy legislators believe that the regulation and oversight of
privacy in the UK is currently too weak. They believe there are
fundamental weaknesses in the powers and remit of the Information
Commissioner, combined with the problem of the Data Protection Act that
the commissioner and his office enforce; on the latter point, the focus
of dispute is the UK’s failure to ensure that the Data
Protection Act is properly implemented under the EU data protection
directive.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000175">&#160;</a>

am sorry to go on about Europe, but some valid arguments are coming
from Europe. The European Commission is pursuing the UK in the European
Court of Justice at the moment over its perception of our failures. The
Commission requested that the UK<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000176">&#160;</a>

does—but even so, those words are pretty stark, and I agree with

regulatory framework has to ensure there is robust oversight and that
people have sufficient control over how their own data are used. The
new clauses I am proposing are an opportunity to apply corrective
measures or, as is more likely, to start a debate on the topic with the
Minister.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000179">&#160;</a>

would create the requirement for specific and informed consent through
the addition of the word “explicit” in the opening
paragraph of schedule 2 to the Data Protection Act to ensure that users
show that they know what they are signing up to when handing over
personal data. As the law stands, any organisation can say that a
person implied consent for the use of their data, purely because they
do not currently have to be explicit. The EU data protection directive
specifies that user consent must

                        <p>which
has led to the notion of “implied consent”, but that is a
long way

                        <p>In
countries such as Germany, consent is required to be explicit in
writing, revocable, and not tied to terms and conditions. That is
partly to do with Germany’s history and its relationship with
state-controlled information about citizens. I like to think that we
could learn from the Germans in this area of policy. An example would
be behavioural advertising, when consent is said to be implied by the
fact that people do not stop cookies being
collected.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000183">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Another
example that might allow members of the Committee to understand what I
am trying to get at is when someone makes a purchase in a store for a
large item— electrical goods, for instance. It is not uncommon
for a store assistant to ask for a name and address, but when they take
that personal information with “implied consent”, they
fail to inform the person that they are going to stick their name and
address on a database. In many cases, that can lead to unsolicited
direct mail—direct marketing in general—and people being
bombarded with marketing messages that they did not sign up to. The new
clause would mean that retailers who collect and use a person’s
information would have to make sure that they can demonstrate that the
person gave explicit consent for their information to be used and
stored on a
database.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000184">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">New
clause 3 allows the Information Commissioner to inspect an
organisation’s premises for evidence of breaches of privacy
regulation. When the EU complained about the UK’s implementation
of the directive, it said that
the<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000185">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

personal data, nor enforce penalties following the

                        </p>
                        <p>That
has the effect of significantly reducing the teeth of our information
regulator. The commissioner must rely on the good will of organisations
under his remit and the current situation gives organisations time to
prepare for inspections in advance. At present, the ICO has power to
issue an assessment notice and carry out compulsory audits, but they
are limited to the public sector. Furthermore, there are serious
limitations, including a lack of monetary penalties, when such audits
find the organisation’s policy wanting.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000186">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Currently,
organisations know that they cannot face spot checks and that it is
unlikely that their wrongdoing will be uncovered or punished. The lack
of power to inspect contributes to a lax regime and leads to an
environment in which there are few incentives to
obey  
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 734<a class="bkMark" name="Column734">&#160;</a>
                           </div>data protection rules. The Information Commissioner himself has called
for greater powers in that area, suggesting that the power to inspect
would add bite to enforcement proceedings. It is the Committee’s
duty to take the commissioner’s concerns seriously
and try to address them; the new clause would allow the Committee a
chance to do that today.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000187">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The ICO is
right to call for greater powers. Other jurisdictions in Europe already
give their data protection regulators powers of entry and their regimes
are considered far more stringent than those of the UK. As a result,
they suffer fewer data losses. In Spain, the Agencia Española de
Protección de Datos has the power to inspect and audit without
the consent of the data controller. When there is an infringement of
data protection law by public sector organisations, fines are not
imposed, but public warnings are issued that may lead to disciplinary
proceedings against civil servants. In Ireland, the data protection
authority has the power to enter any premises at any time without
advance notice to look at personal data processed or information
related to processing. The court can also order the deletion of a
database, and current draft legislation proposes increasing the fine to
€5,000 and a maximum of 10% of a company’s turnover.
Those are stringent powers.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000188">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The data
protection laws and policies in countries such as Spain and Ireland are
less lax than those of the UK. In addition, the numbers of inspections
and prosecutions are higher than in the UK and, as a result, those
countries have fewer data losses. Examples of how different countries
have dealt with breaches of data are best highlighted by the matter
relating to Google Street View, which, as hon. Members will know, is a
huge data collection exercise by Google to build useful maps. When
doing that, however, Google also collected data about people’s
wi-fi connections. Many ICOs initiated investigations across Europe
about Google’s wi-fi data, but that did not take place in the
UK. The ICO received information from Google, but had to request it. In
fact, some organisations, such as Privacy International, had to
intervene to stop the destruction of evidence on the advice of the ICO
in the UK and elsewhere. Germany had powers to mount a more intrusive
investigation to get to the bottom of the problem.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000189">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Citizens and
consumers will remember examples of huge credit card losses over the
past few years. TK Maxx lost more than 40 million credit card details
in 2007, many of which belonged to UK residents. The ICO was unable to
conduct an unannounced inspection, but had to request that TK Maxx give
it access. When we see data losses on that scale, we really need the
Information Commissioner to clean up some of the worst excesses. The
new clause would do that.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000190">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">New clause 4
would ensure that victims of data loss, or the inappropriate use of
personal information, could recover damages if they have suffered
distress or moral damage as a result. As the law stands, under the Data
Protection Act that is possible only when distress is coupled with
other tangible damage, such as financial loss. A further complaint from
the EU regarding the UK’s transposition of the directive stated
that<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000191">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

revealed to the world as a result of data losses, those people have
suffered distress and embarrassment before even being found guilty of
any copyright infringement. In one classic case, a legal firm called
ACS:Law was hired to send out mass mailings threatening people who were
believed to have breached copyright with legal action. Many of those
people were innocent, but their private internet usage was displayed
for the world to see. They had no ability to gain compensation, and
many lost their job or saw their marriage break down. Illegal data loss
had a big impact on their lives.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000192">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Others have
been put at risk. A current example in the press relates to the
PlayStation network. Millions of young people and teenagers who take
part in online gaming have bought into online environments using their
parents’ credit cards, and Sony has lost the information. That
creates distress for the parents, many of whom have to cancel their
credit cards and get their arrangements in order. It also causes
difficulty for the children because there could be information about
them. The new clause is therefore about people being able to put
matters right if they have suffered distress as the result of data
loss.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000193">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">New clause 6
is an attempt to make UK law consistent with the wording of the data
protection directive and to knock out some previous legal cases, one of
which—the Durant case—will be known to the Minister. The
directive defines personal data as<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000194">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“information

                        <p>Identification
is explained in the recitals as covering:<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000195">&#160;</a>

                        </p>
                        <p>The
UK takes a narrower view, which is less clear. That has been reinforced
by widely criticised court decisions and, most importantly, by the
Durant <em>v.</em> Financial Services Authorities case, which interpreted
personal data on the basis of “relevance or proximity” to
the data subject. The practical result is that many forms of what
should be classed as personal data are not classed in that way in the
UK.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000196">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">A
classic example, to give colleagues a practical understanding of what
the new clause does, is the use of IP addresses. If someone does
something on the net, their IP address is essentially their calling
card; it can be used to identify them, but that is not currently
covered by the judges’ interpretation of the directive, and the
new clause is an attempt to ensure that it is covered.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000197">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Let me give a
little background to the other two new clauses. How do we deal with
privacy intrusion? The new clauses come on the back of the Information
Commissioner’s 2006 report entitled “What price
privacy?”. The report detailed the unlawful trade in personal
information. Those buying such information included insurance firms,
lenders, creditors, criminals intent on fraud and national newspapers.
All the press, including all newspapers, were particularly avid buyers
of such information, some of which was gained through blagging, some
through illicit connections and some through phone
hacking.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000198">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It was
subsequently discovered that such intrusions into personal privacy,
particularly by the press, were widespread and continuing, despite the
investigation and report by the Information Commissioner.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000199">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
commissioner believed that the practice would not stop until the
penalties for breaking the law were made more serious: when the most
severe penalty was a fine of only a few thousand pounds, there was
little incentive for the police to pursue cases and little to stop
those who were determined to gather personal information. The
commissioner therefore tried to increase the penalty for an offence
under section 55 of the Data Protection Act to a fine or six
months’ imprisonment for a summary conviction and a fine or up
to two years’ imprisonment for a conviction. His aim
was<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000200">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“not

tempted to engage in this unlawful trade, whether as buyers or
suppliers.”<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000313">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Although
the commissioner’s changes were considered by the then Labour
Government, they were scrapped after strong lobbying by senior press
figures such as Paul Dacre in 2007 and 2008. There is a rather obvious
political point to make, which is easier for me to say as a Back
Bencher: Ministers in both the present and the previous Administration
have let down British citizens who have had their privacy invaded, by
acquiescing to the demands of editors and proprietors. That is
unacceptable. We should listen to the Information Commissioner. The
Freedom Bill is an opportunity to clamp down on the unlawful trade in
data, and new clauses 10 and 11 would deal with that.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000201">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">New clause 10
would ensure that the unlawful trade in personal information is
investigated and reported on regularly. It is not a big demand. No
organisation is tasked with investigating or reporting on the unlawful
trade in personal information—not Ofcom, not the Press
Complaints Commission, not the Information Commissioner’s Office
and not the police. As a result, there is almost no oversight of an
area where there is strong evidence to suggest widespread wrongdoing.
The Information Commissioner’s Office has not only expertise in
that area, but experience of reporting on it, most notably in
“What price privacy?” and “What price privacy
now?”.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000202">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
are examples of related problems. The PCC has so far conducted two
investigations into phone hacking and is engaged on a third. The first
two investigations found no evidence of unlawful privacy intrusion
beyond the actions of one rogue reporter, Clive Goodman, but we now
know that that is not true and the unlawful intrusion went considerably
further. The PCC does not have the resources or the remit to
investigate that unlawful trade within the press, and it certainly does
not have the remit to investigate it beyond the press. That is why we
need to oblige the Information Commissioner to do
so.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000203">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">New
clause 11 would discourage those who might be tempted to engage in the
unlawful trade in personal information, whether as buyers or suppliers.
Section 55 of the Data Protection Act 1998 makes it an offence to
obtain, disclose or “procure the disclosure” of
confidential personal information “knowingly or
recklessly”, without the consent of the organisation holding the
data. Currently, convictions under section 55 attract a penalty of only
a small fine or a conditional discharge.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000204">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
Information Commissioner, Christopher Graham, told the Home Affairs
Committee on 26 April that he was concerned about a company that had
been making

                           </div>a great deal of money selling customer information. All the participants
had been making £70,000 a year from the trade. A separate
example, outlined in “What price privacy now?”, is that
of Anthony Clifford, who ran a private investigation agency, MRS, which
engaged in sophisticated and systematic blagging. He pleaded guilty to
16 section 55 offences, but received a penalty only of 150 hours of
unpaid work. In terms of sentencing guidelines, the court treated the
offences as equivalent to a single incident of dangerous driving where
there was little or no risk of personal injury. In either of those
cases, if the same amount of money had been obtained through false
accounting—assuming an amount of between £20,000 and
£100,000—those convicted would have been looking at two
years in prison. As it is, they can only be fined.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000205">&#160;</a>

these issues so I will not push him hard, but I urge him to use his

Bromwich East mentioned, of people who buy goods in stores, but what we
are talking about is even worse. Most people with cards that allow them
to gain rewards are totally unaware of the information that can be
gained from such a card. Other people can find out how many people live
in the card owner’s house, whether they have any animals, what
kind of food the people eat, whether they are vegetarians or whether
they have special needs. It has always been important not to allow

some money, they always say, “Oh, it’s just for our
records to make sure that everything’s okay.” They never
say that they are taking the details to pass them to somebody else, who
will annoy us and pester us. These people will find out where we live,
and someone even knock on the door if they are in the area. How many
times have we had phone calls from people who say they that are in the

just bought a garage? That happens all the time, but we allow it to

somebody to phone me up to give me a better deal on double-glazing or
to sell me a new garage, and I might have requested somebody to come

company, and at no point in the procedure will anybody actually tell
me, “I will be passing the information you are giving me to

Friend mentioned that we should receive written explanations; my
problem is that we have lots of written explanations. If people take
out a credit card, they get a leaflet giving the rules governing the
credit card, and if they buy other things, it is the same. I would need
new glasses to be able to read the print in some of those
leaflets—I have never seen such small print in all my
life—but if it was put in a normal font size, the information
would almost be book

have to simplify such things, which is where the Government come in.
The duty of the Government is to ensure that people are protected.
People should understand exactly what they sign on to and know, before
anything happens, that there is likely to be a phone call or a
follow-up. They must have that information. The Information
Commissioner may not be happy, as my hon. Friend

say to the Government that not everything in Europe is bad. In many
ways, people in Europe seem to have some of this down better than we
have. I suggest that Ministers should look at why they are attacking
our way of running things. Damages for victims strike me as an
excellent way forward, but although victims can get damages, the
damages never really fit the
crime.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000214">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
read about one newspaper that attacked another, as they invariably do
when they have no stories to run. It complained that the paper had not
looked at the information it had been given on someone, but had just
printed it. It printed that information because the person was then at
the front of the news and the story added 20,000 copies to its
circulation. That increase lasted for a while, before tailing off to
where it had been before the paper told the story. The insinuation,
which I have heard elsewhere, is that when a newspaper receives
information it works out roughly how many extra copies it can sell and
whether, if it receives a £100,000 fine, it will be worth while
to sell those extra copies, given that it will also receive extra
revenue from advertising as its circulation
increases.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000215">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> My hon. Friend makes a very good point, which I
was about to come on to. The fact is that the people who receive
justice are usually those who have money anyway. Ordinary people are
dragged through the newspapers through no fault of their own. They may
be innocent bystanders who just happen to be in the wrong place at the
wrong time—for example, if they live next door to where a crime
happens, it is automatically inferred that they committed
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000217">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Newspapers
run over there and start throwing about the names of people who have
been interviewed by the police. Depending on how it is said,
“Helping the police with their inquiries” means two
entirely different things. Put one way, the ordinary member of the
public reading a newspaper will think, “He did it—I knew
it was him.” Two or more weeks later, however, we find out that
that person is totally innocent, yet that person has no recourse,
because they are poor and do not have the nice lawyers to help them get
the justice that they deserve. Even if they go down that road and get
justice, in fact newspapers will already have made their money by
increasing their circulation. I find that absolutely
intolerable.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000218">&#160;</a>

what has been said on this side of the Committee and take it

have written in my notes that “Penalty is not enough; the
question is, ‘what is the penalty?’” My hon.
Friend the Member for West Bromwich East said that the penalties are
weak, and he is absolutely right. If the penalties were strong enough
and there was a threat that a newspaper could even be closed down for
deliberately putting lies in the public domain and ruining
someone’s life, it might not mean a lot to the 60 million people
in the United Kingdom, but it would mean an awful lot to the one person
whose life had been ruined. That person needs to be protected, and it
is the Government’s place to do that. I assure them that if they
put damages for ordinary people and penalties in the Bill, I would be
the first person to stand up and say that I supported them for doing
that. I hope they have the guts to do

said that the new clauses were probing, but he is doing us all a great
service by tabling them and giving the Committee the opportunity to
discuss them. Such issues certainly come under the remit of a
Protection of Freedoms Bill. Even if we do not bring in new clauses at
a later stage of our proceedings to cover them, I suspect that over the
next few years, a Government—whatever their
persuasion—will introduce something to deal with the protection
of information and the privacy of
individuals.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000225">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We
have only to look at the media or read daily newspapers to see that
there is a major issue. At the moment, we are aware of media
organisations that have intruded on the privacy of individuals. It
seems to be the preserve of the super-rich to take out
super-injunctions to protect their privacy but, as my hon. Friend said,
the protection and handling of information covers a wide range of
information that confronts us on a daily basis. It can range from, as
he highlighted, an innocent request for people’s names and
addresses when they purchase an item. It is considered that they are
giving implied consent for their information to be used for subsequent
purposes, of which they will not be aware. How people are informed
about the use of information that is passed on in the future will need
to be addressed. We have a wide range of legislation on data protection
and freedom of information that particularly covers public bodies, but
information in the private sector is traded and in some respects that
is not welcome. We have seen that written large in some of the big
issues reported recently. Whoever is in government will be drawn into
addressing that issue.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000226">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We had a
debate about judicial creep, where there is no regulation at the
moment. People do not know what they should be doing to control
information. In effect, super-injunctions and decisions in court are
legislating; even the Prime Minister has commented and expressed
concern. I am sure we all share that concern. As legislators and
parliamentarians, we cannot desert the field. The public expect a
framework that they can understand, and they expect public bodies and
private organisations to abide by it. The Government will need to
address the issue in future, if not under this
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000227">&#160;</a>

aware that at the other end of the spectrum, there are individuals

information relating to the circumstances that she highlighted can be
accessed. In his amendments, my hon. Friend the Member for West
Bromwich East highlights the wide range of areas in the management and
handling of information where regulation needs to be tightened. The
structure for managing the handling of that information needs to be
made clearer. At the moment, decisions in courts seem to be determined
by the ability of someone to actually get to court, which cannot be
right, because it means that people who cannot afford to pursue their
cases down that avenue may suffer injustice. It is our duty here to
make sure that everybody is treated equally. It is not right that only
those who can afford expensive barristers have their privacy, or the
information held on them,
protected.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000229">&#160;</a>

hon. Friend highlighted the problem of the power of the press and some
of its excesses. We need to strike a balance. We do not want to clip
the wings of the press and restrict its freedom. A free press is a
central part of a democracy, but at the same time, we have seen some
excesses in the media, whereby that freedom and that right have been
abused. Sadly, self-regulation has at times been left
wanting.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000234">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Trying
to regulate the media formally is a fraught area. Self-regulation is
preferable, but the Press Complaints Commission has been found wanting
in many respects. Unless it improves its performance and shows more
independent-mindedness in the way it determines decisions about the
press, the clamour for some sort of formal, legislative regulation will
only increase. My hon. Friend raised some important points about how
that has become a problem that needs to be
addressed.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000235">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">My
hon. Friend talked about sanctions. It is clear from recent cases that
the sanctions against those who abuse people’s privacy do not in
any way match the gains that people can make from the sums of money
involved in trading information. Moreover, the sanctions do not reflect
the level of distress to individuals whose information has been made
public under the pretence or pretext that it is somehow of public
interest. That takes us back to self-regulation and the PCC, which has
been found wanting in that regard. My hon. Friend is right to ask how
we should regulate this area in the future and to point out that
sanctions should reflect the scale of the intrusion
committed.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000236">&#160;</a>

issue is accountability and how the information is dealt with. At the
moment, it is not clear who people are accountable to, who the public
can go to for redress, or what their rights are when dealing with a
situation in which they feel that information about them has been used
in an improper way. That takes us back to an earlier point; people need
to be far better informed about these things in the future. Through his
new clauses, my hon. Friend has raised an important point by
highlighting the fact that people are often ignorant of their rights
and of what they may be opening themselves up to when they tick certain
boxes on websites, fill in forms when they buy goods, or enter into
certain
agreements.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000237">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I thank the hon. Member for West Bromwich
East for the way he supported his new clauses. I know that he has
followed the issue closely for several years and that the clauses are
not meant to make any partisan or party political point. The new
clauses are technical in nature. I note that he has received the
Clerks’ support in tabling them, but the issue is essentially
technical. I will try to respond to many of the points that he
highlighted in the context of the new clauses. He rightly identified
two themes emerging from this group. I recognise the points that the
hon. Gentleman highlighted; they are informative in feeding into the
broader debate on the Data Protection Act and other points.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000239">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">It was
interesting to hear the comments of the hon. Member for Eltham, who
strayed slightly outside the group of amendments and highlighted
broader issues that involve the Data Protection Act, super-injunctions
and privacy. The Government recognise the importance of finding the
correct balance between the individual right to privacy and the right
to freedom of expression and the transparency of official information.
Before I turn to the new clauses’ provisions on the Data
Protection Act, it is worth mentioning to the hon. Gentleman that the
Master of the Rolls’s committee, which has been examining the
use of super-injunctions and other issues relating to injunctions
binding the press, is due to report shortly, and the Government will be
considering its report closely and
carefully.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000240">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">As the hon.
Member for West Bromwich East said, the group of new clauses relates to
the rights of data subjects and relevant definitions as set out in the
Data Protection Act 1998, as well as the enforcement of the Act by the
Information Commissioner and penalties for unlawfully obtaining
personal information. Members may not be aware that the Government,
through the Ministry of Justice, recently issued a call for evidence to
gather views about how well the current framework of data protection
law in the UK works and how it might be improved, in preparation for
forthcoming EU negotiations on a new European data protection
instrument that are scheduled to begin later this year. Some of the
hon. Gentleman’s comments have been helpful in starting that
debate and adding to some of the points highlighted to colleagues in
the Ministry of
Justice.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000242">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
part of that process, the Government are considering all aspects of the
Data Protection Act, including its definitions, the conditions for
processing personal data, the Information Commissioner’s
enforcement powers and the rights of redress for data subjects. The new
clauses seek to address those issues. The Government are determined
that any changes to the existing data protection framework will be
based on robust analysis of the evidence, and they will ensure that any
costs of increased data protection safeguards are proportionate to the
benefits. That will strike the right balance—a subject at the
core of a number of our debates on the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000243">&#160;</a>

hope that the hon. Gentleman understands that although I will not be
able to accept the new clauses in Committee—I have noted the
probing nature of some of them—there is a continuing exercise
with regard to the new instrument from the Commission. I am sure that
will trigger further consideration of the data protection provisions,
and the information and evidence that has been provided through the
call for evidence has already informed the
process.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000244">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I genuinely cannot address that point
straight on because there will be negotiations, which we expect to
commence later this year, in the context of whatever new instrument
comes from the Commission shortly. I might be able to project and
envisage certain things, but I would be looking at a crystal ball if I
tried to second-guess what the instrument might look like. That
response is probably not helpful in this context, but I hope that what
I have said will at least assure the hon. Gentleman that the issues are
being considered broadly, in the context of that instrument, which
itself will prompt negotiation and further detailed debate, discussion
and examination. Nevertheless, it might help if when responding to the
various new clauses, I highlight where certain of the hon.
Gentleman’s concerns might not be rejected fully, or where they
might have already been addressed in other
ways.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000246">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">New
clause 2 seeks to impose the higher standard of consent, currently
reserved under the EU data protection directive for sensitive personal
data, on data controllers processing non-sensitive personal data. In
practical terms, it would impose a more burdensome requirement on 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 744<a class="bkMark" name="Column744">&#160;</a>
                           </div>UK data controllers than we believe the EU has, to date, found
appropriate. The processing of personal data, from everyday
transactions to social networking, is vital to deliver the services
that consumers want and often take for granted, but the provision might
have the effect of obliging businesses to obtain explicit and specific
consent from every data subject when consent is required, each time a
new or subsequent form of processing takes place. That would result in
citizens being inundated with formal consent requests for even the most
mundane activities, such as using a store loyalty card or sending an
e-mail to a colleague. The Government believe that the higher consent
requirement should be reserved for situations that require it and that
it should not be made a standardised and disproportionately burdensome
obligation. Those issues will clearly remain live in the context of the
evidence that the Government have received and the possible further
proposals from the
Commission.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000247">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">New
clause 3 seeks to introduce a new wide-reaching power of entry and
inspection to enable the Information Commissioner to audit a data
controller’s compliance with the requirements of the Data
Protection Act. The hon. Gentleman might be aware that, under schedule
9 of that Act, the Information Commissioner may apply for a warrant to
enter and inspect premises when there are reasonable grounds for
suspecting that a data controller has contravened any of the data
protection principles, and that may be done without notice to the
occupier, if a judge is satisfied that the case is urgent or if giving
notice would defeat the object of the entry. Conversely, the power
proposed in the new clause would not require a warrant and would amount
to greater powers of entry than those potentially available to the
police when investigating criminal offences. It is also worth noting
that in most cases, data controllers co-operate fully with the
Information Commissioner and provide him with the information that he
requests in order to resolve the case. When they do not, the
commissioner already has a number of coercive investigative
powers.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000248">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">New
section 41A of the Data Protection Act was inserted by the Coroners and
Justice Act 2009. It came into force in April 2010 and gives
the Information commissioner new powers of investigation. The
commissioner may serve an assessment notice on data controllers in
Departments, or on those who fall within any other category designated
in secondary legislation. Among other things, such a notice may require
the data controller to allow the commissioner to enter its premises to
inspect documents and to assist the commissioner with his
investigation. There has been some more recent strengthening of the
powers of the Information Commissioner in that regard, but as I have
said, the matter remains under the broad review to which I have already
drawn
attention.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000249">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendment to the Data Protection Act that new clause 4 proposes seeks
to introduce greater scope for individuals to claim compensation when
distress without damage has been suffered as a result of a breach of
the Act. As it stands, the Data Protection Act provides for individuals
to seek compensation for distress only when it accompanies other
damages or when it arises from processing one of the “special
purposes”, which are art, journalism and literature. The
Government recognise the importance of redress mechanisms in cases
where data protection principles are breached. However, we believe that
the current approach is proportionate and 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 745<a class="bkMark" name="Column745">&#160;</a>
                           </div>fair to both individuals and data controllers. As I have said, specific
provisions apply under section 13 of the Data Protection Act, and
compensation for distress without damage can be claimed when the
contravention relates to the processing of personal data for the
“special purposes”, so provisions govern that area. The
benefit for individuals of the change in the new clause does not
justify the potential implications, particularly those that apply to
very minor breaches that cause no other actual damage and affect large
numbers of
people.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000250">&#160;</a>

                        </p>
                        <p>The
definition of personal data is an important element of the Data
Protection Act, because it determines the scope of the Act. Hon.
Members may be aware that the proposed definition in the new
clause is taken from the court case of Durant <em>v</em>
                           <em>.</em>
Financial Services Authority in 2003. Perhaps some of the concerns
arose, in part, following the Durant case. In the House of Lords case,
the Common Services Agency <em>v. </em>Scottish Information Commissioner
in 2008, Lord Hope stated that it was in the context of the particular
facts in Durant that the notions of biographical significance and focus
might be of assistance, and not more broadly. In other words, the
subsequent case of the CSA <em>v. </em>Scottish Information Commissioner
sought to narrow the potential application of the Durant judgment to
its specific facts and circumstances.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000252">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We are
confident that the definition in the Data Protection Act already
effectively implements the definition in the directive. Because of that
and because of the lack of any practical benefit that we can identify,
the Government do not consider the amendment either necessary or
desirable.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000253">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On
new clauses 10 and 11, we are certainly cognisant of the harmful
consequences of the illegal disclosure and procurement of personal data
and the need to ensure that criminals are effectively deterred from
unlawfully misusing personal data. Section 55 of the Data Protection
Act, which the hon. Member for West Bromwich East has rightly referred
to, makes it a criminal offence to obtain or disclose unlawfully
personal data without the consent of the data controller. It is equally
an offence when there is a commercial aspect to the procurement or
disclosure of personal data, where there has been some sort of
“trade” in that data and in those situations where no
money changes
hands.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000254">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">It
might help the Committee if I were to give an example. The existing
offence covers situations where an employee of a company is paid by a
criminal gang to secure the personal data of the company’s
customers. The gang might then use that information to commit identity
theft. It goes without saying that the Government are serious about
tackling that sort of crime. However, we are not convinced of the need
to oblige the Information Commissioner to report to Parliament each
year on this issue. The Information Commissioner is already obliged to
lay his annual report before Parliament each year and that report
already contains details of the commissioner’s enforcement
activities, including section 55 prosecutions.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000255">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In addition,
the commissioner can already lay a special report before Parliament on
any specific topic or issue that he considers it necessary to report
on. It was under that provision that the previous Information
Commissioner presented two reports on the illegal trade in personal
data in 2006, which the hon. Gentleman has referred to. That is not to
say that on issues such as fraud, which a number of these matters
relate to, that further work is not required. I believe that further
work is required and the Home Office has recently taken lead Department
responsibility for fraud. Therefore we are examining the issues of
fraud in co-operation with the National Fraud Authority and we are
looking at ways in which work on fraud—whether that is identity
fraud or more general fraud—can be enhanced. I am well aware of
the way that stolen data can be used to perpetrate frauds, quite often
online. Reference has been made to stolen data in a number of cases. We
will examine how we can better respond to fraud in a very practical
way, to ensure that fraud is given the important status that it
deserves because of the huge implications it can have for so many
people.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000256">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I turn now to
sentencing. As I have said, the Government are considering all aspects
of the Data Protection Act, including enforcement. It is worth noting
that more serious data protection offences can already be committed to
the Crown court, which is able to impose an unlimited fine under
existing legislation, depending on the severity of the offence. I fully
acknowledge that the illegal trade in personal data can cause
individuals serious harm.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000257">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We believe
that there are effective measures to deter would-be criminals from
committing these offences, but we will keep this issue under
examination as part of the broader review that I have mentioned. For
example, there are other ways in which it might be addressed. It is
possible that gains made through the unlawful obtaining of personal
data could be confiscated under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002. The
court is also able, where appropriate, to impose a compensation order,
requiring a defendant to pay compensation for any loss or damage
resulting from the offences committed by him or her. Apart from fines,
there are other means by which some form of redress can be brought
about. The way that unlawful assets and the proceeds of crime are
properly tracked is a significant issue in its own right, which
deserves further work.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000258">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Gentleman has highlighted a number of important points. As I hope he
recognises, the Government are looking at this issue carefully. We are
examining the evidence that exists to see what will make a difference
and what is proportionate. There will be further consideration in the
context of the new measures that the European Commission will be
publishing. I am sure that my colleagues in the Ministry of Justice
will be engaged in detailed negotiations on that issue.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000259">&#160;</a>

with emerging notions of privacy in the age of the internet. It is a
probing clause to explore the possibility of creating a single privacy
commission to regulate all data protection and privacy issues in the
UK. Here is my pitch to both Front Benches. Notions of privacy are
changing. We live in the age of information abundance. Newspaper
editors can no longer enforce scarcity of information by spiking
stories that they do not like, thank the Lord.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000267">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Our children
are leaving a digital footprint that will exist for eternity. In the
decades to come, that will profoundly change how we think about the
personal and the public. Thank the Lord, again, that Facebook did not
exist when I was a teenager. If it had, I suspect that the editor of
<em>News of the World </em>would have ensured that I would not be moving
this clause. The truth is that we do not know the social impact of that
collective public display of teenage angst. Personally, I have a hunch
that it will make us a more tolerant and relaxed society out of
necessity, but it might not.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000268">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In public
policy terms, that means that Members elected last year in particular
will have to deal with the tensions created by new and changing notions
of privacy, probably for the rest of their parliamentary careers. That
is emerging in current debates, in this Committee and outside it,
examining the idea of super-injunctions and the internet. Phone
hacking—dare I say it again?—essentially involved an
industry that thought that new laws cast to enshrine privacy did not
apply to it.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000269">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I do not have
all the answers, but I am deeply concerned that Parliament is not even
asking the right questions in this area of policy. New clause 5 is an
attempt to address some of the issues that we must deal with. It is
formed from a view that sits with the dilemma that the Prime Minister
has discussed in recent weeks. We do not want judges deciding what is
and is not private, but neither do we want politicians
deciding.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000270">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">By wrapping
up all the different commissioners with an interest in privacy matters,
we would create a single go-to organisation that could deal with the
inevitable tensions in public policy that will arise for many decades
to come. A regulator with a clearly defined public role can do what
judges and politicians find it hard to do: apply a reasonableness test
to privacy disputes and back them up with evidence and
research.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000271">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I am aware
that more detailed work is necessary to set out the powers of such a
commission. However, in my view, the Bill provides the right framework
for establishing it. The clause is supported by Action on Rights for
Children, Privacy International, GeneWatch UK and the Open Rights
Group. For declaratory purposes I should say that I am an occasional
member of the advisory board of the ORG, not without
remuneration.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000272">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The Bill
proposes the establishment of two new commissioners for biometrics and
CCTV. That will expand the number of commissioners responsible for
privacy and surveillance from three to five, but it will not
necessarily lead to greater protection for the public. It may even
fracture the protections that already exist. The only way of providing
meaningful oversight of freedom and privacy is to bring all those
commissioners into a single privacy commission. That would have many
benefits: the current gaps in coverage would be closed, members of the
public would understand to whom they should address their questions and
complaints, it would potentially save a considerable amount of public
money and it would provide a more future-proof structure, within which
future legislation could be naturally located. When there is a
multiplication of commissioners, it confuses the essential relationship
of all those disparate issues, which all of us, if we remain in
Parliament, will be dealing
with.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000273">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
things stand, the Information Commissioner is responsible for promoting
and enforcing compliance with the Data Protection Act. His functions
relate to 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 749<a class="bkMark" name="Column749">&#160;</a>
                           </div>the processing of personal data, which includes CCTV and biometric
information, and data obtained via surveillance, interception or covert
means. Although that is potentially a broad remit, in practice the
Information Commissioner has made it clear that he does not feel able
to act in situations that may be covered by another statutory body
outside the Data Protection Act. For example, in his response to the
2009 Home Office consultation, ‘Protecting the public in a
changing communications environment’, he
said:<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000274">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“The
first data protection principle states that processing of personal
information must be fair and lawful. Any processing of personal
information which has been obtained in contravention of the provisions
of section 1(1) of RIPA would also be in breach of the first principle.
Understandably organisations approach the ICO for advice. However, it
is inappropriate and arguably beyond his powers for the Information
Commissioner to advise on the lawfulness of interceptions of
communications under RIPA. He does not have particular expertise in
this area. An organisation could follow the advice of the Information
Commissioner but still be liable for prosecution if the prosecuting
authority for RIPA takes a different
view.”<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000315">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>The
Minister probably knows where I am going with some of this.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000275">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
interception of communications commissioner was created by section 57
of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000. His role is limited
to the oversight of those who issue warrants and the procedures of
those acting under warrants. He has no power to investigate complaints
or to advise the public, and no duty to provide advice to organisations
that may fall outside the remit of RIPA. That creates a gap in
regulatory control of the interception of communications, mainly in the
private sector.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000276">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The chief
surveillance commissioner has similarly limited powers. His function is
to keep under review the operation of the powers and duties of directed
and covert surveillance under RIPA. Although he may quash the
authorisation of covert surveillance, in practice that rarely happens.
There is considerable lack of transparency regarding the functions of
the surveillance
commissioners.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000277">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Currently
it is proposed that the surveillance camera commissioner will be
responsible for advising on a code of practice to be drawn up by the
Home Secretary—I will not rehearse the
argument—encouraging compliance with the code and reviewing its
operation. The role does not carry any regulatory or enforcement
function and the application of the code is in any case limited in
scope. In practice, it will apply to local authorities and policing
bodies in England and Wales.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000278">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Information Commissioner already has a code of practice covering the
whole UK, including the public and private sectors. However, he has
never used his enforcement powers. Given his evidence to the Home
Office consultation I mentioned earlier, and some of our discussions,
it is likely that regulation will be surrendered to the new SCC
commissioner, although the Minister will tell me if I am
wrong.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000279">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
biometrics commissioner’s role is limited to reviewing national
security determinations. He will review any determination made under
existing terrorism legislation or under clause 9 of the Bill. He may
order the destruction of biometric material if it cannot lawfully be
retained. 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 750<a class="bkMark" name="Column750">&#160;</a>
                           </div>His title is significantly broader than his actual remit, as he has no
function in relation to any other retention of biometric
material.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000280">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
can be seen from the list I have just read out that there is already a
confusion of powers, which may get worse if the Minister is not
convinced by the power of my argument. Although those areas of
responsibility not specifically assigned to a particular commissioner
default to the ambit of the Information Commissioner, it is leading in
practice to significant gaps in coverage, which the creation of yet
more commissioners can only aggravate. Even for those with in-depth
knowledge of each commissioner’s remit, the situation is
confusing. For members of the public without any such knowledge, it is
almost impossible to know where to direct complaints or seek
advice.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000281">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
creation of a single commission taking in all the functions I have
mentioned would ensure that lacunae are identified and that the public
are provided with the comprehensive protection they are entitled to
expect. Greater clarity of role and function would make it easy for
people to find advice and to make complaints. Such an opportunity to
seek redress is increasingly important as access to legal aid, and
hence the courts, becomes more
restricted.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000282">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Precedents
already exist for creating a single commission. The Equality Act 2006
created the Equality and Human Rights Commission, which brought
together the Commission for Racial Equality, the Equal Opportunities
Commission and the Disability Rights Commission. In April 2006, the
Tribunals Service was created by merging some 70 different tribunals
into a single service. At the beginning of April this year, it was
further merged with the Courts Service to create a single integrated
agency—Her Majesty’s Courts and Tribunals
Service.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000283">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The rationale
for those changes was to simplify procedures, make it easier for
members of the public to find help and redress, avoid gaps in coverage
and create bodies that actively promote public understanding of
people’s rights. The logic of that approach also applies in this
case. The reasons for creating the Equality and Human Rights Commission
and the Tribunals Service are exactly the same as those that I am
outlining for the creation of a privacy commission. I am convinced that
the time has come for the same approach to be taken to information
privacy and data protection rights.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000284">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On the point
about the public purse, I am afraid that I am not a Treasury Minister,
but at a time of huge cuts in public spending, it is hard to justify
the fixed costs of running five separate offices, as well as all the
other associated costs. The budget for the interception of
communications commissioner is £1.7 million. Although I have not
yet been able to find figures for the office of the chief surveillance
commissioner, it is reasonable to assume that the budget is the same or
larger, and there is no reason to suppose that the cost of the new
commissioners will not be
similar.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000285">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">By
contrast, the data protection functions of the Information Commissioner
are met entirely from fees, which generated £13 million per
annum the last time I checked. Taking all the commissioners into a
single privacy commission would combine the office and administrative
budgets, and the current income of the Information Commissioner would
be made available. 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 751<a class="bkMark" name="Column751">&#160;</a>
                           </div>That would undoubtedly reduce the costs to the public and maintain value
as we expand the current regulatory
system.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000286">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On
my point about future-proofing, the Bill has become necessary because
existing powers are inadequate to deal with developments in new
technologies. It is attempting to deal with a situation in which civil
liberties have already been compromised and problems have become
entrenched. I must say to the Minister that other new technologies
coming down the line will offer similar challenges to policy makers in
the future: the development of radio frequency identify devices, mobile
location technology and other potentially invasive technologies that
can be bought on the internet on a shoe string. If the response to each
new threat to privacy is to create yet more commissioners with partial
powers, we will end up with a vast array of commissioners, none of whom
will have sufficient oversight to provide meaningful regulation, with
each dissipating public protection still further.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000287">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The Committee
has to think in terms of a structure that is sufficiently flexible to
encompass all future threats to privacy, as well as those already
identified in the Bill. A privacy commissioner would be able to respond
to privacy challenges as soon as they became apparent, and deal with
them before they caused serious infringements of civil liberties and
data protection laws. If we had had a privacy commissioner in the late
1990s, the heir to the throne would not have had his phone hacked in
2005.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000288">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The creation
of a privacy commission would also ensure that we comply with future EU
data protection directives, which were outlined by the Minister. Most
EU countries already have a single commission to deal with data
protection and information privacy, and the emphasis in the EU is
increasingly on greater coherence in data protection requirements, as
the outlined by the Minister in his brilliant rejection of my previous
technical clauses.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000289">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I am aware
that I have not touched on the use of the Freedom of Information Act
2000, but in essence I am saying to the Minister that my proposal is a
common sense simplification of the current system. I am pretty certain
that he will not be able to tell me that it is a brilliant idea and
that he will rewrite the Bill, notwithstanding the geniuses who work
for him on the Bill team, but I hope that he will at least take the
idea away, and that my Front Bench colleagues will too. Perhaps, if the
Minister has an opportunity in the future, he will realise that we have
to rationalise the regulation of privacy matters in the UK, and that
this is, perhaps, one way that we can
start.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000290">&#160;</a>

his important contribution. Many years ago, I was on the Bill Committee
of what became the Communications Act 2003. I will not say an awful lot
in my contribution, but I remember that I said then part of what I am
about to say now about where we were going and how we should look at
the future. When I left school, I became an apprentice telephone
engineer and was then involved in the communications industry for 21
years. In my 10 years as an MP, I have been the chair of the all-party
parliamentary communications group and have always felt strongly about
the issue. If there is one thing I know, it is that communications have
changed over the years. Even in my 10 years as an MP, things are
completely different today from what they were 20 years ago.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000291">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Bills
have always been scrutinised in relation to what happened in the past.
We change the law to try and change something that was wrong, but
sometimes we need to look at the future and try to anticipate change.
We cannot bring in a Bill that says, “This will happen in five
years’ time;” we cannot even bring in a Bill that says,
“This will happen in five minutes’ time”, but we
have to consider ways to change and to adapt to what is happening
today.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000292">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">My
question to the Minister is: what is privacy? What was privacy 10 years
ago, and what will privacy be in 10 years’ time? He
might be able to answer two of those questions, but he will not be able
to answer the third. Why are we asking five people to look at those
sorts of things? If we put five people in charge of ministries where
each crosses over to the other, there is a problem. We see that in the
day to day running of Parliament, where Ministers will not talk to each
other; one puts forward a solution for something and another suggests a
similar solution for something else. At the end of the day, there has
to be somebody to tie things up. The Minister might say that the Prime
Minister is that person. Well, if he is, I hope he does a better job
than he has been
doing.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000293">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
communications industry is changing and that has an effect on
people’s privacy. We do not have a privacy law, although there
probably should be one. We now have social networking, which is, to all
intents and purposes, the way forward and which will be developed as
the years go
by.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000294">&#160;</a>

believe that that will be the way forward in the future, whether the
Government agree to what he says or not. They have to ask what will
happen over the next five years and whether the Bill can cover it. I do
not think it can. It needs to be amended so that we have to revisit
certain aspects of privacy and communications in order to adapt and

highlighted some of the areas that will need to be addressed in the
future. Issues have been raised about the co-ordination of the five
commissioners and all the different pieces of regulation. He
highlighted eloquently some of the dangers that lie ahead.
Again—I made this point in my previous contribution—the
issue transcends politics and whoever is in power will have to address
it. New technology on the horizon, and which may already be in use,
will present even more challenges for regulators who protect the
public. That makes it imperative that we have these debates, and my
hon. Friend has set out that
case.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000296">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
are not yet convinced that there is a case for a single commissioner to
encompass all the powers of the three existing commissioners and the
two created by the Bill to cover the Data Protection Act and the
Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000. My hon. Friend has,
however, highlighted some areas to which future consideration must be
given in order to ensure that we do not see some of the problems that
he outlined.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000297">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I have some
questions before I sit down, or am forced to sit down. Do the
Government accept that there are gaps in regulation and oversight, as
my hon. Friend has set out, in relation to the commissioners and the
current regulatory regime? Does the Minister accept that having so many
different areas of responsibility in the governing and collecting of
information and surveillance may cause confusion? The potential
confusion of the public may cause problems for people seeking redress
in the future or understanding what their rights are. Is it likely that
the Government will be forced to regulate in the future, and have they
given that any consideration?<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000298">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">My hon. Friend
also raised the issue of complaints. How will people know where to go?
Who do they go to in order to seek redress and make complaints? Will
that be made clear to them? The time is fast approaching for you to
force me to sit down, Mr Streeter, so I conclude my
comments.<a class="bkMark" name="11051735000299">&#160;</a>
