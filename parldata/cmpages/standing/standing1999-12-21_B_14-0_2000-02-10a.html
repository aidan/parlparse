<B>Mr. David Heath </B>(Somerton and Frome): I beg to move amendment No. 77, in page 36, line 10, leave out `may' and insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`shall'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 172, in clause 81, page 38, line 29, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(2A) No regulations shall be made under section 73 unless a draft of the regulations has been laid before, and approved by a resolution of, each House of Parliament.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 173, in clause 81, page 38, line 32, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`other than section 73'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> This is a familiar formulation for an amendment, but it applies specifically to whether the Government intend, as I presume they do, to comply with their obligations under the Aarhus convention. Obligations are in place not to make regulations regarding environmental information any less comprehensive than they are now. That was one of the commitments entered into by the Government under the convention, and it is reinforced by accompanying EU directives.
<P>
The purpose of the amendment is to define the Government's intentions; it is clear that, by bringing the Aarhus requirements under the Bill—with which I do not argue for one moment—the Government will have obligations to replace regulations with at least as good access to environmental information as is presently the case. That is almost certainly the Government's intention, but the problem is that the Bill, as drafted, gives a glimmer of possibility that they may wish to do otherwise. If that were the case, we would oppose such action, something with which I am sure many members of the Committee would agree. I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary can clarify the Government's intentions.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 172 and 173 would ensure that new regulations on environmental information are subject to the positive resolution procedure of each House of Parliament. There is considerable interest in the country in how to deal with environmental matters. It is important that they are subject to parliamentary scrutiny and our amendments would ensure that such a process was carried out.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department (Mr. David Lock):</B> This is my first opportunity to welcome the hon. Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh) to the Opposition Front Bench. I also welcome this opportunity to clarify the matter and I am grateful to the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath) for bringing the subject of the amendment to my attention.
<P>
Clause 85(1)(f) provides that clause 73 will come into force when the Bill is enacted. The hon. Gentleman was right to describe the nature of the amendment and I assure him and members of the Committee that, having signed the Aarhus convention, the Government fully intend to ratify it as soon as possible. There is no question whatever of the United Kingdom failing to give effect to it by not introducing regulations under the clause. Indeed, failure to implement the treaty would result in the United Kingdom being in breach of its international obligations. Now that I have made that clear and put it on the record, I hope that is sufficient for the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
In any event, the European Union is working on a new directive to incorporate the UN obligations within a directive and, if and when that were to happen, it would become part of the obligation of the United Kingdom Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> What is the time scale for ratification and introduction of the new regulations?
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> The work has already begun on preparing the regulations and that is expected to take a matter of months. The Government are in a position to ratify and intend to do so as soon as reasonably possible, although I cannot give the hon. Gentleman a precise date. We do not intend to be slack; we shall move forward quickly and with those assurances I invite the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> I am grateful to the Parliamentary Secretary. That will be widely received with approbation. It will be interesting to see how fast ratification can take place. Most of us will want to see it at the earliest date and perhaps the hon. Gentleman will take that message to his colleagues in another Department.
<P>
I am still not entirely sure why ``may'' was used, given the Government's intentions, which I have no reason to doubt. Having said that, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 73 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 74</center></H4>
<H4><center>Power to amend or repeal enactments</center></H4>
prohibiting disclosure of information
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath:</B> Clause 74 deals with the power to amend or repeal enactments prohibiting disclosure of information. It would be interesting to know how the Parliamentary Secretary feels that the provision will be used by the Government in future enactments and under what circumstances it would be appropriate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> About 400 provisions in the statute prevent the disclosure of information. They vary in detail according to the subject matter, legislative context and, to some extent, the date at which they were passed. Many are necessary to implement EC obligations, others to provide necessary protection to those who supply information to Government for limited purposes. However, although the Government are committed to reviewing whether those bars should remain, that must be done on a case-by-case basis.
<P>
For example, under the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990, members and employees of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority are prohibited from disclosing confidential information including that which would identify those who had received fertility treatment or who had been born as the result of such treatment. That is an appropriate restriction, but along with the other 400 such bars it will be reviewed by the Government and clause 74 is designed to provide an opportunity to bring forward such a review by regulation, rather than having to wait for primary legislation. It is a symbol of the Government's commitment to openness and I hope that the review will proceed as fast as is reasonably practicable.
<P>
Clause 74 cannot be used for future enactments. The appropriate time to ensure that there are no unnecessary bars to disclosure of information in future legislation will be when it is being considered. It is a constitutional principle that one Act cannot bind future Acts of Parliament. For all past bars, this is the mechanism that will be used to review, and if necessary, repeal individual restrictions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> I am grateful to the Parliamentary Secretary for having clarified the intention behind the clause. Hon. Members wanted to ask many questions about the clause. The hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mr. Fisher), who is not in his place, is especially interested in the clause and in clause 75, to which he has tabled amendments. Unfortunately, he is not here to ask those questions himself.
<P>
The Parliamentary Secretary has given a full description of the effect of the clause and how it relates to the rest of the Bill. It seems sensible to include such a provision. Without it, further orders or, indeed, primary legislation might be necessary. Given that the hon. Gentleman has made the case for the clause so successfully, I need not detain the Committee longer in considering its application.
<P>
We must proceed.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 74 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Clauses 75 to 80 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 81</center></H4>
<H4><center>Orders and regulations</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 186, in page 38, line 31, after `3(1)', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`or 3(5)'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 187, in page 38, line 35, leave out subsection (4).
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> Clause 81 deals with the procedures for making orders and regulations. It provides that some orders and regulations will be dealt with by affirmative resolution, and others by negative resolution. However, some measures will apparently not be laid before Parliament until after they have been made. The explanatory notes state:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``An order under clause 3(5) and regulations under clauses 8 (fees), 9 (time for complying with request for information) and 14(1) (fees for discretionary disclosures) have to be laid before Parliament after being made.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
However, clause 81(4) seems to provide that the only orders that will be dealt with under the provision are those made under clause 3(5). Will the Parliamentary Secretary confirm whether that is so?
<P>
Clause 3(5) provides that the Secretary of State may by order amend schedule 1 to remove an authority that has ceased to exist or is no longer covered by either of the two conditions in subsections (2) and (3) of clause 3. Those provisions allow bodies to be added to the schedule if they are established by statute, royal prerogative or Ministers, or are bodies to which Ministers make one or more appointments.
<P>
The provision raises two questions. First, although a body may cease to exist, applications for its records might still be made. Assuming that the Bill covers the Scott inquiry, for example, people might still be interested in applying for its records even though the inquiry itself has ceased to exist. If the inquiry is subsequently removed from the schedule, would its records still be accessible under the Bill? If so, to whom would such applications be made?
<P>
Secondly, under what circumstances might a body to whom Ministers make appointments cease to be such a body? Is there such a clearly defined, unequivocal phenomenon whereby bodies can be removed from the schedule without Parliament being consulted, merely being informed after the event?
<P>
The amendments would require orders under clause 3(5) to be subject to the negative resolution procedure, so that Parliament was consulted before they took effect. That seems to be a sensible way of dealing with what appears to be a flaw in the Bill. I shall be very interested in the Parliamentary Secretary's response.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Lock:</B> I am grateful for the opportunity to clarify this point. Amendments Nos. 186 and 187 would require the Secretary of State to make an order under the negative resolution procedure before removing a body from the list of public authorities in parts VI and VII of schedule 1. I am unclear why the amendments are considered necessary. The relevant part of the Bill is clause 3, which sets out several provisions concerning the list of public authorities in parts VI and VII of schedule 1. The order-making power in subsection (5) is already tightly limited; as the hon. Gentleman said, an order under this subsection can remove a listed authority only where that body has ceased to exist or no longer meets the criteria for being listed, which are set out in subsections (2) and (3).
<P>
It is entirely sensible to make provision for tidying up the list when necessary in those circumstances. I can think of no situation where that procedure ought to be controversial. An order making such a deletion is no more than a good housekeeping exercise. It has no effect on the Bill's application to the authority to which it relates.
<P>
As I said, there are only two instances when an order can be made. In the first case, the body has ceased to exist as a public authority. The structure of the Bill is such that the duties that previously applied to that body no longer apply, because it no longer exists. The second criterion is when a body on the list no longer meets the criteria for listing as set out in subsections (2) and (3). Any such body or office automatically ceases to be a public authority for the purposes of this Bill from the moment that it ceases to meet those criteria. That is the effect of subsection (4). It is therefore entirely unnecessary for the order-making power to attract the negative resolution procedure. It would merely be putting into effect something that had already occurred.
<P>
As to whether the explanatory notes are entirely accurate, the hon. Gentleman raised a good point. They are not entirely accurate, because the regulations under clauses 8, 9 and 14 are to be made by negative resolution. The hon. Gentleman also asked about the position of bodies that were no longer caught by the Bill. If they cease to exist, the information that they held will pass either to another body or back up to the sponsoring or parent Department with which the body was associated. For example, the Scott inquiry was set up by a Government Department. While it was sitting, its documents would be accessible from it under Bill's procedure—if they were not exempt. Once it had ceased to sit, the information would be passed back to the sponsoring Department and an application for it would be properly addressed to the Department that held the information, which by then would not be the Scott inquiry, which had ceased to exist, but would be the sponsoring Department.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> What the Parliamentary Secretary says makes great sense. I am worried about the automatic nature of the process that he described. Is he confident that there are no circumstances in which a public body can cease to exist when the documents that it had while it was a public body are not passed to a sponsoring Department of State or another public body? I shall not give an example, but no provision has been made to require that such information has to be passed to another public body. Is the Parliamentary Secretary entirely confident that the information could not simply die with the public body that had ceased to exist?
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> Let me give an example. If a body that was listed under parts VI and VII changed its constitution so that, under the terms of clause 3, it was no longer a public authority, the Bill would cease to apply to it and it would not be within the scope of the Bill. However, at that point, the body could be brought within the scope of the Bill by an order made under clause 4. The information, documents and records that belonged to a public body while it was still a public body would have to be passed somewhere, generally to the sponsoring Department or, in default, if it is a public body, to the Public Record Office. As the hon. Gentleman said, because we are dealing with a range of public bodies, it is impossible in primary legislation to prescribe the circumstances that will apply to every body in every conceivable circumstance. That is why we provided the flexibility to make additional orders under clause 4.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> The Parliamentary Secretary has satisfied me that the records of a public body that has ceased to exist will become the responsibility of the sponsoring Department or will be passed to the Public Record Office. I am still concerned about a body that changes its constitution so as to fall outside the criteria but which remains in existence, because there seems to be no retrospective power to require information to be released that it acquired while it was a public body. By reversing the burden of proof, Parliament may intervene—it may decide not to accept the delisting—because the Minister had not made proper provision to ensure access to that information. There is an element of doubt that the Parliamentary Secretary has not fully addressed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> I shall try to answer the hon. Gentleman. If further information is required, I shall write to him.
<P>
If a body changes its constitution to stop being a public authority, it would not come within the scope of the Bill and the amendment would not necessarily assist. A way forward would be for the body to be brought within the scope of the Bill by an order made under clause 4. In a sense, it would have been automatically removed as a public body by virtue of changing its constitution, and it would therefore fall outside the scope of clause 3 and the primary definition. That is the right route to follow, but the amendment will not achieve that aim. I therefore invite the hon. Gentleman to withdraw it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> I accept that the amendment would not achieve that end and that it would simply provide a check that whoever was the responsible Minister had taken appropriate steps via the mechanisms that the parliamentary Secretary described. There is no reason to suppose that that Minister would not do so, but when framing legislation we try to deal with eventualities that we cannot envisage.
<P>
I am grateful to the Parliamentary Secretary. He has tried hard to explain how the provision will work. The point raised by the amendment is still valid, although I am considerably reassured that it will not be needed because Ministers will not behave as he described. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<B>Mr. Mark Fisher </B>(Stoke-on-Trent, Central): I beg to move amendment No. 176, in page 40, line 39, leave out `five' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`three'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I apologise, Mr. O'Hara, for not being in my place when my amendments to clause 75 were called. I am not often absent, but I was taken unawares by the extreme speed of the Committee's proceedings. I was sad to miss the opportunity to comment on that clause.
<P>
I appreciate the Government's desire to make haste and to end this stage of Parliament's consideration of the Bill. I trust that the Government will be just as hasty to put the Bill on the statute book and, more particularly, to implement it.
<P>
The amendment would encourage the Government to make greater haste than is indicated in the Bill. Substituting ``three'' for ``five'' is a mild amendment. Some would consider it altogether too mild, but it would reduce the maximum time available to bodies to implement the Bill's provisions. The Bill envisages a start not later than 18 months after Royal Assent. It then proceeds by tranches of public bodies covered by the Bill. That seems a remarkably stately and relaxed attitude.
<P>
Given the Government's laudable rhetoric in introducing the Bill, will my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary explain why such a slow approach is being taken. What problems does he envisage, particularly for those bodies listed in schedule 1, which will be brought in with local authorities at later stages? I would be amazed if local authorities have many problems. They have been subject to freedom of information legislation for many years now, so what on earth will be the difficulty for them in implementing the Bill? Similarly, many other bodies, including the Government, have been subject to the code of practice.
<P>
Although the Bill has greater statutory powers—and is all the better for it—it is not as though it is introducing a strange new world of freedom of information to any of the bodies, and certainly not to the Government Departments and local authorities. Given, therefore, that they are all extremely familiar with freedom of information legislation and presumably have their files in hand so that they can comply with the code of practice, why on earth is my hon. Friend saying that it may take them five years? If an Act of Parliament gives bodies five years to comply with legislation, one is likely to find that most will take the whole five years. I would be amazed if any of them said they wanted to start as quickly as possible. My hon. Friend has been notified that some of these bodies are enthusiastic about implementing the Bill. I am delighted to hear that.
<P>
<H5>2 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Do my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary and the Government want to implement the Bill as quickly as possible? If they do, why are they so slow? Why are there no powers in the Bill for the Secretary of State to order implementation by those bodies that he believes would be able to comply with it before the period of five years—or three, if the amendment meets with the approval of the Government and the Committee? If he does not want to implement it as fast as possible and will not take powers to speed things up, what exactly will the Government do to cajole or to encourage bodies under schedule 1 and other Departments—ideally, there would be incentives—to begin to comply?
<P>
Implementation is far too slow. We get the Bill at long last, at the tail end of the legislation of this Parliament. It was promised in the manifesto for the last general election, but implementation, with Royal Assent, will occur in the next Parliament or of perhaps even in the Parliament after that. For a Government who say that they are enthusiastic about the importance of this legislation, that seems to be remarkably slow progress. Surely we can do better than that.
<P>
Surely, at the very least, the Government can accept the amendment and say, ``Let us bestir ourselves and get it in within three years.'' I hope that most Departments will implement the provisions within that time, but if the period is three years at least that will ensure that the Bill is fully implemented between the next general election and the one after. This Government, who I hope will be in power during that period and indeed beyond that, will then be able to receive credit not just for introducing the legislation but for seeing it fully implemented and on the statute book.
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary and others in the Committee have said many times, how the Bill will be implemented will be as important as what is in it. This slow approach towards implementation seems to send all the wrong signals about enthusiasm, importance and urgency to bodies that may be cautious or even sceptical. Those bodies need a lead from the Government—a lead on the urgent need to get this measure on the statute book. I hope that my hon. Friend will have some good news for the Committee on that point.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Lock:</B> My hon. Friend accepts that the amendment would reduce by two years the time available to implement all the Bill's provisions. I am afraid that he is somewhat over-optimistic in putting forward the amendment and that he may have underestimated the time scales for the steps that must be taken to implement the Bill fully and successfully.
<P>
I want to reassure my hon. Friend that the Government have no desire to drag their feet. We want to ensure that there is proper and effective preparation. Preparation should not be hurried or ill-considered. The success or otherwise of the culture change which we all want to see happen, the creation of a climate of openness across the public sector, depends crucially on public authorities getting things right.
<P>
The Bill already sets certain targets. Certain provisions will come into force at Royal Assent or shortly afterwards. The Bill does not envisage a start until 18 months after Royal Assent. The office of the Information Commissioner, for example, will be created two months after Royal Assent. That office will need 12 to 18 months to prepare for full implementation and, thereafter, it will be necessary to stagger implementation in order not to overburden the office.
<P>
It is not that we give bodies five years to implement the Bill; rather, the Bill will apply to bodies from the date that the Secretary of State may by order appoint. Clause 85(3) would give the Secretary of State discretion to bring public bodies within the scope of the Bill on such dates as he determines. Five years is a long stop; that is the last possible date on which the last possible public body—with no doubt the maximum operational difficulties and working in a most difficult environment for a culture change—will have to comply. I am confident that enormous progress will be made in developing freedom of information and a change in culture and in implementing the Bill in a much longer time than the long-stop date.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Leigh </B>(Gainsborough): In a shorter time—that was a Freudian slip.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> I apologise. I am sure that we can do it much more quickly.
<P>
Public authorities will need to undertake their own preparatory work. They will need to set up systems to consider applications, to deal with complaints and, most importantly, to train their staff. I cannot emphasise enough the importance of training to deal with applications under the Bill. It will also be essential to bring about a cultural change to ensure the success of the freedom of information regime. That is the view not just of the Government but of the Advisory Group on Openness in the Public Sector which my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary established in advance of the Bill to give advice on how to implement the openness agenda properly and effectively.
<P>
No final decision has yet been taken, but it seems sensible, as my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central anticipated, for the Bill to be implemented in stages by extending coverage gradually by type of organisation. It would make sense to start with central Government and it is right that central Government should provide models of good practice. Further consideration needs to be given to how quickly each tranche of bodies could be brought fully within the Bill's scope. Piloting of the provisions might show how quickly it could be fully implemented where bodies were under a freedom of information regime for the first time.
<P>
I believe that getting the measure right is most important and that it is better to take a bit of extra time and get it right at the first attempt than to rush it. We have lessons to learn from the way in which the Human Rights Act 1998 was implemented. Staff will need training to appreciate the new culture of rights. Five years may seem a long time, but that is only a long stop. It exists to ensure that, at the very worst, that is the date when the new regime will apply to every public body. However, we do anticipate rolling out the obligations over that five-year period with as much speed as is reasonable, given the need to change the culture, to set up the office of Information Commissioner and get it working and to develop the different way of working that is envisaged in the Bill.
<P>
I cannot accept the amendment, but I can give hon. Members the assurance that the Government are not intending to drag their feet and are very much committed to implementation of the Bill's principles as soon as is reasonably practicable.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> Apart from the charming impersonation of ex-President Reagan with ``I knew not what I said'' when my hon. Friend after being prompted, gainsayed himself, I find it disappointing that we have gone through the whole Committee stage and not one of my amendments has commended itself to the Government. I was hoping that at least on my last amendment, Mr. O'Hara, the Government would smile on what I said and accept it as not being entirely unworthy of implementation.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath:</B> It was no lack of persuasiveness or eloquence on the hon. Gentleman's part that failed to persuade the Minister. He persuaded me every time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> That is very kind of the hon. Gentleman, but sometimes persuasion depends on where one starts. I suspect that the positions from which the hon. Gentleman and I started were somewhat closer to each other than my views and those of my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary and his colleague. Although they have been the models of courtesy on the Bill, they have been depressingly unyielding and deaf to cases put to them. Given that the Parliamentary Secretary had the difficult job of coming into the middle of the discussion on the Bill—perhaps with a brief that was not of his Department—he has taken to the Bill incredibly well in a way that shows his skills as a lawyer.
<P>
However, of all the replies that the my hon. Friend has given, the last was the most unconvincing. He seemed deeply unhappy on this occasion when mouthing the words. That says something for his sense of decency and fairness, but it does not say a great deal for the Government's position, and I was wholly unconvinced. He said that much time would be needed for training. Will he give us more information? How will training to implement the Bill differ from training that has taken place on the ground, over the last few years, for the code of practice? They are both about the release of information. Although people will have to grasp the specific details of the Bill and the legal responsibilities associated with it, the training to be able to access information and provide it to an applicant where that is legally allowed under the Bill—allowed rather than encouraged—cannot be any different. It has already taken place, certainly in Departments and in local authorities. For years, they have been dealing with freedom of information in a non-statutory way. It is completely unconvincing to say that some wholly new type of training will be needed. The Government will have to do better than that if they are to explain why the process will be so slow.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary says that he wants to get it right. That is correct. I cannot believe, however, that the Bill, building on the great deal of work that has taken place under the code of conduct, will need such a very long time. I can see that it may take some months for the Information Commissioner's office to get going. It will come as a great surprise to her on the day of Royal Assent that she has these responsibilities. It will not have occurred to her to prepare for Royal Assent! Again, my hon. Friend will have to do better than that. He has been in detailed discussion with the excellent Information Commissioner designate for months and months. She is, as everybody has said, a woman of huge ability in whom everybody has confidence. She knows exactly what will be needed of her staff and what additional resources she will need. The idea that this will come as a shock through her mailbox on the day of Royal Assent and that she will need 18 months to get up to speed is wholly unconvincing.
<P>
Of course we have to get the measure right. We can get it right, however, with a great deal more urgency than this. My hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary said that a culture change was needed. What would change the culture is a lead from the Government that they want to get on with this. No matter what he says, the Bill implies that full implementation will take five years, into the Parliament after next. That sends out all the wrong signals on a change of culture. It suggests that, although we will need to do this, we do not really want to do it as quickly as possible.
<P>
Rightly or wrong, that is the suspicion that has taken hold in the public and in many of these bodies. The way to disabuse them and to achieve the culture change is to set a positive lead. I am delighted that the Government are starting with their own Departments, but they can act faster than my hon. Friend suggests. I hope that, during the further stages of consideration, the Government will convince themselves and then the rest of the world that they want the Bill, in whatever form it comes, to be implemented as soon as possible.
<P>
<H5>2.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Stephen O'Brien </B>(Eddisbury): The points made in support of the amendment define many of the arguments that have been put throughout the Committee. This is an opportunity, even at the eleventh hour, for the Government to recognise that the deep concern of all those who have spent time here considering the Bill's logic and genuineness of approach. Given the admitted dilution of the White Paper, the Government should concede that, if the Bill is to carry the force of law and make an advance on what was already, on the Government's own admission, a reasonably operating code of practice, to accept the amendment would demonstrate their good faith.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> To some extent this is a circular argument. Hon. Members are inclined to talk down the radical effects of the Bill, to undermine the work that is needed to change the culture, to minimise the number of public bodies to which it will refer and to belittle the step change in open government that the Bill will deliver. Many of the proposals will require substantial work by local authorities. The advisory group on openness in the public sector has recognised that. It has worked through the practicalities and does not share the pessimism of those who denigrate the Bill and say that it will make no difference, or the optimism of those who say that it can be implemented quickly and effectively.

<P>

<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> Will my hon. Friend give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> I should like to make a little progress.
<P>
We have been in continuing contact with the Data Protection Registrar, Elizabeth France, about the timetable. She has not demurred from the view that I have expressed and she, of course, was a member of the advisory group. The draft consultation on the legislation included clause 72(3) of the draft Bill, and of the many criticisms this is not one of the more powerful ones. It has been in the legislation for some time. The training has not taken place yet for two reasons. First, the change of culture has not taken place so far under the code of practice. Secondly—a point that has been made repeatedly in Committee—the Bill will apply to far more public bodies than did the code of practice and they will therefore be coping with a freedom of information regime for the first time.
<P>
If my hon. Friend says that five years is too long and that there is an opportunity for public bodies to be tooled up, trained and made available earlier, I do not necessarily disagree. The Government have no intention of dragging their feet, but this is a long-stop power, to be implemented if all else fails. Whichever party is in government, the measures will take effect on the date set out in the Bill. We are debating that, not what is the appropriate time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> My hon. Friend has always dealt fairly with us, but he does not help his argument by discrediting my argument by saying that I or other members of the Committee seek to belittle or denigrate the effect of the Bill. He is a fair-minded man and he knows that I have spent most of the 17 years of my life in Parliament trying to get freedom of information measures on to the statute book. I care desperately about the Bill. For years, I have tried to persuade Governments to so legislate and I am delighted that this Government, of which I am proud to be a supporter, is doing so at long last.
<P>
I am anxious that the Bill will be good legislation, which is why I have criticised many aspects of it. I want to see it on the statute book, so that the Government can take some credit for its implementation. It is not fair of my hon. Friend to say that any criticism of the Bill is belittling or denigrating it. It is not. It is because I believe passionately in the importance of such provisions in public life that I want to see them enacted as fast as possible. The best action that my hon. Friend can take is to create the cultural change that he rightly wants to create to demonstrate the Government's enthusiasm for such provisions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> I am sorry if my hon. Friend believes that I am criticising him. Those who have criticised the Bill—mainly those outside the Committee Room—have underestimated the nature of the cultural change through which our public bodies will have to go to comply with the Bill. My hon. Friend said that five years is too long. I shall certainly reflect on that argument. The Government have no desire to reduce the timetable. As for the advisory group, we shall—
<P>
<B>Dr. George Turner </B>(North-West Norfolk): Lengthen the timetable.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> We have no advisory group. It is Thursday afternoon. I shall reflect on whether the Government can take steps to speed up the implementation of such measures, but I am not in a position to accept an amendment that would reduce the time to three years.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> I hear what I should like my hon. Friend to say and then I hear what he says to correct himself. Given that he said that he will give some thought to the amendment, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`.—(1) Where a public authority has decided under section 13 not to inform an applicant that it holds information or not to communicate information to him and the authority has not complied with a discretionary disclosure recommendation under section 48, a decision notice under section 50(7), or an enforcement notice under section 52(2), the applicant may appeal to the Tribunal.
<P>
(2) On such an appeal the Tribunal may review the public authority's exercise of its discretion under section 13 and may order the public authority to communicate or release the information to the applicant if it finds that the public authority has failed to exercise its discretion in accordance with the provisions of that section.'.—[Mr. Leigh.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Brought up, and read the First time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
I apologise for the fact that my hon. Friend the Member for Ryedale (Mr. Greenway) is not in his accustomed place. He has to be in Northern Ireland today, but he has asked me to speak on his behalf. I come late to the vineyard in terms of speaking in Committee, but I hope that my efforts will prove worth while. I shall not emulate the skill and erudition of my hon. Friend, but I shall try my best.
<P>
New clause 1 is designed to achieve a balance between those whose complaint is turned down by the commissioner and those whose complaint is upheld.
<P>
The question is how to achieve a fair balance. A complainant, the applicant or a public authority can appeal. If the commissioner rules that information should be or should have been released, the public authority can ask the tribunal to review her decision. We have no worries about that; it is for the simple cases in which a public authority has misdirected itself with regard to a point of law.
<P>
If the commissioner concluded that the public authority had discretion about releasing information and it chose not to, she could recommend its release. However, she could not require the public authority to release information. If the commissioner thinks that there is a valid discretion in a certain case and the public interest in favour of disclosure outweighs the public interest against disclosing it, the discretionary disclosure in clause 48 applies. Such a case might revolve around an accident investigation.
<P>
The Parliamentary Secretary confirmed that, if a public authority chose to ignore the recommendation, the applicant could only apply to a court for judicial review. Ministers or public authorities cannot be challenged by reference to the tribunal. The applicant could be put to a lot of expense and difficulty in going to judicial review.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman mean judicial review or contempt proceedings as a means of enforcement? He might find that the reference is to contempt proceedings.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> The Parliamentary Secretary corrects me. I understood that the reference was to judicial review, but my argument is not affected either way. Our point is that the applicant in that case cannot have recourse to the tribunal.
<P>
The right of appeal to the tribunal is not even-handed. We think that the tribunal should have a role, and that there should be a mechanism to allow an applicant to ask a tribunal to review a public authority's decision to ignore the commissioner's recommendation.
<P>
The major criticism of the commissioner's powers has been that she cannot require release, only recommend it. We understand that the Parliamentary Secretary is not prepared to concede that point, but if the commissioner does not have that power, why not the tribunal? After all, it will be composed of the great and good, the highly reputable and responsible. Why have senior lawyers and others sitting on a tribunal if they do not have the clout to compel disclosure when the commissioner's view is that the public authority has wrongly refused it?
<P>
I imagine that the Parliamentary Secretary will say that it is okay for the tribunal to overturn a commissioner's decision, but not okay for it to overturn a Minister's decision. That does not seem fair or even-handed, and why have an enforcement process that is not even-handed?
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> I think that the new clause as drafted contains a technical error. It refers to an enforcement notice under clause 50(2), and I assume that it meant to refer to clause 52(2), which is the correct part of the Bill for enforcement notices. If that is right, the intention behind the new clause must be to establish the Information Tribunal as the ultimate authority in respect of appeals against decisions not to disclose exempted information under the discretionary disclosure provisions in clause 13. New clause 1 would therefore seek to achieve that by creating a new right of appeal to allow the complainant to approach the tribunal in cases of non-compliance with a discretionary disclosure recommendation, a decision or an enforcement notice.
<P>
The new clause addresses, although in a different way, who should male the final decision on a discretionary disclosure. As my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary explained, the power to weigh the balance of the public interest properly belongs to the public authority rather than the commissioner or the Information Tribunal. Public authorities have extremely wide-ranging subject matter and an in-depth knowledge of the subjects with which they deal daily. They understand where the public interest lies in relation to the information that they hold and appreciate the competing public interests in confidentiality and disclosure. That compels us to conclude that public authorities are clearly best placed to take the decision that is required under clause 13.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary mentioned the important role of Ministers in safeguarding the public interest. That applies here as it applied to the amendments to clause 13. As he said, the Government will consider the issue in the context of their deliberations on the proper balance that is established in clause 13.
<P>
<H5>2.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
In certain respects, we believe that new clause 1 is otiose. It refers to decisions that are made under clauses 50(7) and 52(2), which provide a right of appeal in relation to decisions by the commissioner. That is unnecessary because failure to comply with a notice by the commissioner under those subsections is punishable by a court as if it were a contempt. An appeal to the tribunal to confirm those notices, which have been given by the tribunal and have binding effect at that time, is unnecessary. A notice can be challenged by judicial review, but not in those circumstances because the notice would already have been issued to require disclosure.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked why the tribunal cannot overturn decisions. The tribunal can overturn decisions that are made by authorities. It is a limited role or no role whatsoever, in decisions that involve disclosure under clause 13. That is at the heart of the hon. Gentleman's concerns, and I hope that there is no confusion. The proper place to consider the balance that is established under clause 13 is not by virtue of the new clause, but in relation to our debates on clause 13. The Government have undertaken to go away and consider the substance of those debates. That is the proper route. Given the context and the technical difficulties of the new clause, I invite the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the motion.

<P>

<B>Mr. Stephen O'Brien:</B> I support new clause 1. The Parliamentary Secretary's remarks, to which I listened carefully, drew a distinction between the contempt procedure and Judicial review. That does not make a substantive difference in terms of overall enforcement, because it is known to anyone who has practised law—and many Committee members have—that there is an acid test for a legal adviser who instructs a client on a judicial review. The same test is relevant when we apply to the court for a contempt. We advise a client to proceed with the utmost caution because it is a difficult case to establish and risks enormous costs. In addition, the outcome does not usually favour the individual.
<P>
Throughout our deliberations, the ultimate sanction on the public authority is that the judicial review procedure, or a contempt procedure, is the final refuge. That is usually a toothless tiger by any test. When it bites, it hurts, but it is rarely used and puts an individual at great risk. It also sits oddly with the Prime Minister's response to my question on freedom of information. When I asked him to explain why information would not be available for public scrutiny he said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``for the first time, there will be an independent commissioner who can require disclosure.''—[Official Report, 15 December 1999; Vol. 341, c.271.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is partly true, but it does not apply across all the Bill's provisions. In resisting new clause 1, the Government are not giving full weight to the Prime Minister's clear sentiment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his measured tone. He outlined the problem extremely well, on the basis of his professional experience. I know what the Parliamentary Secretary says about our new clause being technically deficient, but the Government could help us. I can only echo earlier sentiments: it is sad that the Government have not been prepared to accept any amendments, despite our cogent arguments. I also note what the Parliamentary Secretary said about contempt and judicial review.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Mr. Mike O'Brien):</B> The hon. Gentleman is wrong to say that we did not respond to persuasive and cogent argument.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> That is what Ministers always say: they only ever respond to cogent argument.
<P>
Our case, notwithstanding any technical difficulty, is powerful. If the Bill is to have any force, people must be confident that procedures are in place for them to go to the commissioner with little difficulty and cost. If she believes that the public authority has a discretion and has failed to act properly, applicants must be confident that they can go to a tribunal instead of going through the difficult procedures of judicial review. The Government have unfairly shifted the burden on to the applicant.
<P>
The Parliamentary Secretary's confidence in the decision-making powers of public authorities is extraordinary. Although public authorities are the subject of a complaint, they will be judge and jury of it. The approach is not even-handed. It is not fair that a public authority can recognise that it has the discretion, but chooses not to exercise it. If the commissioner agrees with the applicant and decides that a public authority is not acting properly, it can say, ``So what? We have come to our decision. The commissioner can say what she likes. We're going to carry on.'' That goes to the heart of the Bill. The Parliamentary Secretary—kindly, I accept—tried to deflect criticism by saying that the new clause relates to clause 13, but that tiny glimmer of hope is not enough to dissuade us from pressing the new clause to a vote.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
Brought up, and read the First time.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
The new clause relates to a difficult area for discussion; the Official Secrets Act 1989 and its relationship to the security services. It is difficult because there is almost a Pavlovian response from Government: they say that matters of national security are of the utmost priority and retreat behind that barrier. I take the contrary view. Because matters of security are so important—literally, matters of life and death—and because we provide specific protection in security matters by making it a criminal offence to disclose such information, it becomes even more important to get the legislation absolutely right.
<P>
I contend that the present legislation, the Official Secrets Act l989, is not absolutely right. I am not the author of the words that I have chosen to include in the new clause; they were actually written by the Labour party in 1988 when it considered that legislation. However, the Labour party seems to have changed its view on the issue, which is one reason why I wish to explore it today.
<P>
There are two problems with section 1 of the Official Secrets Act 1989. First, there is no public interest defence for a person charged with disclosing information under the section. Secondly, there is no harm test. There is no requirement on the Government to show that any harm is likely to result from the disclosure of information, or even to show that the information is true. It is an absolute offence to disclose information in the circumstances described. When the Act was first discussed in 1988, Lord Hattersley, whom I shall not attempt to imitate, said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Clause 1 is comprehensive and arbitrary . . . It cannot be necessary or right to make every item connected with security, no matter how loosely, subject to automatic restriction. It is intolerable that the Government alone should be able to define and designate the individuals who are covered by the blanket ban, and the categories of work which are to be shrouded in secrecy.''—[Official Report, 21 December 1988; Vol. 144, c.472.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He was absolutely right. There is a need for a public interest defence, as was recognised far more recently by the Lord Chancellor in 1996, who, after criticising the inadequacy of the Intelligence and Security Committee, went on to argue that the Official Secrets Act
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``fails to recognise the public interest to know of abuses by government and its powers''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``is more repressive in practice''—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
than the 1911 Act.
<P>
Right up until 1996, the Labour party expressed a very clear opinion about the inadequacy of the Official Secrets Act and the need for reform, but all that has apparently changed. The present Home Secretary does not share that opinion, and there could be several reasons for that. It could be due to the fact that he is in government. That might inform his opinion or cause it to be influenced by others who have a different agenda from that held by the Labour party in opposition. To be charitable, it might be that he believes that the Intelligence and Security Committee provides a form of accountability and has, therefore, reduced the need for reform, although I would argue that it does not. In opposition, the Labour party was critical of the establishment of that committee. Although I make no criticism of its activities, it does not deal with individual cases or provide recourse for the whistleblower, and it is answerable ultimately to the Prime Minister.
<P>
<H5>2.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
When I was a member of the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs, we had a slight contretemps with the Government on the subject of confidential telegrams and information from the security services in the context of the arms to Sierra Leone debacle. The Foreign Secretary chose not to give the Select Committee access to information that it needed to pursue an investigation—contrary, incidentally, to the opinion of the Secretary of State for Defence, who was happy to give us access to the chief of defence intelligence—because that information could be made available to the Intelligence and Security Committee. However, that was of negligible value to the Select Committee because the Intelligence and Security Committee was not in a position to report to the House on its findings—there are no provisions for it to do so and it can report only to the Prime Minister, who has discretion to determine whether to make a report available to the House. There are serious doubts about whether we have genuine accountability.
<P>
There are good reasons why the security services are exceptional and should be treated in an exceptional way. However, I do not believe that the present Official Secrets Act is adequate. It fails to recognise that there are occasions when a person might disclose information because it is in the essential interests of the state to do so. I do not believe that the blanket ban, which ensures that it is an absolute offence to disclose any information, however trivial or true, is right.
<P>
The Bill includes the Home Secretary's statement under the Human Rights Act 1998 that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the provisions of the Freedom of Information Bill are compatible with the Convention rights.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He is probably right, but he could not make the same assertion about the Official Secrets Act, or at least not without careful advice. Currently, there is no provision for someone accused under that Act to test the public interest case before a judge and jury. When a case is brought under the Human Rights Act 1998, we shall have a judicial test of a fundamental incompatibility between that Act and the 1989 Act.
<P>
Accepting the new clause would put right the omission, would make the 1989 Act better, would fulfil the long-established and oft-repeated policy that the Labour party developed in opposition, and would go a little way towards regularising the judicial framework for disclosure and its application to people working in our security services. The issue will not go away—it will be tested in the courts. We have seen the recent Shayler case, and we shall see many more cases in the years to come. The Government will eventually have to move. The new clause provides such an opportunity, and I urge the Minister to take it.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> I hope that the Under-Secretary will carefully consider his reply, will be sympathetic and will encourage the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome. As the hon. Gentleman said, the 1989 Act was one of the worst that the then Conservative Government put on the statute book, and it has been widely reviled since. It replaced the 1911 Act, which was pushed through the House in one day and was an ill-considered, panicky and draconian measure. It achieved the almost impossible task of being worse than that Act.
<P>
I believe that, of the members of the Committee, only the hon. Member for Gamsborough and I were Members in 1988. The hon. Gentleman will recall that the then Home Secretary, Lord Hurd, who enjoyed a reputation for being a liberal Home Secretary and an intelligent man, steamrollered the Bill through on behalf of the then Prime Minister without accepting an amendment. The only opposition came from the Labour and Liberal parties, and from one or two courageous Conservative Back Benchers, such as the hon. Member for Aldridge-Brownhills (Mr. Shepherd) and Mr. Jonathan Aitken The hon. Member for Gainsborough was often in the Lobby with them, but I do not remember whether he was then. Only they had the courage to speak out, although public and press opinion begged the then Government to reconsider and not to drive the legislation through in that thoroughly illiberal and undemocratic way.
<P>
Interestingly, a key criticism was the lack in section 1 of the concept of a public interest debate. Not only the then shadow Home Secretary, Lord Hattersley, but every Labour Member begged the Government to reconsider their view on such a basic protection against thoroughly undesirable official secrets legislation.
<P>
The Act defined the illiberal nature of Baroness Thatcher's Government. Many people would despair if the Government did not take the opportunity to correct something that, as the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome said, we correctly deplored at the time. Twelve years later, we have the opportunity to put that right and I hope that we will take it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> I shall not respond to the invitation given by the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome to salivate on cue, like Pavlov's dogs. It is correct to discuss and debate the appropriate legislative framework for security matters, but only in the proper context. Such discussion is proper and legitimate for the House, and the Government have no problem with that except for the caveat that it should occur in the appropriate context. I do not think that it is appropriate to reform the Official Secrets Act 1989 by tagging provisions on to the Bill. The hon. Member for Somerton and Frome accepted that there were good reasons why the security services were treated in an exceptional way, and I agreed with him. That is why specific legislation is in place to deal with them.
<P>
New clause 3 would amend offences that apply under the Official Secrets Act. It would allow a defence to be made on the basis that disclosure or retention of information was in the public interest. That provision would apply when the person involved believed that there was reasonable cause to think that the information indicated the existence of crime, fraud, abuse of authority, neglect in the performance of an official duty or other misconduct. However, that would be applicable only for offences committed under sections 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 or 8 and when the person had taken reasonable steps to comply with any established procedures for drawing related misconduct to the attention of the appropriate authorities without effect.
<P>
The purpose of the new clause appears to be to provide a defence under the Official Secrets Act for an employee of a public authority who has disclosed information without appropriate authority but believes that it was in the public interest to do so. It is effectively a whistleblower's defence for offences under the Official Secrets Act. I assure the hon. Gentleman that disclosures made by an official in an authority with appropriate authorisation would have been made with lawful authority under the Bill. Any disclosure made under the Bill would therefore not be a breach of the Official Secrets Act. In addition, the public interest would already be taken into account when considering disclosure of the information under clause 13.
<P>
Moreover, when the Information Commissioner has reason to believe that an authority may be preventing the release of information whose disclosure is in the public interest, she may ensure that it complies with the Bill by exercising her powers under clause 51 to require it to provide her with the information. That power will ensure that any attempt to improperly withhold information will be capable of being exposed.
<P>
The new clause would do nothing to add to the statutory access rights that the Bill seeks to deliver. Clause 13 ensures that information that may be damaging will nevertheless be disclosed if such disclosure is in the public interest and the Information Commissioner will ensure compliance with the Bill. It is not appropriate to amend the Official Secrets Act, which deals with unauthorised disclosures, by amending the Bill, which is of an entirely different nature. It is about authorised disclosures and about creating a means by which people can obtain a right to know by setting out the circumstances in which they have that right of access to authorised information. The hon. Gentleman is seeking to import an entirely different concept into the Bill whereby there would be not a right to know but a dispensation under a different Act of Parliament that contains different sorts of provisions. He is trying to achieve something to which the Bill is not related. The Bill is all about information, but it is about a different sort of information, which is why we think that it is not the appropriate vehicle for the proposed changes.
<P>
There are arguments in favour of a public interest defence within the Official Secrets Act 1989 and the new clause raises an important issue; but an amendment to the Bill is not the right context in which to attempt to make such a fundamental change in that Act. The availability of a public interest defence of the type proposed in the new clause would mean that a member of the security services would feel able to decide for himself or herself that disclosure of sensitive information was justified on such grounds.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath indicated dissent.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The hon. Gentleman shakes his head, but that is what the proposal appears to suggest.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> I am very concerned by what the Under-Secretary said. The proposal provides a defence in law against an accusation being made and the person accused being put on trial and imprisoned. That does not allow a person to decide for himself; it allows a judge and jury to determine whether he has acted in the public interest. That is a very different matter.
<P>
<H5>3 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> A person would have to decide whether he could get away with doing what he had done. Only after information was released, and damage had been done to national security, would a court decide whether a disclosure was in the public interest. That is a rather hazardous way of protecting the nation's interests and those of the public at large. That branch of law may well be one in which more specific consideration of some issues may be appropriate, and the House may decide to debate the matter another time. However, regardless of the views of the hon. Gentleman and my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central about cases that are now before the courts, and therefore cannot be discussed, the House would not discuss such matters in the context of the Bill, which will give the individual citizen the right to gain access to authorised information, which a public authority will be obliged to disclose. The new clause would import into the Bill an entirely different and inappropriate concept, which should probably be discussed in the context of an entirely different debate. The new clause relates not just to the security services but to the right to know. Trying to import those matters into the Bill is wrong in principle: thus, we cannot accept the proposal.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> I have seldom been so disappointed with a ministerial reply. I hope that the Under-Secretary will forgive me for saying that, because I appreciate the good-humoured terms on which the Committee has been conducted. However, the hon. Gentleman is profoundly wrong on this issue, which shows how far the Labour party has moved on the matter in such a short time.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I can see that the hon. Gentleman is disappointed because we have not accepted his proposal, but I am not sure which way he thinks that we have moved, because I have not commented on the issue. What I said is that importing into a Bill an entirely inappropriate provision is wrong in principle. If the hon. Gentleman wants to raise the matter in another context, in a Bill on the security services or the Official Secrets Act, for example, we may consider it and I may then comment on the appropriateness of the concept that he proposes. My argument was advanced entirely on the basis that the concept does not belong in the Bill. The hon. Gentleman cannot argue that I have changed my mind on the matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> Would that that were the case. If the hon. Gentleman refers to the record, he will realise that he embroidered his reply, in a way that deeply disappointed me. Had he restricted his comments to the view that this was not the right legislative vehicle for the reform, I would not have been surprised. However, I would have disagreed, because I think that it provides a good opportunity to put right a deficiency in the law that will be have to be addressed soon because of events in the courts. As legislators, we should be leading that process, not following a court's interpretation of the European convention on human rights or some other agreement. Instead, he said that it would be wrong to provide a defence for an offence that is set out in legislation that both sides of the House agree is badly worded and inappropriate.
<P>
The Under-Secretary also said that someone should not be given the option of a defence because it might encourage that person to commit an offence. That is not tenable in law, and I doubt whether it is just or compatible with the terms of the European convention on human rights and the Human Rights Act 1998. But I am not a lawyer and it would be foolish to have a firm opinion. The Under-Secretary, who is a lawyer, may put me right on that.

<P>

<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Again, I say that the hon. Gentleman is putting words into my mouth. I have a note of what I said, which I shall repeat. We recognise that arguments can be put in favour of some sort of public interest defence within the Official Secrets Act, and the new clause raises an important issue. However, it is not the right context in which to attempt to make such a fundamental change to that Act. If the hon. Gentleman is good enough to read Hansard, he will see that I have been careful with my words. I am sure that he does not want to do me an injustice by suggesting that I have rejected all his concerns, but they are matters for a different debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> It is certainly not my intention to do an injustice to the Under-Secretary. He has listened carefully to my concerns and I accept what he says. Although I knew that the Government would not accept the new clause, I was reasonably optimistic because he understood the concept, with which he had some sympathy. However, it was what he said later that bothered me. In giving a commitment that I shall read his words carefully, I ask him to do the same.
<P>
The new clause would be a valuable legislative vehicle to introduce a public interest defence into the Official Secrets Act. The House may wish to express an opinion on that. I shall certainly look at what the Under-Secretary said today, but we may decide to return to this subject in detail on the Floor of the House. It involves an important principle, both in law and in freedom of information in the broadest sense. There is an unfair application of legislation that, as the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central recalls, was pushed through Parliament. I am dubious of such legislation because it is often regretted. Had the Under-Secretary said that the Home Office has a clear view on the need to reform the Official Secrets Act and that he was hoping to introduce legislation in this Parliament to deal with the lacuna, I would have been satisfied. He did not do that, although I am grateful that he said that he would be interested in looking at the arguments. That is as far as the debate will get today, but we shall return to the matter.
<P>
 I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.

Motion and clause, by leave, withdrawn.
<H4><center>New clause 4</center></H4>
<H4><center>Supply of medical etc. information</center></H4>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`.—A model publication scheme for any public authority mentioned in paragraphs 44, 45 and 51 of Part III of Schedule 1 may provide for information to be supplied to an applicant by the responsible primary care group or Health Authority in England and Wales or by the Northern Ireland Central Services Agency for the Health and Social Services.'.—[Mr. Leigh.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Brought up, and read the First time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
Our new clause would allow primary care groups, health authorities and trusts, rather than individual doctors, dentists and opticians, to be the public body required to disclose information. We have consulted the Medical Protection Society, a mutual society of doctors, dentists and other health care professionals, which helps members with legal problems arising from their job. We share its belief that the inclusion of individual doctors and dentists within the definition would be detrimental to their work. They are already overstretched.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> For clarification, is the hon. Gentleman talking about a mutual protection society or the Medical Protection Society?
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I apologise—I think that I was talking about a mutual protection society.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I think that the hon. Gentleman was talking about the Medical Protection Society, which happens also to be a mutual society although it is not called that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> Yes.
<P>
Not only will individual medical practitioners have to respond correctly to applications, but they will have to maintain a scheme for the publication of information and obtain the commissioner's approval for it. That will take time and be burdensome to them. Doctors want to co-operate and they believe in the aims of the Bill, but they think that the proposals would cause administrative chaos. Individual practitioners do not have policies on all the issues that patients could raise in respect of the Bill—the prescription of generic drugs, referral to specialist centres, criteria for referral to secondary care, provision of pregnancy tests, systems for notifying patients of tests and many more.
<P>
Resources will be stretched—it must be remembered that we are talking about individual practices. Dentists and doctors will be taken away from what they believe that they should be doing—caring for their patients. That will go against the grain of the increasing significance of primary care groups and trusts. Specifying the groups and trusts as public authorities under the Bill would solve the problem. We hope that the Under-Secretary will take account of the Medical Protection Society's advice.
<P>
The new clause is fair—there is no intention to upset the Bill's intentions. Doctors and dentists acting on their own do not have the resources of a larger public authority in preparing all the necessary schemes. I hope that the Under-Secretary will be able to respond positively. I can confirm that I was referring to the Medical Protection Society; I am sorry that I got that wrong. I have found my notes. I hope that he will feel that the new clause if worth while. If he cannot accept it today, he might undertake to return to it.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath:</B> I think that I am the only member of the Committee who has practised in primary health care. I therefore understand the hon. Gentleman's points. There is no reason to exclude a class of public bodies from the provisions. He was right to say that there was a difference between generic information and specific information regarding a patient.
<P>
I am not sure that the new clause is the right way of addressing the issue; the hon. Gentleman is not necessarily saying that the wording is perfect. Clear operating guidelines for primary health care professionals would be of the greatest assistance. It would be especially helpful if generic advice, shared by several practitioners and their primary health care group or authority, could be made available to applicants. A potentially bureaucratic word load, which the Bill did not intend, would thereby be reduced.
<P>
<H5>3.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> The hon. Gentleman said that he was the only member of the Committee with direct experience of the subject. He phrased his support for the principle behind the new clause with great caution. I, too, am sympathetic towards the aims of the new clause. The primary health care group in my constituency was one of the first, and it has met with huge praise and approval from the Secretary of State for Health—it is a model. The Government, to their credit, have promoted—and they hope to develop—primary care groups throughout the country. The groups could constructively perform the function. The Under-Secretary rightly stresses that we should make the Bill as practicable as possible; the proposal would be practicable, would help small one-man and one-woman practices to avoid many problems and would be useful.
<P>
I am in a slightly embarrassing position—this morning the Medical Protection Society sent me its briefing and I spoke with a representative on the phone and said confidently that the time to discuss the subject had long passed. I had not seen the new clause of the hon. Member for Gainsborough on the amendment paper. I gave the society poor information. I shall have to make my peace and apologise.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman has a good principle, even if the Under-Secretary cannot accept the wording. I hope that the Under-Secretary will find another way of addressing the point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> I do not agree with the new clause tabled by the hon. Member for Gainsborough, but I do not want to leave him without hope after I have dealt with it.
<P>
The new clause would allow a practitioner providing a medical, dental, ophthalmic or pharmaceutical service, as specified in part III of schedule 1, to provide—in the publication scheme that he must adopt—that information would be made available to an applicant not by him but by the responsible primary care group or health authority in England and Wales, or by the Northern Ireland Central Service Agency for health and social services.
<P>
I understand the concerns that underlie the new clause. They have been put to the Home Office in writing by the Medical Protection Society and by other bodies representing health care practitioners. The Government recognise that primary health care is vital and we have made that a key policy and service delivery issue since coming to power.
<P>
Delivery of primary health care and freedom of information are not competing policies. During the consultation period, including individual practitioners was clearly seen as desirable. There can be no question but that practitioners deliver a public service. Members of the public have a more direct interest in the service than in the more esoteric highways and byways of Government policy formulation. In other words, access to such information will mean much more to our constituents than how to find out what the Government and the local authority are up to, which is the sort of thing that many newspapers, journalists and even politicians who have taken up these issues would consider important. The issue is what is happening in the public services with which individuals have direct contact.
<P>
It is right that individual health care practitioners should be covered by the Bill. I accept that new clause 4 would not remove that status. Indeed, I have some sympathy with the proposal that it might be more sensible for a second-tier public authority such as a health authority to be responsible for providing some categories of information. The Medical Protection Society has suggested that issues on which the individual practitioner might have no separate policy from that of the health authority or primary care group would include prescribing of generic drugs, referrals to specialist centres or to secondary care and provision of pregnancy tests and notification of those and other test results.
<P>
There are three problems with new clause 4. The principal difficulty is that it would overturn one of the Bill's central principles—that a person is entitled to information held by a public authority, irrespective of whether another authority also holds the information. That principle ensures that the applicant will not be sent from pillar to post as each authority claims that the other should provide the information. The more complicated we make the rules, the more difficult it will become for ordinary citizens to gain access to the information. The principle that I mentioned is subject to one caveat—that an authority need not provide information that is otherwise readily accessible.
<P>
My second difficulty with the amendment is that it is unnecessary in part. Clause 19 provides that information is exempt information if it is reasonably accessible to members of the public other than under clause 1. Information that is made public by other public authorities would be ``reasonably accessible''; thus, it would be open to GPs or other practitioners not to have to respond to requests for information if they could show that it was available from the primary care group or health authority. Given that both the latter, as public authorities, would need schemes for the publishing of information and making the public aware of what was available, the request for information could often be dealt with by an appropriate referral.
<P>
However, when information not available under those arrangements was requested, the question of who should provide it might arise. The new clause might cause difficulty in that event, because it could result in someone being sent from pillar to post.
<P>
My final concern is that new clause 4 would bite only on the publication scheme adopted by the individual practitioner, even though that scheme would purport to make a commitment affecting another public authority, the health authority or primary care group. The new clause introduces no mechanism requiring consultation or agreement between the two authorities to ensure that one scheme's commitment could be honoured by the other.
<P>
I understand the reasoning behind the new clause and hope that I have made it clear why we cannot accept it. Nevertheless, it suggests a way forward—consultation and agreement between practitioners, the health authority or primary care group and the Information Commissioner, so that a publication scheme would be designed to safeguard the public's right of access without scope for unhelpful duplication of effort and excessive bureaucracy. If it were clear that the primary care group had a publication scheme and had published the information that someone had requested from the general practice, the practice would refer the person to the primary care group or health authority. If that were not clear, either the practice would have to process the request and ensure its transmission to the correct authority and the provision of the information to the applicant or a complex and difficult situation would arise; we want to avoid that.
<P>
We shall consider how the arrangement would operate. Probably the best approach would be that, by agreement, on consultation, publication schemes would be designed to retain the necessary right of access without the problem of unhelpful duplication. Nothing in the Bill prevents a publication scheme from including reference to information that the public would expect the health authority to hold but that was in fact made available by another authority. With that in mind, I urge the hon. Member for Gainsborough to withdraw the motion.
<P>
The Bill makes provision for the commissioner to approve a model publication scheme for public authorities falling within particular classes, such as general practitioners. It would be open, then, to the Medical Protection Society, if it so wished, to propose such a model scheme on behalf of individual practitioners.

<P>

<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> The debate has been useful. With the help of the Medical Protection Society we have highlighted an important matter. The Under-Secretary was quite right; this is the one respect in which the Bill could really bite, and in which what is going on could interest a great many of the public.
<P>
I am slightly disappointed with the Under-Secretary's response. I understand where he is coming from. He says that he does not want people to be pushed from pillar to post and he seems robust in his view that doctors and dentists are effectively public bodies. Although he did not properly answer it, I am sure that my main point will remain with him—that there are many individual practitioners and we should listen carefully to the concerns they have expressed through their mutual society. They believe that they would have difficulties with the arrangement.
<P>
The essence of the Under-Secretary's reassurance to the Committee seemed to be that, working through the primary care groups, practitioners could develop a scheme to reduce the administrative burden. It was interesting that the subject matter to which he alluded—prescribing generic drugs, referrals to specialist centres and criteria for referrals to specialist clinics—were precisely the ones highlighted in the Medical Protection Society document. I suppose that there is a glimmer of hope that the Under-Secretary understands the concern of those professionals and appreciates that, if we are not to place an undue burden on them when they are already overworked, the commissioner, the Government and the doctors' trade unions, if I may call them that, must do a lot of thinking. That might result in good practice and public confidence in the view that it is possible to get hold of the information that they consider important, without undue burden on doctors. On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.

Brought up, and read the First time.
<P>
<H5>3.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> This is a solemn moment—or perhaps the opposite, a joyful one—as we reach the last of the additions to the Bill, and perhaps it is an appropriate moment to thank you, Mr. O'Hara, and Dr. Clark for the way in which you have overseen our deliberations.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It is more appropriate for hon. Members who want to express courtesies to do so when we come to the end of our consideration of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> I was rather hoping not to have to speak again, as I have taken up a lot of the Committee's time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike Hall </B>(Weaver Vale): Hear, hear.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> I hear my hon. Friend on the Front Bench concur; I suspect that my interventions have sometimes stretched the patience of Government Front Benchers.
<P>
As the Under-Secretary has pointed out, the Bill contains several provisions that give the Home Secretary power to restrict rights of access. Clause 43(1) is an example, as it enables the Home Secretary to create new exemptions retrospectively. Remarkably, he could create such an exemption to deal with requests that have already been received but that have not been replied to, which would be very retrospective. Clause 6(3) enables the Home Secretary to amend schedule 1 to limit the right of access to information held by any authority specified in the schedule. Clause 9(3) enables him to extend the 20-day period for responding to requests to any length that he thinks appropriate.
<P>
Committee members have disagreed about all three of those provisions. The Under-Secretary has clearly and fairly explained the Government's position, especially on clause 43 and on the power to create additional amendments. We agreed to disagree, and, although I do not accept the weight and force of his view, I accept that it is sincere and that he made a case for the restrictions. I hope that he will accept that the Home Secretary may not want to restrict such matters but could instead want to loosen up the Bill and move in the opposite direction. Bizarrely, the Bill does not allow him to do so—it enables him to go in one direction but not in the other. Is that the Government's intention.
<P>
If the Government intend the Home Secretary to have powers enabling him only to restrict access rather than to make it more liberal, it is their assumption that no circumstances could arise in which the Bill would be seen to be unnecessarily restrictive once it is put to the test? That turn of events may be unlikely, but it is possible, and the Bill should have enough latitude and elasticity to give the Home Secretary the ability to respond to the real world and to adapt to circumstances. Just as he may want to restrict access, he may want to liberate it. The new clause would give him the opportunity to do so by order, although it, too, restricts the Home Secretary's exercise of his power.
<P>
The new clause is a move in the right direction. I hope that the Under-Secretary will accept, in the interests of even-handedness, that it would be sensible to introduce such a provision rather than require the Home Secretary to return to primary legislation if he wants to make this excellent Bill—as I hope that it will be after full parliamentary scrutiny—more liberal in future.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right to propose the new clause. Throughout our consideration of the Bill, the Under-Secretary has persistently pointed out the need for flexibility, for reassessment by future Governments of the working of the Bill when enacted and for an ability to adapt to changing circumstances. Unfortunately, that discretion applies in only one direction, which is that of conservatism. I use the term not in its political sense, but in its broader sense—in other words, I am referring to small ``c'' conservatism. Under the Bill, the Home Secretary can move in a small ``c'' conservative direction but not in a small ``c'' liberal direction. It would not be surprising if I were to say from the Liberal Democrat Benches that I approved of people becoming more liberal and disapproved of their becoming more conservative. That is why our amendments have sought to resist some of the Home Secretary's opportunities to make access to and disclosure of information more difficult.
<P>
It is entirely sensible to introduce provision to ensure that the Home Secretary has flexibility in both directions. The new clause would ensure that he would not have to seek to amend primary legislation in order to have such flexibility. It would be nonsense to have to put primary legislation before the House to try to allow greater disclosure merely because circumstances arose in respect of which the Bill was deficient. We cannot predict future circumstances, which is precisely the argument advanced by the Under-Secretary several times in support of flexibility allowing the Home Secretary to move in the other direction to that in which the new clause would allow him to proceed. Even if the new clause is not acceptable to the Government in its present form, I hope that the Minister will consider whether flexibility can be introduced to enable future Secretaries of State to ease the legislative burden and to stray in a liberal direction if they wish to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> Let me start what I think will be my last contribution to our deliberations by assuring my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central that Government Front Benchers have never been bored or frustrated by his helpful observations. We have been challenged several times and have had to consider our position carefully. On many occasions we have reflected in his observations and have agreed to consider making changes to meet his legitimate concerns. We are extremely grateful for his contributions to our debate, just as we are grateful to the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome, to the right hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (Mr. Maclennan) and to the hon. Members for Ryedale (Mr. Greenway) and for Gainsborough.
<P>
The new clause has a beguiling attraction and a certain simplicity, if not reciprocity. It would enable the Home Secretary to make orders to remove exemptions, to limit their scope, to introduce a prejudice test into a class exemption and to remove or vary the legal position in respect of clauses where the duty to confirm or deny does not arise. Subsection (2) of the new clause would allow such orders to have different applications to different bodies and subsection (3) would require them to be subject to affirmative procedures.
<P>
The new clause would mean a significant vesting of delegated powers in the Secretary of State. It has been presented as an attempt to balance the interests of the Executive with those of the individual applicant. The Committee has repeatedly considered provisions dealing with interests that are not solely those of the applicant and the Executive. A great deal of the exemptions that apply to information held by Government and to other information exist to protect third parties. On many occasions, we have debated the delicate balance that must be struck between protecting the interests of third parties—be they data subjects under the Data Protection Act 1998, people who provide the Government with information in confidence or members of the security services—the interests of the Executive to formulate policy without having to do so in a goldfish bowl, and the interests of applicants. However, ultimately, Parliament will decide where that balance should be struck.
<P>
To include new clause 5 in the legislation and provide for the removal or amendment of exemptions in such a way would cause considerable concern to many authorities that currently hold information that is rightly protected. It would also cause concern to all those third parties whose protection is set out in the Bill, and who need to know where they stand and what information they can and cannot give to the Executive. The Bill provides for those legitimate protections.
<P>
We want to achieve a cultural change towards openness, but in doing so, we must maintain the confidence both of public authorities—so that they know in which areas they have discretion—and of third parties, who must be reassured that they will be able to pass certain information to public authorities and that protection will apply in relation to legitimate exemptions. The new clause is not conducive to maintaining that confidence because it would allow the delicate balances in the Act and the exemptions that exist to protect those balances to be upset by secondary legislation passed by the House, at any time in the future, with limited notice. However, I have sympathy with the idea that, as society changes and public authorities develop, it might be necessary to express some of the exemptions in a slightly different form from their descriptions in the Bill.
<P>
The purpose of the new clause is already met by clause 13. Under that clause, an authority cannot simply rely on an exemption in the Bill. Other than in a few specified cases, the authority will be required to consider the exercise of its discretion to disclose information, even if it is in an exempt area. Therefore, if an exemption no longer applies or is no longer appropriate—the situation raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central—the authority will have a duty to consider disclosure of the information and should do so if the public interest in the disclosure outweighs the public interest in maintaining the exemption. In that respect, there is no question of an exemption that is no longer appropriate being allowed to prevent the disclosure of information.
<P>
The Information Commissioner will also have a role to play in such circumstances if an application is refused by the authority. I reiterate a point I have made before, that if the commissioner believes that an exemption does not apply, she can order disclosure of the information.
<P>
The debate has highlighted the need for the Government to go away and reflect carefully on the scope of clause 13, so, to that extent, I am grateful to my hon. Friend for tabling the new clause. However, to create a blanket power for the Secretary of State to disturb the balance of power in the Bill between the applicant, the Executive and all the third parties, who must also have confidence in the information that they give the Executive, and in the circumstances in which it will or will not be disclosed, is not the best way of building trust in a freedom of information regime or of achieving the change of culture that we seek. The right place to address that is during the debate on clause 13. I am sure that we will return to the matter and on that basis I invite my hon. Friend to withdraw the new clause.

<P>

<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> I am grateful for that reply, although the longer my learned Friend spoke, the more I began to think that if the Government are trying to rethink clause 13(3), probably planning to make it yet more restrictive. I would have been more convinced by the Minister's argument if he had decided which argument he wanted to rely on in rejecting the new clause. His first argument was that having such elasticity in regard to possible change would lead to uncertainty and destroy the confidence of people supplying information. That has a certain plausibility, although I was not persuaded by it. But his second argument was to turn to clause 13(3) and say that it gives public authorities a variant of exactly that elasticity. He must make up his mind why he rejects the new clause.
<P>
I am delighted that my learned Friend will consider the matter, but I hope that he will decide which argument to use to resist a perfectly sensible amendment that does not require the Home Secretary to make any changes. It requires only that the Minister bear in mind the remote possibility that the Government might have got the Bill's balance wrong. The Government's total confidence that the Bill could not be too restricted is interesting, and slightly worrying in terms of the desired change of culture, I hope that my learned Friend will genuinely rethink the matter with an open mind. In that spirit, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.
<P>
Motion and clause, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the Committee do report the Bill, as amended, to the House.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> On behalf of the Committee, thank you, Mr. O'Hara, and your co-Chairman, Dr. Clark—I am sure that you will pass our thanks on to him—for your firm handling of our proceedings. It did not need to be too firm; it has been a good-humoured and constructive Committee, in which issues have been debated robustly but reasonably. We have not had, to use a very ministerial phrase, any mucking about, no doubt due to the sensible way in which you and Dr. Clark have managed the Committee.
<P>
Our congratulations should also go to the hon. Member for Ryedale on his recent move. I am sorry that he could not be here today. The hon. Member for Gainsborough has done him proud in carrying on his good work and I am sure that he will pass on to his hon. Friend our good wishes. I also acknowledge the eloquence of my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central, who has been vigorous in his challenges. My hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary said that he had been challenging, and I sometimes felt challenged by him. He has been vigorous, which is as it should be in Committee.
<P>
I also congratulate the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome, who has managed to get two amendments out of us. Not many Opposition Members can claim to have convinced the Government to accept two amendments, and I am sure that he will use that in his press release after the Bill is passed. Our best wishes go to the right hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (Mr. Maclennan)—whose constituency I remember this time—who has brought us the benefit of his long and valuable experience of such matters.
<P>
I thank my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary for his efforts and for taking over for a full day at the beginning of our proceedings. I am enormously grateful to him and to the Lord Chancellor for allowing him to serve on the Committee.
<P>
I thank my hon. Friends, who have remained with us throughout this long but important process. They have contributed to creating a right to know for the people of this country, and that contribution has been valuable.
<P>
I especially thank the officials, who have been steady and careful in giving advice, and have got me out of several situations in which, without their advice, I might have crashed. Their advice enabled me to deal with the able queries of Opposition Members and my hon. Friends. I also thank my hon. Friend the Whip for keeping most of us in line.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> On behalf of my hon. Friends, I join the Minister in thanking you, Mr. O'Hara and Dr. Clark, for the eminently fair and courteous way in which you have both chaired our proceedings. I am sure that you will pass on our thanks to Dr. Clark.
<P>
Thanks to the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central, our proceedings have given the official Opposition the tantalising hope that we might defeat the Government, which reinvigorates us for a further 18 dreary months of opposition, or however long it will be until we win a general election. I shall certainly pass on the Minister's thanks to my hon. Friend the Member for Ryedale, who has gone on to higher and better things. The Committee has given me the opportunity to return briefly to the Front Bench after seven dismal years as a Back Bencher. At 4 o'clock I turn back into a pumpkin, and return to the Back Benches, but it has been very enjoyable.
<P>
I do not know whether any hon. Members attended the Channel 4 lunch yesterday, but if so, they will have seen the brilliant sketch that portrayed the Minister responsible for freedom of information resolutely refusing to give any information to anyone who asked what was going on in the Government. These Ministers are not like that; they have been eminently courteous, open and fair, and I hope that, as the Bill proceed, that approach will give us confidence that the Bill will indeed result in more information being made available to the public.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath:</B> I add my thanks to you, Mr. O'Hara, and to Dr. Clark for the way in which you have conducted our proceedings. I am grateful to you for your courtesy and firmness, which has been dealt with a velvet glove, and for your help to me personally. This is the first time that I have served on a Committee other than on the Floor of the House. Having plied my trade in foreign affairs until now, I have always dealt with matters of constitutional importance that were debated on the Floor of the House, so I have learned as I have gone along.
<P>
I also thank my colleagues on the Committee for making full use of the Committee and exploring the detail of the Bill, especially my right hon. Friend the Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross, who is disappointed not to be here today. He is dealing with some rather tragic circumstances in his constituency; otherwise he would have contributed today as he has done throughout our proceedings.
<P>
I next pay tribute to the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central. We often found ourselves in agreement. That will doubtless continue as the Bill progresses. The hon. Gentleman has played an important role So did the hon. Member for Ryedale, who has gone on to greater things in the field of sport, although the hon. Member for Gainsborough said that he becomes a pumpkin at four o'clock. I shall return to my duties as agriculture spokesman at some stage, but our debates have allowed me a splendid release from those duties.
<P>
I also pay tribute to the Parliamentary Secretary and the Under-Secretary. They have been unfailingly courteous and helpful—within the confines of their brief. I appreciate my two small, partial victories; they make me feel a little better.
<P>
In the context of freedom of information, I add a small codicil. I remind Ministers that they assured the Committee that they would provide us with the draft fees resolutions made under clause 9 before the end of the Committee stage, which is now only minutes away. We still live in hope. We also hope for a letter on the classes of non-departmental public bodies that might be included in the schedule that was promised by the Parliamentary Secretary. However, those are minor cavils.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> They will be expedited with the speed for which the Home Office is renowned.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> I rather feared that. But is that not disparaging to the departmental officials who have been extremely helpful?
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> I assure the hon. Gentleman that the only reason why the letters to which he referred have not reached him—I have already signed one of them—is that, although the extraordinary co-operation and expedition of Opposition Members during the last part of the Committee's proceedings enormously impressed us, it left us a little surprised. I assure the hon. Gentleman that he will have the letters within the week.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> I am grateful for that. I would have spoken for longer on clause 74 if I had known that the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central would arrive in the new few minutes.
<P>
We support the Bill, but it could be much better. The Committee has fully explored how it could be improved. Despite the patience and courtesy with which the Ministers have addressed our amendments, questions remain to be asked. They will now be asked on Report. I have no doubt that the Government will have to expend some energy and care in answering those questions. I am thankful, Mr. O'Hara, for the experience of having served on an extremely interesting Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> I associate myself with the gracious remarks of the Under-Secretary, which were entirely consistent with the way in which he has handled the Committee's concerns The good humour that he, the Parliamentary Secretary and the Whip have shown does them credit. It certainly has made our consideration of the Bill much more enjoyable. Even when he was tested, he was the soul of courtesy. I also associate myself with what he said about both Opposition parties.
<P>
I am amazed that this is the first Standing Committee of which the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome has been a member. He was so fluent and had mastered his brief so extremely well that it made me feel old. The proceedings of the first Committee of which I was a member took place in this very Room in 1983, when we discussed the privatisation of British Telecom. It was a different century then in almost every sense of the phrase. On that occasion, the then hon. Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme, Mr. John Golding, spoke for 11 hours. I sat beside him and he taught me the craft of being a member of a Committee, even if I have not learnt it as well as he would have wanted me to. I am sure that my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary and you, Mr. O'Hara, are glad that such an approach was not adopted during our proceedings.
<P>
I also associate myself with the hon. Gentleman's remarks about the officials who have been a source of helpfulness. I thank the Clerks, as I do the Hansard staff. I have never understood how they can make sense of incomplete sentences, illiteracies and our garbled and sometimes mumbled words but, yet again, they have triumphed over our verbal infelicities.
<P>
Finally, in musical hall terms, I thank you, Mr. O'Hara, and Dr. Clark for the very good-humoured way in which you have supervised our proceedings. I look forward to meeting the Ministers again when we discuss the Bill on Report on the Floor of House.

<B>The Chairman:</B> It is for the Chair to thank those on this side of the rostrum. I thank the Clerk to my left, who has kept me and, I am sure, my co-Chairman, in order as necessary. I thank the Hansard staff. I thank those on my right who have been seen and, in the main, not heard. I thank also those who have kept order in the Room. All have contributed to what was a good Committee stage.
<P>
When I first embarked on this Committee stage, I was minded of Juvenal's comment about how those in authority like to exercise censorship. He said that they prefer censorship which dat veniam corvis vexat censura columbas, which translates as the sort of control of information that makes life easy for the crows and makes life difficult for the doves. We would say that it makes life easy for the guys in the black hats and makes life difficult for those in the white hats. It is not for the Chair to say how much the Bill will protect the interests of the guys in the white hats or how much better those interests have been protected during the course of scrutiny in the Committee.
<P>
I echo the remarks that have been made already. Our proceedings have been conducted with unfailing courtesy, good humour and, in the main, restraint. I say ``in the main'', because I have had the unique experience of seeing the normally mild right hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross moved to anger. I am sure that that was a rare experience for all of us.
<P>
I wish to thank all the protagonists, such as the right hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross, the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome and the hon. Member for Ryedale—with whom I sat on my first Committee. His performance brought back memories. I much appreciated his comportment during the proceedings. I also thank the hon. Member for Gainsborough. I associate myself with the courteous remarks that have been made about the way in which the Ministers have carried out their duties and have behaved towards members of the Committee. Among the protagonists, although unusually on the Back Bench, I include the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central whose well-balanced and useful contributions I have unfailingly enjoyed. The Ministers listened to them, even if they did not always agree with them.
<P>
I thank other members of the Committee whom I have not mentioned, but who have contributed to our proceedings on occasions—if only by their discipline and silence. I also thank the Whips on both sides of the Committee who kept order and who made my life and that of my co-Chairman, Dr. Clark, easy and pleasurable.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Bill, as amended, to be reported.
