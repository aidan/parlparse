Bill</a></center></H3>

<P>
(Except Clauses 1, 2, 3 and 4 and Schedules 1 and 2)
<H4><center>New Clause 1</center></H4>
<H4><center>Powers of recall of the Mayor</center></H4>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>" (1) A referendum of those entitled to vote as electors at ordinary elections shall be held on whether the Mayor should be removed from office if 90 per cent. or more of the Assembly members submit a petition, or if 10 per cent. or more of those entitled to vote in the election of Mayor submit a petition to the Assembly.
<P>
(2) If, at the referendum in subsection (1) above, more than 50 per cent. of those voting support the removal from office of the Mayor, an election shall be held.".-[Mr. Simon Hughes]
<P>
Brought up, and read the First time.
<P>
Question proposed [this day], That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
</UL></FONT><H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Question again proposed.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that with this we are discussing the following: New clause 2-Assembly election if Assembly vote to remove Mayor from office-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>" (1) The Assembly may vote by a two-thirds majority to remove the Mayor from office.
<P>
(2) Following a vote to remove the Mayor from office under subsection (1) above, an election shall be held for the office of Mayor and all Assembly members".
<P>
<H4><center>New Change 7</center></H4>
Recall petition
<P>
".-The Mayor will be deemed to have been disqualified from office with immediate effect, it, if within not less than twelve months of the date of his signing the declaration of acceptance of office, a minimum of one fifth of electors, or one million electors, whichever is the smaller, entitled to vote in Greater London, shall put their names to a recall petition, the wording of which includes a demand that the Mayor should resign. Receipt of a valid petition by the Greater London returning officer, will result in the publication of notice of a new election for the Mayor, which will not preclude the candidature of the former incumbent, provided that he remains qualified to stand in that election".
<P>
<H4><center>New Clause 9</center></H4>
Impeachment of the Mayor
<P>
" (1) The Assembly shall have the power to remove the mayor from office.
<P>
(2) A resolution for removal will require the support of at least nine members of the Assembly.
<P>
(3) The Mayor will be removed from office, if the resolution for removal is supported by at least seventeen members.
<P>
(4) The criterion for removal will be that the actions of the Mayor are deemed to be harmful to the interests of the people of London,
<P>
(5) A valid resolution for removal must be followed within thirty days by a debate on the resolution in which the Mayor will be entitled to participate.
<P>
(6) If the mayor is removed from office the provisions of section 16 will apply."
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Keith Darvill </B>(Upminster): Before the lunch adjournment, I was talking about petitions in relation to recall, as proposed in new clauses 1 and 7, Such petitions would be easy to challenge in the courts and difficult to validate. For those reasons, they would be expensive and unwidely, so they should not be incorporated into the Bill.
<P>
In summary, the new clauses should be rejected. The White Paper clearly set out a new approach to the government of London which, in respect of the mayor, will be consensual. That is clearly embodied by the Bill; the new clauses would affect that balance, and therefore should be rejected.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Wilkinson </B>(Ruislip-Northwood): I shall seek to be brief. We all heard the hon. Member for Harrow, East (Mr. McNulty) with indulgence, but the Committee would not want to be indulgent twice, so I shall try to stick succinctly to the four new clauses.
<P>
The new clauses go to the heart of the democratic accountability that I hoped would have been written into the Bill. The proposers of the new clauses have admitted that none of their formulations is ideal, but, as yet, apart from two interventions from the more experienced Labour Members-the hon. Members for Brent, East (Mr. Livingstone) and for Hayes and Harlington (Mr. McDonnell)-we have had no sign that Government Members comprehend the significance of the issues at stake.
<P>
Londoners will want a mechanism which either they themselves or assembly men on their behalf can deploy to bring a book a mayor who is demonstrably failing in his duties. The mechanism of a petition with a threshold of 10 per cent. of the electorate, as advanced by the Liberal Democrats in new clause 1, is all very well, but the problem is that that initiates a referendum process, which would secure the removal of the mayor with the support of more than 50 per cent. of those voting. Our experience of local government is that turnouts can be notoriously low. Even on an issue of great controversy such as this one, we cannot be sure that the turnout would be sufficient to merit the removal of a mayor from office. I sympathise with the objective behind new clause 1, but it is insufficient in its argumentation.
<P>
New clause 2, also tabled by the Liberal Democrats, has the merit of recognising that the members of the assembly should not be mere poodles, to use the expression of the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam (Mr. Burstow)-at least I think it was him. The assembly's function is not just to scrutinise but to bring the mayor to account and, if necessary, to remove him.
<P>
I have nothing against the two-thirds majority postulated in the new clause, but I find it strange that having voted to remove the mayor, the assembly should thereby vote to remove itself. I presume that that is to stop any peverse behaviour-vindictiveness, malice or, to use the phrase that is do deplored by the Liberal party,
{**p15Z[Mr. John Wilkinson]

partisanship-by the assembly. Nevertheless, once assembly men and women have been elected to office they should stay there, particularly if they do their appropriate duty in this instance by voting to remove the mayor because he is plainly not up to the job.
<p4**}My hon. Friends the Members for Croydon, South (Mr. Ottaway) and for Solihull (Mr. Taylor) tabled new clause 7, which proposes a much higher threshold for a recall petition-some 20 per cent. of the electorate. At least that has the advantage of attempting to minimise the possibility that a political party, for example, would, for reasons of partisanship, mobilise its support against a mayor who has been duly elected. The new clause has a further merit in that it would force not a referendum but an election in which the mayor could take part. The electorate as a whole could thus reconsider his personal merits. <P>
I therefore favour new clause 7, although I have some doubts about the threshold. Those doubts were heightened by the intervention of the hon. Member for Brent, East, who described how difficult it was, even in the case of the petition that his outgoing council organised against the abolition of the GLC, to secure wide participation on the part of the public.
<P>
My right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Mr. Forth) tabled the admirable new clause 9, to which he spoke so trenchantly and cogently. To my mind, it goes to the heart of the issue.
<P>
If we want an assembly with teeth and real power, surely we will need an authority in which the mayor and assembly work together effectively for Londoners. We do not want merely a powerful chief executive; we want a team working together. We want partnership and co-operation. We do not want antagonism and discord from the beginning, particularly if the mayor is a high-profile personality who might have strong party political support-in that case, it would be more important than ever to require him or her to get along with the assembly. He or she is more likely to be induced to get along with it effectively if there is a clear mechanism for the assembly to bring the mayor to book and, if necessary, to cause his or her removal from office.
<P>
My only query on new clause 9 concerns subsection (4), which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>" The criterion for removal will be that the actions of the Mayor are deemed to be harmful to the interests of the people of London."
<P>
As usual, my right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst has gone to the heart of the matter, but in practical terms the definition is extremely wide and would be open to highly subjective interpretation. That is my only anxiety. One hopes that the assembly would be meticulous in its rigorous application of the criteria and would not stray into matters of opinion of perverse judgment.
<P>
To conclude, all the new clauses are of the greatest importance and I hope that the Government will not lightly brush them aside. If they do not respond to a willingness at least to draft a new clause or new clauses to meet the purposes behind those tabled by the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats, the Committee should divide and vote against the Government.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. John McDonnell </B>(Hayes and Harlington): Welcome back to the coal face, Mr. Stevenson.
<P>
Earlier on I was inspired-rather than provoked-by my hon. Friend the Member for Harrow, East to intervene and put my views to the record. He condemned by hon. Friend the Member for Brent, East for supporting additional checks on the mayor as an honest attempt to undermine the whole process. I do not want to embarrass my hon. Friends or any other hon. Member present, but during the past decade we have all opposed the concept of a mayor, and-except for the Minister for Sport we did so every time it was proposed by the previous Government. We came out in favour only months before the election.
<P>
Nevertheless, that is history. There was a referendum, but I do not want to comment too much on it because not all of the options were placed before the people. That is past, and our role now is to make the system work as best as it possibly can. I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Harrow, East and others will accept my suggestion, which is not made in bad faith, that we must consider carefully how to design the constitutional and strategic governance of London. It has been said that the system is completely new. That is right, and it is difficult to make comparisons with what we have and with what preceded it.
<P>
I studied under Bernard Crick, who argued that when one considers constitutions, one looks to Sir Thomas More and his construction of utopia for optimism, but to Machiavelli for pessimistic protection. Machiavelli's prince is controlled with a right of recall. The Committee should examine the definition of Machiavelli as a good republican who protects the powers of the people. We are not discussing how to ensure that a mayor who is lacking in probity is removed. The powers are in the Bill, as has been demonstrated by one of my hon. Friends. The powers of ultra vires are also there, as are the powers to remove a lunatic or a criminal.
<P>
The issue is almost a Glen Hoddle question, and concerns circumstances in which a mayor's behaviour falls short of criminal activity but warrants sufficient public opprobrium to motivate the populace to rid themelves of that mayor. The Bill contains no provision to enable the general public-the electorate of London-to do that, through whatever mechanism. The powers of recall are worth examining at some stage in the debate.
<P>
Hon. Members have asked how we should ensure that the powers are not used vexatiously. My hon. Friend the Member for Harrow, East raised that issue. We must ensure that any power of recall that is installed is not used vexatiously. We must do so by placing hurdles in the way of the exercise of that power-hurdles in the form of plateaus that have to be reached and which are sufficiently high to prevent such use of any power.
<P>
Logistically, I agree that petitions are too onerous. I was the Greater London council member responsible for organising the GLC's petition of 1 million signatures.
 <P>
My handwriting has just about recovered. That petition, which was legitimate, incurred the problems mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Harrow, East in respect of other mechanisms in that it took too long. Currently, we could be in for a year-long process of uncertainty and doubt.
<P>
That is why the onus should rest on the assembly. We can strengthen its powers of scrutiny by ensuring that it has a form of recall. I favour the proposal requiring the vote of two thirds of assembly members, which should apply to all assembly members rather than jut those in attendance at any one time. If the assembly members provoke the use of a right of recall, the question should be put to the people, but there should be equal risk to assembly members and to the mayor. That is why I favour the calling of a general election if a recall mechanism is implemented.
<P>
The general election mechanism would overcome the problems of the length of the process, which could be performed within six to eight weeks. Such a mechanism would also make it easier, because it would enable the arguments to be focused through debate in the assembly and through engagement with the general public. That would occur during a general election period, with the mayor standing again if he or she so wished and with the assembly representatives also being able to put their argument through the ballot box. That is why I urge my hon. Friends to reconsider the matter. I shall not, at this stage, oppose my party by voting for the new clauses, but I think that further debate will be needed as the Bill progresses. I hope that at a later stage the assembly's powers, and thereby those of the people, will be strengthened, so that any misuse or abuse of power by a directly elected mayor can be corrected in a way that does not undermine the mayor's strength or authority in acting on behalf of London.

<P>

<B>Mr. John Randall </B>(Uxbridge): Once again, I find myself endorsing the comments of my constituency neighbour, the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington. I am sure that that will not further enhance his credibility.
<P>
Members of the Committee have been told that the principle involved in the new clause is that of democratic accountability. I was sorry to hear that the hon. Member for Harrow, East believes that Opposition Members' desire for democratic accountability is insincere. Having heard his views on democracy on several occasions, in Committee and in the Chamber, I expect that we will be told again that, because the Bill is the work of the Government, everything in it is wonderful per se and should be agreed to en masse. That worries me greatly. If that is how one has to behave to gain preferment, I am looking forward to a long career on the Back Benches.
<P>
We have heard from the left and the right, and even from the nebulous area inhabited by the Liberal Democrats. Following this morning's perambulations into Tokyo's city policies, perhaps I should call them the bonsai party-the party that likes to stunt growth.
<P>
I suspect that the petition idea is unworkable, and I favour the new clause tabled by my right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst. If the Government are minded to look again at the issue of accountability, I shall be happy; otherwise, I shall vote for new clause 9.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike Gapes </B>(Ilford, South): I, too, welcome you back to the Committee, Mr. Stevenson. I am sure that this will not be the last time that you return.
<P>
I begin by talking about petitions. Those hon. Members who have been Members of Parliament for a number of years know that it is easy for people to go down the street and collect signatures on petitions about all kinds of subjects. In my constituency, I have been presented with many petitions about issues of local concern-against a new bus route, for example. Soon after the establishment of that bus route, I began to hear people saying how marvellous it was.
<P>
I am concerned about the proposals for petitions. A group of dedicated fanatics, obsessives and anoraks could quite easily dedicate their entire campaigning activity as a political party, for a period of weeks or months, to trying to generate enough signatures to trigger a mechanism whereby they could effectively destroy the entire concept of the mayoral and assembly dual partnership. Perhaps that would be what they really wanted-we have known all along that the Liberal Democrats were not in favour of having a mayor but favoured an assembly without a mayor. Maybe this is part two of their plan to achieve that, following their defeat in last year's referendum.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon </B><P>
Hughes (Southwark, North and Bermondsey): The hon. Gentleman can be as rude as he likes, but he should be factually correct. The Liberal Democrats have always been in favour of the election of a mayor, but one that is chosen from the assembly in the same way that leaders are chosen from councils.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gapes:</B> I find that interesting. I had not noticed any great enthusiasm from the Liberal Democrats for the idea of a mayor, but perhaps that is because I do not read their publications too closely.
<P>
Under what circumstances might the recall mechanism be necessary? We have been told that they might include criminal activity. Who is to determine whether certain activity is criminal? Surely that is a matter for the police, the Crown Prosecution Service and the courts-the judiciary and the jury. It is not a matter for Liberal Democrat activists who want to trigger petitions to determine whether somebody is responsible for criminal activity. We already have laws that ban people from holding public office if they are subject to a criminal charge or conviction. As my hon. Friend the Member for Upminster (Mr. Darvill) said, it is a matter for the courts.
<P>
What would central Government be doing while whoever was mayor was bringing the office into disrepute? I cannot imagine for one moment that a Government of whatever political complexion would want the mayor of its capital city to be corrupt, mad or any of the other things that have been mentioned.
<P>
<B>Mr. Randall:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gapes:</B> In a moment.
<P>
I, too, want the Government to investigate the matter further. I am concerned that there should be safeguards
{**p15Z[Mr. Gapes]

<p4**}not only for the residents of London, but for the general well-being of society. For example, if the residents of London elected the Shiv Sena candidate or a candidate from some other extremist group, I would have great concerns about harmony and the relationships between communities in the city. Similarly, if government in London was run by an extreme group-none is represented in this Room-that was dedicated to providing services, transport and other facilities for only a minority in our city, there would need to be safeguards to ensure that provision was made for Londoners as a whole. <P>
These are difficult issues. If people are elected, they have a democratic mandate. The judgment as to whether activities are contrary to the general well-being is difficult. The petition model does not, however, provide us with a way forward because there could be frivolous petitions and because of the time scale involved. It might be many months before we could deal with a problem because we would have to get signatures for the petitions to trigger the process. I would rather that we examined the relationship between central Government, the mayoralty and the assembly or the assembly itself. The ideas that have been proposed for a petition are, however ridiculous. I hope that, on reflection, the Liberal Democrats will withdraw their new clause.
<P>
<B>The Minister for London and Construction (Mr. Nick Raynsford):</B> I am pleased to have the opportunity to respond to what has been a wide-ranging and detailed debate on the four new clauses.
<P>
The new clauses provide for the removal of a mayor from office in certain circumstances. On the surface, that might appear to be a desirable and sensible objective. As I intend clearly to demonstrate, however, the recall mechanisms that are set out in the new clauses contain serious inherent defects, which make then undesirable and impractical.
<P>
The Government will not support any of the new clauses. In taking that view, we are not, as the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Wilkinson) suggested, setting them aside lightly. On the contrary, we have carefully considered the principle of accountability to ensure that the mechanism that we put in place enables London to enjoy good, efficient and proper government, and is not paralysed by conflict and unnecessary divisions between different parts of the Greater London authority.
<P>
New clause 1 provides for a referendum that can lead to the forced removal of the mayor. New clauses 2 and 9 would enable the mayor to be removed from office by the assembly, while new clause 7 provides for a recall petition, which would trigger fresh mayoral elections.
<P>
The fundamental premise underpinning new clauses 2 and 9 is flawed. It is that the assembly's mandate is in some way superior to that of the mayor. The Liberal Democrats, who tabled new clause 2, have always opposed the idea of a mayor separately elected from the assembly; they want asembly members to be in the driving seat. I understand their logic, but it is inconsistent with our model for a separately elected mayor with a separate mandate to the assembly. To give the assembly a power to remove the mayor would destroy the balance between the two elements in the Greater London authority that we have carefully constructed. For that reason, the new clauses proposed by the Liberal Democrats are inappropriate and impractical. If the people of London have decided that they want to elect a mayor, how can it be right for the members of an assembly of only 25 people-whether the majority is two thirds or 90 per cent.-to decide that they do not want the mayor to continue in office?
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I understand the Minister's argument, although I disagree with it. He is now coming to the second part of the argument. The logic of what he has just said is that the people, separately, choose the mayor, so the people, separately, should be able to remove the mayor.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> Absolutely. That is fundamental to our approach, which is why we do not believe it appropriate for the assembly to be able to trigger the removal of the mayor.
<P>
<B>Mr. Eric Forth </B>(Bromley and Chislehurst): There is surely another key difference. Notwithstanding the fact that circumstances can change dramatically during a mayor's term of office-the basis on which most of the argument has so far rested, and which must surely be dealt with by the Minister-the assembly is different in kind because of the possibility of by-elections, at least in part. They would give people the opportunity to express their view through the ballot box during the course of an assembly's term of office. No such opportunity exists heretofore in the Bill as far as the mayor is concerned, and that is what we are trying to get at.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> If by-elections are held for the assembly, the people of London will express their view of their representatives on the assembly. But we are also creating a single mayoral post, and while the mayor remains in office, it is inconceivable that there can be a by-election for that post. The mechanisms that are being proposed to allow that to happen would inevitably mean interrupting the mandate that has been given by the people of London to the mayor in the first and subsequent general elections.
<P>
I put it to the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst that the hon. Member for Croydon, South has tabled a new clause that would allow a recall procedure involving a petition, but only within the first 12 months following the election of a mayor.
<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Ottaway </B>(Croydon, South): It is the other way round.

<P>

<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> After 12 months? So they could not apply in the first 12 months. If in the first 12 months there can be no recall, that makes the whole thing even more curious, because it creates an arbitrary barrier.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> We will take it away if the hon. Gentleman wants.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The hon. Gentleman is, from a sedentary position, giving me all the ammunition I could want. What is the basis for that arbitrary one-year peiod? Why should something be satisfactory in the first 12
 <P>
months, but unsatisfactory subsequently? If the mayor is unfit for office, why does that become clear only after 12 months have elapsed?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The Minister can have fun about barriers, and so on. However, there is a principle here, which embraces what has been said by my right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst, Liberal Democrat Members and me. I should be grateful if the Minister could deal with the principle of a check and balance on the mayor.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> With the greatest respect, I was doing precisely that until I accepted interventions from the hon. Gentleman's colleagues and was led into different territory. I will now return to the principle, which I regard as the most important part of this debate.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Harrow, East provided the Committee with clear evidence of his considerable knowledge of the operation of American systems of mayoral government. He demonstrated that those processes, which exist in different forms in some American states allowing recall, can be perverted for inappropriate purposes, or take so long to carry through that they nullify the whole purpose of the exercise. If the next general election of the mayor were to occur before such a process were resolved, a nonsense would clearly be made of that process.
<P>
I do not believe that we should introduce into this country fundamentally flawed mechanisms, which are capable of attracting lengthy litigation and which allow the sort of problems that are currently being experienced in the United States. The impeachment process has been brought into total disrepute by the partisan way in which the Republicans are trying to attack the elected President of the United States, who clearly commands the support of the people of the United States. There could not be a clearer illustration of the danger of importing such ill-thought-through impeachment or recall procedures, which allow people to challenge and try to unseat a person who has been democratically elected by the people.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Brooke </B>(Cities of London and Westminster): I am not quite clear whether the Minister is arguing that the charge of perjury against the President is one that should be disregarded. He may say that that charge will follow its natural course in terms of the rest of the proceedings-although that poses the risk of the President becoming a lame duck official. Does the Minister disregard the perjury charge in the present proceedings in the United States?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I am not disregarding the charge, but it is extremely difficult, as the right hon. Gentleman will know only too well, to define "high crimes and misdemeanours". Whether the President of the United States is guilty of a high crime and misdemeanour is at the nub of the whole debate that is continuing in America.
<P>
I remind the right hon. Gentleman that the Bill provides specifically that a mayor who has been convicted of a criminal offence and sentenced to a period of imprisonment of three months or more shall be automatically removed from office. We have introduced real safeguards, which do not exist in many American counterparts-the mayor of Washington, who has been referred to many times, was allowed to continue in office despite being a convicted drug dealer, which we do not believe was appropriate. We do not wish to encourage a framework such as that in America, where a partisan group in the Congress is using the impeachment procedure to attack a President, whose policies they do not like, on grounds that look spurious and thin to the outside world.
<P>
<B>Mr. McDonnell:</B> For the record, it is correct to say that the problems being experienced by the President of the United States, which are causing gridlock, are being caused by a vexatious group within Congress and the Senate who are trying to bring him down or destroy his reputation. The problem of the American system is that the President does not have the power to go to the people to ask for his mandate to be renewed. The new clauses that suggest a general-election-type process for the assembly and the mayor would provide the mayor with the opportunity to go to the people to renew his mandate if he was faced with a vexatious challenge to his power.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I hear what my hon. Friend says, but I am not convinced that a procedure that allows a mayor or-to use another parallel-party leader to seek a further mandate in mid-office to boost his or her position is necessarily a happy example. I think of the right hon. Member for Huntingdon (Mr. Major) and his manoeuvres during the course of the previous Parliament. That is not necessarily a constructive  precedent, and we would not necessarily wish to follow it.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster correctly highlighted the unhappy precedent for impeachment in this country. He referred to the case of Melville and the damage that it caused to good government in the middle of the conflict with Napoleon in the early 19th century. In entertaining the Committee with some interesting doggerel, he educated me by explaining that the reference to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>" Across the wires, the electric message came"
<P>
was delivered not on the death of Queen Victoria but on that of King Edward VII. That reminded me of another piece of doggerel that arose from the death of Queen Victoria, which I cannot resist quoting. One of her subjects in the far-flung bounds of the empire wrote:
<P>
" Dust to dust, ashes to ashes, into the grave the great Queen dashes."
<P>
To return to the matter in hand, the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam demonstrated a curious ambivalence. He described his attempts to set up meetings to explain the Bill to his constituents but, by revealing to us that he does not understand it, he has called into question the validity of those sessions. To imply that the assembly has no real power to change the budget is a distortion of reality. The assembly has real power to change the budget, and that important power will hold the mayor to account. His power to act will be very much circumscribed by the assembly.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Paul Burstow </B>(Sutton and Cheam): I want to make it clear that the mayor dictates policy. The
{**p15Z[Mr. Paul Burstow]

<p4**}assembly has no means to change policy, nor does it have the ability to change the capital programme. Its power in respect of the revenue budget is so circumscribed as to make it almost impractical. <P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The hon. Gentleman's position is extraordinary. His party supports the proposal for a recall that is based on a vote of three quarters of the assembly's members. But he is saying that if three quarters of the assembly's members vote against the budget, they do not have the power to change it. That is simply wrong. They do have the power to change it. The hon. Gentleman is inconsistent, which further reinforces my point that he does not follow or understand the Bill.
<P>
The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey (Mr. Hughes) expressed concern about what might happen if a mayor goes off the rails. As I said in relation to criminal action-this is also the case for other misdemeanours-specific safeguards are in place. It was interesting-this demonstrated the Liberal Democrats' prejudice-that the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey did not for a moment think about the possibility of what would happen if the assembly went off the rails. The Liberal Democrats do not believe that that could happen because the assembly is bound to be a virtuous and benevolent body, and only the mayor could be wrong.
<P>
The behaviour of the majority in the United States Senate shows that it is possible for bodies of democratically elected representatives collectively to go off the rails and to behave in an irrational and foolish way. Assembly members, and not necessarily the mayor, could cause serious problems.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I do not know whether that argument is the Minister's or his civil servants', but it is ludicrous. By definition, the mayor is one person; the assembly has 25 people. The statistical chance of the mayor going off the rails is clearly 25 times more likely than the assembly collectively going off the rails. Of course the assembly might do things that the Minister disagrees with, but his argument is like saying that Parliament might go off the rails. Some of us trust 25 people more than we trust one.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The hon. Gentleman's argument would not command confidence if advanced in relation to what is happening in America. If the question is whether Republican Members of Congress or Bill Clinton have gone off the rails, it is clear who most sensible-minded people would think have brought their constitution into jeopardy through an ill-considered and frivolous use of the impeachment process. That is the responsibility of a number of people, not an individual.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> One more response. The Minister's example is not the right one. The process in the United States is triggered by a simple majority. There is no simple majority trigger in the new clauses that we have tabled, or in any of the others. Ultimately, the President can be impeached only by a qualified majority of two thirds. We have argued for a 90 per cent. requirement. As my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey) put it, should there be mutual destruction, we have argued for a two-thirds requirement. We have never argued for a simple majority.

<P>

<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The hon. Gentleman is sliding away from his argument. A moment ago, he argued that the individual is inherently more likely to go off the rails than is the group. I put it to him that there is a contemporary practical example of the group, rather than the individual, going off the rails. He declined to answer that point, which clearly indicates the force of his logic.
<P>
The debate has demonstrated weaknesses and inherent defects in all the models for recall procedures that the Opposition have put forward. We heard about the problems of defining what might be a harmful policy. That argument forms part of the new clause tabled by the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst, which depends on the assembly defining a harmful policy.
<P>
During the early 1980s, when the Greater London council was seeking to introduce the fares fair policy, many representatives of local Bromley communities did not like it and took legal action against it. In their view, it constituted a harmful policy. I assume that the hon. Gentleman thinks that the Bromley representatives were right.
<P>
That is a classic example of how, if that power were to be created, people would have the scope to trigger the procedure to challenge the mayor's existence, simply on the basis of their views on the merits or demerits of a particular policy. That demonstrates that the power would be open to abuse, and that the process of good government in London could be brought into disrepute by such small-scale disputes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> I am, as ever, grateful to the Minister. He will have noted that new clause 9 makes the modest proposal that the resolution for removal would require the support of at least nine members of the assembly, and that the removal of the mayor would require the support of at least 17 members. That is an attempt to deal with precisely the matter that the Minister has rightly identified. Even if Bromley were to be outraged at what was going on, Bromley members alone-perhaps to my slight regret-could not trigger the process, but would require the support of a significant number of members from other parts of London. I put it to the Minister that, although it might not be entirely adequate, that would be a safety mechanism.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The point that I was making was about the difficulty of defining "harmful"so that it applies only to "high crimes and misdemeanours" , for example, and cannot therefore be used as a mechanism to oppose virtually any policy proposed by the mayor. That is the right hon. Gentleman's difficulty.
<P>
On the issue of numbers, in different circumstances it will obviously be possible for a majority of the assembly-whether of 75 per cent. or 90 per cent.-to find against the mayor. The possibility has been advanced that an independent might be elected mayor. By definition, that person would have no party support in the assembly. If a coalition of hostile party interests in the assembly were to confront such a mayor, those interests could trigger the procedures. The people of London, having elected one mayor, could find their
 <P>
decision overturned by a group of people in the assembly who were elected on a separate mandate. That is the danger of giving the assembly the power to override the decision of the people of London.
<P>
There are serious problems associated with petitions. Given the number of names that a petition would require, how could they be verified? My hon. Friend the Member for Harrow, East rightly highlighted the situation in British Columbia, where it has proved difficult to verify relatively few names on a petition. I put it to those hon. Members who have proposed petitions that it is a recipe for conflict and litigation. Inevitably, it would be easy to find a frivolous, Mickey Mouse name among the 500,000 on a petition intended to satisfy the 10 per cent. rule, or an address that was not a London address. That would be open to legal challenge, and by the time that the legal processes had exhausted themselves we should no doubt have reached the next general election.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I hear the Minister's argument, but people in many places in the world have thought through the problem and come to a perfectly adequate answer. The Minister's argument clearly does not stand up to examination. We could use the same verification system that the Government clearly think is adequate for people who vote at elections: people could be required to go to a local authority office, where they would be checked off against the electoral roll. They would give their address and the same particulars as are currently sufficient to allow them to vote. If the Minister is suggesting that a referendum or petition should use a different procedure from that used for voting, I should be interested to hear about it. I stress that it is the Government's system that we currently use for voting.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The hon. Gentleman is obviously not familiar with his new clause, which refers not to a referendum beign conducted by the mayor but to a petition. The petition would no doubt be hawked around by Liberal Democrat activists and councillors, who would gather names wherever they could. They would try to convince the rest of us that they somehow have solid support for their proposals.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Ilford, South (Mr. Gapes) rightly referred to the unreliability of many such petitions. I hope that the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey recognises that a petition of that scale, which would involve 500,000 names, is bound to be open to challenge in one way or another. If the hon. Gentleman thinks that a mayor who is threatened with removal from office would not use lawyers to challenge the process, he reveals naivety in the extreme about the way in which politics works in practice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> The Minister displays surprising paranoia about the ability of Liberals to secure a petition of 500,000 people, although we would rist to that challenge. He makes no allowances for a more official system, and he possibly fails to understand my point. The petition could be collected if the people who wanted to sign it went to officially approved places to do so, where they would be verified during elections. There would be no hawking around the streets and no standing at railway stations. The petition would be gathered in a perfectly proper way. If one wanted to be safe, one would collect a few more than 500,000 signatures, so that there would be a few spare names in case they were needed. The petition would have just as much-or as little-likelihood of challenge as every election in this country.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The hon. Gentleman says that, but it is not what his new clause says. If he is proposing a new mechanism, he will have to explain who will pay for it. Who will pay to establish all the polling stations? The new clause, which he has obviously forgotten since he tabled it, requires the names of
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>" 10 per cent. or more of those entitled to vote in the election of Mayor to submit a petition".
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. John M. Taylor </B>(Solihull): Quite inadvertently, the Minister misled the Committee in his reference to polling stations-surely they would be called petition stations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a good point and reveals the nonsense of the Liberal Democrats' proposal.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Dismore </B>(Hendon): does my hon. Friend agree with my experience when submitting nomination papers? They have to be submitted in a particular way-they have to be signed and include a name, polling district and polling number. They are carefully scrutinised and it takes a long time to verify the relatively few names that are involved. To talk of verifying 500,000 names is rediculous. Has my hon. Friend also considered the fact that the petition could be signed by people who may not be qualified to do so, including, for example, alien nationals and Members of another place?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> My hon. Friend makes an extremely good point. Anyone who has gone through the process of submitting nomination papers, which all Members of the House have done, knows that in order to prevent their being challenged great care has to be taken to ensure that they are absolutely accurate. If that is the case with 10 nominations, what would it be like with 500,000?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gapes:</B> Has my hon. Friend given any thought to the resources that would be required if each of the constituencies in Greater London-and, presumably, in all the libraries and post offices and other places in which the electoral register is currently available-had to have a person available just in case a Liberal Democrat activist happened to turn up on a particular day with some names that he wanted to submit to a petition? Have the Government been able to calculate the on-going cost of employing such a system and, if they have, how much of the budget of the Greater London Authority will be spent on it?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> My hon. Friend makes an extremely good point. The Government have not calculated the cost because we have no intention of accepting the new clause. I do not imagine that the Liberal Democrats bothered to consider the cost either before bringing forward their fanciful proposal.
<P>
I find the Conservatives' proposal in new clause 7 somewhat odd. The clause would allow a minority of voters to dismiss a mayor, but on what grounds-because those voters did not agree with the
 {**p15Z[Mr. Raynsford]

<p4**}decision of the majority? That is a ludicrous proposition. Of course, it is an invitation to a party that thinks that it will lose an election to try to gather together during the election the requisite number of signatures to produce a petition to get rid of the mayor, whom it was not able to defeat in a proper election. That would be an entirely perverse process and not something that we would wish to encourage. <P>
I must remind the Committee, as did my hon. Friend the Member for Upminster, that the normal disqualification provisions governing the conduct of local authority members will apply to the mayor. The mayor will have to stand down-he will not be invited to stand down, but will have to stand down-if he or she is convicted of any offence or is sentenced to more than three months' imprisonment. That is a very clear safeguard against the sort of events that occurred in Washington, referred to earlier in the debate, which allowed a convicted criminal to continue in office as mayor.
<P>
Furthermore, the mayor will have to stand down if he or she is adjudged bankrupt, is disqualified under part III of the Representation of the People Act 1991 or is disqualified under sections 17 or 18 of the Audit Commission Act 1998. That is an appropriate framework, which will ensure that when the mayor has done wrong, he or she can be removed from office-not when the mayor has done something that members of the assembly do not like, but when the mayor has done something that is demonstrably wrong. In addition, the mayor will have to justify all of his or her actions to the assembly, which will ensure that the mayor is open to public scrutiny and criticism on a regular basis.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Hayes and Harlington quoted Machiavelli. I was not entirely sure about the purpose of the quotation because I doubt very much whether Machiavelli would advise his prince to have a recall mechanism in place to enable his citizens to remove him from office.

<P>

<B>Mr. McDonnell:</B> The tragedy is that Machiavelli has been much misunderstood. To clarify, "The Prince"was written as a republican statement. It is a warning to the populace and all those who support the republic, and describes how to keep a prince in check. One of his recommendations is to trust the people and have a right of recall that relies on the voice of the people being heard.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I agree wholeheartedly with the fundamental principle put forward by my hon. Friend, which is that one should trust the people. When the people of London have elected a mayor, no one other than the people of London should remove the mayor from office. We are determined to support that principle.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I want the Minister to continue in the same vein as that in which he began to reply to the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington. The people elect the mayor and the people should be allowed to get rid of the mayor. Does the Minister propose any option whereby the people of London can get rid of their mayor other than at the end of the four-year fixed term?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> No. I have made it clear that the appropriate mechanisms should ensure the removal from office of a mayor who has done wrong, but that, otherwise, the mayor should be in office at the pleasure of the people. That will be subject to a decision at a fixed term, four years after the first election. In the meantime, the mayor will be subject to intense scrutiny, which is fundamental to the Bill. We believe that democratic accountability is, and should be, at the heart of the Bill.
<P>
The mayor will have to report to regular monthly meetings of the assembly and will face a people's question time twice a year and a state of London debate once a year. The mayor will be held to account by the London media; the Evening Standard, television and radio programmes and local newspapers will all scrutinise the mayor's activities. There will be an enormous amount of information and the mayor will know only too well that if he or she does not get a good press, there will be less likelihood of re-election. The mayor will be under immense pressure to maintain good government.
<P>
The mayor's power to act will depend crucially on the budget, which must be approved by the assembly, although Liberal Democrat Members do not seem to appreciate that part of the constitution. When we come to the relevant clauses, I shall remind them of the specific powers that we are giving to the assembly. We do not intend to make the mayor vulnerable to malicious, party politically motivated conspiracies by small, unrepresentative groups which simply want to remove someone who has been elected by the people of London.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Brent, East rather curiously gave the example of the removal of his predecessor as leader of the Labour group on the former Greater London Council. I fear that his example does not support his case that someone who has lost the confidence of his or her colleagues should be removed from office. The unfortunate Lord McIntosh, who was then Andrew McIntosh, had no opportunity to demonstrate his capabilities either as leader of the former Greater London Council or to the people of London. He was removed-
<P>
<B>Mr. McDonnell:</B> There is a good precedent, because my hon. Friend the Member for Brent, East regularly lost votes of no confidence, but was not removable. During the final period of the former Greater London Council the people of London might have welcomed a general election of some sort.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I seem to recall-my memory is no longer as sharp as it was because time has elapsed-that a number of members of the former Greater London Council put themselves forward for re-election during the council's final year and received a strong endorsement from the people of London, but that was against the background of a different argument about the use of arbitrary power by central Government to remove a democratic structure.
<P>
My point is that recall mechanisms cannot avoid the risk of a small group of people, who may or may not be representative, acting in a way that overrides the view of the entire London electorate. We must keep that in mind. We want the people of London to be sovereign. A mayor who fails should be removed by the people of London. A
 <P>
mayor who commands the confidence of the people of London should not be subject to removal by a group of people in the assembly who are simply trying to wield a political axe against that mayor. The mayor should be in office at the pleasure of the people of London, not a party caucus or the majority in the assembly.
<P>
The amendments would not achieve the clarity and accountability of the people of London which is at the heart of the Bill. I ask the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey to withdraw his amendment and the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst and the hon. Member for Croydon, South not to press their amendments. If they do not, I urge my hon. Friends to oppose them on Division.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I believe that there will come a time in the Minister's life when he will regret that speech. He justified his rejection of the amendment by saying that the Bill contains adequate safeguards. He said that if the mayor were convicted of an offence and sentenced to three months in prison, he would be removed; but two months in prison is all right. He said that if the mayor were made bankrupt, he would be removed. I do not know whether the Minister has had any experience of bankruptcy matters, but I have in my professional life. I know that it can take much longer than the mayor's period of office to make someone bankrupt.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman said that the mayor would be open to scrutiny, but when responding to the Liberal Democrats' new clause he said that the assembly will be inferior to the mayor and that it was not intended to keep the mayor in check. Those were the words that he used. He not only said that, for a variety of reasons, there was no need to have the new clauses; he also made it clear that there was no desire to have them, and that lack of desire is a weakness. I believe that there should be a mechanism to keep the mayor in check. The Minister says that our amendments lack clarity, which is always the last refuge of a Minister. There is an important principle here which the Minister has rejected and, as a result, we shall press new clause 7 to a vote.
<P>
5.30 pm
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> I regret that the Minister has not even made a move to say that he will consider the arguments advanced not only by Opposition Members but by some of his hon. Friends. Having listened carefully to what he said, I do not believe that he has given sufficient reason to reject the substance of the new clauses with the totality that he has. I would rather the Minister had said that he would reflect on these matters and consider carefully over a period with his advisers what had been said in Committee, in order to judge the value of the arguments that we have heard.
<P>
Nevertheless, having listened to what he has said, I shall not press new clause 9 to a vote, because I want to think further on the matter to see what can be done later in our deliberations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> I regret that my right hon. Friend will not press his new clause, but that is a matter for him. I regard the exchanges that have taken place on the new clauses this morning and this afternoon as the saddest part of the Committee's proceedings to date. They demonstrate an arrogance on the part of Her Majesty's Government that is alien to our democratic tradition, which is to have a system of effective checks and balances to ensure that, in the words of one of my right hon. or hon. Friends, no municipal potentate emerges. If the Government insist on voting down the new clauses, there will be no mechanism to ensure that such a personality does not emerge.
<P>
The Minister gave the impression in his remarks-I hope that he will reconsider them-that to imagine that the assembly had a genuine function of accountability was somehow flawed. What is the purpose of the assembly if not to ensure that there is no possibility of an abuse of power by a mayor? There is genuine electoral equivalence between the authority vested in the mayor and the authority vested in the assembly. Both are elected on the same day, both are elected by the same electorate and both are elected for the same term of office. Furthermore, the 11 assemblymen who are London members can rightly view themselves as having a London-wide perspective, just as has the mayor. It would be very difficult to secure sufficient constituency members, in alliance with London-wide ones, to secure the 90 per cent. demanded by the Liberal new clause-the 23 votes for the impeachment, for want of a better word, of the mayor.
<P>
The Minister traduced his argument further by alluding to the proceedings in the Senate of the United States of America. There, par excellence, if an example of a Congress of the United States in both its houses seeking to fulfil its duty on behalf of its electors to ensure that an over-mighty President does not abuse his powers and commit perjury or seek to pervert the course of justice.
<P>
There could be many instances when, in the conduct of business, the mayor abused his powers without perpetrating criminal behaviour. Yet in all conscience it wouldd be clear to those assemblymen, particularly in view of the representations that their constituents, one hopes, will make to them, asking them to do their duty and call the mayor to account. I have no quotation to strengthen my argument, certainly none comparable to any that the Committee-man-laureate, my right hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London Westminster, could invoke.
<P>
Time and Londoners will be our judges. I hope that all will be well and that the mayor-for example, the independent mayor with no party connections, as postulated by the Minister can be reined in and induced to conform with the norms of democratic behaviour so that there is no question that he will exceed his powers.
<P>
Human nature is what it is. Individuals will be elected with a mandate from more than 5 million people and with all the adulation of the media that goes with such high office. Therefore, it is imperative that we have the means to require the mayor to relinquish office if he does not conform to the democratic traditions that I prayed in aid at the beginning of my remarks.
<P>
It is a sad day. I hope that my hon. Friends on the Front Bench and the Liberal Democrats will decide to press their new clauses. I am sad that my right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst has chosen not to
[Mr. Wilkinson]

<p>press his. However, I am sure that he has made that choice-as he explained in his remarks-not because his argument is weak, but in the hope that the Government will think again. He recognises, as we all do, that none of the new clauses are perfect. However, we all hope, against experience, that the Government will do the honest thing and seek to introduce new measures, perhaps on report, that will put the democratic deficit to right.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I hope that my hon. Friend will not be too disappointed but I do not intend to press my new clause. I believe that the matter is very important, deserves wider airing and should be debated on Report.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> It is interesting that this little debate in this little Committee Room has received quite wide attention outside. It has done so because those who report our proceedings judge that the issue is important for London. My hon. Friend the Member for Kingston and Surbiton referred to the writers of the American constitution. Our task is not as big as that, but the Committee is writing the new London government constitution. To protect people against what is unlikely, but not impossible, is a hugely important part of constitution writing. The hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood put that point extremely well.
<P>
Of course, we hope that every person who is elected as mayor from the time that the Greater London authority comes into being, does his or her job impeccably, honourably and honestly. However, on occasions, that has not been the experience around the world and it may not be the experience with the authority. Behaviour that is considered inappropriate cannot be legislated against.
<P>
It troubled me that, in the middle of the good and wide-ranging contributions made by many colleagues on the Committee, we heard a revelation from the hon. Member for Ilford, South. He expressed the Government's whole approach to the subject more clearly that we had heard before. That gave me and my hon. Friends great concern.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman said that perhaps the issue should be left to the Government to sort out and that no Government would allow any mayor to go off the rails. I say, once and for all, that we are creating a body that should be free of Government, one that is meant to be the London government elected by and accountable to the people of London. It should absolutely not be at the behest of the Secretary of State, who should have no power to intervene even if the mayor went completely off the rails. It is for Londoners to decide, not the Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gapes:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman now saying that local authorities in the United Kingdom should not be subject in extremis to action by central Government? Or is he saying that he is advocating not a local authority or even a city government but a unilateral declaration of independence, and the secession of London from the rest of the UK?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> We could get into a long debate, but I will stay within the remit of the Bill. The hon. Gentleman and I are clearly in different parties for good reason. Some of us believe in a federal Britain, in devolving power in a way that does not allow central Government to take it back. Some of us do not believe in capping local councils and holding local government by the short and curlies. Some of us believe in allowing local government to raise its own revenue, and allowing regional government to exist in England and to raise its own revenue.
<P>
We reject absolutely the hon. Gentleman's view that local government-or regional government if it were ever to be created by his Government, although I doubt whether it would be, because they would be terribly nervous of it-should be a poodle of the Government of the day. That is why we are not socialists, not believers in the municipal state, not centralists or believers in central power. That is why the Liberal Democrats are in opposition to the Government.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am listening with great interest to the hon. Gentleman's speech, but I wonder whether we have drifted too far into a discussion of political philosophy rather than the new clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I would never drift further than you would allow me to, Mr. Stevenson. I was talking in a London context about London issues and about the Bill. The hon. Gentleman betrayed the serious point that is so evident-that the fingerprints, footprints, and the grasp of the Secretary of State and his minion Minsters are all over the Bill. That is why we are so strongly of the same view as Conservative members of the Committee on the matter.
<P>
The Minister took a position in relation to the power of the assembly to trigger a referendum. He was right: our view is different from his. We have never wanted a directly elected mayor. We argued that the mayor should come from, be accountable to, and be able to be sacked by the assembly. We lost that argument. The referendum-[Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. There are far too many little meetings going on on both sides of the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> We did not lose the argument intellectually; we lost it because the Government would not allow a proper vote on those issues in the referendum. As other hon. Members have said, if they had put all the questions to the people, there might well have been a different result.
<P>
I can understand the Minister's argument, however, which is, "We don't think that the assembly should have the power to kick out the mayor". We differ, but it is an honourable difference. I expected to hear the Minister make a philosophical and political case against the people's being able to exercise the power of recall. Was there such an argument? There was not, not even a sentence of one. In fact, the only arguments deployed on that issue were arguments in support of our proposition, which is that if the people choose, they should have the right to remove.
<P>
Using the Machiavellian example, the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington warned us that there is a danger in giving uncontrolled power to an individual. We are arguing that exact point, and our argument is clear. We
 <P>
have put an alternative in new clause 1, and another in new clause 2, about which my hon. Friend the Member for Sutton and Cheam spoke and to which I shall return. If the people choose the mayor, the people should be allowed to get rid of the mayor, even if the Government do not like the idea that the assembly should be able to do so.
<P>
The Minister misrepresented my hon. Friend the Member for Sutton and Cheam (Mr. Burstow)-I was here for the whole of his contribution. We have read the Bill; we understand that the assembly has a power over the budget. However, my hon. Friend's argument was that the balance of power in the Greater London authority is with the mayor, as the Government has always wished. They have made no secret of it. We understand their position, but we disagree with it.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The restraints placed on the mayor-he may have to negotiate, bargain and sometimes lose arguments about the budget; a restraint is placed on him by the Audit Commission; and he cannot serve a prison sentence of more than a certain length and remain in office-are not enough. I understand that under the Bill the mayor could attend a meeting of the authority twice in each year of his four-year term of office, and that is enough. Ministers may inform me if I am wrong. We have tabled amendments to change that, and to require more frequent attendance. However, under the Bill, the mayor could turn up twice a year-a state visit to the Greater London authority, whose headquarters I hope will be based in Southwark, where he would be very well received-and then he could go away.
<P>
I am not talking about criminal behaviour alone. I shall give the Committee a topical example. Let us imagine that the mayor of London unquestionably stated that disabled people were disabled as a result of their actions in a previous life. It is not a sin to say that, yet sufficient numbers of Londoners without a party political axe to grind might feel that the mayor should not continue in office. If that was the mayor's unmitigated view-if that extreme and explicit view was expressed-I believe that there would be uproar. But the Minister says, "No, I am sorry; if the mayor decided to stay, the mayor would stay". The people should not be powerless in those circumstances; they should have the power to say, "We want to do something about it."
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> In a speech of great eloquence clearly directed towards a wider audience-perhaps beyond London-the hon. Gentleman seems to have omitted to mention the potential for a mayor to continue to enjoy private interests while serving as a mayor. He could be a director of a company, he could have massive shareholdings, he could have all sorts of potentially conflicting interests. In my judgment, the mayor should have to forswear all those interests, as a Minister of the Crown would have to do. For those reasons, there is a likelihood of malfeasance, which the Government may not fully have anticipated.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> The hon. Gentleman has been in the House longer than I have, and he understands that that is a recurrent theme in debates on such issues. None the less, he is perfectly right to make the point now, and I am grateful that he has done so.
<P>
There are cumulative reasons why the Government are wrong on this issue. People outside do not accept what they are saying. The people of London do not think that there should never be mechanisms for them to rein in a mayor.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> They are called elections.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> It is not a question of calling an election; it is a question of giving the people the power to call an election. If Ministers believe that the Labour Government were elected to power-with a minority of the vote in Britain, and in London-under a distorted electoral system-
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman is straying a little again, as I am sure he would agree. I should be grateful if he would stick to the matter before us.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I shall not stray; I shall come back. The Minister says that the mechanism is called an election. If he believes that the people of Britain voted because of a particular proposal on London Government, I think that he is sadly misguided and misinformed.
<P>
I want to deal with a few last points. First, with reference to the arguments against the petition, unlike some of the amendments tabled by the Ministers, our amendments are drafted by us. We received excellent advice and assistance, but the amendments were finalised only with our agreement. We clearly argure for the right to petition, but there are difficult ways to conduct petitions. It is not necessary to conduct them in an old-fashioned way with people-be they Liberal Democrats or anyone else-walking up and down pavements with clipboards collecting signatures on wet Saturday afternoons.
<P>
I am surprised that Labour Members are worried by the prospect of Liberal Democrats becoming so active. Nothing is likely to make us more active than our opposition to the power set out in the Bill. If the Minister wants to encourage us to become more active, he should put more powers in the Bill. The more autocratic the Government become, the more we will benefit from that politically.

<P>

<B>Mr. Gapes:</B> The hon. Gentlemen referred to electoral support and talks about Liberal Democrat activism. In my constituency, the Liberal Democrats vote went down from 9 per cent. in 1992 to 6 per cent. at the general election in 1997. Throughout London and rest of the United Kingdom, Liberal Democrat votes fell at the last general election. How does he feel that he has a mandate for the extreme views and bizzarre proposals that he is putting forward today?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Before the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey resumes his speech, may I say that I have twice requested that we do not get into the relative merits of people canvassing, or the different merits and demerits of political systems, Hon Members. must stick to the new clause. I hope that I do not have to say that again.
 <P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I take that, Mr. Stevenson, as a suggestion that I do not answer the hon. Gentlemen's question now. Therefore I will not.
<P>
The answer to the earlier questions about how a petition can be conducted without having extra people do extra work is to use local authority offices. As far as I know, unless something has changed this afternoon, the offices are meant to be open between 9 am and 5 pm, and electoral returning officers are employed by every local authority.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dismore:</B> They do other things.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> Of course they do, but the hon. Gentlemen is deluded if he thinks that they are not public servants who are there to serve the public and that they could not manage to verify petitions just as they register postal votes and proxy votes on a regular basis.
<P>
There might be a small additional cost, but returning officers and public servants and they will do what they are told to do by the legislators. They are contracted to the public service. Most of them are pleased to perform such duties. If we decide that we want a petition, they would be the obvious and easy means through which to conduct one. [Interruption.] I know that the politics of Westminster make people anti-democratic, but I did not realise that that had 
rubbed off on the hon. Gentlemen.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dismore:</B> Does the hon. Gentlement not realise that most returning officers in most local authorities are chief executives? Would chief executives not be better off spending their time helping to run their authorities rather than messing around with referendums and surverys?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> Perhaps when the hon. Gentlemen led the Labour group on Westminster city council, he never went into the office of the people who loohed after electoral matters. Most local authorities have several people working in those offices. They are not chief executives.
<P>
<B>Ms Karen Buck </B>(Regent's Park and Kensington, North): There are two of them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> There may be two, three or four. The reality is that people are on duty all the time just as they are at the registration of births, marriages and deaths. There are officials who could perfectly well receive the petition names.
<P>
Labour's great saying at the last general election was "education, education, education" , but if we cannot manage to get people to fill in a form properly with their name, address and polling number, that policy will not have achieved much after two years or some years in the future.
<P>
It would be very sad if we had the prospect of attracting the World cup and the Olympic games to London and of gaining great international creditability, but we had a mayor who was incompetent and incapable of doing the job or not wanted in the job. London would pay a far bigger price if we allowed that person to continue than if we gave the people the opportunity to replace him.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jim Fitzpatrick </B>(Poplar and Canning Town): Will the hon. Gentlemen explain how we are going to attract the World cup and the Olympic games to London and gain international prestige with an incompetent mayor who is supposed to be working on all three tasks?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> The hon. Gentlemen did not hear me. I said that if we were bidding for those events and we had a mayor who was not up to the job, the prospect of us gaining those prizes would be diminished.
<P>
The Government's attitude is clearly, "Once you are in, you are in" -once people are elected, they are elected; once they are in power, anything may pass.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tony McNulty </B>(Harrow East): It will be a fixed-term election.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> The hon. gentlemen said that it will be a fixed-term election, but it will not the same as other elections. Baroness Thatcher's last premiership was for a fixed term, but she did not survive because-thank goodness-she lost the confidence of her people and out the door she went. That is what politics is all about.
<P>
The hon. Member for Brent, East took over as leader of the GLC from Lord McIntosh because the then Andrew McIntosh did not have the confidence of the Labour group on the GLC. There was no fixed term for that post, but a fixed term of a day. That is how the political system works. However, we are discussing a new political system and the people ought to be given the power to remove, as well as to elect, a mayor.
<P>
There are four new clauses and each has its merits; one tabled by the hon. Member for Croydon, South; one by the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst; and the others by my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston and Surbiton. I do not claim that any of them are perfect, but we need to do something. Like the hon. Member for Croydon, South and the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst, I Believe that not only will we wish to return to the matter but that the people of London will want us to come back to it. [Interruption.] The Minister for London and Construction may laugh. We are happy to have such a debate anywhere-on the Floor of the House, in the other place, on the radio, in the newspapers and on the television. We know that we can win all the arguments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The hon. Gentlemen has detained the Committee with a further lengthy speech advocating the principle in which he believes. However, his response that he does not intend to put his proposal to the vote is a clear sign of the lack of confidence that he has in his own convictions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> The Minister can put what spin he likes on his arguments, but our argument will find support-albeit qualified-from some labour Members. We are very keen to test it.
<P>
<B>Hon. Members:</B> Test it.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I too, am keen to see whether the hon. Member for Southwark, North Bermondsey wishes to test his new clause. If we allow him to conclude his speech, we shall all be the wiser.
<P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I want to do just that. We want the opportunity to build the strongest coalition on the best approach and to use the time available between now and the later stages of the Bill. Committee Members who are new to the House may not realise that a vote forced in Committee may adversely affect our chance of being able to vote on the same subject on Report.
<P>
We believe that because the Government made no concession, they have adopted an unacceptable position. Like the hon. Member for Croydon, South, we wish to return to the matter. On this occassion-and for today only-I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.
<P>

<P>
We are now coming to the important part of the Bill-[Laughter.] It is an equally important part of the Bill, to do with the purpose and general powers of the authority.
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
We believe that there needs to be an extension of the purposes that are provided in this part of the Bill. I shall be brief because we took a long time over the previous debate, important though it was. We seek to add two items to the clause. First, we want a definition of substainability written into the purpose of the Greater London authority. Secondly, the improvement of health should also be added to the purpose of the authority.
<P>
The obvious case for the first proposal is that it is generally accepted as public policy that the policies of local, central and other authorities should be sustainable. As for the second, the Government's White Paper proposed that the improvement of health should be included in the authority's purpose. However, that proposal was lost between the publication of the White Paper and the Bill. There is a strong lobby outside this place that believes that the improvement of the health of the people of London should be included, and we share that view. I hope that the Committee will regard the amendments as non-controversial, and accept our proposals.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I seek clarification that the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey was moving amendment No. 255.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Yes, amendment No. 255.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> In that case, the amendments in my name probe the meaning of the expression "social development". I think that it was Keith Joseph who said that to put the word "social"in front of another was to reverse the latter's meaning. We should like to replace "social development"with "quality of life".
<P>
Social development is, in my judgment, a loaded left-wing term. It is also a meaningless expression, and not in keeping with the powers of the authority. Therefore, we propose the alternative expression of improving the quality of life; we believe it to be a far more neutral and measurable term, which better reflects the powers of the authority.
<P>
The clause uses the phrase "ensuring a reasonable balance" , implying that there are trade-offs between economic, social and environmental concerns. Although that is true to an extent, it misrepresents the real relationship, which is that they are all interdependent. Social development, whatever that may mean, almost certainly requires jobs. Economic development is at the heart of the expression and therefore, in our judgment, "quality of life"is far more appropriate.

<P>

<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I speak to amendment No. 256 and should like to comment briefly on amendments Nos. 146 and 147, tabled by the hon. Member for Croydon, South.
<P>
Amendment No. 256 would add another purpose to the list set out in clause 25 (3). There is much in the list that we welcome, as it gives the authority quite a wide licence to act. We shall come back to how that licence to act may be constrained.
<P>
A key task of the GLA, along with the London boroughs and other agencies in London, is to tackle poverty and social exclusion. It is strange that the Bill promotes the desirability of facilitating wealth creation, which we wholeheartedly support, but does not go on to recognise the desirability of wealth redistribution and, therefore, of eradicating poverty.
<P>
On amendments Nos. 146 and 147, we were puzzled as to why the Conservatives wanted to remove the words "social development"until the hon. Member for Croydon, South gave an explanation. To some extent, the concern that the hon. Gentleman expressed is dealt with by amendment No. 255, which my hon. Friend the Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey moved.
 {**p15Z[Mr. Burstow]
<p4**}The effect of the Conservatives' amendments would be to return to a notion that was expressed while the Conservatives were in government-namely, that there is no such thing as society. That would deny the authority a crucial role in striking a balance between the social, economic and environmental needs of our community in London. Such a role would be an essential part of promoting sustainable development. The Conservatives' amendments would mean that the assembly and the mayor would not deal with issues such as inter-generational equity. That is one reason why we do not support these misguided amendments. <P>
There is a substantial poverty gap in our capital. All of us know about it because poverty confronts us in our constituencies. It is important to make it explicit in the Bill that the mayor must have regard to the desirability of eradicating poverty when exercising the general duty and general power specified in clause 25.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> I want to investigate a little further some of the probing points that my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South raised and some of the observations that the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam made in an interrogative mode.
<P>
In tabling amendment No. 18, the Liberals seek explicitly to give the authority a power to promote the health of Londoners under clause 25 (1). They are presumably taking responsibility from the London regional health authorities and conferring it on the Greater London authority. We do not yet know how effective the new London-wide health authority will be. The regional bodies that it will replace-the North and South Thames regional health authorities-have had their successes, but I suspect that they have been outweighed in the eyes of many of our constituencies by their failures.
<P>
I have been struck by the lack of democratic accountability in the NHS decision-making process in London. In my constituency, there have been proposals for the dismemberment of services at Mount Vernon hospital. Such proposals could conceivably be replicated at Harefield hospital. Local people have been unable to do anything about that because the regional health authority is accountable to no one.
<P>
It would be a step forward if, as a consequence of the Liberal amendment, the London regional authority at least issued a report. The problem with the amendment is, however, that there is a divergence between a putative power over health and the resources to provide health services. I assume that health service resources would still come from central Government. In speaking to their amendment, the Liberal Democrats have not made it clear that the funds would be transferred from the London regional health authority to the Greater London authority. Perhaps the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey will put me right.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> The hon. Gentleman has opened up a perfectly proper debate. The Liberal Democrat amendments seek to change the list of purposes of the authority to include the improvement of the health of the people of London. Discussion of the relevant powers and of the relation of the GLA to the new London health authority is perfectly proper, and should come later. I shall be happy to speak later about whether we can transfer funds now, in part or in whole.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> I did not make myself clear, for which I stand reproved. The hon. Gentleman and other hon. Members will see that subsection (2) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>" The powers of the Authority are only exercisable where the body or person exercising them considers that the exercise in question will further the purpose mentioned in subsection (1) above."
<P>
In other words, the purpose has to be incorporated in subsection (1) for the power to be applicable. I seek to question whether responsiblity for health will in practical terms be a sensible purpose for the GLA, inasmuch as the funding will continue to go to a different body, namely the London regional health authority, unless the Government were to make appropriate amendments to other legislation.
<P>
I should like to explore another aspect of the clause, which was opened up by my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South. The question of social development is dealt with in subsection (3) (a), which is concerned with
<P>
<P>
" ensuring a reasonable balance between promoting economic development" <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and the promotion of social development. That is the difficulty of the provisions.
<P>
My hon. Friends the Members for Solihull and for 
Croydon, South spelt out the matter at least by implication by insisting on an enhancement of the quality of life. Without such insistence on quality of life, could not social development lead, for example, to the building of massive municipal housing estates in the last remaining areas of green belt in London? I declare an interest, because I serve as the unremunerated president of the London Green Belt Council, as did my hon. Friend the Member for Chipping Barnet (Sir S. Chapman) in his time. The question of balance is important; my hon. Friends have got it right by stipulating quality of life, which gives just the balance that is necessary between the meeting of social need by appropriate housing development and the protection of the environment. The latter is also spelt out at the end of subsection (3) (a).
<P>
I have a final word of inquiry about what the Liberal Democrats intend. If they have it in mind to promote redistribution of wealth, as argued for by the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam, they should say so in their amendments. They have not had the guts to do so, I suspect because they would be fearful of upsetting their more well-to-do constituents. Instead, they go for the convenient euphemism of
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>" facilitating the eradication of poverty".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We all wish to facilitate the eradication of poverty, and the creation of wealth is an inherent part of that process.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> I always understood that one of the difficulties with that argument is that many people seem to define poverty in relative rather than absolute terms. If the poor are to be defined, as I think that they usually are, by being in the lowest 10 per cent. of income, they are by definition always with us, and it is therefore impossible to eradicate them.
 <P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> I am tempted to stray out of order by pursuing that interesting intervention by my right hon. Friend. However, suffice it to say that the Liberals would have been more honest about the fact that redistribution of wealth was their objective if they had stated that in their amendment. The Government would also be more honest about seeking wealth redistribution if they did not use the euphemism "social development" , which I take to mean the same thing.
<P>
6.15 pm
<P>
<B>The Minister for Transport in London (Ms Glenda Jackson):</B> Both sets of amendments, although their intentions are somewhat different, would weaken the general purpose that we have given to the Greater London authority.
<P>
The hon. Members for Ruislip-Northwood, for Sutton and Cheam, for Southwark, North and Bermondsey and for Croydon, South raised issues that are integral to delivering a truly improved quality of life to the people of London. We heard representations about the need to eradicate poverty and to ensure proper health provisions. No Labour Member would argue against either of those aims.
<P>
However, it is curious that the amendments ignore provisions that have already been made in clauses 25 (3) (d) and 33 (3) (d), which require the authority, in exercising any of its powers and in the preparation of its strategies, to have regard to the desirability of promoting the health of people in Greater London, including people who live and work in the city or are visiting it. That is a requirement of the Bill: it is not a matter of choice for the mayor or the assembly.
<P>
As my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health has had occasion to say more than once, one of the greatest contributors to poor health, in this or any other nation, is poverty. The requirement upon the mayor and the assembly to promote the health of people in Greater London means that there will be an equal requirement on them to consider the effects of poverty. They will have to work with others, to the best of their abilities, to meet the requirements that clause 25 places upon all local authorities. That reflects our manifesto commitment to place upon all councils the duty to promote the economic, social and environmental well-being of their areas.
<P>
The Greater London authority is a new form of strategic authority. The mayor, when devising strategies, will be required by the powers that are specified in the Bill to be cognisant of the desired outcome of those powers. As the GLA is a strategic authority, the mayor will have to work not only with other local authorities but with a range of interested individuals and groups to deliver the desired outcome.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I follow and understand the Minister's argument. Can she then tell the Committee why the Government changed their position between the publication of the White Paper and that of the Bill? The White Paper stated that the mayor will have a duty to promote improvements to the health of Londoners. Clause 25 (3) of the Bill states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>" The matters to which a body or person is to have regard in determining whether to exercise any of the powers of the Authority include the desirability"
<P>
of promoting improvements. Why has a duty given way merely to having regard to desirability?
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Ms Jackson:</B> I am somewhat puzzled by the hon. Gentleman's question. He comes from the legal profession, so I should have thought that he would have been aware that the duty has not been removed. Indeed, parliamentary counsel's advice is that desirability is the word that ensures that there can be no doubt what will be required of the mayor and the assembly in delivering the requirements of the Bill within the general powers.
<P>
There is no argument in Committee about what is desirable: improving the quality of life and health of Londoners; increasing social unity; ensuring a suitable economy; and eradicating those things that impact so unfairly on certain sections of London. It would be improper of me not to mention the speech of the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst. It may be his perception-indeed, it may be his political ideology-that the poor must always be with us; that does not inform our thinking.
<P>
In the light of my remarks, and of the fact that the amendment is unnecessary, I ask the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey to withdraw it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I shall deal briefly with the points made in this short debate. I shall first respond to the point made by the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood about the eradication of poverty, which was echoed by the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst. We argued straightforwardly that because the Bill already contains as one of the general purposes of the authority facilitating the creation of wealth in Greater London, it should also contain the complementary duty-on which, as I think that the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood said, we are all agreed-of eradicating poverty. We cannot easily define wealth; we cannot easily define poverty-of course, it is all relative.
<P>
If we are to say-this is not our wording; it is the Government's-that one of the jobs of the new authority shall be to facilitate the creation of wealth, it should certainly be the supervisory job of a regional authority to try to eradicate poverty. That cannot be done in the same way by local government; it can clearly be done by central Government. I must tell the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood that whatever beliefs we may have on the issue, we are not arguing that the Bill ought to include as a purpose the redistributon of wealth. That is a separate argument. We could have argued that, but we have not. That is not what we are proposing to the Committee. We are asking that the Committee try to assist the people at the bottom of the heap, as well as the people at the top, and to increase wealth all around.
<P>
To their credit, the Government have come to office determined to try to eradicate poverty. I accept that; I do not dissent from it. It would therefore be consistent to include that as a duty of the first city-wide authority for London. The Minister for Transport in London, and I share the view, as do others, that there are pockets of
{**p15Z[Mr. Hughes]

<p4**}poverty and deprivation in London the like of which exist nowhere else in the country. That is all the more reason for the statement of duties on the authority to include the eradication of poverty. <P>
Let me put a practical proposition to the Minister. Imagine that in some far-off day there was a Conservative majority on the assembly and a Conservative mayor who had extremely right-wing views. I think that she and I would be at one in wanting to ensure that even they had a duty to seek to eradicate poverty-a duty that they might otherwise neglect.
<P>
To reinforce the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Sutton and Cheam, I should say that we take the view that it is odd to delete the phrase "social development" , as Tory members of the Committee argued. We share with the Labour party the view that social cohesion-society-is something that is worth creating, supporting and developing. Social development is a perfectly understood concept, and we share the Government's view that that phrase ought to be included.
<P>
Lastly, I turn to the debate that the Minister and I had on the issue of health. If she is telling me that parliamentary counsel told her that the duty to promote the health of Londoners can be better achieved by the Bill as drafted than by the White Paper, I must say that not only do I disagree, but so do all those who made unsolicited representations to me and to her colleagues. The London Health Alliance wrote to the Minister for London and Construction on 2 January and sent a copy to me. It stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>" We were greatly disappointed that the original intention in the White Paper has been weakened"
<P>
on the issue of health.
<P>
The Chartered Institute of Environmental Health made the same point and says that the GLA should have the power to improve the state of London's health., The King's Fund in particular argues strongly that that duty should be included.
<P>
We will come to the powers question-which was raised perfectly properly by the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood-under clause 27. It would not be in order to discuss it now. However, we believe that it is better to write in health and I hope that the Committee will accept amendment No. 255.

New clause 6-Consultation with business and voluntary organisations-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>" ( ) Within one year of its first meeting, the Greater London Authority shall produce proposals for including business and voluntary organisations in the formal consultation processes of the Authority.".
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Clause 25 (1) sets out the general purpose of the authority, which is to promote
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>" economic and social development in Greater London".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The authority is to determine what constitutes that economic and social development, but with no reference to anyone else.
<P>
The amendment would require the authority to consult the boroughs in deciding what constitutes economic and social development. That is a good idea politically-an authority that was dominated by one party would have at least to listen to the ideas of another-and on common-sense grounds. It is always good to listen to
 <P>
others on so diverse a topic as economic and social development. Londoners would be tested and served by that co-operative approach.
<P>
The amendment would also give consultative rights to bodies that the Conservative party has traditionally supported-the existing boroughs and the common council of the City of London. They have the experience and history that the new authority will lack. We believe that the amendment is important. It is consistent with our theme-that we must consult widely and involve the London boroughs as much as possible. I urge the Minister to give it full consideration.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> Amendments Nos. 257, 260 and 259 add to the debate on consultation. They would put in the Bill provisions covering anxieties that the London chamber of commerce and industry and the voluntary sector have raised with me and my hon. Friends. The amendments would ensure that they are properly consulted.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 257 and 260 reflect the anxiety that, under the clause as drafted, the mayor and not businesses will decide who will represent them in discussion with the mayor. It is essential that the business community is able to choose who will voice its interests in dialogue and consultation.
<P>
<B>Mr. McNulty:</B> I have two short questions. Who chose the list in amendment No. 260 of those who should represent business in London but ignored the comments from London First, the business campaign group, which said that it is happy with the drafting of the provision and that the mayor should determine whom to consult?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I take the point that perhaps we should take in the round all of these comments. I am sure that the Minister will make that point. However, it is right and proper for us to table amendments to tease out the Government's thinking on how they intend to pursue consultation with the business community. We tabled amendment No. 260 following the views that we received from the chamber of commerce and we accept that London First may not have the same view, but on balance we believe that it is important that the Bill makes it clear that the mayor should hear the authentic voice of the business community and not a representative of the business community chosen by the mayor. If the Minister believes that the drafting of the amendment is inappropriate or incorrect, I am sure that he will tell us in due course.
<P>
Amendment No. 259 refers to the voluntary sector, whicch is currently omitted from this part of the Bill. If the business community is to be consulted and recognised in the Bill, albeit inadequately, there should be similar recognition of the standing and importance of the voluntary sector in the community of London. Procedures should be in place to enable the voluntary sector to be treated in a similar way as the business community. Given its contribution to the promotion of sustainable development and a host of aspects covered by the clause, and because it is such an important stakeholder, the amendment should be accepted.
<P>
New clause 6 would require the mayor, within the first 12 months of election of the Greater London authority, to issue proposals on how best to consult the voluntary sector, the business community and other elements of civic society in London. That might provide a route by which, through consensus, a civic forum could be established in London. On Second Reading, I referred to the desirability of having an explicit reference to a civic forum in the Bill. The London Voluntary Service Council and others are campaigning and lobbying the Government for that. The body language of Ministers when I made that comment on Second Reading suggests that they do not believe that the matter should be explicitly covered in the Bill. Nevertheless, I hope that it will be possible for the new clause, or something like it, to be accepted to enable a clear signal to be sent from Parliament to those who will form the new institution that we want clear procedures to enable genuine engagement between the assembly, the mayor and civic society in London.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> I should like to utter a few comments in strong support of amendment No. 153. It is very important that it is stated explicitly and without ambiguity in clause 25 (1) on the purpose and general powers of the authority that from the outset there is a clear duty of co-operation with the boroughs and the common council. Many of us fear that the Greater London authority will, at worse, seek to usurp many of the powers of the boroughs-and, to some extent, conceivably, of the Corporation of London-but at best will muddle, confuse or interfere with the operations of the council, especially as the Government have set their face against having a representative from each borough sitting in the assembly. Their reluctance to have borough representatives will prove a weakness and, to anticipate the dangers of conflict arising out of failure to co-operate with the boroughs, amendment No. 153 should be incorporated in the Bill.
<P>
Without such local representations, there is a real risk of lop-sided development in London. We may have a mayor who has a preoccupation with a rundown east end area or one who has a preoccupation with west London-in which case I would be more than delighted. Nevertheless, the mayor should have a London-wide responsibility and the authority's decisions about economic development should be pursued in such a light. If not, particular boroughs may easily have good grounds for complaint. In west London, if the fifth terminal at Heathrow is developed, the mayor and the authority will have a responsibility to ensure that good surface access prevails to prevent traffic congestion in west London. Without an explicit power to co-operate with boroughs such as Hillingdon and Hounslow, which have a particular interest in Heathrow, there might be a reluctance to tackle traffic problems and introduce the surface transport links that are necessary to solve them. That example, I hope, will make it clear why amendment No. 153 is so important. I trust that the Government will not lightly dismiss it and will regard it as important.
<P>
We are all aware of the commmon council of the City of London's anxiety that the Greater London authority may seek to interfere in areas relating to the welfare and interests of the financial community in the City of
 {**p15Z[Mr. Wilkinson]

<p4**}London, which are properly for the attention of the Lord Mayor and the corporation. I need for co-operation with the common council should be explicit in the Bill from the outset. <P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> I begin, I hope, by reassuring the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood that the GLA is already required by clause 25 (4), in deciding whether to exercise any of its powers, to undertake any consultation that it considers appropriate. That consultation must include the London boroughs, where they are affected by its decisions. I am beginning to become somewhat irritated by the continual representation, not only of the mayor but of all assembly members as exclusively male-
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> Oh, no.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I am glad that the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst is distressed. I never thought that he would show any concern about equality.
<P>
<B>Sir Sydney Chapman </B>(Chipping Barnet): There is perhaps a genuine misunderstanding in the Committee. In my generation, it was always understood that the word "man"or "chairman"embraced the woman generically. It is no discourtesy-a chair, to me, is an inanimate object-and, as I pointed out on the Floor of the House, my surname is Chapman and not Chap. It is not discourteous to refer to a Chairman without adding, "or Chairwoman".
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> As a non-inanimate object, I hope, I call the Minister for Transport in London.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> My remarks having nothing to do with experiencing discourtesy; they are due to the remorseless presentation in Committee and on the Floor of the House that the holders of office, by they high, low, medium or intermediate, must be exclusively male. There was, I thought, humour in what I said, but clearly the lateness of the hour has reduced Opposition Members' potential for appreciating that.
<P>
As I was saying, in preparing his or her strategies, the mayor is required by clause 34 (1) (a) to (e) to consult, among others, each London borough council and the common council. However, the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Croydon, South would give the GLA, the London boroughs and the common council a general purpose.
<P>
The Minister for Local Government and Housing, my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Durham (Mrs. Armstrong), will present legislation to provide all English and Welsh local authorities with such powers in due course, but the Bill cannot and should not provide existing London authorities with that new general purpose.
<P>
We agree-I have been at pains to point out what is in the Bill-that in exercising its powers to further its general purpose, the GLA will need, on most occassions, to co-operate with other London local authorities. That will not always be the case, and it is highly unlikely that anyone in the Room would want it to be so. In certain circumstances, when promoting a specific issue that falls within the general purpose of the GLA, the mayor may not have the co-operation and support of all, or even the majority, of borough councils. That should not mean that the mayor is unable to act.
<P>
The amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey show his desire to remove any discretion from the mayor about whom he consults from the business community. The hon. Gentleman wishes to place a further administrative restriction on the authority, requiring it within a year of its first meeting to produce proposals for including business and voluntary organisations in the authority's formal consultation processes. It is quite proper for the authority to decide on the procedures that it adopts in conducting its business, including how it consults interested parties. It must also decide the timing for the adoption of those procedures.
<P>
There is a desire to include specific mention of the voluntary sector as consultees-a point made by the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam. We have some sympathy with that view. The need for widest possible consultation by the authority is at the heart of our proposals. We see it as a way to ensure openness and transparency, and the Bill provides for that widespread consultation. However, this matter is not exclusively part of the hon. Gentleman's remit. Some sectors of the community need further reassurance that they will be included in consultation procedures. Therefore, in response to the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam, and to those individuals and organisations in the voluntary sector who have made similar points, I am prepared to consider the opinions that have been expressed with a view to introducing Government amendments on Report to include in the Bill a wider range of categories of interest that the mayor must-I must stress "must" - consult. That will obviously include the Lonon boroughs, the business community and the voluntary sector. I emphasise, however, that I have no intention of producing lists of specific organisations as proposed in amendment No. 260. In light of my commitment, I ask the hon. Member for Croydon, South to withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> In light of the Minister's thoroughly reasonably response, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

No. 253, in page 15, line 4, leave out from "London"to end of line 5.

New clause 13-Report on health impact of strategies
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>" () The Mayor shall produce and publish reports of the impact on the health of persons in Greater London of the strategies set out in subsection 33 (1)."
 <P>
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> This important group of amendments may give us the only opportunity during Bill's Committee stage to debate the subject of health throughly.
<P>
Amendment No. 251 obliges the mayor to conduct a health impact assessment of the people of London and amendment No. 253 deletes the call for the mayor to promote improvements in the health of persons in Greater London. At first glance, it may seem that we are opposed to something that sounds as good as motherhood and apple pie, but on closer examination of the Government's proposal I believe that we are right to be concerned.
<P>
May I make it clear at the outset that we wholeheartedly support better health and a healthy environment for all. We support improvements in all areas of health and health care for people in London and in the nation as a whole. However, we see three problems with the Government's proposals. First, the clause is vacuous: it fails to give the mayor any specific duties in respect of the health of Londoners. Secondly, we believe that health care professionals, not politicians, should promote the good health of London. Thirdly, the Bill does not even make it clear who "persons in Greater London"are.
<P>
A month ago, as a result of the Turnberg report on London Hospitals, the Government set up the London regional office of the NHS Executive to fill the gaps in the strategic management of health care in London. It is a professional body, working in partnership with local government. Its five key functions are to develop understanding of health needs across London, to improve primary care, to develop intermediate and community care, to put a new focus on the most vulnerable Londoners and to modernise London's hospitals. That is no easy task. The idea that the mayor and his advisers might be better qualified to issue guidance or directions on such matters is questionable. The mayor should concentrate on the promotion of health issues, not on the health of people.
<P>
The mayor could at some stage offer direction to a health authority for, say, electoral gain, instead of for the benefit of the health of London. He could conduct publicity campaigns on various health issues, but not implement a single policy. As I said, this is a motherhood and apple pie clause, and we need to lift the lid to see what is underneath the crust.
<P>
<B>Mr. Darvill:</B> Apples.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Very healthy food.
<P>
The references in the Bill to health are bland and non-specific. The mayor could either do nothing or meddle in matters in which he has no expertise.
<P>
When it comes to the specifics, the Government are typically vague. At the King's Fund conference on 10 December last year, the 
Minister for Public Health, the right hon. Member for Dulwich and West Norwood (Ms Jowell), stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>" it would be the Mayor's responsibility to reinforce the work of the Regional Office... it would be the Mayor's duty to promote and improve the health of Londoners."
<P>
<P>
That was it. That was the great statement from the Minister for Public Health. What on earth do those comments mean?
<P>
I should be grateful if the Minister could explain precisely what the mayor will do. What will the mayor do in respect of, for example, family planning clinics, drugs, HIV policies, and alternative medical practitioners? The mayor should not promote health issues, but should ensure that his own policies take account of health. That is why we have tabled our amendments.
<P>
The Government have the whole thing the wrong way round. We want the mayor to take account of the impact of his policies on health. We do not want the mayor to have an impact on health policies.
<P>
In drafting the Bill, the Government were clearly unable to identify exactly what the mayor's responsibilities should be. They have concocted a few clauses that say little, but which could lead to duplication, confusion and possible conflict. The mayor's involvement in this unspecified way could increase bureaucracy and slow down the decision-making process as a result of another layer of consultation. London's health authorities have responsibility for the provision of health care. They are the experts and the responsibility should remain, with them.
<P>
Amendment No. 251 places a duty on the mayor to conduct health impact assessments on the exercise of each of his policies and strategies. The Government have recognised the value of such assessments in respect of their own responsibilities. Indeed, the Green Paper, "Our Healthier Nation" , states:
<P>
" the Government will apply health impact assessments to its relevant key policies so that when they are being developed and implemented, the consequences of those policies for our health is considered."
<P>
<P>
Other respected bodies also endorse the principle of health impact assessments. The first and key recommendation of the recently published report by the independent inquiry into inequalities in health, chaired by Sir Donald Acheson, is that,
<P>
" as part of health impact assessment, all policies likely to have a direct or indirect impact on health should be evaluated in terms of their impact on health inequalities."
<P>
<P>
The King's Fund has also called for the mayor to be given responsibility to undertake health impact assessments. Its letter to me states:
<P>
" health is about more than healthcare. It is influenced by jobs, housing, transport and the environment. The decisions of the GLA will clearly have a huge impact on the health of Londoners."
<P>
<P>
To give one example, the Bill specifies that the mayor is to prepare and publish a municipal waste management strategy. That strategy will contain proposals for the recovery, treatment and disposal of municipal waste that originates in London. The mayor is even empowered to give direction to a waste disposal authority in Greater London. It is obvious that waste management has a direct impact on health, with its use of landfill sites or incineration, and the mayor should therefore be required to consider the impact of his strategy on London.
{**p15Z[Mr. Ottaway]

<p4**}It is hardly conceivable, as we approach the millennium, that we would create a new public body that is not specifically required to undertake a health impact assessment of its actions. That is expecially important within the context of the GLA's  responsibilities, which could have a direct impact on the health of Londoners. We do not think that the mayor should promote health development but he should take the lesser option of carrying out health impact assessments. <P>
New clause 13, tabled by the Liberal Democrats, proposes a regional health executive. It is, in effect, a call for regional government and-this does not surprise me because it is consistent with everything that the Liberal Democrats have said-it calls for the mayor to issue direction and guidance to the health authority. In our judgment, that is a step too far, and we do not believe that the mayor should adopt that role.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I do not dissent greatly from the burden of the argument put forward by the hon. Member for Croydon, South. His view of new clause 13 is based on a false premise about its contents. To clarify the matter, new clause 13, which is simple and very similar to amendment No. 251, states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>" The Mayor shall produce and publish reports of the impact on the health of persons in Greater London of the strategies set out in subsection 33 (1)."
<P>
I appreciate that occasionally in this business we all face the risk that the page with the note on it will disappear under a pile. The difference between the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood and the Liberal Democrats is that our proposal is an add-on rather than an alternative. The hon. Gentleman does not want the proposal to be a purpose of the authority, but we do. We also think that there should be a health impact assessment in any event. The hon. Gentleman referred to high-powered representations, which I hope will persuade the Government of our case.
<P>
Finally, the British Medical Association submitted a reasonable brief that made the same point. It gave several examples, one of which is topical: it said that had there been a health impact assessment of the Manchester runway proposal, the development might have been viewed differently. In south-west London, a big issue is the fifth runway at Heathrow-
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> Fifth terminal.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> Of course. If that were subject to a health impact assessment, it might well influence the outcome of the inquiry.
<P>
All Committee members probably received the same representations from the King's Fund, which said that Londoners are pessimistic about health in their city. It commissioned a MORI poll, which was carried out in December 1998 and which had some interesting findings. The majority of Londoners-three out of five-think that the capital is an unhealthy place in which to live, two thirds think that it is less healthy than other parts of the country, and half think that it will be less healthy in five years' time. The case is strong, and I hope that the Minister will give comfort to Opposition Members by accepting our new clause or Conservative amendment No. 251, or by re-amending the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I hope that my response to the amendments will satisfy the hon. Members for Croydon, South and for Southwark, North and Bermondsey. I hope that they will withdraw the amendment and the new clause, but we hope to come back to some of the issues later.
<P>
I put it to the hon. Member for Croydon, South that amendments Nos. 251, 252 and 253 are unnecessary and impractical. We agree with the broad intention that underlies amendment No. 251, but we believe that the Bill already achieves the same objective. Clause 25 (3) (d) requires the GLA to have regard, when deciding whether to exercise any of its powers, to the desirability of
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>" promoting improvements in the health of persons in Greater London".
<P>
Amendment No. 253 would remove that provision.
<P>
We have already discussed the drafting by parliamentary draftsmen, and we are perfectly ready to accept that some improvements might be achieved. We intend to give full effect to the commitment in the White Paper, which stated that the health of Londonders will be an important concern for the mayor, and we want to be absolutely sure that the Bill will achieve that.
<P>
As I said, the mayor is also placed under a general duty, in the preparation of his or her strategies, to have regard to the desirability of promoting the health of Londoners, and he or she has powers that will enable him or her to co-operate with other bodies. The hon. Member for Croydon, South discussed family planning services. It will be open to the mayor, under existing powers, to co-operate with health authorities in London to further the provision of family planning services.

<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> Will the mayor have the benefit of the health impact assessment-or whatever the Government come up with-or will the authority? The Conservative amendment would involve the authority, and we support that proposal.

<P>
<H5>7 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> As the hon. Gentlemen knows. the structure of the new Greater London Authority will give the main executive functions to the mayor, and the assembly's role will be essentially to scrutinise the mayor, to serve on bodies and to investigate issues of concern to Londoners. However, a fine balance needs to be struck between the specific duties that are given to the mayor and the wider duties given to the authority. That issue also relates to the phrasing of clauses, and we therefore want to give further thought to the matter.
<P>
The proposal made by the hon. Member for Croydon, South is impractical because a health impact assessment is not defined and because such an assessment would not be relevant to all the activities carried out by the authority, whatever form it took. The new clause tabled by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey is also impractical and unnecessary because many reports on the health of Londoners are already published at frequent intervals.
<P>
I am sure that Committee will agree that the major's strategies and policies must have regard to the need to promote improvements in health. That is our intention. In the light of our wish to give further considerations to how the matter is expressed in the Bill, I invite hon. Members to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The Minister has half satisfied me. I am not entirely happy with his response to amendment No. 253. To take the example I used, to which the Minister replied, the mayor should not delve into family planning policy in London, although he should be interested in and aware of it. It is our judgement that that is a matter best left to the professionals. We believe that that part of the Bill is wrong, and we therefore wish to push amendment No. 253 to a vote.
<P>
With regard to 
amendment No. 251, I shall take the Minister's word for it that other parts of the Bill will oblige the mayor to conduct a health impact assessment. That was not immediately apparent to me, but if he says that that is so, that is fine. Under those circumstances, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>" (b) contributing towards the achievement of sustainable development in the United Kingdom;".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment is intended to ensure that the Greater London authority, in exercising any of its powers, and in pursuit of its general purposes, should seek to promote a sustainable development not only in greater London, as the Bill currently states, but that it should have regard to the contribution that it must make to the achievement of sustainable development in the United Kingdom, and consequently to the UK's contribution internationally.
<P>
Environmental concerns, as we all recognise, cannot be limited to any one geographical area, and the GLA must therefore obviously be mindful of the wider context. I an sure that all hon. Members would agree that that is an essential objective, and that the amendment will help in achieving it.
<P>
For the reasons that I outlined in response to the previous debate, the amendment is one of a number that may need to be made to clause 25 to make still more explicit our intentions in relation to the general purpose of the authority. We discussed the issue of health during the previous debate, but other issues are involved and we need to ensure that the intentions specified in the White Paper are carried through into the Bill across a range of activities.
<P>
Parliamentary counsel has done a splendid job in trying to give full effect to our intentions, but there is a need for further discussion and refinement, and we hope to return at a later stage with further comments. However, any further amendments will not change the general purpose that we intend to give the authority. They will simply clarify our intentions if we decide that that is necessary.

Amendment agreed to.

</FONT>Question accordingly negatived.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> I have some difficulty with the clause for two main reasons. First, I am always suspicious of legislation by shibboleth, slogan and soundbite. The clause is a good example of all those. It is full of well-meaning but largely vacuous words which will be no guide to those who are elected to the Greater London authority, whether mayor or assembly members, and which could be positively misleading or could raise expectations and aspirations that are almost certainly unlikely to be fulfilled. They could also in some circumstances even be self-contradictory. I can imagine circumstances in which the creation of wealth on the one hand but improvement to health on the other could be contradictory.
<P>
That reminds me strongly of another document of similar pretensions and portentousness-the treaty of Rome-which contains similarly vacuous and pretentious phrases and aspirations, all of which are mutually incompatible, as we have found to our cost over many years. Therefore, I do not believe that it is wise or sensible to sprinkle potential statute with phrases and words that are much better suited to spin and soundbite. That is the first reason.
<P>
The second is that it is probably wrong for the Bill to give an elected authority such constraints and even such aspirations. The Ministers have laid great stress on the fact that they believe that this authority will be powerful and influential, elected in its own right, expressing through the ballot box the views of the people of London and so on. Yet that authority will be constrained by the words that the Government now seek to place in the Bill. That strikes me as an odd contradiction. If the Government had the confidence that they have expressed in this authority and its democratic validity, Surely they would let elected members, mayor and assembly, make
{**p15Z[Mr. Forth]

<p4**}their decisions from time to time about the priorities, the aims and the direction in which they want to take London. However, right from the start those elected representatives will act within the constraints of clause 25. <P>
If the words mean nothing, that is one thing, but if they have any meaning, they will act as an arbitrary and unnecessary constraint on the views and the development of policies that the elected members for this authority would have. Therefore, the clause contains a contradiction between the way in which the Government tell us they see this body and the reality that they wish to constrain what the elected members will be able to do.
<P>
As we go through the Bill, we shall come to what I see as a further set of inherent contradictions and potential conflict between the views of the 
authority and those of the London boroughs. Some worrying conflicts are built into the proposed system, to which we shall have to turn our attention as we go through the Bill.
<P>
At this stage my worry is that the clause is at odds with the aim and purpose of what the Government say the authority should do on behalf of the people of London, and that is bad law making. In a sense it is dishonest, because if the authority, with the best of intentions and the best will, fails to meet these aspirations, there is a distinct danger that the people of London will feel let down, having been led up a political garden path by the sort of nonsense that is contained in clause 25. The increased likelihood arises of disillusionment and disappointment, which would surely be unfortunate at this stage of a venture of such size and importance.
<P>
For those reasons, I hope to have the opportunity to vote against clause 25, which is unnecessary, misleading and at odds with the democratic aims and aspirations that Minister themselves have set out. For all those reasons, we should have none of it.
<P>
<B>Ms Joan Ryan </B>(Enfield, North): On a point of order, Mr. Stevenson. I understand that, during the last vote, my vote was not recorded. I would like the written record of the Committee's proceedings, at least, to show that I voted against.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Thank you for raising that matter with me.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> Broadly speaking, we welcome the concessions made by Ministers in respect of consultation in the voluntary sector, and their recognition of the possible need for further drafting to facilitate the authority's purpose in respect of health. We welcome Ministers' comments on those matters.
<P>
Clause 27, which in a sense links with clause 25, in particular provdies the basis for a power of general competence for local government. To that extent, we welcome the clauses. In a way, the arguments advanced by the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst are the exact opposite of those that we advanced in support of the clause. We welcome anything that effectively relieves local government of the shackles that previous statutes have placed on it. We therefore support the clause, and we would certainly not vote against it, but we look forward to a more elegantly worded clause in due course.

<P>

<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> We have already debated most of the key issues surrounding the provision during the debates on the amendments. Clause 25 defines the general purpose of the authority, which is to promote the economic and social development of greater London and the improvement of its environment. Therefore, in exercising any of the authority's powers, the mayor and the assembly, or anyone to whom their functions are delegated, must consider whether the exercising of those powers furthers the general purposes of the authority.
<P>
I put it to the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst that it is very difficult for the authority's members to exercise their democratic responsibilities in a vacuum, without a clear indication of the authority's overarching purpose. I cannot believe that he would wish to create an authority without setting objectives and boundaries, which this and subsequent clauses seek to do.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> In that case, how can a Government seek to achieve their purposes if some higher authority has not set out their aims? Presumably, any Government would look to their manifesto for inspiration, as I believe the present Government do from time to time, and say, "This is what we set out before the people, and this what we are going to do."Why cannot the Minister allow people standing for the London authority to set out their aspirations and to be jduged by the electorate, be they assembly members or mayor?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The mayor of London will undoubtedly present a manifesto to the people of London, and that manifesto will hopefully be carried out. We believe strongly that political parties should present their proposals and honour their obligations-the Labout party in government are doing exactly that. Indeed, the Bill was one of our manifesto commitments.
<P>
Any organisation must be conscious of the remit within which it is working. Whether the right hon. Gentleman likes it or not, this country is signed up to certain international treaties and obligations. Any elected Government inherit those obligations-they cannot escape from them. We are creating the Greater London authority's remit and objectives to ensure a background against which candidates' manifestos can be prepared, so that no unrealistic expectations are raised among the electorate. Matters covered by the clause include the desirability of ensuring a reasonable balance between the pursuit of each of the elements in the general purpose and, as amended by amendment No. 238, contributing to the achievement of sustainable development in the United Kingdom. The clause requires bodies or persons exercising the authority's powers to carry out such consultation on their proposals as they consider appropriate. We hope to return to the issue of consultation, particularly with the voluntary sector, as part of our general definition of consultative obligations.
 <P>
<H5>8.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The measures are designed to ensure that the mayor, acting on behalf of the authority, can take a flexible approach in tackling London's problems. We want the mayor to be able to work with others, including the boroughs and the common council, to promote London's interests. It is central to the authority's ability to act strategically outside the confines of its functional responsibilities. Not only does the general purpose provide a focus for it to do that, but it will enable the GLA to act in partnership with other major players in London. The clause is helpful; it sets the parameters and I hope that members of the Committee will that it stand part of the Bill.

<H4><center>Clause 26</center></H4>
<H4><center>Secretary of State's guidance about the</center></H4>
Authority's purpose
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> This is an important clause although, as members of the Committee will have noted, no amendments have been tabled to it. Nevertheless, if the Minister is unable to provide satisfactory answers to our questions, I shall seek to table amendments on Report.
<P>
At first scrutiny, the clause seems most sinister. Again, the Secretary of State is seeking explicit powers to meddle in, and to second-guess, the work of the authority. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst made clear in our previous debate, a democratic authority should have maximum autonomy. Such an authority is put in place by virtue of a democratic mandate and it should be allowed to get on with its work without being told what to do or guided by the Secretary of State. The Minister should make it clear what the Government have in mind by the word "guidance". Is guidance something that can be ignored? What will be the consequence of not following the guidance issued by the Secretary of State and in what areas is guidance most likely to be issued?. We are told that the guidance will apply to the excercise of the authority's powers. In other words, the Secretary of State could be involved in just about any area in which the authority seeks to exercise competence, doing some back-seat driving, trying to seize the steering wheel, put a foot on the brake, or generally obstruct or interfere with the good direction of the assembly.
<P>
Under clause 26 (2), the guidance can affect any body. I presume that means that the guidance may relate to refuse collection, the fire service or any body under the auspices of the authority. In fact, any individual must take note of the guidance and act accordingly. The powers seem to be extremely wide, draconian and intrusive in the extreme.
<P>
Last but not least, the clause deals with the manner in which the guidance may be issued and, of course, it gives the Secretary of State total latitude. A mechanism should be available whereby guidance may be issued. There should also be some means by which guidance may be openly challenged because a genuine conflict of policy could arise between the Government and the authority over the guidance. The clause states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>" Any guidance issued by the Secretary of State... shall be published by him in such manner as he considers appropriate" -
<P>
not in a way that is appropriate or suitable for the authority, but in a way that "he considers appropriate".
<P>
I would have thought that, at the very least, the Secretary of State should go to a full meeting of the authority and explain why he is issuing guidance, and there should be a question and answer session in public about it. If such a creature-I am sorry to call him such-as a Minister responsible for London still exists after the authority is up and running, perhaps that Minister should also come to the House of Commons to explain why it was necessary for the Secretary of State to issue guidance to the authority because London Members will be interested to know. In other words, the clause is a classic example of legislation that confers very wide-ranging, totally undefined, sweeping powers, and the Minister has a lot of explaining to do.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Sir Sydney Chapman:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood has virtually said what I intended to say but, to put it briefly, although it is not an insignificant point, will the Minister give us an assurance that "guidance"does not mean direction and "have regard to"does not mean obey, and will he spell out precisely what "guidance"means?
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> We are in danger of getting into a mess here because, following on from what the Minister said in relation to the previous clause, one can envisage circumstances in which a mayor, political parties or candidates for election would have their own manifestos setting out their policies, which they would implement if they were elected. However, those policies could be at odds with the aspirations in clause 25-I do not suppose that the clause will limit what people say in their election manifestos-which may give rise to a conflict between what elected members have said that they want to do and the aims and constraints in clause 25. That is bad enough, but now another party-the Secretary of State-is entering the potential mess. He will have an eye either on the objective in clause 25 or on commitments in the manifesto on which he was elected. Unless the Minister is going to tell us that all politicians will be bound by
[Mr. Forth]

<p>clause 25, which strikes me as unlikely, those considerations could be different.
<P>
The Secretary of State may seek to give guidance, which, as my hon. Friend the Member for Chipping Barnet made clear, has yet to be explained. The guidance will be based either on the Secretary of State's view of the world, and of London in particular, or on what is in statute. It might not be based on what may be conflicting aims and aspirations in elected representatives' manifestos.
<P>
We are in a multidirectional muddle and there may be conflict between different sources. The Government must come clean and tell us what is going on. Will we be driven entirely by clause 25, or will that be overlaid by clause 26 and the whim of the Secretary of State of the day? If so, what is the relationship between the two clauses? Where do the elected representatives, with the manifestos that they have set out before the voters of London, come into this? If the elected representatives have a view that is at odds with clause 25, what will prevail? If the Secretary of State has yet another view, will he or she-for the benefit of two of the Ministers present-she prevail?
<P>
We should be told clearly at this stage what the relationships will involve; who will have the final say and on what that will be based; and what the relationships will be between potentially conflicting political entities-the Bill, elected members and the Secretary of State. Surely Ministers, even in their most optimistic moments, cannot imagine that they those entities will necessarily or magically be in harmony. We must be told what is going on and what will happen.

<P>

<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I am tempted to say in response to the last comment of the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst that in a way we do not want greater clarity. The clauses may create the basis on which the new authority will be able to exercise the power of general competence. That is the best possible way, in the context of our constitutional arrangements, for a Bill to put into effect the idea of a power of general competence. I have discussed with the Minister in debates on other Bills how we might achieve that, and we welcome the move in that direction.
<P>
However, clause 26 reverses the welcome step towards greater autonomy and greater powers of general competence for local authorities. For that reason we will vote against it. The Secretary of State should not issue guidance on this matter. Those involved in the campaign-the parties and independents-should set out their policies for Londoners. They should determine how best to take forward the governance of London for the betterment of Londoners.
<P>
In that respect, it seems that the arguments on greater autonomy that have been advanced by Conservative members of the Committee are welcome. I hope that there is a genuine reconsideration, and I look forward to debating amendments on Report that will give effect to the desire to give local government far wider autonomy. But we contend that clause 26 is unnecessary. It gives the Secretary of State a power that is in addition to the many controls and powers that he already possesses. It is an unnecessary power. We should not allow the Secretary of State to fetter the wide discretion that Ministers are willing to give the assembly through the powers in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The clause affects not only clause 25, but clause 27. Clause 27 deals with the general power of the authority, which is referred to in relation to the exercise of the powers in clause 25. That makes clause 26 thoroughly all-embracing.
<P>
I have always said that the Deputy Prime Minister will be the first mayor because of clause 26. The question that I want to put to the Minister was best summed up by my hon. Friend the Member for Chipping Barnet and relates to guidance. If the mayor had campaigned against road pricing and the Secretary of State decided to give guidance to the effect that it should be introduced, who would prevail? Would the mandate of the mayor, who had been elected on the pledge not to introduce road pricing, be overridden? If so, that would confirm my view as to who the first mayor of London will be. How we respond to that problem depends on the Minister's answer.
<P>
<H5>9 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I am happy to give that answer. I shall start by explaining the significance of clause 26 in the context of its position between clauses 25 and 27. The hon. Member for Croydon, South rightly and perceptively recognised that it is an important clause. It is one of three that define the authority's role, remit and method of operation.
<P>
The hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood asked why guidance was necessary. The answer is that we are dealing with a new type of authority with a strategic remit and a relatively limited number of specific powers. It is, however, being given a wider general power to pursue policies that have a beneficial effect on the economic, social and environmental well-being of London. We discussed earlier some of the wider ramifications of the definitions of those terms. Given the authority's wider remit, there is inevitably scope for it to trample on the toes of other bodies that have specific remits in the areas that I mentioned. That is why when we come to clause 27 we will consider the specific safeguards that have been put in place to ensure that the authority does not trample on other bodies, but can co-operate with them. Careful safeguards have been put in place.
<P>
We are dealing with a new structure of government and are inevitably moving into relatively uncharted waters. In that context, it is perefectly proper for the Secretary of State to issue guidance on how the powers in the clauses before us can best be used in the spirit in which we prepared them.
 <P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> Given that the Minister is saying that we need guidance because we are dealing with a new authority, will not the clause be needed only temporarily? The Secretary of State does not need the power in perpetuity.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes an interesting point. Clearly, guidance will serve its main purpose at the outset. If difficulties arise, however, because of an interpretation or misinterpretation of the relationships by the GLA or other bodies, the Secretary of State might subsequently need to issue guidance. It would, therefore not be helpful to restrict guidance to the early stage.
<P>
The hon. Member for Chipping Barnet questioned the force of the guidance. We have been careful in the phrasing of the clause. The term is guidance, not direction. The GLA must, however, consider the guidance carefully and will be required by the clause to have regard to it. It is not for me to give a definitive interpretation of statute. As all hon. Members know, that is ultimately for the courts to do. I should say, however, that we want the GLA to consider the guidance carefully. If it chooses to operate in a way that conflicts with it, it must have carefully thought through the implications and have exceptionally good reasons for its actions. If we were saying that the Secretary of State had power to direct, that would have a different force. We are saying that the Secretary of State has the power to issue guidance, and that the authority must have regard to that guidance.
<P>
<B>Sir Sydney Chapman:</B> I do not want to be pedantic, but surely that guidance leans more towards direction than, for example, advice. I do not necessarily expect an answer now, but will the Minister reflect on whether "advice"may be more appropriate in these circumstances?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I have either the advantage or the disadvantage of not having received a legal training. Therefore, I shall not choose to enter the interesting territory of the difference between guidance and advice. However, there is a long tradition of Secretaries of State being empowered to give guidance on a range of issues. For example, in our Department we issue planning policy guidance to local authorities, and they are required to have regard to that. This is very much part of the understanding of our constitutional framework, and we are trying to follow it in these arrangements.
<P>
We are not, as I stressed, imposing a blanket direction; we are seeking to offer guidance that will help the new authority to move into territory that is not entirely familiar, and to do so in a way that follows its objectives. There must not, however, be unnecessary conflict with other bodies which have responsibilities in related areas.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> We are badly in need of guidance. We are none of us lawyers, and the Minister admitted to having had no legal training. The persons who might have to take note of such guidance in clause 26 (2) might not be legal experts. It is crucial that we define clearly what is meant by the term.
<P>
The Minister says that the Government expect that those receiving guidance will-that was the verb that he used-have due regard to it, and will also have regard to the consequences of not following that guidance. Can he spell out what those consequences might be? There is an implied threat here, which I find disconcerting. It leads me to suppose that this will be much more than advice and closer to direction, as my hon. Friend the Member for Chipping Barnet pointed out.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The hon. Gentleman is misconstruing my comments. There is no purpose in the Secretary of State issuing guidance if the guidance can be loosely or lightly disregarded. That is not the purpose of guidance. Equally, as I have said clearly and will repeat, it is not our objective to issue binding directions that will allow no discretion to the Greater London authority. We expect the authority to have regard to the guidance. That is clearly in statute. Therefore, I expressed the view that it would not be appropriate for the GLA to disregard, without good reasons, the guidance contained in 
whatever is published by the Secretary of State. However, that is for the GLA to determine. I cannot bind that authority in advance, and I would not wish or intend to do so.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst, who seen conflict everywhere, was worried that the GLA would be overruled by a whim of the Secretary of State of the day. I hope that he will understand from what I have said that that is not the position. We are not giving the Secretary of State power to overrule, to direct, the GLA. We are giving the Secretary of State power to issue guidance, to help the authority understand the territory into which it will be moving. That will involve relationships with other bodies rather different from those which have existed in the past, and there will inevitably be scope for misunderstanding and disagreement. In helping to achieve a smooth introduction of the new authority in such circumstances, the Secretary of State's guidance will, I believe, perform a useful and positive function.
<P>
The hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam indicated that he welcomed the Government's broad approach, but believed that we should not issue guidance. Now that he has heard my description of why it is necessary and how we intend to use it, I hope that he will recognise that it is sensible and appropriate rather than threatening, and will not feel obliged to vote against clause stand part.
<P>
The guidance that the Secretary of State will provide will set the context of the authority's use of the general power. We do not intend that the guidance will stifle the authority's ability to act flexibly, co-operating with other agencies. We expect it to tackle London's problems, promote London's interests and ensure that the areas in which it chooses to operate are appropriate to the general purposes of the authority. I hope that hon. Members recognise the value and importance of the clause and will vote that it stands part of the Bill.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> It seems tha we have inadvertently, on a wet Tuesday night in early February, stumbled on the crux of the arguments about the authority-that is, who will run London? In my speech, I asked the Minister a question about a candidate who had a mandate to oppose
[Mr. Ottaway]

<p>road pricing. I now realise that that was a bad example. The mayor will have no discretion about road pricing, because clauses 200 and 201 give those powers to the Secretary of State.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I apologise to the hon. Gentleman for not responding to his question. I had meant to do so, but unfortunately I overlooked that part of my notes. I shall now give him the answer. The road-pricing powers in the Bill, which we shall debate in due course, are permissive rather than mandatory. They enable the authority to introduce a scheme if it wishes to do so. The Secretary of State provides the power, but it is for the mayor to determine whether it is wished to introduce a road pricing scheme. I hope that that answers the hon. Gentleman's question.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> Has the hon. Gentleman not read the Bill?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I am particularly obliged to the Minister for his reply. I am also comforted by the Minister for Transport in London's aside. I had taken clauses 200 and 201 to mean that the Secretary of State will be introducing road-user charging and non-residential parking place levies, and I am glad to hear that that is not necessarily the case.
<P>
The thrust of my point is that if the mayor has a mandate for a policy and the Secretary of State issues guidance in conflict with it, which of them will prevail?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The hon. Gentleman referred to clauses 200 and 201. I should like to clarify the wording of those clauses. Clause 200 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>" The Secretary of State may by regulations make provision for and in connection with the establishment and operation by or on behalf of-
 (a)the Authority... of schemes for imposing charges."
<P>
That makes provision only for such schemes to be introduced: it does not give the Secretary of State the power to introduce them. If the hon. Gentleman is still confused and uncertain about that, let me reassure him. The power is permissive-it allows a structure that will enable the mayor to make decisions about London.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked about guidance. I have already made it clear that the guidance in clause 26 is guidance to which we expect the Greater London authority to have regard. It is not a mandatory direction and the GLA would clearly be able, in certain circumstances, not fully to implement the guidance issued by the Secretary of State. However, if the GLA was felt to have acted in a way that was irresponsible in ignoring guidance and in not properly taking account of matters that the Secretary of State had drawn to its attention, it could possibly find itself in difficulties. I would expect the authority to act responsibly and to have regard to the guidance in reaching its decisions on the implementation of policies.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I believe that the Minister is not fully able to answer my question because, in truth, there is no answer to it. I do not belittle what he said, but there is a physical limit to the definition of this issue. He talked about irresponsible behaviour by the mayor, but if the policy was utterly consistent with the mayor's manifesto and involved a high-profile issue, a fundamental conflict would occur. A clause such as clause 26 in a Bill of this type will lead to problems.

<B>Mr. Forth:</B> We come now to a crucial element of the Bill and therefore of the relationship between the mayor and the assembly. It is obvious that 
the Government intend the mayor to have the sole power to interpret the aims that are set out in clause 25, with the assembly having no role whatever. That seems to be directly at odds with the thrust of what the Government have sought to argue up until now-that the authority as a whole acts on behalf of the people of London and that we can be reassured that the assembly is there to provide checks and balances on what the mayor does.
<P>
In the debate about the possible removal of the mayor, we were told repeatedly that we should not be too concerned because the assembly had the power to monitor what the mayor was getting up to and to check him if necessary. The truth, however, is set out in clause 27 for all to see. In the Government's mind, it is the mayor and the mayor alone who has the vital power of interpreting the meaning of clause 25. The mayor is therefore being given absolute primacy and superiority in determining what the authority will do on behalf of the people of London. I am not at all reassured by that.
<P>
If we are to proceed with this venture-although I have said from the outset that I do not want to proceed with it, it appears to be well under way-we must find the best way of bringing about this new and, as the Minister
 <P>
admitted a few moments ago, highly experimental measure about which we can know very little. The onus is on the Committee and the House-and, indeed, another place-to give the maximum reassurance to the people of London that we will provide safeguards for them against all reasonable eventualities. There is a danger that the clause will allow the mayor to drive the authority in ways over which the assembly will have little or no influence or say.
<P>
The amendments-to which I am happy to see that other hon. Members have added their names-would balance the authority's power by prescribing that the assembly must play its full and proper role with the mayor in making these important determinations on how the authority as a whole, bearing in mind what members have said to the electorate in manifestos and programmes and on platforms, will interpret and carry out the provisions of clause 25 for the benefit of the people of London.
<P>
The clause is one of the most important elements of the Bill. The Opposition will listen to the Minister, but I hope that Ministers will accept on reflection that it is entirely unsatisfactory. It gives no reassurance to Londoners about what they might expect as a crucial constitutional check on the mayor's activities. It is not good enough to say that in embarking on this experiment we must be able to trust anyone whom the people of London elect. Suppose that a person is elected by a narrow majority in the peculiar electoral process that has been wished upon us. Suppose that the mayor and the people elected to the assembly have rather different views.
<P>
It is wrong that under the clause the mayor's views will be the only ones that count, and that the members who have taken such trouble to be elected to the assembly will have no say at this crucial early stage in the interpretation of what is to happen about the direction in which the authority will take the people of London. That cannot be right, and my amendments seek simply to ensure a proper role for the assembly, which should work in concert with the mayor or, if necessary, counterbalance his or her views. That would ensure that we proceed in a proper, reassuring and transparent way that does not become out of control or out of balance with the wishes of the people of London, as expressed through the ballot box.
<P>
The matter is of great importance. I hope that Ministers will reflect on that importance, and on the fact that what they have said in the Committee appears to be seriously at odds with the Bill. My amendments seek to bring the Bill into line with Ministers' views and aspirations.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I call Mr. Burstow.
<P>
<B>Mr. McNulty:</B> Oh dear!
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I am delighted that at least one hon. Member has reacted in that way.
<P>
I shall briefly explain why the Liberal Democrats support the amendments, although I fear that they would not bring the Bill into line with the Government's intentions.
<P>
As has been said, the clause and the two debated before it are the framework in which a power of general competence will operate. They must be read in the context of other powers provided for in the Bill, in terms both of strategies and the authority's individual functions. In that respect, we shall have to examine closely clause 36, which makes it clear that the Secretary of State will be able to direct the shape and content of strategies, and will therefore ultimately be able to dictate whether road pricing and any other change comes to pass. That is why the amendments are so important now. When the Committee reaches that clause, the Liberal Democrats will seek agreement on clear amendments, and I hope to delete the provision from the Bill.
<P>
Liberal Democrats think it important that a balance between the assembly and mayor is restored. In exercising the power of general competence, the mayor must not just have regard for how the powers are to be exercised, but must actively engage with the assembly and "co-decide"with it on that question. The Government must take that point on board, not least in terms of the general power, if they are still minded not to accept any amendments that affect strategies. It appears that the assembly is to have no locus in terms of detailed policies and strategies other than to comment and to hope that the mayor will take its comments on board. If that is so, it is essential, when developing the institution-a point clearly in Minister's minds when the Bill was drafted-to ensure from the outset that Londoners can be confident that the assembly will provide an effective check on the wide power in the Bill. We welcome that power, but strongly believe that it needs to be exercised jointly.

<P>

<B>Mr. McNulty:</B> The right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst and the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam-if they will indulge me, as the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood kindly said he had done earlier-are bankrupt in what they say, because they are looking for checks where there are none. They should not be looking for constitutional checks in this clause, which appear elsewhere, as has been said ad nauseam.
<P>
The aim of the Bill is clear, and has been since the manifesto: an executive mayor and an assembly that will scrutinise the mayor and keep him in check thereafter. Clause 27 simply puts into perspective the executive mayor's functions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow rose-</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. McNulty:</B> The hon. Gentleman will only bore me, but he may go on.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I probably shall bore the hon. Gentleman, but I want to clarify his argument. Is it that because the Labour party manifesto proposed an executive mayor and an assembly to scrutinise him, there is somehow no case to argue that there should be additional checks and balances? I hope that the hon. Gentleman will consider that there are plenty of examples of executive mayors around the world who are subject to far greater scrutiny than is provided by the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. McNulty:</B> I do not doubt that, but we are not running round the world looking to replace anything else; we are looking for the most appropriate model for Greater London. If it is an astonishing revelation that all
 {**p15Z[Mr. McNulty]

<p4**}of a sudden a Labour Government are implementing what was in the Labour party's manifesto, blow me down dead. That is exactly what the clause is about; as we said, the checks are elsewhere. <P>
When we reach amendment No. 26 onward, I should like to return to discover some of the other more fatuous and obtuse points made by the Liberal Democrats, in particular-this time without the assistance of the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst. However, the amendment is nothing short of a nasty little wrecking amendment-and why would it not be with the name of the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst attached to it?-that is intended to do down the executive mayor and assembly model that we propose, and it should be resisted at all cost.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> I was frightened by the taunt of the hon. Member for Harrow, East, who suggested that we might be easily bored. Far from it. These amendments are extremely important. The hon. Gentleman may regard them as fatuous and obtuse; he may even think that Opposition Members are bankrupt and looking for checks. We are not. We are merely seeking to ensure that the Bill represents in its wording what was put to the people of London in the Labour party manifesto and at the hustings: that there would be an authority, consisting of a mayor and an assembly who would work in partnership for betterment of London. [Interruption.] I welcome the rather sinister figure of the hon Member for Ealing, North (Mr. Pound), the gallant sea dog, to the Committee. There is no concept of partnership in clause 27 (1) and subsection (2).
<P>
The assembly and the mayor are elected for the same term on the same basis, and the electors believe that their assembly men have a worthwhile function in seeking to influence the mayor in the exercise of his powers, and to use such opportunities as the assembly's meetings provide to ensure that the policies of the mayorality accord with the wishes of their constituents, on the part of constituency members, and of Londoners as a whole, on the part of London assembly men.
<P>
If we are to have a concept of the mayoralty that is one of genuine democracy, not autocracy, we should support the amendment tabled by my right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst, which was supported in an enlightened way by the Liberal Democrat Members who append their names to it.
<P>
I hope that the Government will think again and will not give all power to the mayor. It is an illusion of power, because power will reside with the Secretary of State, as my hon. Friend the Member of Croydon, South explained. Nevertheless, we 
might at least have democratic illusions, rather than autocratic ones.
<P>
<B>Mr. Darvill:</B> The White Paper set out clearly the division of powers between the assembly and the mayor. Paragraphs 3.54 and 3.55 list the assembly's powers. When they voted in the referendum, Londoners were aware of the division of those powers. The amendment would blur those powers and cause considerable conflict, and should therefore, be opposed.
<P>
<H5>9.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Mr. Raynsford The amendments would make the authority's general power to act to further the general exercisable not only by the major but by the mayor and assembly acting jointly. That shows that Opposition Members have completely failed to grasp the essence of the new form of government that we are creating in London, predicated as it is on a separation of powers between the mayor, who is in the executive, and the assembly, which will fulfull the scrutiny function.
<P>
The hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood made the point that the mayor and assembly will be elected on the same day. He is absolutely right about that. However, he went on to say that they would be elected on the same basis, which is not correct. They will be elected by separate elections for the mayor and the assembly will have separate purposes. Those separate purposes are intinsic to this structure of government,
<P>
The mayor will exercise the majority of the authority's functions, including the power to promote the authority's general purpose. The assembly will hold the mayor to account for the decisions that he or she takes. That is a model for good, accountable administration.
<P>
The amendment is entirely at odds with that structure. How would the assembly provide adequate scrutiny of the exercise of powers carried out under the general power if it were partly responsible for exercisable those powers itself? How could it possibly scrutinise? The separation of powers between the mayor and the assembly would be fundamentally weakened.
<P>
The amendment makes no reference to how the mayor and the assembly would decide on what action should be taken under the general power. Would total agreement between the mayor and the assembly be necessary before a decision could be taken? The amendment is mute on that. If consensus were required in all cases, that would inevitably lead to deadlock, when the point of what we propose is to enable the authority, acting through the mayor, to adopt a flexible and dynamic approach to tackling London's problems.
<P>
The assembly will share in the authority's general purpose of promoting economic and social development in London and the improvement of the environment in London. The general purpose will condition the assembly's activities, including the scrutiny of the mayor, and the nature of its inquiries into issues of importance to London. However, it is only right that the mayor alone should be able to take executive action to further the general purpose. To give shared powers to the assembly would weaken the structure that we want to create.
<P>
Under clause 50, the assembly will be able to submit proposals to the mayor, which could include proposals for particular actions to be carried out under the general proposals for particular actions to be carried out under the general power, to which the mayor will have to respond. The assembly is not by any means powerless, as Opposition Members have suggested. On the contrary, it has important powers.
<P>
The key point of the proposal is to ensure that the distinct powers of the assembly as against the powers of
 <P>
the mayor are recognised and that that is not confused, as would be the case if the amendment were passed. I urge the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst to withdraw his amendment. If he does not, I urge my hon. Friends to vote against it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> I thank the Minister for his explanation, but I am far from reassured-in fact, I am beginning to be scared. We face the prospect of an experiment in the government of the large city of London-an experiment about which, as the Minister has admitted, we can know little at this stage. We are embarking on a process to create the new political entity of the authority and the new constitutional function of an excecutive mayor. We have been told that once the mayor is elected, nothing can be done to remove him or curtail his activities-for the benefit of the ladies on the Labour Benches, I use "he"in the Champaneseque sense.
<P>
What I find unsettling is that the Minister is asking us to trust him and his Bill, and to accept that the mayor will be a splendid person, that we need not at this stage give the assembly any effective input into the process by which decisions will be taken or worry about the fact that even if the mayor goes badly wrong he cannot be removed, because the electorate can have its say in the future. That is not and cannot be good enough. We cannot be assured that all will be for the best in the best of all possible worlds, when we have almost nothing in the way of checks and balances. The Minister has tried to say that those issued will all be dealt with later in the Bill and that the assembly will have an input into the process, but the clause gives the game away. We can see clearly what is going to happen-the mayor will drive the process, for good or bad.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> My right hon. Friend is making a forceful and cogent speech that, for those who care about democracy, has a strong ethical content. Surely a good mayoralty will be one in which the mayor will pursue policies that have the majority support of the assembly. The mayor should seek that support of the assembly. The mayor should seek that support; by doing so, he would be acting in a way that constituents who have returned members of the assembly would support. If that does not happen, we are on the way to an autocracy without any effective control.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend because he points to the hint-it is more than a hint; it is virtually an instruction-given in the wording of the Bill that the Government are saying to the mayor, "Go on with what you think is right and do not worry at this stage about what the assembly people may think-they may or may not have some input later on."The only person whom the mayor seems to need to worry about is the Secretary of State. That surely cannot be what was intended.
<P>
So the thing is skewed and we are being sold a false bill of goods. There is a danger that elections to the assembly will be almost a waste of time and that the key players in this unfolding but unpredictable scenario will be the mayor and the Secretary of State. I must therefore press my amendment to a vote.

<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> The amendments are designed to widen the Bill's scope to allow the authority to deal with such issues, as homelessness in London, further education and health, which we have already discussed in previous sittings.
<P>
I shall briefly speak to amendment No. 26-on homelessness-and to amendment No. 116, which deals with further education. I shall seek, in speaking to amendment No. 28, clarification of the Government's thinking on the authority's powers to provide support and training for its staff, given that the Bill seems to exclude it from that role.
<P>
We tabled amendments Nos. 26 and 116 because it is important that the strategic authority for London has a role in dealing with homelessness. Homelessness is no respecter of London boundaries. There is undoubtedly a growing problem of homelessness in the capital. The number of homeless people is continuing to rise from last year's figure of 30,000, The Government have acknowledged the problem of rough sleeping and have launched an initiative to deal with it. That should come withint the ambit of the Greater London authority. We hope that the Government will tell us how they think the authority will deal with homelessness.
<P>
<P>
<B>Mr. McNulty:</B> How can the Greater London authority have competence for homelessness when it will not be a housing authority?
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> In exactly the same way as the Department has established a tsar position to co-ordinate such matters. Ministers have already told us on several occasions that the authority will have a co-ordinating role in a number of issues. We tabled the amendment to provide an opportunity for Ministers to tell us whether they think that the authority has a locus in such matters.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gapes:</B> I am concerned about the wording of the amendment. Presumably, homelessness is dealt with either by providing people with existing houses or by building new ones. Under an earlier subsection, the authority will be precluded from dealing with housing matters. Nevertheless, it could do something about homelessness if the amendment were adopted. Will the hon. Gentleman clarify the wording of the amendment, which seems ambiguous? In particular, will he tell us what the relationship would be between his proposal and the housing provision of the existing boroughs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I am not certain whether the hon. Gentleman's Whip will necessarily want me to follow the path that he suggests, but I am happy to explore in detail the issues that he has raised. The Government have already acknowledged that there is a London-wide aspect to dealing with the problem of homelessness. They have already identified the need to provide additional funds and co-ordination. Therefore, we believe that there should be an overall strategy that is democratically accountable to Londoners.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman made the perfectly fair point that there should be appropriate levels of funding to provide additional social housing. One of the problems is that the Government have not provided that additional funding-certainly not to the scale that is needed-and I regret that fact.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gapes:</B> Even if I accepted that argument, the amendment does not deal with that question. The wording of the amendment, if accepted, would sow confusion in the Bill and lead to an enormous problem. I suggest that the hon. Gentleman proposes a more coherent amendment that reflects what he is trying to say.
<P>
<H5>9.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I have listened to what the hon. Gentleman has to say, but my view is that the amendment is clear and that its purpose has been outlined this evening. We will listen closely to what the Minister has to say in a moment.
<P>
I move on to amendment No. 116, which deals with the issue of further education. We believe that there is a substantial democratic deficit in relation to the accountability of what is an important sector in London and in the country generally. The amendment would bring democratic accountability for further education within the ambit of the Greater London authority. We would like to hear the Government's thinking on such a change in relation to education, which we believe to be important.
<P>
<B>Mr. McNulty:</B> I ask a question that is germane to amendment No. 116. Will the hon. Gentleman define what he means by further education?: Is it further Education Funding Council provision? Is it all post-16 provision short of higher education? Does it include adult provision by local education authorities? Can the hon. Gentleman be specific?
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> The hon. Gentleman has used the word "fatuous"on a number of occasions, and I think that his intervention counts as a fairly fatuous one. If he wants to pursue his question later, I shall provide a further answer.
<P>
Amendment No. 28 has been tabled to enable the Government to clarify a point about which we are concerned. The authority has some specific powers in respect of providing certain services to its staff, but it may be explicitly precluded from undertaking the education and training of staff. I am sure that that is not the intention behind the Bill, and that the Minister can clarify that, but we tabled the amendment to test the Government on that point. We believe that the authority's ambit can be widened in these respects.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> As I listened to the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam, I was reminded of the maxim, "Why use a rapier when a bludgeon will do?"We are totally unable to support the Liberal Democrat amendments; we do not believe that the mayor's power should be expanded in such a manner. Indeed, the Conservative and Liberal Democrat amendments, which are grouped together, are diametrically opposed to one another.
<P>
The thrust of our amendments revolves round the fact that the clause allows the authority to incure expenditure provided that it is acting in co-operation with the housing, education, social or health services of London borough councils, the common council or any other public body. Instead of simply suggesting co-operation, the clause implies that the authority has an executive function over such bodies. Amendment No. 160 clarifies that situation and asserts the authority of borough councils. While we advocate co-operation, there must be a clearly defined sphere of power within which the boroughs cannot be coerced by the authority. Amendment No. 159 deals with lack of clarity in relation to the possibility that temporary housing could be provided for refugees, for example, if the mayor chose to do so. We think that that should be clarified, and that such a possibility should be excluded. The hon. Member for Harrow, East was right to point out that the authority is not a housing authority.
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> As the hon. Member for Croydon, South said, in introducing his amendments, the amendments cancel one another out. The amendments spoken to by the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam would appear to give the mayor additional powers, but the amendment in the name of the hon. Member for Croydon, South would reduce the Bill's powers.
<P>
On the amendment in the name of the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam, we made it abundantly clear that we do not want the borough's statutory responsibilities to be eroded by the mayor or duplicated by the authority. Moreover, given the Bill's provisions, that would not be possible. The hon. Gentleman discussed homelessness and further education. I am in as much of a quandary
 <P>
about what precisely is meant by further education as my hon. Friend the Member for Harrow, East.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman touched, yet again, on the Liberal Democrats' desire to create a health authority for London and to repose its terms of reference clearly within the remit of the mayor and the assembly. He also touched on training, and was somewhat scurrilous in his allegation that the Government have provided no additional funds for the creation of housing. We have provided 5 billion-no negligible sum-which will be directed exclusively at the creation of housing. That sum constitutes additional funds under anyone's definition of the phrase.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman referred to a tsar, especially in relation to homelessness. If the boroughs decided that it would help them if the mayor acted in a co-ordinated way to ensure that homelessness in a London-wide context involved such an approach, nothing would prevent the boroughs and the mayor from working together in that way. We shall later discuss health, but I must repeat that we do not presuppose that the mayor should provide such services-that has never been our intention-although there is a clear requirement on the mayor to make the health of Londoners one among many desirable outcomes.
<P>
On the training that the GLA will provide, it was somewhat bizarre of the hon. Gentleman to criticise the training that will be offered to employees of the assembly before it has been formed and before any employment agreements have been entered into.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> In all honesty, I was not attempting to be critical of the Government or of the GLA. I merely wanted to establish the import of clause 27 (8), which refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>" the provision of health services"
<P>
for staff, but does not mention education or training. Does the fact that those matters are excluded from the clause mean that the authority will not be able to act in those areas? I was asking an honest question rather than trying to make a criticism, and I hope that I will receive a reciprocal answer.

<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I would hope that my replies are always honest. The authority will clearly be required to be a good employer, and part and parcel of being a good employer involves providing the facilities to which the hon. Gentleman referred.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I apologise to the Minister for delaying her speech, but why was it necessary to make a specific reference to health in clause 27 (8)? surely, the provision of health services for staff is also a natural part of what large employers wish to furnish. The London fire and civil defence authority already does that.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I thought that I had already answered the hon. Gentleman's question. Part and parcel of being a good employer means that the authority will provide for its employees.
<P>
The amendments that were tabled by the hon. Member for Croydon, South would remove from the authority the power to, for example, acquire housing and to make it available on a temporary basis in pursuit of its purposes. We do not envisage-nor is the relevant power available in the Bill-that the GLA will become a housing authority in the sense that the phrase applies to local authorities. However, if, for example, the GLA was engaged in a regenerative scheme and it was necessary to decant occupants from certain houses during the regeneration, it would be entirely illogical if the authority did not have the power to acquire temporary housing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> Is the Minister therefore suggesting that the GLA should have compulsory purchase powers? The boroughs would consider that a serious extension of the potential capabilities of the authority.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> It is not my understanding that local authorities with an existing statutory responsibility to house people can do so only via the route of compulsory purchase. It is entirely possible for a local authority to be able to rent outside its area in certain circumstances, usually to provide temporary housing. The short answer to the hon. Gentleman's question is no.
<P>
In the hope that I have answered the questions put to me by the hon. Members for Sutton and Cheam and for Croydon, South, I urge that the amendment be withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I have listened to the Minister, but she has not adequately responded to our concerns; we intend to press the amendment to a Division.

On resuming-
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey </B>(Kingston and Surbiton): I beg to move amendment No. 29, in page 16, leave out lines 21 to 26.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, it will be convenient to take the following amendments:
{**p15Z[The Chairman]

<p4**}No. 31, in page 16, line 25, leave out "or a public body". <P>
No. 32, in page 16, leave out lines 27 and 28.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> During our debate on clause 26 stand part, Conservative Members expressed concern about the dictatorial powers being taken by the Secretary of State. We had some sympathy with them. However, they should have held their fire until this clause, subsections (10) and (11) of which our amendments would delete. If both subsections remain in the Bill, they will effectively make a mockery of this Committee's proceedings. They take to the Secretary of State the power to make an order preventing the authority from doing almost anything. Subsection (11) gives the Secretary of State draconian powers for capping. This would effectively denude the authority of genuine democratic power and give the lie to the idea that the Bill creates democratic government for London.
<P>
The powers are the equivalent of allowing the right hon. Member for Henley (Mr. Heseltine) to intervene before breakfast, before lunch and before dinner. They are extremely dictatorial, and are a recipe for unprecedented central interference. One wonders why they were proposed and whether they were a backstop in the event of the election of a mayor of whom the Secretary of State disapproved. We are greatly concerned about the provisions. The keeping of so much power to the Secretary of State renders the authority's democratic credentials a sham. Therefore, as a true believer in democracy, I must hope that members of the Committee will study subsections (10) and (11) with care, and support our amendments, thus removing the provisions from the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> As far as I can see, the deletion of subsections (10) and (11) would damage London boroughs. I am not sure that the Liberal Democrats really mean what they say, but as regards this part of the clause, the amendment is not one that we can support.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I cannot accept the amendments, which, as the hon. Member for Croydon, South rightly said, would have more or less the opposite effect of what Liberal Democrat Members have argued for during most of the Committee stage so far. This shows that, once again, they have failed to understand the purpose of the amendments.
<P>
I explained in previous debates-most members of the Committee appear to have understood-that it is essential that the mayor should not be able to duplicate the statutory functions of local authorities and other public bodies, especially the London borough councils and the London health authorities. Clause 27 (5) specifies the functions that the GLA cannot incur expenditure in undertaking. The list is intentionally not exhaustive. We wish to give the GLA the widest possible scope for co-operation with other authorities and bodies, to ensure that London gets the best quality services. But we also believe that it is necessary to give those authorities reassurance that if the GLA does attempt to intrude into matters that are their statutory responsibility, without co-operation, the Secretary of State will have the power to add further functions, and the functions of further bodies, to the list set out in clause 27 (5), on which the GLA cannot incur expenditure. I hope that the use of those powers will never be necessary, but their availability is necessary.
<P>
As I explained, it is not our intention that the GLA should provide those services, in whatever circumstances. We do not intend that it should police the failures of other service providers. When an authority fails in its statutory duties, it will be a matter for central Government. For that reason, we cannot accept an amendment that would change the provision so that it covered services already being provided by the authorities. That would open up the scope for endless litigation and would waste time and money in the courts. When an authority has the discretion to decide whether or not to provide certain services, it will be a matter for that authority and, again, ultimately its electorate.
<P>
I have already explained why we believe that the reserve power to set a limit on expenditure is essential, and I shall not rehearse the arguments again. Needless to say, I find the amendment unacceptable. In the light of what I have said, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw it. If he does not, I hope that my hon. Friends and Conservative Members will vote against it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I do not think that the Minister understood the thrust of our argument. He agreed with the hon. Member for Croydon, South that we would be taking protections away from the London boroughs. There are many protections elsewhere in the Bill, but subsection (10) refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>" preventing the Authority from doing by virtue of subsection (1) above anything... which is specified, or is of a description specified, in the order." <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There is no reference to a borough. It is a very wide power that 
would give the Secretary of State huge ability to intervene.
<P>
The Minister brushed aside our point about extensive capping powers in subsection (11), which is unfortunate. I am sure that many Labour Members, when in opposition, were very concerned about capping powers and probably spoke in many debates against the capping of local authorities. They should be opposing the powers that are now being given to the Secretary of State to stop the GLA-a democratic body, apparently-incurring expenditure.
<P>
We wish to return to the matter, so we shall not press the amendment to a Division, but I hope that the Minister will have a more convincing set of arguments when we do so. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Sir Sydney Chapman:</B> I shall be as brief as possible, as is my wont. Clause 27 is entitled "General power of the Authority". I have looked carefully at the clause and the rest of the Bill, but I see no reference to what I believe is one of the more significant and important items that governs both the economy of our capital city and the employment of its people. I am referring to tourism. That
 <P>
seems to be a glaring omission. The Bill refers to many things, and many amendments have been moved, but there is no mention of tourism. I do not wish to detain the Committee and talk about figures and statistics, but we need an answer from the Government. What relationship is proposed for the mayor, the assembly and tourism, which is of such economic importance in our capital city? What will be the relationship with the London tourist board, which has done an excellent job and should continue to do so? The exact relationship between the new authority and tourism should be spelt out in the Bill.

<P>

<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> I shall address the point raised by the hon. Member for Chipping Barnet. I appreciate his justifiable concern about tourism and its effect on our capital city-an issue which, as we have said more than once, is very important.
<P>
The amendments relating specifically to culture, and those under the overarching title of culture, clearly cover tourism. More detailed amendments will be presented to the Committee later in our proceedings. We frankly admit that the part of the Bill that deals with culture is skeletal, so I trust that he will accept our undertaking to return to the issue with detailed amendments.
<P>
<B>Sir Sydney Chapman:</B> I asked this question on the Floor of the House at Culture, Media and Sport questions yeaterday. The Minister for Tourism, Film and Broadcasting, the hon. Member for Rossendale and Darwen (Janet Anderson), said that I was totally wrong to say that little or nothing was said in the Bill. I am delighted to hear that an amendment will be moved to clarify the position. I rest my case on that.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for resting his case, but it is not something that the Government intend to do. Indeed, the Government are on the record as saying that we shall return to these issues. Clause 262 (5) (a) refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>" the arts, tourism and sport".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We frankly admit that this is skeletal. Amendments will be tabled for the scrutiny of the Committee.
<P>
Clause 27 defines the general power of the authority, which is exercisable by the mayor. The mayor will have the power, subject to certain limitations, to do anything that he or she thinks will further the authority's purpose. The mayor will not be able to incur expenditure in doing anything that may be done by Transport for London, the police and fire authorities and, in particular, the London boroughs. The mayor must also seek to ensure that expenditure is not incurred by doing anything that might duplicate the activities of the LDA.
<P>
The clause makes provision for the proper exercise of the power. It provides a variety of safeguards against the abuse of that power and protects the interests of the London boroughs and other public authorities. We have discussed these issues at some length and I urge that the clause stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 33, in page 16, leave out lines 32 to 34.
<P>
The amendment raises issues to which the Committee will return next week, so I shall be brief. The Government seem to wish to prevent the authority from having any revenue raising powers. Liberal Democrats believe that devolving power and decentralising decision making can only have substance if accompanied by proper financial decentralisation. the Government have shuffled a little in that direction with their permissive proposals for introducing road user charges. We believe they should go much further.
<P>
We propose that the authority should have income tax-raising powers along the lines proposed for the Scottish Parliament, and preferably more radical than those. We hope to debate those fully in this Committee. The amendment seeks to delete part of the clause to enable the Committee to come back to the issue when we consider the financial provisions to-[Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Will the hon. Member for Ealing, North please return to his seat so we can hear what the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton has to say?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> Thank you, Mr. Stevenson. If the Committee accepts the amendment we could come back to the issue to ensure that the Greater London Authority will have a decent set of financial powers, including tax-raising powers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> Clause 28 provides for the authority to do anything that is calculated to facilitate, or is conducive or incidental to the exercise of its functions, including the functions under its general power. It is the equivalent of section 111 of the Local Government Act 1972.
<P>
Such powers enable authorities to do several things that they are not specifically empowered to do provided that they relate in a demonstrable way to one or more express functions. Subsection (2), which the amendment would delete, makes it clear that the power is not a way around the controls on GLA finance. That clarification is also found in section 111 of the Local Government Act 1972.
<P>
It may be that in seeking to remove the subsection, the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton had a kneejerk reaction against anything that appeared to be a constraint
{**p15Z[Mr. Raynsford]

<p4**} on the GLA. But I cannot think that he seriously proposes that the GLA should to be able to get round the local government finance regime. If that is his intention, perhaps he could make it clear to the Committee. <P>
The local government finance regime is the means by which central Government safeguards their strong interests in local government's spending and taxation decisions, which account for about a quarter of public expenditure. Through the Local Government Bill, we are, of course, making changes to enhance local financial accountability. There is absolutely no question of allowing the GLA, uniquely, to operate outside those controls. Therefore, I urge the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<H5>10.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> The Minister clearly does not understand Liberal Democrat's opposition to the local government finance regime, which is why we are pressing amendments such as amendment No.33. We want to revolutionise the organisation of local government finance. [Interruption.] I shall not take the bait and detain the Committee by explaining in detail our plans for revoluntionising local government finance. We shall save that for a later sitting, and leave the hon. Member for Mitcham and Morden (Siobhain McDonagh) in anticipation of the details of our policies. For tonight, I beg to ask to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> I shall be brief, but I want to repeat my earlier question. As I read it, clause 28 (1) would not preclude the compulsory purchase of a property by the Greater London Authority. In the past, local authorities have flagrantly abused such powers. If the assurances that the Minister for Transport in London gave me is to be meaningful, preclusion of compulsory purchase should be made explicit in the Bill. Subsection (1) is permissive. I should like further reassurance from the ministerial team.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I think that I can put the hon. Gentleman's mind at rest. As I explained earlier, subsection (1) provides for a permissive power, which is still ancillary to the powers in the previous three clauses. It is appropriate that powers exist to enable the authority to discharge the functions that the previous clauses empower it to.
<P>
I assure the hon. Gentleman that we do not propose to give the Greater London authority compulsory purchase powers. His fears that the subsection will enable the authority to exercise compulsory purchase powers are therefore groundless.
<P>
 I hope that the hon. Gentlemen accepts that the clause should stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<H4><center>Clause 31</center></H4>
<H4><center>Delegation of functions exercisable</center></H4>
by the Mayor
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 34, in page 17, line 37, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>" (aa) the Assembly;".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment goes back to earlier discussions. It reasserts our view that the assembly should have a greater role in the conduct of business within the authority in the undertaking of its functions. It would include the assembly as one of the bodies to which the mayor could choose to delegate functions, and I hope that the Ministers will accept it.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Kate Hoey):</B> The hon. Gentleman has been honest. His amendment goes to the heart of the differences between the Government and the Liberal Democrats over the entire Bill. We had some discussion on a similar theme earlier.
<P>
Hon. Members will not be surprised to hear that I cannot accept the amendment, which would enable the mayor to delegate functions to the assembly. Such a proposal would undermine the clear separation of powers that we have proposed between the mayor-the executive arm of the authority, and the assembly. We have been clear about that from the start.
<P>
We should consider for a moment what the amendment would mean in practice. I want the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam to withdraw it. As the Bill makes clear, the assembly will question the mayor on the exercise of his or her functions, and will be able to summon people and papers to ensure that the authority's decision-taking procedures are open and accountable.
<P>
How would the assembly be able to scrutinise the exercise of functions delegated to it by the mayor? Are the Liberal Democrats seriously suggesting that the assembly could on the one hand exercise certain executive functions, and on the other hold itself to account for the exercise of those functions? The amendment would inevitably make the authority's decision-taking procedures less transparent and less accountable.
<P>
Furthermore, the delegation of functions from mayor to assembly would undermine the assembly's autonomy because it would become answerable to the mayor for the exercise of delegated functions. That would not be healthy for accountable administration. The scrutineer would in effect answer to the executive, blurring the clear delineation of responsibilities which we have set out in the Bill.
<P>
The Government have made their position clear. The hon. Gentleman knows that and I doubt whether he would expect us to accept his amendment. I ask him to withdraw it.
