Webb</b> (Northavon) (LD): I look forward to hearing what the
right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border has to say about the
amendments that he tabled, when he has had chance to work it out. This
group of amendments is different from that which we debated previously
because, since our sitting on Thursday, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column345" />Column number: 345</div>two more measures have been added: amendment
No. 110, which we tabled, and new clause 22. For the benefit
of members of the Committee who might not have had chance to look at
amendment No. 110, it questions the decision to restrict the number of
pilots under clause
70(2).</div><a name="08070873000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
approach is to allow 1,000 flowers to bloom, not five. There are big
variations among local authorities. Urban, rural, and multi-tier
authorities have different waste streams and structures for dealing
with waste. In light of that, there is a huge amount of learning to be
done. While I would not dream of accusing the Department of doing this,
the present Prime Minister has a tendency to want to control things.
Although, in one sense, the provision is enabling and saying,
&#147;Let there be pilots,&#148; there must always be a
&#147;but&#148; at the end, which is that we can have only five
pilots. That is
unnecessary.</div><a name="08070873000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Bill refers to five pilots, so if the Government invited proposals for
pilots and received 10 good ideas, they would be obliged to throw away
five of them because, under statute, they will not be allowed to have
more than five pilots. If the Government think that five pilots are all
they can cope with, they are perfectly at liberty to decide to do that
after receiving submissions, but to pre-empt looking at the pilots
before they have even seen them is wrong, which is why my hon. Friend
the Member for Cheltenham and I want to remove the
stipulation.</div><a name="08070873000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 108 would exclude from participation in the pilots authorities that
do not undertake weekly collections. As we said on Thursday, some
schemes could be pure incentive schemes; in other words, some pilots
need not be penal. Given that, at worst, they must be revenue-neutral,
they could be net beneficial. Authorities, for whatever reason, that do
not have weekly collections&#151;that might be popular or accepted
locally&#151;should not be precluded from taking part in pilots
whereby they could offer incentives to their residents to improve
recycling. There is a valid debate to be had on weekly or fortnightly
collections and whatever is appropriate in a particular area, but to
preclude whole categories of authorities from running pilots because
they opted in their particular circumstances not to have weekly
collections seems unduly restrictive. We do not therefore support
amendment No.
108.</div><a name="08070873000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have a lot of sympathy with what amendment No. 109 is trying
to do, but it is over-prescriptive. It refers to polystyrene and
Tetrapak, for example, but we could find ourselves constantly amending
legislation to cover new materials. We could certainly have central
Government guidance and initiatives, but if we list specific individual
materials&#151;&#147;metal and aluminium&#148; itself is an
interesting phrase&#151;we would start to see some of the problems in
identification. At the moment, we think that amendment No. 109 is
somewhat
over-specific.</div><a name="08070873000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 18, which was tabled by the hon. Member for Bexhill and Battle
on Thursday, relates to giving authorities the opportunity to cut
council tax by means of an incentive mechanism. In principle, we have
no problem with that. We are perfectly happy for local authorities to
have that freedom. It was not apparent to us that they could not do
that anyway under the Bill. If it is necessary to be explicit, we do
not have a problem with that. However, we would probably need further
legislation to make it happen. For example, imagine a council tenant on
benefit who is on 100 per cent. council tax benefit. My understanding
is that they do not pay the council tax and get the
money back from 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column346" />Column number: 346</div>the Government&#151;they just never pay it.
Therefore, if we wanted to incentivise people who do not pay council
tax at all to cut their waste, it would be odd if their council tax was
reduced and they got council tax benefit in excess of the council tax
that they were paying. That would probably be illegal. Such an
amendment would have knock-on effects, but, in principle, we do not
have a problem with
it.</div><a name="08070873000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
we would be interested to hear what is meant by new clause 22, which
has not yet been spoken to. It would probably be unhelpful for me to
start guessing what it means, so I will draw my remarks to a close, but
I might comment on that new clause once we have heard what it is meant
to
achieve.</div><a name="08070873000029"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08070873000336"></a><b class="B">David
Maclean</b> (Penrith and The Border) (Con): I am grateful to
my hon. Friend the Member for Bexhill and Battle, who leads from the
Front Bench, for moving the amendment that I tabled last Thursday. I
apologise for not being able to be here, but I was on the Floor of the
House dealing with an equally important question as saving the planet:
MPs&#146; pay and
allowances.</div><a name="08070873000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">Where
am I coming from with the amendments? I would not seek to press them to
a vote or to delete the relevant measures, unless the Government
volunteered to do so. However, over the past few weeks we have had
important discussions about saving the planet. We have had discussions
on global warming, carbon emissions, the loss of biodiversity and the
destruction of the rain forest. We have been seeking to do incredibly
noble things with reporting targets for 2050. I am not sure that any
Committee, dealing with any legislation, has attempted to be so
far-sighted or far-reaching. Now, near the end of the Bill, we have
five clauses that are, literally, on garbage&#151;on allowing
councils to come up with what, in some cases, are hare-brained
garbage-collection schemes or innovative recycling schemes. This could
discredit the main purposes of the
Bill.</div><a name="08070873000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have already seen in the newspapers over the past few months stories
about some of the imaginative ideas that councils have had. We have
seen how some of the public have become cynical and disillusioned,
because they believe that the rubbish that they put out is being
recorded by spies or by cameras and microchips in their dustbins. I
believe that there is scope for recycling initiatives. I believe that
the Government should be running pilot schemes under fairly tight
control. However, I do not believe that such measures should be in the
Bill because that takes away from the glorious merits of the
legislation before
us.</div><a name="08070873000032"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070873000337"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural
Affairs (Joan Ruddock):</b> I know that the right hon.
Gentleman was not present when we began the debate in our previous
sitting, but there is a direct connection with the amount of waste that
we householders throw away every year, the majority of which goes to
landfill, producing methane, which is one of the most powerful
greenhouse gases contributing to climate change. He might not think
that it is entirely tidy to have the clauses in the Bill, but there is
an important
connection.</div><a name="08070873000033"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070873000338"></a>David
Maclean:</b> The hon. Lady is right that there is a
connection, but why do we not have clauses on the amount of motoring
that we do, the cars that we buy and the contribution that transport
makes? Why do we not have clauses on peat-land bogs and upland
forests?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column347" />Column number: 347</div><a name="08070873000034"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070873000339"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> The right hon. Gentleman knows that all such
matters are considered in other forms of legislation. We can
do&#151;we are doing&#151;many things to try and move towards
having a low-carbon economy. However, we need the specific legislation,
because we are the only country in the EU15 that does not allow charges
to be applied for waste
collection.</div><a name="08070873000035"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070873000340"></a>David
Maclean:</b> This Bill is a convenient vehicle for the garbage
clauses to be tacked on to. I am not suggesting that they are out of
order because the long title of the Bill permits their inclusion. It is
not just a matter of tidiness, although I do like tidy
legislation&#151;and tidy everything, to be honest. The schedule is
inappropriate because it could disillusion the public with regard to
our main purpose. People in the pilot areas and in other areas will
struggle to put the right sort of material in the right boxes on
whatever day of the week the council deigns to turn up to collect that
sort of recycling material. When they get it wrong and are given
penalties, I am afraid that they will say, &#147;Well, it&#146;s
all this climate change nonsense and saving the planet,&#148; and
they could become disillusioned about our main purposes. I will not
labour the point; I want to get on to the technical
details.</div>

John Gummer</b> (Suffolk, Coastal) (Con): Will my right hon.
Friend press that point a little more before he gives it up? The
Minister is just wrong. The schedule will distort the Bill in a way
that will do damage. Already, local councils that tried to do what is
proposed for a pilot scheme have found it much more difficult than they
thought. At the moment, they&#151;Tory as well as Labour
councils&#151;are being blamed. The Bill is about too big a matter
for us to add to it this sectional interest, which the Government could
have put in the Finance Bill or a whole range of other legislation.
This shows that the Government have not yet realised what a huge
undertaking they have taken on. In a sense, they have not built up the
importance of the Bill.</div>

would have liked to have seen the Government&#146;s

never have come along to a Committee and said, &#147;Pass this
legislation. We will at some point in the future produce a good
recycling service, and we will produce guidance and standards on what
that is.&#148; The Committee would have said, &#147;Look, Minister,
we are not going to go ahead with that until you produce the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070873000344"></a>David
Maclean:</b> Yes, of course it is terribly important. I do not
want to go back to the discussion that we had two weeks ago but, as
everyone admits, the rain forests are worth more than all the transport
emissions in the world and we do not have a big section in the Bill on
rain forests&#151;the Government said, &#147;Oh, it&#146;s
covered, we don&#146;t want to deal with that.&#148; Biodiversity
is vitally important to saving the planet and it is not in the Bill.
Yes, garbage and recycling make a contribution, but they have a huge
part in the Bill, and it stands out like a sore thumb. It stands out
like a piece of plastic in the newspaper recycling box because it is
not appropriate to the Bill.</div>
<a name="08070873000042"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070873000345"></a>Mr.
Gummer:</b> I hope that my right hon. Friend would agree that
it is important to remember that the domestic waste stream is 8 per
cent. of the waste stream as a whole, so even though the hon. Member
for Southampton, Test is right about those figures, we are dealing with
not the 92 per cent. but 8 per cent., and we ought to put that in
context.</div>
<a name="08070873000043"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070873000346"></a>David
Maclean:</b> My right hon. Friend is absolutely right. If the
proposal was for a waste reduction scheme or a garbage collection
scheme relating to all the garbage in the country, including the vast
amounts that the commercial vehicles pick up each morning in the giant
Biffa bins, or however else they collect it, I could understand it. My
right hon. Friend is right: we have a Bill on carbon emissions, setting
magnificent targets for 2050&#151;which we can argue about ad
nauseam&#151;yet we have a few clauses on trying to create five pilot
areas for a bit of domestic recycling containing weird and wonderful
ideas and penalties. The pilots concern five of the authorities dealing
with 8 per cent. of the waste in the country, so that is perhaps 0.1
per cent. of waste.</div>
<a name="08070873000044"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070873000347"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> There are measures to deal with all the other
waste streams. I repeat that it is a specific necessity to deal with
household waste streams. The recycling rates of commerce and industry,
for example, are far ahead of household recycling rates. Regarding the
right hon. Gentleman&#146;s comment about what makes a
&#147;good&#148; recycling scheme, on 19 June we issued the draft
scheme for
consultation.</div><a name="08070873000302"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070873000348"></a>David
Maclean:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Lady for that latter
point and I stand corrected. I hope the draft scheme will be circulated
to members of the Committee. It is a pity that it is not in the room
for us to study as we go along.</div>
<a name="08070873000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">If industry
and business are further ahead, let us have a specific Bill to lay out
all the proposals for dealing with household waste in separate
legislation, so that we can deal with it in detail. I do not want to
get bogged down on that point&#151;it was an aside at the start of
the Committee. It is a pity that five or six clauses on garbage are
stuck in such a major Bill.</div>
<a name="08070873000047"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070873000349"></a>Mr.
Gummer:</b> Will my right hon. Friend note what the Minister
said? The Government have done nothing whatever about the 20 per cent.
of the waste stream that is construction waste. They have not insisted
upon consolidation, they have not insisted that building 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column349" />Column number: 349</div>companies behave properly, and they have no arrangement to help the
links between local authorities and the building industry. We have the
worst record in Europe, and the Government have done nothing. They have
not even bothered to deal with the matter in the
Bill.</div>
<a name="08070873000048"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070873000350"></a>David
Maclean:</b> I am grateful to my right hon. Friend for those
detailed observations, which I will leave for the Minister to respond
to. We could do much more to use construction waste in recycling,
whether in concrete blocks or road building and so
on.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070873000352"></a>David
Maclean:</b> No, I do not wish to go down that route now, I
wish to consider the amendment and explain what it is about.</div>
<a name="08070873000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
108 states that</div>
<a name="08070873000292"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the authority
proposes to collect residual domestic waste at least once in every
seven
days,&#148;.</div><a name="08070873000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
suggest inserting that requirement into proposed new paragraph 2(2), so
that a waste authority could create a waste reduction scheme. It would
be allowed to do that, providing that it satisfied qualifications (a),
(b) and (c), and that it collected waste every seven days. It would
also be able to collect all recyclable material.</div>
<a name="08070873000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">I then
propose an alternative amendment, suggesting that authorities should
collect every 14 days. An authority might not want to collect every
seven days, as it believes that it has a good scheme collecting every
14 days. I personally think that that is too long and I am disturbed
that some schemes collect garbage only every 14 days. However, in
recycling garbage collection pilot schemes, collection up to 14 days is
legitimate, so the option exists.</div>
<a name="08070873000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">With my dodgy
legs, I find it difficult, staggering with different boxes to the
recycling bins, but I do my best to recycle. However, I am appalled to
see the many rules that exist in district councils in different parts
of the country&#151;even in my area of Cumbria between Carlisle and
Eden. There are different collections on different days. Some take
paper but not cardboard, others allow paper and cardboard in the same
box. There are numerous definitions of plastics. God help a person with
a carrier bag full of plastic bottles that they are stuffing into the
holes. If they stuff the carrier bag in with the bottles, they are in
deep trouble. That will be a criminal offence, so they must go to
another bin to dispose of the plastic bag.</div>
<a name="08070873000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
different kinds of cans. I can tell the difference between a tin can
and a Coca-Cola aluminium can, but the hassle involved in separating
all that stuff in some ways prejudices me against recycling. It would
be easier to put everything in a big bag and dump it at the tip. I do
not do that, but at times, one is tempted. I can see that many others
have been similarly tempted because of the sheer hassle of trying to
separate things into too many different categories.</div>
<a name="08070873000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">When I come
to London&#151;many of us have homes in the Westminster
area&#151;it seems to be all-in-one recycling. What is Westminster
council doing? Is it doing it correctly, or wrongly? I assume that it
is doing it legally. In the Westminster area, provided there are no
food scraps, garbage or bits of cling film from food, all plastics,
glass 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column350" />Column number: 350</div>bottles, tin cans, containers, newspapers and card
of whatever description&#151;glossy Sunday colour supplements and
ordinary newspapers&#151;go into one recycling plant. I do not know
how the council sorts it. I do not know if the council sorts it. Much
of it may go for power generation, or incineration to create power. It
is so convenient for householders that it is much easier to do and we
are not prejudiced against doing
it.</div><a name="08070873000057"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08070873000353"></a><b class="B">Miss
Anne McIntosh</b> (Vale of York) (Con): Perhaps I can help my
right hon. Friend. I followed the rubbish from Westminster to its
ultimate destination, which is SELCHP&#151;South East London Combined
Heat and Power. I challenged the Minister about what is, in my view, a
missed opportunity in the legislation, and about the need to educate
people about what such schemes do. My right hon. Friend may not know
that despite its name, SELCHP does not at present have a combined heat
and power facility, or it may have just got
it.</div>
<a name="08070873000058"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070873000354"></a>David
Maclean:</b> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that
elucidation. The next time she is following the garbage truck, I would
be grateful if she could call by my flat, because I have a huge bit of
polystyrene wrapping from my last printer that needs to be taken to the
tip.</div><a name="08070873000059"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08070873000355"></a><b class="B">Ms
Karen Buck</b> (Regent's Park and Kensington, North) (Lab): As
a Member of Parliament whose constituency covers Westminster, may I
inform the right hon. Gentleman that Westminster council has one of the
worst recycling records of any local authority in the country? Whether
waste is combined or separated, let us not be deluded into thinking
that that in itself is the solution to the
problem.</div><a name="08070873000060"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070873000356"></a>David
Maclean:</b> The point is that Westminster council seems to be
able to collect combined material from householders and do some
separation. Presumably, it does not burn the glass or the metal in the
power plant. It is able to separate that, I presume, and then burn the
plastics and the paper. It has made it simple for householders by
encouraging householders to use it. I see an awful lot of commercial
waste lying around the streets from shops, pubs and caf√(c)s, which
is presumably much more difficult to separate.</div>
<a name="08070873000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">My amendments
make it clear that any waste authority that intends to set rules for
recycling must accept all possible plastics, paper and recyclable
material. The hon. Member for Northavon is right. Once one starts
specifying Tetrapak or the type of plastic, one gets into difficulties.
I do not want to do that. I tabled the amendments in this form so that
I could provoke a debate. I want at least one of the schemes to suggest
that it will collect the residual domestic waste, as the Government
have termed it&#151;that is, the garbage, the food scraps, or what
has not gone into compost&#151;and take everything else in a limited
number of containers.</div>
<a name="08070873000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">My worry is
that if an authority designs a scheme whereby it charges for the bulk
of the garbage left&#151;the residual domestic waste&#151;or the
weight of it, that may be legitimate, in order to minimise residual
domestic waste either in bulk or in weight. However, if the authority
then says, &#147;Aha! We&#146;re going to take only little plastic
bottles, and we are not going to take polystyrene. We will not take
cardboard or Tetrapak. We will take only the following materials,
separated into three or four types&#148;, it automatically forces
householders to have a lot more residual domestic waste.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column351" />Column number: 351</div><a name="08070873000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">Householders
will have to stick the polystyrene, the Tetrapak, the unacceptable
cardboard or the mixed bit of plastic and paper into the residual
domestic waste. I bought a new printer yesterday and I could not get
the plastic off the cardboard. It is difficult to separate some of
these things, and one ends up throwing them into the
residual domestic waste because one cannot take the risk of
putting them into the cardboard or into the plastic.</div>
<a name="08070873000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">By being
ruthlessly discriminatory as to what they will accept as recycling
material, local authorities could design recycling schemes that force
people inadvertently to increase the amount of residual domestic waste.
Local authorities could then put a charge or tariff on that, which is
unfair on householders. My amendments seek to tell local authorities
that they cannot do that. If a local authority intends to be ruthlessly
tight on the amount of garbage&#151;I apologise for using the
American word, but it is easier than &#147;residual domestic
waste&#148;&#151;on the food scraps and the bits that have to go
into garbage, and if it proposes to penalise or charge householders who
produce more than one little bag of garbage, there is a duty on the
local authority to say, &#147;However, we will take all the plastics,
glass, bottles and cans in three simple boxes, or one multi-recycling
container.&#148;</div><a name="08070873000065"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070873000357"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> I think I need to help the right hon. Gentleman.
The sort of scheme that he envisages would not happen. That is not the
purpose. There is no absolute level of residual waste that a local
authority would deem to be the basis of the scheme. A scheme must be
based on the total residual waste produced within the pilot area. An
average of that would be taken, and the range calculated. There is no
absolute, as he describes. When I speak later, I may be able to
elucidate further, but the sort of proposal that he makes would not be
approved by the Secretary of
State.</div><a name="08070873000066"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070873000358"></a>David
Maclean:</b> I am delighted to hear that from the hon. Lady,
and I admire her faith in the ability of all our local councils to come
up with schemes that have such integrity. That seems to fly in the face
of some of the stories in the newspapers over the past few
months&#151;not necessarily in the <i class="I">Daily Mail</i>, but perhaps in
<i class="I">T</i><i class="I">he Daily T</i><i class="I">elegraph</i><i class="I">. </i>Those stories may have
been totally untrue, but if the stories about some of the schemes that
local councils are imposing are untrue, I would love to hear so.
Experience suggests that some of the stories about local authority
prescription of the type of containers and receptacles that can be used
are, unfortunately,
correct.</div><a name="08070873000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the dustbin man&#151;I am not sure of the politically correct term;
perhaps refuse-recycling collector-person&#151;comes along to a
household and there are 20 different sorts of bins, boxes and
collection receptacles outside, that is not acceptable. My amendment
says that if local authorities prescribe a type of bin, they should not
prescribe a designer-style one, which can be bought only from them, at
exorbitant cost. If it is nicked, blown away in the wind or ends up
being used in the allotment for more convenient purposes, a replacement
has to be bought from the authority, again at exorbitant
cost.</div>
<a name="08070873000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">Authorities
should have a more standard-shape receptacle that the elderly can carry
when it is full of bottles and that we cripples can carry when our legs
do not work 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column352" />Column number: 352</div>properly. I would like to see schemes that are more helpful&#151;I
declare an interest&#151;for the disabled staggering to the garden
gate than schemes with all the different sorts of boxes that we must
have these days, because it seems that our garbage collection people
will no longer come up the garden path to get them. I want to make sure
that the local authorities do not build into their schemes conditions
that are convenient for them, but are dashed near impossible for the
householder in respect of the size, type or cost of the receptacles
that may be
used.</div><a name="08070873000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
part of my amendment proposes that there ought to be no more than three
different types of receptacle. This is not a gross exaggeration by
<i class="I">The Daily Telegraph</i> or others. Across local authority areas
there seem to be totally different rules about what may go into a box.
I agree with the hon. Member for Northavon that the Bill cannot
prescribe the details such as thin or thick cardboard, Tetrapak and
plastic. I do not want our district councils to do so either, as they
are doing at present. There are vast differences in the definition of
cardboard and newspaper between Carlisle city council and Eden district
council. God help us if we put the wrong sort of cardboard in the
cardboard box. It does not get collected and we might get a
penalty.</div><a name="08070873000070"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070873000359"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> The right hon. Gentleman is over-egging the case.
Unlike ourselves, most people do not live in two local authority areas.
Although we might represent areas that cover different schemes,
provided that local authorities are consistent and clear, before long,
people will know exactly what they are meant to do. Different local
authorities will have different schemes, because they have entered into
different contracts on different dates and so on. As long as residents
are told and it is consistent, why does it matter if different
authorities have different
schemes?</div><a name="08070873000071"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070873000360"></a>David
Maclean:</b> It matters because there is incredible mobility
around an area. They are all our constituents. If we are all trying to
come up with a proper recycling initiative, let us get as much
standardisation as
possible.</div><a name="08070873000072"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070873000362"></a>David
Maclean:</b> Because we are trying to move the public and
ourselves on to do more and more recycling, it is incumbent upon us to
make it as simple as possible. The huge difference in the how local
authorities are operating and in their definitions results in the sort
of stories that appear in the<i class="I"> Daily Mail </i>and <i class="I">The Daily
Telegraph</i> and cynicism about all the recycling initiatives. Let us
follow the old military term, KISS&#151;keep it simple, stupid. That
applies to me,

Gummer:</b> As one who does not read either <i class="I">The Daily

Friend that there is a much more domestic reason for this? Often,
people go and help their old 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column353" />Column number: 353</div>relations who happen to live in the next-door area.
I represent the Suffolk coastal area, and many people in mid-Suffolk
come and help their aunts or uncles, or people who need their help, and
they find it confusing that the two places have totally different
arrangements. That is all right for the intelligentsia of the Liberal
Democrat party, but there are many people for whom waste is not the
most important thing in life. To have to go into the kitchen and read
through a list that is totally different from that in another area is
just confusing and off-putting.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070873000368"></a>David
Maclean:</b> I will give way to the hon. Gentleman in a
second, I just want to elaborate on this point. I accept that different
councils can have different coloured bins, different coloured
receptacles and different days for collection. That is okay, that is
the great diversity of Britain, but it should not be the case that one
authority says, &#147;Ah ha, that cardboard orange juice packet is
acceptable because we deem it to be cardboard,&#148; and another one
says, &#147;You have committed a criminal offence, you&#146;ve put
your orange juice packet from Marks and Spencer into the wrong
box.&#148; It is incumbent on us to make the legislation
straightforward and simple. Given the difficulties of interpretation
that the Committee is finding and the fact that the hon. Gentleman says
we cannot put this into law because we cannot start defining what is a
Tetrapak or polystyrene because it is too difficult and changes all the
time, we will end up in this country with 300 authorities having 300
different definitions of what is acceptable newspaper or
card.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070873000370"></a>David
Maclean:</b> I promise I will give way to the hon. Gentleman,
but please give me a minute to finish this point. As I was saying, it
is acceptable to have differences around the country, but those
differences should be within certain parameters. It should not be
within the parameters for local authorities to so narrowly define
newspaper, card, or material that they will not accept, and to do so
not because it is not recyclable or they cannot do anything with it,
but because they have just entered into a contract with Mr.
Snoggins, who will take only&#151;<i class="I">[Interruption.].</i> Well in
that case the council should enter into a contract with Mr.
Y, who will take the thicker cardboard or the
newspaper.</div><a name="08070873000082"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070873000371"></a>Martin

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070873000372"></a>David
Maclean:</b> I give way to the hon. Gentleman to shut him
up.</div>
<a name="08070873000084"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070873000373"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> The right hon. Gentleman is clearly enjoying
himself. At the risk of encouraging him to go on to a further
diversion, does he accept that the Select Committee on Communities and
Local Government&#151;or the Committee on the Office of the Deputy
Prime Minister as it may have been called when it produced its 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column354" />Column number: 354</div>report on recycling&#151;clearly endorsed the
approach that each council should be able to make up its own approach
to recycling because the physical environments differ so much? It is
one thing to recycle in a rural area, where people may have four
wheelie bins, but that is not possible in a suburban area, which may
have a box-based system, but even that is not possible in a place that
is dominated by flats or multi-occupancy, where people have to do the
recycling within their own household or share facilities. That is why
we need a diversity of approaches. As my hon. Friend the Member for
Northavon said from a sedentary position, different contracts are
negotiated with suppliers, which have to be done at best value for
local councils and therefore involve different qualities of paper or
qualities of recycling. That is why the approaches have to vary. The
right hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal said that people might be
confused by different districts having different approaches. The last
time I looked, most households were residing in one district. That may
not be true of Conservative Members, who have such huge gardens that
they cover three districts, but most people do not seem to
move.</div>
<a name="08070873000085"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070873000374"></a>David
Maclean:</b> In essence, what the hon. Gentleman is saying is
that the most convenient way for the local authorities and the councils
to recycle will be the way that it is done and sod the constituents,
sod the residents, who will be left with the residual burden. I accept
that local councils may have a different contract to take cardboard or
paper, or the most lucrative recycling contract. That is fair enough,
but we should be making these pilots based around what is most
convenient and best for our constituents, for our householders. What
collects the most material for recycling? What breaks the polystyrene
problem? Some bins now take polystyrene, but the attitude of the
councils has been appalling. They will take the easy stuff:
&#147;Bring us your glass bottles and we will recycle them; put them
into brown, green, yellow containers. Bring us your easy paper, we will
recycle it. Do not bring us your polystyrene as it is too difficult.
You are stuck with that and must sort it out. If it is too big, do not
put it in a big bag as we won&#146;t take
it.&#148;</div><a name="08070873000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is the problem of old mattresses and sofas, which will now pollute the
countryside. If the rules are too tight or it is too difficult for
householders to get rid of the chunks of polystyrene that come with a
new TV or printer, we know where those chunks will end up&#151;in the
fields and hedgerows of my constituency. If people cannot get to the
recycling tip in the cosy hour that it is available, those materials
will be dumped in the countryside.</div>
<a name="08070873000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of the
amendments suggests that recycling centres in the pilot areas should be
open more&#151;not 24/7, but perhaps 7-11. If someone finishes
unpacking their kit at the weekend after a trip to Ikea or
wherever, by 5 o&#146;clock when they are ready to load the
car with big chunks of card, the tip or recycling centre has already
closed. That is outrageous. If we want innovative ideas, we should
build in rules so that local authorities keep recycling centres open
later in the evening and accept all plastics and materials.</div>
<a name="08070873000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we have
five innovative recycling pilots, and none take polystyrene and
Tetrapak, what is the point? We cannot get rid of those things at the
moment. I know nothing about the subject, but any fool can recycle
plastic bottles or glass; that is easy. I accept what the hon.
Gentleman says and that we might need different 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column355" />Column number: 355</div>rules for the countryside and towns. I am happy with
that&#151;we might need different types of boxes and receptacles in
the country and the towns, and in blocks of flats. However,
householders must be able to get rid of all their recyclable material
in those pilot schemes, and not be told that only the easy stuff will
be taken as the rest of the plastics, glass, Tetrapak, polystyrene and
so on cannot be coped with. That means that people are stuck with it
and if they put it into the garbage, the residual waste, it is too
bulky and big and they will be clobbered.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070873000375"></a>Mr.
Gummer:</b> Will my right hon. Friend explain to the Liberal
Democrats the very simple distinction between a different method of
collection due to the nature of the household, which is for the benefit
of the public, and the inability of councils to recognise that unless
there are standard assertions about which materials are collected, we
cannot get the proper value for that material? We get very little value
from many materials because no single council collects enough of that
material to make it worth while. That costs the council, as it will not
deal with its neighbours and make a joint decision as to what the value
and nature of the material should be.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070873000377"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. Before the right hon. Gentleman replies,
I remind the Committee that we had an extensive debate on these
amendments on Thursday, and we are in danger of falling behind. I ask
hon. Members to bear that in mind.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070873000378"></a>David

agreed to withdraw these clauses, we could make very rapid
progress.</div>
<a name="08070873000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">My right hon.
Friend is right. The key point I wish to get from the Government is
about those &#147;standardised assertions&#148; of what is
recyclable material. If that could be standardised throughout council
areas, I would not care whether councils insist that they collect glass
on a Saturday morning at 3 o&#146;clock, or that the plastic bin has
to go out on a Friday at 2 pm, although I would like to see that
standardised as well&#151;it seems to be for the convenience of
councils and their operatives rather than householders. We should
standardise the definitions of what can be put in the ruddy box. If the
Minister goes ahead with the pilot schemes, I beg her to make that the
main test. It is not about what size box councils have or what day they
collect it; the main test of the pilots should be whether councils can
standardise their definitions so that we have three recycling boxes at
most that can take most of our recyclable material. We should challenge
the councils to find another operator that will take the difficult
cardboard, glossy paper or Tetrapak
products.</div><a name="08070873000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am fed up of going round the supermarkets, practically with my
magnifying glass, looking at juice packets and seeing that even
Sainsbury&#146;s puts &#147;Not yet ready for recycling&#148; on
them, because it finds them too difficult to recycle. If the
supermarkets and the councils are finding it too difficult or too
expensive, why should our constituents be left with the residual
difficulty of, &#147;We can&#146;t take that, guv, it&#146;s the
wrong material&#148; or &#147;it&#146;s the wrong weight&#148;?
I ask the Minister to try to design the pilot schemes to make it easy
for householders to recycle 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column356" />Column number: 356</div>and to recycle nearly everything, so that we have
the minimal amount of garbage. Do not base the pilots on an area
average.</div><a name="08070873000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
thank my right hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, Coastal, who informs
me that it was utterly inappropriate to refer to a &#147;garbage
collection man&#148; or a &#147;bin man&#148;, they are domestic
environmental collection operatives. I hope that all our domestic
environmental collection operatives in future will find it easy to do
simple recycling and take away the garbage at least every seven
days.</div>
<a name="08070873000096"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08070873000379"></a><b class="B">Gregory
Barker</b> (Bexhill and Battle) (Con): I rise to speak in
favour of new clause 22, which we placed before the Committee but did
not have an opportunity to debate last Thursday. I am mindful of the
revenue-neutrality concerns raised by Committee members when we
discussed the last group of amendments on Thursday. While council tax
reductions have to be paid for, we should remember that a municipality
sending less waste to landfill would be paying less to landfill
operators, which we discussed last week when Members rightly questioned
how incentives would be paid for. The money saved could pay for the
reductions in council tax for ambitious recyclers, and there would be
significant savings from reductions in landfill tax being paid to
Government.</div><a name="08070873000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
in addition to cuts in council tax, there is another way to incentivise
householders without threatening them with a penalty, and that is by
paying people to recycle by offering vouchers depending on the amount
of recycling waste that a family produces. Those vouchers could be
redeemed locally, at supermarkets for example, and would thus go
towards reducing families&#146; costs of living by helping them to
pay for daily essentials at a time of soaring food costs. Communities
could pool the vouchers to pay for equipment for schools or for the
upkeep of parks and green spaces. That sort of market incentive is far
more exciting and positive than
pay-as-you-throw.</div><a name="08070873000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
public will not like the message, &#147;We will fine you if you
don&#146;t go green.&#148; &#147;We will pay you to do it&#148;
is a better and more positive message. The only incentive scheme
allowed under existing legislation is offering council tax reductions
in exchange for producing less landfill waste, although, we would like
that to be more explicit in the Bill. That is why I have tabled new
clause 22, which would legislate for the introduction of
such voucher schemes across
Britain.</div><a name="08070873000099"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070873000380"></a>Mr.
Gummer:</b> Will my hon. Friend assure me that the new clause
would enable public-private partnerships in cases in which local
organisations of all sorts might like to join the local council? That
will be a good way for large stores&#151;department stores and the
like&#151;to join the local authority in encouraging such schemes and
perhaps put money into them so that the vouchers are worth that much
more.</div>
<a name="08070873000100"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070873000381"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> Absolutely. My right hon. Friend makes a very good
point. The precedents for this kind of incentive scheme are primarily
in north America and those partnerships are exactly what have happened.
In effect, there have been top-ups in addition to the incremental
savings from the value of the recyclates. Other organisations that wish
to help to encourage recycling, particularly supermarkets and large
retailers, have joined in to help recycle as part of their corporate
social responsibility policies and to help drive the creation of viable
new markets for recyclates.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column357" />Column number: 357</div><a name="08070873000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
voucher system operator in north America, where a similar scheme
operates, claims that recycling rates rise from single figures to, on
average, 40 per cent. of household waste in the communities where it
has been trialled. Participation in voucher schemes is entirely
voluntary, but in north America it averages at 90 per cent.
in areas where it has been introduced.</div>
<a name="08070873000304"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.15
am</div><a name="08070873000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
give a specific example, an initial pilot in two neighbourhoods in
Philadelphia included 2,500 households where recycling rates were just
7 per cent. and 30 per cent. respectively. They were two very diverse
metropolitan areas. Within two months, recycling rates had doubled in
both neighbourhoods, and participation rates rose to an incredibly
impressive 90 per cent.</div>
<a name="08070873000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
example is from Wilmington, Delaware. Participation in the voucher
scheme is around 90 per cent., and the amount of waste to landfill has
dropped by 40 per cent. This saved the city about $800,000 a year in
landfill costs and landfill tax savings. That $800,000 was after the
costs of rolling out the city-wide
scheme.</div><a name="08070873000104"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070873000382"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> The hon. Gentleman is citing helpful evidence about
what others have done. Where does he stand on the apparent
inconsistency between what he is saying and what his right hon. Friend
the Member for Penrith and The Border argued? His right hon. Friend
called for standardisation, no pilots without standardisation and so
on, but he is talking about 1,000 flowers blooming. Does he think that
such voucher schemes should be bog-standard, fixed and constrained, or
should they be
varied?</div><a name="08070873000105"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070873000383"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> The hon. Gentleman misconstrues what my right hon.
Friend is saying. My right hon. Friend and I speak with one voice. We
do not want to clobber the council tax payer with penalties and fines
in the way that the Liberal Democrats do. We want to offer incentives.
The problem is the incredibly complex array of schemes. The average
community charge payer is more likely to incur one of the Liberal
Democrat fines or penalties if an array of legislation is allowed in.
</div><a name="08070873000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
strong difference is not between my right hon. Friend and me, but
between the Liberal Democrats and us. We favour rewarding people who do
the right thing, looking for ways to incentivise communities, and
looking for a positive agenda, rather than the Liberal Democrat
hair-shirt, bang-people-up attitude, or at least their preference for
giving people a fine or a penalty, because it is so much easier,
particularly for lazy-minded councils, just to fix a penalty than to
consider innovation and reward. Of course, although we do not intend to
impose a scheme from the centre, the more uniform it is, the easier it
is to understand, and the more comprehensive, the better. That is
common
sense.</div><a name="08070873000107"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070873000384"></a>Mr.
Gummer:</b> Will my hon. Friend explain very simply to the
Liberal Democrats that it is helpful to people to have standard
categories, so they know what to save in the right boxes, and it is
helpful then to have as many different ways of encouraging people to do
it in as many different places as possible? That is clear, and even if
the Liberal Democrats do not get it, most of the public
will.</div><a name="08070873000108"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070873000385"></a>Gregory

the incentive schemes? Is he saying that there was an increase of 90

the waste was

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070873000387"></a>Gregory

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070873000389"></a>Gregory

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070873000391"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> Let me get to the logical breakpoint in my
argument, then I shall give way. Let us return to the case in point at
Wilmington, where the city faced the daunting dilemma of dwindling
landfill space. It did not wish to fine anyone to increase recycling,
so it used the innovative voucher scheme instead. The head of
Wilmington&#146;s public works, the public works commissioner,
said:</div>
<a name="08070873000293"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We&#146;re
not interested in penalties. We&#146;re interested in making it work
and getting people
involved&#148;.</div><a name="08070873000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is exactly how the Conservatives see the recycling
agenda.</div><a name="08070873000116"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070873000392"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I am glad the hon. Gentleman told us that that
was the logical breakpoint. He is indulging in some entertaining
political slapstick, for which he will receive due reward from the
<i class="I">Daily Mail. </i>To bring him back to the facts, is he interested to
know that during the Select Committee&#146;s inquiry into recycling
to which I referred, I supported incentives, not fines? I agree with
his amendment. At the time, that action got me favourable mention in
the <i class="I">Daily
Mail.</i></div><a name="08070873000117"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070873000393"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> Am I surprised that the Liberal Democrats say one
thing in one Committee sitting and say another in a different
Committee? No. That is their standard operating procedure. As for the
savings for United Kingdom recycling operations that would accrue from
not sending household waste to landfill, councils could make
significant savings by avoiding landfill costs.</div>
<a name="08070873000118"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08070873000394"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Chaytor</b> (Bury, North) (Lab): The hon.
Gentleman&#146;s argument about the Wilmington experience is
interesting. There are always dangers in trying to import directly into
the United Kingdom an experiment that took place in the United States.
Does he accept that, if the voucher scheme that he described was linked
entirely with the larger retail businesses, it would further
concentrate the retail market in the hands of the big five supermarkets
in the UK?</div>
<a name="08070873000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">The last
thing that most towns in Britain want is a further concentration of
retail share with the big five because that would continue the
hollowing out of our town centres. It would also make individual
households more car dependent because, to use their vouchers, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column359" />Column number: 359</div>people would have to drive to the out-of-town
supermarket. What would be saved in emissions and might be saved
through an increase in recycling would be counter-balanced by increased
emissions from having to use the car to drive further to the retail
outlet.</div><a name="08070873000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
is there in the Bill to prevent one of the five local authorities from
submitting an innovative bid on exactly those lines? Is anything
blocking
that?</div><a name="08070873000121"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070873000396"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> If my right hon. Friend will allow me, I shall
explain. We want it made explicit in the Bill that such action would be
allowed. I do not accept the absolute logic of the assertion of the
hon. Member for Bury,
North.</div><a name="08070873000123"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070873000397"></a>Mr.
Gummer:</b> Will my hon. Friend help the Committee by
explaining that the Wilmington project was supported not by the local
retailers, but a major beverage manufacturer? The manufacturer wanted
to take such action. It was a sensible thing to do, and the vouchers
could be used at any local shop. That is not the issue. A system can
always be organised. We need the opportunity under the Bill for at
least one of the tests to be undertaken in that
way.</div>
<a name="08070873000124"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070873000398"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> Absolutely. The hon. Member for Bury, North
painted an entirely sensible scenario of everything accruing to
supermarkets, and that would worry us. However, as my right hon. Friend
the Member for Suffolk, Coastal said, food or other manufacturers are
equally able to participate in promoting such a scheme. It would
enhance the opportunity to recover things like glass bottles from
drinks manufacturers and reusable or recyclable packaging products.
Although we do not want to get into that level of detail now, I
understand his point, but I do not consider it to be a necessary or
obvious conclusion that such schemes would put more power into the
hands of the supermarkets, to the detriment of local
traders.</div><a name="08070873000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
I return to the landfill tax and the cash savings that would accrue
from recycling within a year to a council that increased the amount it
recycled. The landfill tax stands at &#163;32 a tonne. As was
announced in the 2007 Budget, landfill tax will rise by &#163;8 a
tonne a year until at least 2011, when it will be &#163;48 a tonne.
As we are producing about 28 million tonnes of municipal waste a year,
the opportunity to avoid the costs of sending the waste to landfill,
plus avoiding the costs of paying up to &#163;48 a tonne on landfill
tax represents a significant financial saving for councils. I note that
the Treasury expects to receive &#163;1.1 billion from landfill tax
in
2008-09.</div><a name="08070873000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">Avoiding
such costs should mean that councils are able to pass those savings
directly back to the ratepayers through council tax reductions for
ambitious recyclers, on the basis that council tax payers are already
paying through their council tax to have their waste collected. Any
additional savings that the council make as a result of participating
in such schemes and diverting waste from landfill should at least be
shared with the council tax payers, consistent with our policy that it
is right to reward people for doing the right thing, and to do so
without penalising non-participants.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column360" />Column number: 360</div><a name="08070873000127"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070873000399"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> Savings are an important part of the equation. A
local authority does not get money; it just does not face an increase
in a bill that would otherwise be faced. It is not that local
authorities will suddenly have an income stream that they will have to
decide what to do with, but that there is a tax with a ratchet effect
on it, which they may be able to mitigate, to a greater or lesser
extent, by such schemes. Does the hon. Gentleman accept that, although
it sounds great in principle, that is not a pot of money that local
authorities will have? The rate per tonne is going up and up, They can
try and offset it, but the odds are against the net effect being less
landfill usage. The scheme would have to be extraordinary to deliver
that, would it
not?</div><a name="08070873000128"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070873000400"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> I understand what the hon. Gentleman is saying,
but any responsible, prudent local authority will have to have a
financial plan that anticipates paying that charge. If councils are
able to beat the financial plan because of the actions of their local
council tax payers, they will achieve a saving on their forecast
budget. That saving should at least in part, if not in full, be shared
with those who are doing the right thing and
recycling.</div><a name="08070873000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">Unfortunately,
I am unable to press new clause 22 to a Division. However, I shall seek
to press new clause 18, to which I spoke on Thursday and which gives
power to local authorities to reduce the amount of tax payable in
relation to household
waste.</div><a name="08070873000130"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070873000401"></a>Joan

made in the debate this
morning.</div><a name="08070873000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
right hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal accused the Government of not
tackling waste other than household waste, but we put in place
construction-site waste-management plan requirements earlier this year,
which will transform the operation of construction sites. The
Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform strategy on
construction waste was published last
month.</div><a name="08070873000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border spoke of how Westminster
deals with its waste, sending it to SELCHP. I cannot comment on the
particular processes of that authority, but I can tell him that there
are perfectly good mechanical arrangements for separating combined, dry
recyclates. Many local authorities across the country satisfactorily
separate plastics, paper, metals and glass, collected together, by
using plants called MRFs&#151;materials recovery facilities. He said
that Westminster sends everything to SELCHP. I cannot comment on the
specifics, but it is the Government&#146;s policy that only residual
waste remaining after the maximum recycling by a local authority should
be sent for incineration. It is true that the SELCHP plant does not
currently have heat recovery, but it is looking at whether it can do
that in the future. I would support that, SELCHP being in my
constituency.</div><a name="08070873000305"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.30
am</div><a name="08070873000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

them.</div>
<a name="08070873000134"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070873000403"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> I was glad that he took my interventions because
they helped, I hope, with the case that he was making, or not making.
He spoke about recycling centres and I agree with him that recycling
centres, civic amenity sites&#151;whatever the local authority calls
them&#151;should offer a service that is relevant and fits
contemporary lifestyles. We have encouraged local authorities to
consider carefully the hours at which such facilities are open and how
they enable people conveniently to deposit materials for re-use,
recovery and recycling. I have recently seen a state-of-the art
facility at Reading.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070873000404"></a>David

<a name="08070873000137"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070873000405"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> I am sorry to have to tell the right hon.
Gentleman, but that is not relevant to these particular clauses. We are
considering enabling the local authority to recover more recyclates at
the household level. The schemes are to deal with the material that the
householder puts in his or her bin, not what they may or may not be
taking to the civic amenity site. Taking things to the civic amenity
site or the recycling centre is usually done on the basis that what one
cannot put in one&#146;s bin is what one takes to the other place. I
am giving the right hon. Gentleman that information because he makes a
good point, but it is not relevant to these particular clauses or the
amendments proposed to them.</div>
<a name="08070873000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">The right
hon. Gentleman queried what is the point of the pilots if they do not
take everything. The point is to increase the participation rate and to
increase the quantity of material that is collected. Although he would
like, and I would join him in this aspiration, local authorities to
collect more and more and more waste streams, none the less it is a
fact that not everyone is participating at the moment and not everyone
is participating to the degree that they might, so we could collect a
great deal more from the doorstep than we do currently.</div>
<a name="08070873000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">The right
hon. Gentleman said that he would like standard assertions of what is
recyclable. The waste resources action programme, which the Government
support financially, gives a great deal of advice to local authorities
and to manufacturers and retailers, to try to standardise and reduce
the number of, for example, plastics that are in use&#151;we do not
need the huge range that we have. Virtually everything is recyclable,
and that is the direction that the Government seek to follow.</div>
<a name="08070873000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I have
said, local authorities provide many other outlets, if required, for
the recyclates that that particular local authority is not collecting,
such as the civic amenity site. Retailers are offering more and more
big containers on site, so that people are not necessarily using making
more car journeys and producing more emissions because they are going
to the supermarket anyway, so it can be done all at the same time. Most
recently, we have introduced &#147;recycle on the go&#148;, to
capture in particular aluminium cans, glass bottles and plastic bottles
when people are away from the home. Much is being done.</div>
<a name="08070873000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clauses
are about the collection of household waste where the local authority
collects from the doorsteps. The hon. Member for Bexhill and Battle
referred to the Wilmington experiment. I was concerned to hear that it
was a beverage manufacturer&#151;I hope that alcohol was not being
offered.</div>

<a name="08070873000143"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070873000407"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> I am glad to hear that. It might have accounted
for a tremendous increase in the recycling rate if it had involved
bottles of wine or cans of beer. Nobody would dispute that it was a
good result but, as I understand, the rate of material that was
recycled as a consequence was 40 per cent. We already have local
authorities that are at the 40 per cent. level, so we must do
more.</div>
<a name="08070873000144"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070873000408"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> The hon. Lady is right; 40 per cent. is not the
summit of our ambitions. However, the point is that this was a
difficult metropolitan area. This country has some very poor
communities that recycle a fraction of their waste&#151;I think
especially of Liverpool where the recycling rate is in low single
figures, perhaps as low as 3 per cent. During the experiment, recycling
in one area went from 7 per cent. to 40 per cent. in a short space of
time. It is not the only solution, but it is an interesting
scenario.</div>
<a name="08070873000145"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070873000409"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> Indeed. We will discuss the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s amendment shortly.</div>
<a name="08070873000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
108 requires authorities running waste reduction schemes to collect
residual waste at least once a week, and to collect all recyclable
materials. Clearly, we cannot accept that. It specifies,</div>
<a name="08070873000294"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;tetrapak
materials, polystyrene and all
plastics.&#148;.</div><a name="08070873000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border knows, at the moment,
such materials are not collected from the doorstep by the vast majority
of authorities. Requiring a local authority to operate a weekly
collection of residual waste and collect all the recyclables would
prohibit the majority of local authorities from coming forward to offer
a scheme at all.</div>
<a name="08070873000148"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070873000410"></a>David
Maclean:</b> I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Lady as I
initially spoke for much longer than intended. This is about pilot
schemes, not amendments to compel every authority in the land to
collect all Tetrapak and polystyrene. I am merely trying to build it
into the pilot schemes.</div>
<a name="08070873000149"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070873000411"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> Indeed, but all local authorities are invited to
put themselves forward to undertake a pilot scheme. It would completely
distort any schemes that might come forward if that involved moving
into a different era and collecting 20 streams of recyclables.
<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> The right hon. Gentleman protests
too much.</div>
<a name="08070873000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other
important point, which was raised by the hon. Member for Northavon, is
that if we specify that residual waste is to be collected every seven
days, no authorities that currently operate alternative bin collection
schemes will come forward at all. The amendment is unnecessarily
prescriptive and limits the options for authorities. What the right
hon. Gentleman proposes would effectively prevent any authority in
England from piloting one of those schemes.</div>
<a name="08070873000151"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08070873000412"></a><b class="B">Joan
Walley</b> (Stoke-on-Trent, North) (Lab): I am concerned about
what my hon. Friend says in response to the amendments in view of press
reports that I read last week. I know that we should not believe
everything that we read in the press&#151;that point was raised just
now&#151;but I remember reading that the shadow Secretary 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column363" />Column number: 363</div>of State for Communities and Local Government was
intending to report local authorities for collaborating on some of
these pilot schemes. I am a little unsure about the comments coming
from the Opposition with regard to the Department for Communities and
Local Government. I wonder if there is a difference between the two
shadow Front-Bench spokesmen on that matter.</div>
<a name="08070873000152"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070873000413"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> My hon. Friend is perceptive. The shadow
Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government has spoken
frequently about the schemes and threatened Conservative local
authorities, telling them not to collaborate with the Government. I am
delighted, however, that that is not the attitude of the shadow
Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Minister who has joined us in the
Committee. It is for that party to sort out what on earth its policies
on those issues might be. We have certainly not been able to understand
them.</div><a name="08070873000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">Reference
was made to Tetrapak cartons, which have historically been difficult to
recycle, but industry is working hard to turn that around. We all hope
that that will happen, as they are such an important part of our lives.
While we encourage local authorities to continue improving the
recycling services they offer, we must recognise the complexities and
different circumstances they face on the ground. As the hon. Member for
Cheltenham indicated in a intervention, that is very much a case of
achieving the commercial contract, and local authorities have to do
that and gain an outlet, otherwise there is no point in collecting
it.</div>
<a name="08070873000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">The powers
outlined in the Bill require an authority already running one of the
pilot waste reduction schemes to operate a good recycling service. As I
have said, that means a service that meets the standards specified for
the purposes of that definition in the guidance. The Department has
also recently published draft guidance on what constitutes a good
recycling service. That proposes that an authority must, as a minimum,
offer free kerbside collection of dry recyclates and at least two waste
streams. We have also said that additional priority in selecting pilots
would be given to authorities that collect plastics and food waste or
that plan to do so within 12 months. Food waste was not one
of the streams that the right hon. Gentleman suggested needed
collection, but I am sure that members of the Committee will have noted
the enormous amounts of food waste that we are putting out in this
country. Indeed, tackling the amount of food waste has become a
priority for the Government.
</div><a name="08070873000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
believe that the proposals represent a good balance between ensuring
that householders within a scheme are provided with a good collection
service and that the requirements are not so prescriptive as to limit
the types of authority that can participate in the scheme. The key
issue is to ensure that the pilots provide us with robust evidence
about the impact of incentives on behaviour. We have seen that similar
schemes work elsewhere, which is why we want to trial them in England.
Excluding large numbers of local authorities from coming forward to
undertake a pilot by including over-prescriptive requirements, which is
what the amendment would do, would hinder us in the task, so we
obviously oppose it.</div>
<a name="08070873000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
109 is nothing but a wrecking amendment, as the right hon. Gentleman
must know that no local authority would be able to collect waste 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column364" />Column number: 364</div>from all of the recycling categories that he has
specified. The hon. Member for Northavon, when speaking to amendment
No. 112, which he tabled, suggested that we should let 1,000 pilots
bloom. I think that he will know that that is a slight exaggeration,
even of what he
proposed.</div><a name="08070873000157"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070873000414"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> A figure of
speech.</div><a name="08070873000158"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070873000415"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> A figure of speech, but I reiterate that what
really matters in these pilots is that we should be able to retrieve
the evidence systematically and analyse and record it properly. That
limits the numbers that we should properly put in place. The hon.
Gentleman might have an opinion that there should be more pilots, but
we have decided that five is appropriate, and I ask him to accept that
we need a robust and useful evidence base for deciding whether to roll
out those powers to other waste collection authorities. If he thinks
that all authorities ought to have the opportunity to do that, that is
for a later stage in the
proceedings.</div><a name="08070873000306"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.45
am</div><a name="08070873000160"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070873000416"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> I cannot understand why the Minister needs to tie
her hands with legislation. It is almost as though she does not trust
herself, as if she has to pass a law to stop herself saying yes to six.
Surely she should see what she gets in, and if there are six damned
good ideas, she should take six, and if there are four, she should take
four. Why does she have to pass a law to ban herself from doing
something that she might want to
do?</div><a name="08070873000161"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070873000417"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> I have a great deal of confidence in myself,
thank you very much. We wanted to settle on a number, and we put that
number in the Bill. That gives clear certainty to local authorities. It
is also a case of looking to what financial support will be provided.
If we had a completely open-ended number, we would have to have a
completely open-ended budget. There will be financial support from the
Government. We want to get the evidence. We believe that we can do it.
I am sure the hon. Gentleman would agree that it would be impossible
anyway to test every conceivable type of scheme in every conceivable
type of
authority.</div><a name="08070873000162"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070873000418"></a>Steve
Webb:</b>
Six.</div><a name="08070873000163"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070873000419"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> The hon. Gentleman says six, but someone else
would say, &#147;Yes, but there are already four types of scheme and
20 types of demography&#148;. The hon. Gentleman should accept that
we have decided on five. We certainly will not have an open-ended
number, as he proposes in the amendment. That will be
resisted.</div><a name="08070873000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 107 would prevent the Government from making any regulation that
would create a criminal penalty on any householder for non-compliance
with any aspect of a waste reduction scheme. Unless I am mistaken, that
amendment has not been spoken to. I will not tempt the right hon.
Member for Penrith and The Border. He might like to be tempted. No, his
colleagues say that they would not like him to be
tempted.</div><a name="08070873000165"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070873000420"></a>David
Maclean:</b> I did not speak to that amendment. Similarly, I
did not address in detail some of the other amendments. I got so bogged
down by interventions on 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column365" />Column number: 365</div>the principle of the clauses, and on some of the minutiae, that I did
not test it. I shall not attempt to speak to it now in a brief
intervention, but I support the concept underlying the amendment. I do
not believe that householders in a pilot test should get criminal
penalties if they make a
mistake.</div><a name="08070873000166"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070873000421"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> I am glad the right hon. Gentleman made that
point. Iit is appropriate for the record that I deal with the
amendment, even though he did not. I am sorry to tell him that he
failed to notice that there is no provision in the Bill to use any
regulation to create any criminal penalty. I hope that with those few
words he will be entirely satisfied. I echo the comments made by my
hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North. The right hon.
Gentleman has probably been reading too many of those press releases
from the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles),
who is always saying that people are being made into criminals by the
proposals for proper waste collection
policies.</div><a name="08070873000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
advice to local authorities is that they should first communicate well
with their citizens and explain clearly what is expected in response to
waste collection policies, and that they should not need to have to
penalise people. However, where people will not accept the advice and
will not co-operate, the provision exists for the fixed penalty notice.
That is what local authorities can issue. As the right hon. Gentleman
knows, a fixed penalty notice does not make a person a criminal. I am
sure he has occasionally had a fixed penalty notice himself, not in
respect of waste, but perhaps in respect of a vehicle. He would be
unusual if he had
not.</div><a name="08070873000168"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070873000422"></a>David
Maclean:</b> I may have picked up many fixed penalty notices
for parking offences, and they were richly deserved where the evidence
was clear. Who will judge whether a householder has got it wrong with
recycling? Will the hon. Lady tell us the type of mistake that could
lead to&#151;I am glad that it will not be a criminal record&#151;a
fixed penalty? Would those mistakes include putting the wrong sort of
card or paper in the wrong
box?</div><a name="08070873000169"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070873000423"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> As I explained to the right hon. Gentleman,
communication between local councils and householders is crucial in all
these things, leaving aside the pilot schemes authorised by the Bill.
If people put materials in the wrong bins, the council should explain
what they are supposed to do. I expect councils and those who operate
their policies to understand the position of the householder.</div>
<a name="08070873000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">We would all
expect common sense to prevail. For example, if a blind person made
such a mistake, a fixed penalty notice would be inappropriate. We need
common sense, courtesy and proper communication. We know perfectly well
that some people persistently do the wrong thing after receiving an
explanation and having been treated politely. Some people are abusive
to the refuse collectors. A line must be drawn at some point. That is
how I believe we should
proceed.</div><a name="08070873000171"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070873000424"></a>David
Maclean:</b> We are getting into rather dangerous territory. I
am glad that we are pursuing this line of questioning. I take the point
that only a crazy local council would penalise a blind person. That is
an extreme 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column366" />Column number: 366</div>example. I am more concerned about the millions of householders who have
to deal with something that appears to be a cardboard box and do not
realise that it is lined with plastic or foil, as with a
Tetrapak.</div><a name="08070873000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
come back to the point that I have been making. If we do not have
simple, standard definitions that are advertised by the Government in a
national campaign, we will catch millions of innocent householders.
They might not be blind, they might have perfect sight and they might
be reasonably intelligent, but they still might not realise that the
material in their hand is the wrong sort of material. They might not
realise that their little district council will refuse to collect it
and penalise those who put it in the wrong box. That is the
mischief.</div><a name="08070873000173"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070873000425"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> I remind the right hon. Gentleman that the
general point about waste collection is that we all have to do more and
we all have to learn to do it better. In the vast majority of cases,
common sense prevails and such difficulties do not occur. If we cannot
decide on these things, councils will not be in a better
position.</div><a name="08070873000174"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070873000426"></a>David
Maclean:</b> It will not stop
them.</div><a name="08070873000175"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070873000427"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> Well, in general, common sense prevails and these
things are dealt with
appropriately.</div><a name="08070873000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
come back to the Bill, we are talking about only five pilots. Perhaps
this is a case in point for the Liberal Democrat amendment tabled by
the hon. Member for Northavon. In the pilots, we will work closely with
the local councils through the Waste and Resources Action Programme to
give advice and ensure that the communications work. We will test some
of the hypotheses put forward by the right hon. Gentleman in a proper
way.</div><a name="08070873000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under
the existing mechanism local councils can issue fixed penalty notices.
It is not Government policy to make non-payment of a waste charge a
criminal offence. Under the regulation-making powers we cannot create
criminal offences for non-payment of a waste charge. On the basis of
that reasoning, I am sure the right hon. Gentleman will be pleased to
withdraw the amendment, as it is
superfluous.</div><a name="08070873000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
new clause 18, I agree entirely with much that the hon. Member for
Bexhill and Battle said. Of course we want to give people incentives,
to learn from the practices undertaken elsewhere and to do all we can
to incentivise and increase recycling. However, new clause 18 is a
puzzle. It would not remove schedule 5, which might have been a logical
move. Instead, the new clause would be additional to the powers of the
schedule. As the hon. Member for Cheltenham pointed out, what is
proposed can already be done under the Bill. We therefore do not
believe that the new clause is
needed.</div><a name="08070873000179"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070873000428"></a>Mr.
Gummer:</b> We have been trying throughout, with a certain
amount of amusement in between, to reach a consensual answer on the
issue. The crucial matter is that there are modern means of encouraging
people to do things, which are more attractive to many households than
the traditional ways of reducing council tax and all the rest, because
they are immediate and fit in with other things that householders do,
with television and the like.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column367" />Column number: 367</div><a name="08070873000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope the Minister will undertake to ensure that at least one of the
pilots would try to use a voucher system or something similar, to see
whether that raised the participation of a wider range of families. We
should not allow the whole business to become the purview of particular
kinds of families from particular backgrounds. In the work that I have
been doing, I have found that the most difficult thing is how to
increase recycling in, for example, disadvantaged areas. It may be that
the mechanism before us would have the effect in this country that it
has had in the United States.</div>
<a name="08070873000181"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070873000429"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for
that intervention. If I may, I shall explain our attitude to the new
clause in a logical sequence and then come to his point. It seems to
make little sense to allow waste disposal authorities to require
billing authorities to reduce council tax, while requiring that the
waste disposal authority should reimburse the billing authority for
both the lost council tax revenue and the costs of bringing the scheme
about, which is what is proposed. It seems unlikely that a waste
disposal authority would ever choose to do that.</div>
<a name="08070873000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
provisions for linking rebates and charges made under an incentive
scheme to council tax are set out in schedule 5 and already allow
authorities to net rebates off council tax bills. The rebates and
charges made under a scheme are designed to incentivise sustainable
behaviour on waste. There is no need to consider changes to the
underlying council tax liability and it is not Government policy that
the schemes should do so. I need to set that on the record because it
has not been debated. The provisions in the Bill and the framework that
we intend to establish in regulations will ensure transparency and
fairness for householders, and will ensure that councils may link the
administration of their scheme to council tax if they wish. We will
consult fully on the detail of the regulations relating to council tax.
We do not believe that anything more is required.</div>
<a name="08070873000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn to the
issues about which the hon. Member for Bexhill and Battle spoke. He
wants only reward schemes under the Bill. As I said at the outset, such
schemes can be established under the proposals in the Bill
and, perhaps even more significantly, do not require new legislation.
Right hon. and hon. Members may not be aware that
DEFRA has already carried out major incentive-only and reward-only
schemes involving a significant number of authorities. There were 53
fully reported trials, of which 30 found that they had a positive
impact in increasing the tonnages of recyclables collected. I am pretty
certain that those reward-only schemes included vouches in some cases.
I may need to check whether they were actual vouchers or prizes, as it
were, but there was not a council tax reduction or anything of that
kind. They did not have a monetary
value.</div><a name="08070873000184"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070873000430"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070873000432"></a>Mr.

problem with the whole issue is that we forget that most people find it
boring, not terribly interesting and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column368" />Column number: 368</div>not essential to their lives. We, who are involved, have become much
more interested in it. How do we make people keen on it? We should use
mechanisms that those selling mass-produced, household goods learned
about long ago. Vouchers should be available that are used in the same
way as &#147;buy one, get one free&#148; offers. I want to make
sure that we go down that line, and that people can take something into
a shop and get something cheaper because of it. I do not mind what sort
of shop or circumstance, but please can we make sure that that is an
element of what we are trying to do? I know about the earlier schemes,
but they were tentative and slightly nice. We want a bit of vulgarity,
and the Minister to be straight down the line as if she were the
marketing boss of a major soap company.</div>

inviting me to be vulgar. I hope that I am not capable of doing that,
but I shall obviously
try.</div><a name="08070873000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">Whatever
the right hon. Gentleman thinks about the schemes and their being timid
or not, there were a lot of them. Local authorities came forward and
volunteered to undertake what were a considerable variety of schemes.
All I am saying to Conservative Front Benchers is that such a scheme
has been tried in this country. We saw a rise in recycling in 30 of the
53 trials. There was a positive impact, but the difficulty was that the
magnitude of the increase varied widely. It was hard to separate out
the extent to which the particular reward, rather than the education,
information and exhortation, increased recycling rates. As the scheme
took place some years ago, rates were much lower, so there was greater
scope for easy increases.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070873000434"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> Apart from exhortation and education, a key role
is played by the mechanism for collecting recyclates. If it is overly
complex or requires too much effort on the part of the consumer,
take-up will suffer. I urge the hon. Lady to look at the pilots in the
USA&#151;and perhaps not at the historic examples in which DEFRA has
taken part&#151;to see how the combination of vouchers plus effective
collection produces such positive
results.</div><a name="08070873000190"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070873000435"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> We have looked extensively at north America and
its different schemes, such as the rewards-only and the
rewards-and-charges schemes, as we have at continental Europe. I shall
make a point of looking at the example that the hon. Gentleman gave of
Wilmington, how long it has been happening and how sustainable it is.
Participation rates can be raised easily and quickly by giving people
vouchers, but how is that sustained for years on end? Where do the
commercial interests lie in offering the rewards and vouchers? How
sustainable is that? Does it raise competition issues in due course?
Many factors would have to be considered if a scheme was based entirely
on a commercial interest being allied with a public service. We must be
sustainable and constantly increase recycling rates, not just have a
burst of activity with a good result. We need to do
more.</div><a name="08070873000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having
considered all the research, I was advised strongly that, if we want to
increase recycling rates substantially and in a sustainable way, we
need to look to the continental and north American examples that
involve both rewards and charges. That is why, informed by all that
research, we have brought forward proposals to try out five pilots in
this country.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070873000436"></a>Mr.
Gummer:</b> I ask the Minister to remember where her advice is
coming from. It is coming from people who are universally unconnected
with private industry. She is being advised by civil servants who,
charming and able though they are, have specifically chosen not to be
part of the private sector. She is being advised by local authority
people who are in the same position. The American example is very
interesting. In fact, it is sustainable, and is the basis of a now
nationwide provision. It is supported by major companies and it really
has a result.</div>
<a name="08070873000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not
suggest that the Minister should take this on alone. I merely say that
it would be silly if we produced an exciting idea but did not find a
way of testing it ourselves. There is a worry about where our advice
comes from. When I was in her position I had no idea, because there was
a certain filtering of information, how much was being done
commercially in both continental Europe and the United States. I hope
that we will be given the opportunity to do this. I do not care two
hoots who does it. I want to achieve it. But this line of vulgarity is
important because otherwise the expansion of recycling is restricted to
particular sections of the community, which is a great
sadness.</div>
<a name="08070873000194"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070873000437"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> I hope that we can satisfy the right hon.
Gentleman. We will clearly look at all the schemes that come forward.
As he said, we may need to do some additional work ourselves in order
to inject some further ideas into the process. I am more than happy to
consider that. He would be entirely wrong, however, if he thought that
I spent all my time talking to civil servants and people from local
government. I have a significant number of meetings with entirely
commercial interests. The civil servants involved also have a great
deal of dialogue, particularly in these fields, with manufacturers and
retailers. There is no ideological reason for us to be opposed to the
sort of proposition that the right hon. Gentleman
makes.</div><a name="08070873000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is where we are. We believe that we need the possibility of pilots that
involve both rewards and charges. That is the provision in the Bill,
but it does not mean that we cannot do reward only&#151;I must make
that absolutely clear. All moneys raised in charges must be returned to
residents as a whole, so that the overall burden on householders will
not increase. That is an important point. Using words such as
&#147;penalties&#148; and &#147;fines&#148; suggests that it is
a new imposition on residents as a whole. It certainly is not. It is a
reward-and-charge scheme and a rebate-and-charge scheme, in which no
moneys accrue either to the Exchequer or to local government. That is a
very important
point.</div><a name="08070873000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 18 does not introduce any useful new powers. New clause 22
removes the current provisions which allow authorities to issue rebates
and charges to householders according to the amount of waste that they
throw away, thereby permitting reward-based schemes only. As I have
just said in relation to new clause 18, schedule 5 already allows
authorities to run such reward-only schemes. Rebates could be netted
off council tax bills or paid to householders directly. Indeed, the
powers also allow for other types of financial payments, including
vouchers, which new clause 22 specifically seeks to allow. As neither
new clause 18 nor new clause 22 would replace schedule 5, but would
merely add superfluous material, they must both be
opposed.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070873000438"></a>David
Maclean:</b> Before my hon. Friend the Member for Bexhill and
Battle perhaps chooses not to press the amendments in my name, I want
to say a few concluding words. The Minister asked whether I would be
pleased if we chose not to pursue my amendments, and I am not pleased
at all, but that may not prevent me from declining to press them
further.</div>
<a name="08070873000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
109 is not a wrecking amendment&#151;none of my amendments on the
amendment paper are intended to wreck the Bill. We are talking about a
pilot scheme, and I have tabled probing amendments outlining what I
thought were genuine pilot schemes. I agree with the hon. Member for
Northavon that it is daft to restrict ourselves to just five schemes,
when we could have four or six or seven. Yes, there is a cost involved,
so we cannot have 200, but why restrict ourselves to five if they are
pilot schemes?</div>
<a name="08070873000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thought
that the pilot schemes were intended to test not only the financial
charging and penalty mechanisms, but whether councils could do the
difficult recycling tasks that the rest of us cannot do. Instead, all
that we have heard is that they will test charges, rebates and fixed
penalties for householders who do not get things right. Local
authorities will therefore not be encouraged to introduce pilots to
deal with the huge amount of stuff that we cannot recycle&#151;the
Tetra Paks of this world. I am not totally obsessed with Tetra Paks,
except in the sense that when I go to recycle them, nobody wants to
take them. I cannot put them in the cardboard box, the foil box or the
plastic box. If I go to the recycling centre, warnings tell me not to
stick them in any of the containers.</div>
<a name="08070873000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">Local
councils have got me running up and down the stairs sorting out all
their rubbish for them, and we the householders are doing their dirty
work by putting our recycling into separate boxes, but when it comes to
the difficult stuff, they just do not want to know&#151;they do not
want to take the things that they find it difficult to recycle. In my
ignorance, I had assumed that at least one or two of the pilot schemes
would test volunteer councils that came along and said,
&#147;We&#146;ve got a system for dealing with the polystyrenes of
this world and with the composite materials&#151;the cardboard and
the foil together and the plastic and the paper together. Minister, can
we have a go at testing it out because we can take the stuff that most
other councils aren&#146;t taking? Here&#146;s our charging
regime.&#148;</div>
<a name="08070873000201"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070873000439"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> A council will be perfectly free to say that it
wants to do that in its pilot. Its proposal might be the most
successful if it offers much more. Everything is
possible.</div>
<a name="08070873000202"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070873000440"></a>David
Maclean:</b> I am delighted to hear it, but that was not the
message that I got from the Minister earlier. She suggested that our
proposals would be rejected because they would compel every council in
the country to recycle everything. Of course, I do not want the
provisions and the pilot schemes to do that, but we must draft such
probing amendments to explore the Minister&#146;s intentions in
Committee.</div>
<a name="08070873000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will
happily sit down now if the Minister tells us that the pilot schemes
will offer positive encouragement to councils&#151;it may be one or
two councils&#151;to come forward with ideas about how to recycle the
stuff that most councils do not want to touch because it is too 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column371" />Column number: 371</div>difficult to handle. We must solve that problem.
There is no point in the Minister introducing five schemes if they test
only the charging incentives, the penalties and ways of clobbering the
local community charge payer. Surely a pilot scheme must test the
mechanics to see whether councils can recycle stuff that others
cannot.</div><a name="08070873000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
right hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, Coastal is right that there
is a danger that the whole recycling issue will get stuck not in a
class system, but with the people who are already attuned to it, who
are already recycling and who probably already have a lower carbon
footprint. The issue should not be the preserve of puritanical
liberals&#151;luckily, we do not have too many of them in my
constituency. We know what puritanical liberals are like: they put
their plastic bottles through the dishwasher to make sure that they are
clean, they put their wet newspapers through the tumble-dryer to get
them dry, they load everything into their diesel Volvo and they go down
to the recycling centre. If that is what turns them on on a Saturday
night, good luck to them, but there are more exciting things to do in
Hexham and Penrith. <i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> My right hon.
Friend wanted vulgarity and he has got it.</div>
<a name="08070873000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">The serious
point&#151;I apologise for that excessive levity&#151;is that we
must make things easier for people. I am getting fed up with recycling.
I believe in it, but I am getting sick to the back teeth of having to
separate everything out and do the council&#146;s dirty work when it
will not take the stuff that I find it most difficult to cope with.
What is the point of a district council if it cannot deal with those
things, even on a pilot
study?</div><a name="08070873000308"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.15
pm</div><a name="08070873000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister has heard my plea. If the clauses need a slight tweaking on
Report, I beg the Government to give her the flexibility and the
freedom to have four, six or seven pilots, and to have some pilot
schemes that will deal with the rubbish and the recycling materials
that no one else wants. She will have my full support. I am happy to go
along with my hon. Friend the Member for Bexhill and Battle if he
wishes to withdraw my amendments, on the basis of the firm assurances
from the

amendment Nos. 25 and
26</div><a name="08070873000214"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070873000445"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> The amendments refine an amendment that was made
during the Bill&#146;s passage in the other place. Our intention was
to enable waste collection authorities to run waste reduction schemes
where residents buy tags or stickers to place on their waste
receptacles, either waste sacks or bins, when they put them out for
collection. Residents would then receive a flat rate rebate. People
buying the most tags would pay more overall, whereas others who had
bought fewer tags would make a net financial gain. To allow for such
schemes, we made an amendment to the Environmental Protection Act 1990
to give authorities the power to specify in a notice to residents under
section 46 of that Act how they should identify their waste
receptacles&#151;say, with a specific tag or sticker.</div>
<a name="08070873000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">That would
apply to all waste collection authorities, which was not our intention.
The amendment would avoid the unwanted impact and clarify that the
power to specify how waste should be identified should be available
only to those authorities running a waste collection scheme.</div>
<a name="08070873000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">Following the
pilots, as the Committee knows, the Government will report back to
Parliament and will consider whether to roll out to all authorities in
England powers to make a waste reduction scheme available. Should the
powers to implement such schemes be rolled out in future, the power to
specify how waste should be identified would continue to apply only to
those authorities operating a waste reduction scheme.</div>
<a name="08070873000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn now to
new clause 5. My noble Friend Lord Rooker mentioned during the
Bill&#146;s passage in the other place our intention to table an
amendment to clarify that once a local authority has informed residents
how they should present their waste for collection, such as by putting
it in a bin, the authority need not collect any waste left lying
outside the bin, for example. In the business, such waste is normally
termed &#147;side waste&#148;.</div>
<a name="08070873000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">As explained
then by my noble Friend, these sorts of policies have been successfully
operated by a significant number of authorities, with the support of
their communities, using powers conferred by the Environmental
Protection Act 1990. As part of a good overall service, they have
helped householders to reduce the waste that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column373" />Column number: 373</div>they throw away, and to increase the amount that
they recycle. We have not made any change to existing policy, but we
think it would be helpful for local authorities and for residents to
have a single clear point of reference in legislation. That is why we
tabled Government new clause 5, which would apply to all waste
collection authorities in England and
Wales.</div><a name="08070873000219"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070873000446"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> Would the provisions permit councils whose
current policy it is to allow side waste to continue to do
so?</div>
<a name="08070873000220"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070873000447"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> The hon. Lady is probably referring to situations
where the way in which waste should be collected is specified, but
householders put out additional waste and the collection authority
willingly takes it away. Authorities would obviously be able to do
that. They are not being dictated to, but are being given a power. It
is our understanding that the power exists at present.</div>
<a name="08070873000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">Local
authorities can refuse to take away the side waste because they have
made a specific provision under a section 46 notice. However, some
local authorities choose to take waste that is additional to the bin or
system that they use. That is their choice. There are, however, quite a
lot of authorities which say, &#147;We issued a notice. We made it
clear what you are required to do. You must not put out more
waste.&#148; The Bill will clarify what we believe to be the case
already&#151;that they have the power to
refuse.</div><a name="08070873000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Lady still frowns, but I hope that what I said is clear. Our
reason for tabling the new clause is to make it clear that all waste
collection authorities are covered by the relevant provisions. They
need not collect waste that is placed for collection in a way that
contravenes the collection requirements set out by the local authority
in a notice to residents. That may seem unnecessary and complex, but it
is intended to make the law absolutely clear.</div>
<a name="08070873000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">Government
amendment. No. 25 is consequential to Government new clause 5 on the
collection of household waste. The amendment adjusts the Bill so that
its provisions on the collection of household waste extend to England
and Wales only. Similarly Government amendment No. 26
adjusts the long title of the Bill to reflect the inclusion of the new
provisions.</div>
<a name="08070873000224"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070873000448"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> I note from the Minister that the amendments seem
primarily to be of the tidying-up kind. She answered my hon.
Friend&#146;s query, but we need to probe a little into the
ostensibly innocuous nature of the provisions and consider their exact
intention a little further.</div>
<a name="08070873000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
24 is an amendment to schedule 5, which in turn makes changes to
section 46 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990. For the benefit of
those without the Minister&#146;s mastery of the legislation, can she
clarify the significance of the 1990 Act, how it relates to the waste
section of the Climate Change Bill, and the effect that the amendment
will have on the operation of the Bill and the 1990 Act?</div>
<a name="08070873000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">Government
new clause 5 would also change section 46 of the 1990 Act.
The text to be inserted looks somewhat less innocuous than that in
amendment No. 24. It
reads:</div><a name="08070873000295"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
waste collection authority is not obliged to collect household waste
that is placed for collection in contravention of a requirement under
this section.&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column374" />Column number: 374</div><a name="08070873000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">Such
phrases can set alarm bells ringing all over the country, particularly
where residents have experience of particularly officious waste
collection regimes, so can the Minister assure me that the inclusion of
the amendment will not mean that people will get out of bed in the
morning to find that their rubbish has not been collected, on the
grounds that they put the bag 1 m in the wrong direction, it was a few
grams too heavy, or for some other pedantic
reason?</div>
<a name="08070873000228"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070873000449"></a>Mr.
Gummer:</b> The proposal worries me a great deal. We should be
passing legislation for the benefit of the customer, and not of the
provider. This sounds like bureaucratitis of the worst kind. It says,
&#147;I am the local authority, I am going to decide what is
convenient for me. You are going to do it and, if you don&#146;t, I
have no duty to collect your waste.&#148; That is precisely the
attitude of Government that people are getting tired of. It is an
attitude that has become more pervasive over recent years, and this
seems to be a prize example. The provision is too tight and I do not
like the feel of it at all. I suspect that our constituents will not
like it. I know what will happen. Mr. Jobsworth will be
around from the local council, saying, &#147;Wrong place, wrong type
of product. I&#146;m afraid we can&#146;t take it. And
what&#146;s more, they&#146;ve just moved the law so that we can
tell you that if you don&#146;t put it out in the right way, we
don&#146;t take
it.&#148;</div><a name="08070873000229"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070873000450"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> My right hon. Friend has his finger on the pulse
of the public, as ever. In my area many elderly people are worried
about such regulations. There has been the experience of bins not being
collected from time to time by new operators. Particularly when there
is a change in operator and a switch from one system to another, people
take a while to get used to it. Sometimes waste is not collected, even
though the householder has behaved entirely
sensibly.</div><a name="08070873000230"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070873000451"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> Will my hon. Friend take the opportunity to
press the Minister further? I am not entirely satisfied. My right hon.
Friend the Member for Suffolk, Coastal has struck on a problem. The
amendments make the system much less flexible than the present one.
There are people who work away and who are not able to put out their
rubbish on the collection day, but have come to an arrangement. There
might be pressing security reasons why that cannot be done. Could my
hon. Friend press the Minister further about the Government closing
down a degree of flexibility and making matters more difficult, which
will lead to more
fly-tipping?</div><a name="08070873000231"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070873000452"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> Absolutely. That is expressed across the country,
where new regimes and new contracts are coming into force, ending the
flexibility that many householders used to have with their dustman and
the relationship that they used to have with him, which found
expression at Christmas. There was often a personal relationship with
him. <i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Laughter.</i><i class="I">]</i> No, not the milkman.
<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Laughter.</i><i class="I">]</i> From a sedentary position, the
Minister has broken the habit of a lifetime and been rather vulgar.
However, I will rise above
it.</div><a name="08070873000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">All
I am saying is that customs have grown up locally where householders
were on good terms with their dustmen, ensuring flexibility in the
collection of rubbish. I would hate to see such arrangements
compromised by tightly worded legislation such as this. I have lost my
line of thought.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070873000454"></a>Gregory

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070873000455"></a>David
Maclean:</b> My concern is not just, as my hon. Friend said,
the jobsworths coming around and dictating what they cannot take and so
on, but what will happen to the stuff that they do not take. We are not
referring to people who, when they are supposed to be putting out their
garbage or recycling, dump a sofa or mattresses. What will happen to
the little bags? What happens if a person puts out extra newspapers in
the wrong box&#151;a whisky box or a wine box&#151;instead of the
official council plastic box? Such a move will inevitably be fly
tipping. I would like to have reassurances that if householders put out
extra, legitimate, material on the right day, it will not end up being
thrown over a hedge into a farmer&#146;s field in the
countryside.</div><a name="08070873000309"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.30

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070873000456"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> My right hon. Friend makes another valid point. We
want to hear the Minister say that she takes on board such common-sense
concerns and that a common-sense regime and culture will not be
superseded by an exact charter and a legalistic interpretation of the
rules and regulations. We hope that common sense will continue to
prevail.</div><a name="08070873000237"></a>

will be in <i class="I">The Sun</i>.</div>
<a name="08070873000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
24 is astonishing, in that we have to produce a piece of legislation to
permit a local council to ask someone to put a sticker on a bag in its
local authority area. It is a measure of just how ridiculously
centralised this country is that the amendment is before us and that 20
Members of Parliament have to discuss special clauses to allow people
to put stickers on bags. If the Minister insists that it is necessary,
we have to take it at face value.</div>
<a name="08070873000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">In all
seriousness, I share the concerns of other hon. Members about amendment
No. 24. The Minister is right that councils can already refuse to
collect waste under certain circumstances. I have had one such
experience. Having been told to shred my confidential waste paper, I
was then told that I did not have the right to have it collected for
recycling. In the brave new world of the right hon. Member for Penrith
and The Border, I suppose that it would have been collected anyway and
that it would have clogged up all the recycling
machines.</div>
<a name="08070873000240"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070873000458"></a>David
Maclean:</b> If the hon. Gentleman shredded his confidential
papers, why did the council refuse to collect that for recycling? Was
it in a plastic
bag?</div><a name="08070873000241"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070873000459"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> A paper bag. I gather that the dust generated by
shredded paper affects the machinery. There was a technical reason why
it could not be done. Such realities have to intrude on the debate
occasionally. The alarm that I have is that there is a difference 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column376" />Column number: 376</div>between shredded paper and what is generally known in the trade as
putrescible waste, which is something that I learned about on the
Select Committee. That is where the concern of the public starts to get
real along with that of environmental health officers and others. I
would hate to think that we were compromising any important public
health principles in the name of recycling and that we were
inadvertently placing people, such as the elderly and those in a
confused state, at risk of having their welfare compromised by well
intentioned provisions aimed at allowing councils to enforce recycling
schemes. I guess that the scenario could be positively Neapolitan if
things went badly wrong. I am seeking reassurance from the Minister
that even after the measure has been passed, there will still be
sufficient protection in other legislation or regulations to protect
vulnerable citizens and ensure that public health is protected as
strongly as it has
been.</div><a name="08070873000242"></a>

Ruddock:</b> In response to the final remarks of the hon.
Member for Cheltenham, I give him every assurance that this is not a
new measure&#151;I have been at pains to stress that before. At the
moment, local authorities issuing a section 46 notice can specify how
waste will be collected from a residence. Once they have done that, if
people do not comply, they may refuse to take away the additional
waste. As I said in relation to the intervention made by the hon.
Member for Vale of York, that does not mean to say that they will
refuse, but they may refuse. If there were any risk to public health,
they would have to collect. This provision already exists; local
authorities may refuse to collect and some
do.</div><a name="08070873000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
have been some questions about this. We have put clear provisions in
the Bill to make it obvious that this is the law and that the power

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070873000461"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> I will take this opportunity to correct the
record. When we debated clause 69 on Thursday, I was recorded in column
334 of the <i class="I">Official Report</i> as saying &#147;clause 60&#148;.
I will ensure that that is
corrected.</div><a name="08070873000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will press the Minister on a couple of points so that she can respond
to some criticisms that have been made. We have had lengthy debates
last Thursday and today on why five pilot areas have been designated.
Subsection (4) will give the Government the power to change
the pilot  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column377" />Column number: 377</div>areas. Does that mean that there can be additional pilot
areas or that a pilot area can be substituted? Is
five the maximum? How does she envisage subsection (4) being
interpreted?</div><a name="08070873000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister will recall that the Communities and Local Government
Committee report described the thrust of clause 70 as a &#147;massive
retreat&#148; because it will limit the number of recycling incentive
schemes to just five local authority areas and because the Government
have capped the amount that local authorities may offer as incentives
or take-in charges. Perhaps the most serious criticism is that it
delays any possibility of England-wide schemes until after 2012-13. Is
she confident that the Government will be able to introduce an
England-wide scheme before that date? What date do the Government have
in mind? Does the clause mark a departure from the Government&#146;s
waste strategy along the lines suggested by the criticisms, or does the
Minister believe that the clause is in keeping with the
strategy?</div><a name="08070873000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have had a little read of &#147;Erskine May&#148;, as one does from
time to time. Subsection (5) will exclude the prospect of an instrument
being treated as a hybrid instrument. Is that a standard procedure? I
am sure that the Minister will find that help is at hand. The Commons
is not as used to this procedure as the Lords because hybrid
instruments are largely used in the Lords. Such instruments give the
public the opportunity to petition. I do not know whether that could be
seen as a delaying tactic, given the strength of feeling about clauses
69 and the amendments to it. What was the thinking behind the
Government&#146;s seeking to exclude the possibility of a hybrid
instrument?</div><a name="08070873000252"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070873000462"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> The hon. Lady is correct to suggest that I might
require the help that is at hand in dealing with her final point about
hybrid instruments. I have looked at the provision and taken a briefing
on it, but as we are in a formal Committee, I will read what is
provided to me in due course to be on the safe
side.</div><a name="08070873000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Lady referred to the Communities and Local Government Committee
report, which said that the clause was a &#147;massive
retreat&#148;. Everyone who has spoken has indicated that these are
subjects on which people feel strongly. We have considered, therefore,
that moving immediately to the roll-out of schemes across
the country would be premature, given the controversy that they have
generated. That is why we thought that it would be much better to start
with pilots and to have a limit of five pilots. In no way does
that go against our waste strategy, as outlined a year and a
half ago. We said that we would create such powers and they are
being created, albeit by beginning with piloting.</div>
<a name="08070873000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government have said that we want to have substantial results from
those pilots before proposing any roll-out and that we want a
parliamentary debate on those results, so the timing could be as the
Committee has suggested. That is not a huge problem because we are
already on target for the 2010 requirement under European law to reduce
the amount of waste going to landfill, and we believe that we can
achieve the 2013 target. It is beyond that time that we know we will
have a huge challenge to meet the 2020 targets. If the schemes were to
be rolled out within that time frame, it would be a way of rising to
the challenge of the difficulties that face us regarding the 2020
target for the reduction of waste going from households to
landfill.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column378" />Column number: 378</div><a name="08070873000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the issue of capping the amount that could be charged, although we have
not really been referring to charges, based on the schemes that we have
studied from overseas, the indicative amount that might be charged
would be of the order of &#163;50 over a year. That is not a huge
amount. As I said previously, there has been a great deal of excitement
about this, which has come primarily from the hon. Member for Brentwood
and Ongar, and it has been suggested that we could be talking about
&#163;1,000 a year. We want not only to make it clear that that is
ludicrous, but to reassure people by saying that we will take the power
to cap in case any local authority wanted to propose anything that was
unreasonable.</div>
<a name="08070873000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am now
getting the advice that I need, although there is much of
it<i class="I">&#151;[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> It keeps coming, so I do
not know whether the opinion is changing. I am told that hybrid
procedures do not state that there will be full public consultation, if
that helps anybody. If a scheme does not start, a designation order can
be revoked and another designated in its place&#151;that is the
precise answer to the question about changing where a scheme is. Apart
from as provided for under that power, only five may be
designated.</div><a name="08070873000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is reasonable to remind the Committee that we are talking about five
pilots, not a scheme throughout the country, so the question of the
hybrid procedure would relate to a small number of cases. I confirm
that such an instrument would allow the public to petition. There is no
doubt that that could result in the process slowing down. However, of
course, there will be full public consultation on all the secondary
legislation

differ with the Minister&#146;s conclusion. Waste strategies are
coming forward in each local authority, and several include heat in
some shape or form, whether that is straight incineration or not. I
repeat the request that I made in connection with clause 69. In
relation to the provision for a report or review in clause 71, and an
interim report in clause 72, will the Government elaborate on what was
said at column 333 so as to end the public disquiet on that form of
waste reduction?</div>
<a name="08070873000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not know
if the mailbags of other hon. Members reflect my own, but in the Vale

<div class="Column"><a name="Column379" />Column number: 379</div>five ongoing campaigns. In relation to the reports, will the Minister

disquiet about the matter?</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070873000464"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> Unless I am wrong, the hon. Lady is not dealing
with any provision that exists in clause 71. Those reports are about
the pilots. What she talks about has nothing to do with waste
collection; it is to do with waste disposal and incineration&#151;she
refers to heat, but I think that she means incineration
plants.</div>
<a name="08070873000265"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070873000465"></a>Miss

sending less to landfill. Does the Minister say that none of the pilots
will look at anything other than recycling?</div>
<a name="08070873000266"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070873000466"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> The pilots are about incentivising behaviour and
the way that householders separate household waste into recyclables and
residual waste. The destination of residual waste is a decision for the
disposal authority. In some cases, that is the same authority as the
collection authority, in others it is separate. Those decisions do not
relate to the provisions in the Bill. I responded to the points, but
they remain outside the provisions of the clause. I will write to the
hon. Lady about where to find information that can satisfy the public
about the safe operation of incinerators.</div>

That maize requires so much energy that it may be making a contribution
to climate change rather than tackling it. There are examples of
deforestation in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column380" />Column number: 380</div>other parts of the world that might be making way
for the production of otherwise sustainable biofuels. Yet this is an
area where there is a potential for CO<span class="Sub">2</span> reduction, and I am
sure that many of us have examples of sustainable approaches to
biofuels, using algae or switchgrass, or more energy-intensive crops
such as sugar beet&#151;provided that they are not grown on
deforested land. There is also short rotation coppice, with willow in
the UK. In my constituency, a company called Green Fuels sources local
reused cooking oil and turns it into biodiesel. That is a very
sustainable approach to providing transport
fuel.</div><a name="08070873000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
we are in a fast-moving policy landscape, as the Government would like

that</div><a name="08070873000297"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Professor
Gallagher also concludes that there is a risk that the uncontrolled
expansion and use of biofuels could lead to unsustainable changes in
land use, such as the destruction of rainforest to make way for the
production of crops. That might, in turn, increase greenhouse gas
emissions, as well as contributing to higher food prices and shortages.
The Gallagher report therefore concludes that the introduction of
biofuels should be slowed until policies are in place to direct biofuel
production on to marginal or idle land and until these are demonstrated
to be effective.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>, 7 July 2008;

within 24 hours an opportunity arises in this Bill to make such a

are operating in the context of wider European policy, including the
2003 directive that mandates European nations to increase the
proportion of road fuels from renewable sources to 5.75 per cent. by
2010, and the imminent renewable energy directive, which may raise that
target to 10 per cent. by 2020. We agree with the Government&#146;s
statement, although it has come late in the day, that action is
required at EU level to modify that imminent biofuels target and to
place a moratorium&#151;I would say&#151;on biofuels targets until
we have strict sustainability criteria in place. Yet the Government
have pressed ahead with some policy in their own right, including the
renewable transport fuel obligation introduced in April.</div>
<a name="08070873000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
possible&#151;although not necessarily likely&#151;that the EU
directive might not be agreed before April 2009, and that even if the

might be allowed to develop stricter criteria. Such criteria might not
prevent the importation of other biofuels&#151;I gather that that
would be prevented under the directive&#151;but they might provide
the basis for the kind of regime that we have seen in other sectors,
where labelling and public information might lead to more sustainable

biofuels.</div><a name="08070873000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

law.</div><a name="08070873000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am therefore delighted&#151;genuinely pleased&#151;that the Liberal
Democrats have looked more closely at the issue and that they have
clearly decided that things must change. Although I am happy to support
the amendment, it is a shame that we could not have halted the RTFO in
its tracks earlier.</div>
<a name="08070873000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">What exactly
does the RTFO require? It stipulates that all fuel suppliers must
ensure that 2.5 per cent. of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column382" />Column number: 382</div>their sales in the UK come from biofuels from April this year. That
figure will rise to 5 per cent. by 2010. The RTFO is designed to help
bring the UK into line with the European Union biofuels directive,
which sets targets for all EU countries to achieve biofuels usage rates
of 2 per cent. by the end of 2005 and 5.75 per cent. by the
end of 2010. A failure to ensure that such a vast amount of renewable
fuels are obtained sustainably will negate any positive efforts to
tackle climate change that such biofuels will supposedly bring, as the
hon. Gentleman suggested. The notion of destroying vast swathes of
pristine rain forest in a bid to protect the
environment&#151;</div><a name="08070873000285"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070873000471"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I remind the hon. Gentleman that we are
discussing the general functions of the administrator in relation to
the schedule. We are not having a wide-ranging debate on biofuels.
Members&#146; comments must relate to this schedule and the duties of
the administrator.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070873000472"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> I stand admonished, Mr.
Atkinson.</div><a name="08070873000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
believe that such a notion is unacceptable. The current reporting
requirement and the Government&#146;s hopes to have mandatory
sustainability standards in place by 2011 are not sufficient safeguards
to protect the environment. By 2011, we will already have sold more
than 5 billion litres of biofuels in the UK. Therefore, on what I
rightly assert to be a moral principle alone, I repeat now what my
party colleagues said in Committee Room 11 more than eight months ago:
we cannot allow the Government, who up till now have shown little or no
regard for the impact of biofuels imports on the environment, to set
targets for biofuels with no statutory requirement for sustainability.
That is why I am happy to support the amendment, which would place a
sustainability requirement for the RTFO on a statutory
footing.</div><a name="08070873000288"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">It
