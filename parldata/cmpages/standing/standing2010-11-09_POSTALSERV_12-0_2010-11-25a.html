                           </span> Before the
adjournment, I was explaining to the Committee how the amendments
provide for a situation whereby both parliamentarians and the public
have easy access to information on how the privatised Royal Mail is
affecting the post office network, thereby providing transparency and
the ability to scrutinise.<a class="bkMark" name="10112542000024">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I urge the
Minister to give amendment 33 strong consideration, as it would ensure
that the public, parliamentarians and stakeholders knew exactly where
post office services were being provided, rather than simply outlet
locations, which may not provide the proper service that the public
have become accustomed to and rely on. It is important that the public
and Members of Parliament have access to that information on a regular
basis. It would allow us to identify service provision black holes and
to lobby for alternative provision such as mobile services, a point
made very well by my hon. Friend the Member for Llanelli.<a class="bkMark" name="10112542000025">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment 36
goes further than amendment 33. It calls for the listing of the number
of post office services that have ceased to be delivered since the last
report, the locations where that has happened, and the reason for the
reduction in the service. I understand that the information could be
gained by comparing reports year on year, but if we want to provide the
public with transparency and accessible information, that should be
done by Post Office Ltd. Amendment 36 would ensure that the reasons
were outlined for the service reduction since the previous annual
report.<a class="bkMark" name="10112542000026">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment 37
would oblige Post Office Ltd to provide annual information on the
number and location of areas being serviced by mobile provision. Again,
that is an important amendment. It would allow stakeholders to
scrutinise the use of the service and its growth or, indeed, reduction.
As my hon. Friend explained, it would give individuals information that
they should be entitled to have. It would be helpful for the public,
Members of Parliament and stakeholders to have easy access, through the
report, to service provision information, and to see exactly how much
the service is being used and which areas are served by a mobile
service.<a class="bkMark" name="10112542000027">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
38 would add another level of transparency to the Post Office report,
which is crucial for proper scrutiny of the effect that a privatised
Royal Mail is having on the Post Office and the services that it
provides. While amendment 36 would enable the public to see where and
why services had been reduced, amendment 38 would enable
them to see what Royal Mail was doing to address those reductions.
Amendment 48 would provide for the introduction of proposed new
paragraph (d), which would ensure that the report indicated any changes
in the level of utilisation by the universal service provider—at
this point Royal Mail—of the post office. This is vital to
ensure that stakeholders can see how the universal service provider is
using the post office once Royal Mail is sold off.<a class="bkMark" name="10112542000028">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Finally,
amendment 49 seeks to change subsection (3)(c) so that it
includes not just small but medium businesses. It is important that
medium-sized businesses become part of the report. Medium-sized
businesses are reliant on accessing services that post offices provide,
and they can have a range of access challenges, in many of the same
ways that small businesses do. Medium-sized businesses therefore need
to be recognised and included

amendments will provide clearer, more accessible information to the
public, Members of Parliament and key stakeholders. If the Government
plans come to fruition, and Royal Mail is 90% privatised, with only
“at least 10%” owned by or on behalf of employees, there
must be greater transparency so the effects of privatisation on the
post office network can be easily
seen.<a class="bkMark" name="10112542000034">&#160;</a>

allowing them easily to understand any changes to the post office
service and, indeed, to the provision of the services that I talked

doubt, the constituents of Members across the House. For those reasons,
I urge the Committee to support the amendments of my hon. Friends the

I said that the amendments were about accountability and democracy, so
it is only right and proper that Parliament should be able to receive
and debate the information provided in an annual report, as well as the
additional information for which we are asking. Parliament is a
legislative body, but it is also there to scrutinise the Executive and
to hold to account the decisions and actions of Government. If the
Minister was indeed minded to accept our amendments, perhaps that would
become his clause IV moment—we will wait and
see.<a class="bkMark" name="10112542000037">&#160;</a>

the post office network remains publicly owned or is mutualised, it
will hopefully remain a national body providing a valued and valuable
public service to our communities. As such, parliamentarians will no
doubt wish to retain an interest in its development.

                           </div>Also, public performance reporting of public services is good practice,
but for it to be meaningful and add value, comprehensive and robust
information must be provided, which is why agreeing to the amendments
is essential if the process is to have any value at all. Not least,
there is the need to ensure that the £1.34 billion that it is
proposed be invested in the post office network—not an
inconsiderable sum—is spent wisely; it is public money, after
all. It is therefore not unreasonable for Parliament to have the
opportunity to consider the progress that the network is making, at
least on an annual basis.<a class="bkMark" name="10112542000038">&#160;</a>

Members this morning expressed concern about the apparent burden that
collating that information might place on the business; the hon. Member
for Witham raised that point. No one wishes to place an undue burden on
anyone, but the Bill already places a duty on the Post Office company
to provide myriad pieces of information about its business to the
Secretary of State. The template is already there. All we ask is that a
little more information be provided.<a class="bkMark" name="10112542000039">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">It is a
positive thing for Parliament to consider the ongoing progress of a
transforming post office network. This is not about providing for a
forum in which to talk down the postal service, as some hon. Members
have suggested, but about a real opportunity to engage in the process
and add value. There are many good ideas out there about how the
interface with the customer can be improved and how more services can
be provided.<a class="bkMark" name="10112542000040">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We have heard
myriad good ideas mentioned about creating greater accessibility,
particularly in more rural and remote areas, addressing the poverty gap
and working in partnership with other agencies, such as the Department
for Work and Pensions or local authorities. In my constituency, in the
town of Blackburn, West Lothian, where Susan Boyle resides—I am
remembering one of my first interventions, when the Chair rightly cut
me short—my local authority, when I was its leader, took steps
to save the local post office by providing it with the council’s
local cash collection function for council tax, rent and other service
charges. Doing that created a one-stop shop for a range of pay-in and
withdrawal services in that
community.<a class="bkMark" name="10112542000041">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
am sure that there are similar successful models throughout the
country. We have heard mention of shops and even pubs providing post
office services, but we can go much further as part of a modernisation
package. We all, though,<strong> </strong>need to be part of that process: the
post office network, employees, unions, communities and
parliamentarians. We all have post offices in our communities and we
all have constituents who use them and who have their opinions. If we
wish to do our job as elected representatives, we need all that
relevant information; we need the opportunity to have an input into,
and a say on, the development of a great, cherished national
institution that is very much part of the British way of life. Will the
Minister allow me, as the elected Westminster MP for my constituents
from Dechmont, Breich, Ecclesmachan and Faucheldean—I will not
go on—to represent their interests in annual debates on the
development and progress of the post office network, as it spends their

very frustrating for Members to have to wait through the break to hear
the phrase and consider how it will compare with previous soubriquets,
including Red Bull, the clause 3 moment and the Gordian knot. It was a
difficult choice, looking at the amendments and having listened to the
debate, but the cumulative impact of the amendments suggests to me that
they should be christened “War and Peace”. I will try to
explain that through my remarks. I am not referring to the long process
of trying to reform Royal Mail or the post office network, but the
cumulative impact of the amendments.<a class="bkMark" name="10112542000043">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">It is right
that we have spent some time discussing post offices today. Although
there is mention of post offices in one or two other clauses, this is
the last clause in the Bill that really focuses on them. It is right
for Opposition Members to have talked about the important, unique and
valued role that post offices play up and down the country, and I agree
with them. Indeed, some were kind about the level of funding that we
have put in as a result of the spending

was delighted to attend a meeting of the all-party parliamentary group
on post offices last night, at which a number of Committee members were
also present. They will have heard the general secretary of the
National Federation of SubPostmasters, George Thomson, talk about the
federation’s support for the Bill. He issued a news release
yesterday saying that sub-postmasters back Government plans for the
Post Office. That is a reassuring message for Opposition Members; the
national federation that represents sub-postmasters believes that the
approach that we are taking in the Bill, and our Post Office policy
more generally, commands a great deal of support from sub-postmasters,
who are, of course, the
experts.<a class="bkMark" name="10112542000045">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">It
worried me to see and hear at the APPG, and in the press, the notion
that lots of post offices are closing. The national federation has
recognised that the Government have said that there will be no closure
programme of post offices. In saying that, we have made it clear that
if a sub-postmaster retires or dies, we cannot necessarily prevent any
individual closure. It is interesting that the figures that were
bandied around are not recognised by Post Office Ltd. There seem to be
some significant
inaccuracies.<a class="bkMark" name="10112542000046">&#160;</a>

that we have inherited and are trying to put right. I want to get it on
the record that we have seen reports of post offices apparently closing
in places such as Tintagel and Padstow in Cornwall, but when one looks
at the reality, it appears that those post offices have been replaced,
and transferred to post office local branches in Tintagel and St Merryn
Padstow. It appears

                           </div>that the data for that allegation are not accurate. People need to

discussions in the debate this morning about 900 post offices for sale,
and it was implied that that meant they were going to disappear. It is
not unusual for numbers of post offices to be for sale; that is the
usual run of things. In fact, the figure given by Post Office Ltd is
that on average 200 branches change ownership every quarter, and that
has been consistent for a number of years. In the six months to
September 2010 there were 302 successful commercial transfers of post
offices, as the sub-postmaster sold on to someone else. That is the way
those things usually operate. It would be wrong for the Committee,
either through briefings received from others or from press reports, to
be under any misapprehension. That is why we need a report such as we
are
proposing.<a class="bkMark" name="10112542000049">&#160;</a>

that yesterday it was George Thomson of the National Federation of
SubPostmasters who used the figure 900? It was his estimate, presumably
based on data gathered from his members. Therefore, it is not a figure
that has been plucked out of thin air. Quite clearly, there is a
problem in a situation like mine in Felinfoel, where we have been
waiting over 18 months to find somebody to take over in an area where
there is potential for a viable post office. It is difficult. Does the

deny that it was George Thomson who used the figure of 900, and I do
not dispute the figure. It is right, but it should be put in context.
It is not unusual for post offices come on the market; the trend is for
200 to do so every quarter, and in the last six months 302 have been
successfully transferred. One needs to put the number in

the hon. Lady said about the example from her constituency—that
when a post office closes it is often completely outside the control of

The post office in Tolworth broadway in my constituency was closed when
the sub-postmaster had to leave. I was approached by Post Office Ltd,
which said, “She must go into the change programme.” I
said, “Absolutely not. There is a real demand for a post
office,” and I worked with the Post Office and local people to
find a sub-postmaster. It took us a long time, but working with Sue

number and location of post offices and their accessibility. We propose
a network report that is much more comprehensive. It will include

absolutely right; the circumstances then were different. But those
circumstances occurred when Royal Mail and Post Office Ltd were in the
same group. The notion that public ownership or the two companies being
in the same group somehow protects post offices is incorrect, as
demonstrated by the 7,000 post office

                        <p class="tabbed">I believe
that many parliamentarians are interested in whether the Post Office is
providing any services for other postal operators in the UK. The
Opposition spoke a lot on Tuesday about the importance of the Post
Office’s income from mails or the postal service. I
want to remind everyone that, although we want the Post Office to be an
even stronger partner for Royal Mail in the future, and we know that
sub-postmasters value the footfall that mail customers generate, the
projected decline in letter volumes means that the postal service will
not be a growth area for the Post Office, despite the potential
opportunities in parcels. So we need to ensure that the definition is
much wider than would be the case if we only looked at amendment
48.<a class="bkMark" name="10112542000080">&#160;</a>

already told the Committee about plans for the future of the post
office network and the development of new revenue streams, as detailed
in our policy statement. We should be clear that the majority of the
post office network’s income already comes from other sources,
in particular financial services, government services and, as the hon.
Member for Llanelli demonstrated, telephony services. Any report should
not simply focus on services from the universal service provider; it
needs to be wider, and that is how we have written the
clause.<a class="bkMark" name="10112542000081">&#160;</a>

                        <p>to both small and medium
businesses. We know that businesses value the post office network.
According to research by the Federation of Small Businesses, almost 20%
of small businesses visit the post office every day, and nearly half
twice a week. That shows how significant the post office network is in
the life of our economy. I therefore share the concern that lies behind
amendment 49, and I agree with its intention. I am trying to
be as helpful as I can to the hon. Member for Ochil and South
Perthshire, to show that great minds think alike, but the clause
already covers what the Opposition seek.<a class="bkMark" name="10112542000087">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
should be clear that there is no universal definition of what
constitutes a small or medium-sized business. In the United States, the
term “small businesses” generally refers to businesses
with fewer than 100 employees, while “medium businesses”
refers to those with fewer than 500 employees. In the UK, SME
statistics define a small business as one with 10 to 49 employees, and
a medium business as one with 50 to 250 employees. If we are going to
be particularly technical, one could argue that since UK SME statistics
define a small business as a business with between 10 and 49 employees,
and a micro-business as one with between one and nine employees, both
micro-businesses and sole traders could be excluded from the definition
in clause 11(3).<a class="bkMark" name="10112542000088">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">However, that
is not what we are suggesting. About 95% of SMEs have fewer than 10
employees, and we know that post offices play a particularly valuable
role for some in that group—such as eBay sellers—so they
should be included in the report. We therefore intend “small
businesses” to include all those with fewer than 250 employees,
which is in line with the broader UK statistical definition of an SME.
Of course, in line with the relevant provision in clause 4, if the
Secretary of State was not satisfied that the post office was providing
broad enough information to meet that requirement, under powers in
clause 11(4) they could direct the post office to provide any
additional information that they deemed
necessary.<a class="bkMark" name="10112542000089">&#160;</a>

the Bill that the Minister’s intentions regarding the figure of
250 employees are covered either by clause 4 or clause 11. Will he go
away and come back on Report with something that makes that clearer,
perhaps by inserting “small businesses, or businesses of up to
250 employees” in the relevant

seek to increase the statutory requirements for the content of the post

on changes in the network is precisely the sort of information that I
would expect such a report to contain, and I believe that the current
provisions in clause 11 are sufficient to ensure that. Although we are
committed to improving transparency in the post office network, the
desire must be balanced against the need to limit the bureaucracy
imposed on Post Office Ltd and on individual
sub-postmasters. Increasing the amount of data that they are asked to
collect and compile may distract them from their real task of securing
a sustainable post office network for the future.<a class="bkMark" name="10112542000100">&#160;</a>

                        <p>The majority of post
offices—the hon. Gentleman has mentioned the figure of 97%,
which I think is correct—are independently owned and operated
businesses. Requiring the report to contain details on the nature and
extent of any businesses run in parallel with the post office business
would impose a significant new regulatory burden on what are primarily
small or even micro businesses. Opposition Members seemed to suggest
that such information is currently collected but I have to tell them
that it is not, and it would be a new burden. One can only imagine how
the report would have to be drafted in order to take account of post
offices in fish and chip shops, pubs, libraries, small shops,
off-licences and garages. We could end up with an extremely unwieldy
report that does not add much to the debate, when we should focus on
ensuring that post offices are there and accessible to those who need

slightly confused between POL and individual sub-postmasters. The
problem with the amendment is that it would impose a huge burden on
individual sub-postmasters who run private businesses. Yes, of course
post offices have a social use. That is why the Government are putting
£1.3 billion or £1.4 billion into both subsidy and
transforming the network. We are not going to repeat the closure
programme, because we recognise their social value. But we also
recognise that individual sub-postmasters have invested a huge amount
of time and money to build up their businesses, and we want them to
make those businesses successful. We want to ensure that the post
office network thrives. Tying them up in unnecessary regulations is not
the right
approach.<a class="bkMark" name="10112542000106">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> My concern is about the way in which the amendment
is drawn. Sub-postmasters up and down the country would have to fill in
an awful lot of forms to ensure that there was consistency and
coherence and that the information was up to date. I am not prepared to
allow that. Yes, of course we need to ensure transparency. That is why
we are going further than the Labour party proposed to go on
transparency—so that we can have accountability in reporting.
However, in going further than the Labour party was prepared to go, we
will not impose burdens and red tape on
sub-postmasters.<a class="bkMark" name="10112542000125">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">If
I may, I shall proceed to amendments 33 and 36 to 38. These would
increase the statutory requirements for the report, focusing on changes
in network provision. Given our commitments to the post office network,
hon. Members should have less reason to worry about post office
closures than they may have had in previous years. Although we agree
that an annual report is very important, an annual report on its own is
only an annual report. Other means of monitoring the post office
network are already in place and have already been put before
Parliament. I am surprised that although we have had a very long debate
on the “War and Peace” amendments, we have not heard
about those other ways of reporting, which are readily
available.<a class="bkMark" name="10112542000126">&#160;</a>

example, a comprehensive list of all post offices in the country,
broken down by parliamentary constituency, is placed in parliamentary
Libraries each summer. I am sure that Opposition Members were aware of
that. My Department monitors Post Office Ltd’s compliance with
the access criteria on a monthly basis. Also, Post Office Ltd publishes
details of the monthly changes in the network, currently subject to
local consultation, on its website. I have an example for the Committee
that sets down all the consultations relating to March 2010. That is
monthly reporting and is in much greater detail, because it is about
consultations that the public need to know about. That has not been
mentioned to show how open and transparent the Post Office already
is.<a class="bkMark" name="10112542000127">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">On
a quarterly basis, the Post Office sends reports on the number of post
offices and their geographical distribution to parliamentary Libraries.

it independently to scrutinise the

the measures ensure that the information that Parliament receives on

                           </strong> We will be discussing that point in some detail in
later clauses. The hon. Gentleman will note, when we get to those
clauses, that Consumer Focus is not mentioned, but the National
Consumer Council is. That was the predecessor body to the Consumer
Council, which the previous Government abolished before they moved
related responsibilities to Consumer Focus. We are indeed moving
Consumer Focus into Citizens Advice, but we are not in any way
abolishing its duties, whether in relation to its wider consumer duties
or its duties with respect to things such as the post office network. I
have made that point very clear to Consumer Focus, and it was also made
clear in the statement by my right hon. Friend the Business Secretary.
I am happy to debate that point, and I hope that I have taken the early
opportunity to be able to dispel hon. Member’s concerns that
somehow we have had to weaken the independent consumer monitoring of
the post office network. Nothing could be further from our intentions.
I would therefore ask hon. Members not to press amendments 4, 33, 36,
37 and

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
5 seeks a statutory requirement for a parliamentary debate on the
annual report on the post office network after it has been laid in
Parliament. I am sorry to disappoint the hon. Member for Angus, but I
believe that that amendment is also unnecessary. Through the
requirement to lay a report, alongside the other measures that I have
described, such as the monthly and quarterly reports, I think there is
already suitable provision for parliamentary oversight. Furthermore,
hon. Members are skilled and experienced enough to secure a debate,
should they want one, through the usual channels. I
therefore urge the hon. Gentleman not to press his
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="10112542000134">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">There
were one or two other points in the debate that I should deal with in
case there are particular concerns to hon. Members in their
constituencies. The issue of mobile post offices was raised by the hon.
Member for Llanelli and other Labour Members. I am not quite sure
whether they are concerned about certain definitions in clause 11. If
they are concerned that somehow mobile post offices will not be covered
by the report, it is certainly my understanding that they will be. I
would like to reassure hon. Members that information about the number,
location and services offered by mobile post offices is precisely the
sort of information that should be covered in Post Office Ltd’s
annual report. It is not our intention for there to be any
ambiguity.<a class="bkMark" name="10112542000135">&#160;</a>

this is one of the better areas of their policy on post office networks

                           </strong> We have had a long and interesting debate.
I understand that Government Members are concerned about
regulation. I ran a small business and I have had experience of Her
Majesty’s Revenue and Customs, and the Scottish Legal Aid Board,
so I know a bit about form-filling and what you have to do to keep a
business going.<a class="bkMark" name="10112542000141">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendments are not intended to impose regulation on small businesses;
they are intended to provide Parliament with a regular update on the
state of our post office network. We must remember that the Government,
the Scottish Parliament, the Welsh Assembly and others are—quite
rightly—putting a huge amount of public money into the network
to help it to diversify and change. We need to see how that network
changes over the years and how it links in with other parts of business
and with the social needs of our community.<a class="bkMark" name="10112542000142">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The Minister
has said that much of the information is not available. I recall that
when the previous Government were closing post offices, Post Office Ltd
provided me with huge amounts of information about every post office in
my constituency—in fact I could hardly lift the box that it gave
me. That information covered everything from the post office to the
buses that passed it, who used it, how many people used it, and what
other sort of business took place there. That information already
existed
then.<a class="bkMark" name="10112542000143">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> My point is that the information already exists on

                        <p class="tabbed">I seek your
guidance, Mr Hood, but I would like to press amendments 3 and 4 to a
vote, but not amendment 5, because I recognise that there
may be other ways in which to secure the debate that it proposes. One
of my reasons for tabling amendment 5, however, is my concern about
some of the things that are happening.<a class="bkMark" name="10112542000149">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">For example,
in this House we have always had a regular annual debate on fisheries,
which is very important in my part of the world. I notice that that
debate has disappeared from the Government’s agenda and is now
taking place only in Westminster Hall as part of the Backbench Business
Committee agenda. Such a situation is indicative that if these matters
are not dealt with, debates on important subjects such as the Post
Office will not be aired in the Chamber.<a class="bkMark" name="10112542000150">&#160;</a>

important for Post Office Ltd for parliamentarians to know how our post
office network develops once Royal Mail is—unfortunately, if it

those two companies. I should, therefore, like to press those

                        <p class="tabbed">I
want to take the Minister through some of his comments. I acknowledge
that the Government’s position is that there will be no closures
programme, but we know that there will be post office closures. The
quarterly report for Post Office Ltd, which the Minister mentioned,
shows that there will be closures. The comments that we have heard
about Bankfoot being one of those 900 reiterated the point that places
that should have post office services do not have
them.<a class="bkMark" name="10112542000155">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">My
hon. Friends and I agree that, with the transition and what will happen
to Royal Mail, the Minister does not want to understand the importance
that we attribute to the privatised Royal Mail in relation to the
clause and the amendments as they relate to the Post Office. That is 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 419<a class="bkMark" name="Column419">&#160;</a>
                           </div>his prerogative, but the need for the report is even more important,
because the thrust of the Bill is to privatise Royal Mail. We agree
that the report is needed, and we want to make it better. Our
amendments 33 and 36 to 83 do that. We want to see the amendments
incorporated into the Bill so that we can better evaluate the money
that the Government are investing into the post offices; the amendments
will allow us to do
that.<a class="bkMark" name="10112542000156">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
accept that subsection (2)(b) may be designed to match the impact of
amendment 48. I take the Minister at his word on that. However, we felt
that that subject was so important that we wanted it singled out.
Although I shall not press that amendment to a Division at this point,
we may want to return to it
later.<a class="bkMark" name="10112542000157">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On
amendment 49, and how there is not an overwhelming definition for small
businesses, the Minister talked about the definition of small
businesses in the United States, but the definition in the Bill does
not deal with those. I said in my opening remarks on the
amendments that I am happy to accept whatever definition the Minister
wanted to put on small and medium-sized businesses. I hear
the Minister when he says that he means “small
businesses” to encapsulate those with up to 250 employees,
which, by one of the definitions of his Department would include small
and medium-sized businesses—I am grateful for that—but I
am disappointed that he did not see fit to make a slight amendment to
the relevant clause by adding “small businesses up to 250
employees” into subsection (3)(c). That would have made it
simple. Had that been included in the Bill, we would not be having this
discussion. The Bill is lacking clarity in that regard. I hope that the
Minister’s words come
true.<a class="bkMark" name="10112542000158">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
will return to our intentions in respect of the amendments in a moment
or two. Let me first deal with the heart of what the Minister called
the “War and Peace” amendments. We have a structural
disagreement here. We Opposition Committee members have given examples
showing that the level of information that we want to be included in
the report actually exists. We can all quote verbatim examples of such
information being provided to us by Post Office Ltd. Indeed, I did so
in my earlier contributions in relation to Coalsnaughton and<strong>
</strong>Tillicoultry. All of us could probably highlight
examples.<a class="bkMark" name="10112542000159">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">No
burden would be placed on either Post Office Ltd or sub-postmasters by
asking for such information to be included in the report. The
information is in Post Office Ltd’s regional offices, and it
just needs pulling together into a format that would allow us to get a
better handle on how Post Office Ltd copes with changes in
future.<a class="bkMark" name="10112542000160">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On
the points that the Minister has made about reports, to which I have
made reference, already being available to Parliament, nobody is
disputing what is currently available. In conjunction with the need for
an annual report, we feel that the Minister believes that what is
currently available is not enough. We agree that it is not enough, but
our amendments would make the Bill, as drafted, better in that context.
In his response to the amendments, the Minister did not convince me or
my hon. Friends, and he certainly did not convince the hon. Member for
Angus, that an additional burden would be created, which was what the
main part of his response focused
on.<a class="bkMark" name="10112542000161">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Minister has asked us not to press amendments 33, 36, 37 and
38 to a vote, and if he had convinced us, we might have decided not to
do so. Those amendments

will try not to detain the Committee too long, but we are getting to a

                        <p class="tabbed">Clause 16
allows the Secretary of State to create a new public scheme and
transfer qualifying accrued rights into it. Qualifying accrued rights
are the liabilities for which the Government intend to take
responsibility, so, broadly speaking, they are all the rights that
members of the Royal Mail pension plan have accrued before an
unspecified date. Liabilities accruing after that date will remain with
the new RMPP. We welcome the transfer of liabilities to the new scheme.
That is what taking responsibility for the deficit amounts
to.<a class="bkMark" name="10112542000305">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Clause 16(4)
allows the Secretary of State to make the benefits for active members
different from the benefits for true deferreds. True deferreds are
members who opted out of the RMPP or left the Royal Mail before the
division that I referred to a few moments ago. The explanatory notes
say that the purpose of subsection (4) is to allow the Secretary of
State to provide active members with “better” benefits.
In fact, the power allows the Secretary of State to convert final
salary benefits to money purchase benefits, which, as we all know, are
less
secure.<a class="bkMark" name="10112542000306">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Minister, on behalf of the Secretary of State, will say that clause 19
prevents such a move, because it states that a transfer cannot be made
that would diminish accrued rights; the rights must be “at least
as good” after the transfer. However, one could argue that
converting final salary benefits to a cash equivalent means that the
value is “as good” as the defined benefits that the cash
equivalent replaces. Transfer values work by converting defined
benefits into a cash equivalent transfer value, while the cash lump sum
is transferred into another scheme. In monetary terms the value is the
same, but

                           </div>the security of a defined benefit is lost. This should not be
controversial, and if the Minister accepts the amendment, it would show
his commitment to the position that I have outlined. Alternatively,
perhaps he can give an assurance, on the record, about his intentions
and reassure us that our fears in relation to the amendment are
unfounded.<a class="bkMark" name="10112542000307">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> If I can beg the indulgence of the Committee, as we
have moved on to part 2, I have some preliminary remarks to introduce
not only the amendment, but the part before us. As the hon. Gentleman
has suggested, the part is relatively technical, which is why I decided
to try to help by writing to members of the Committee with some
background, in addition to the notes on clauses. I hope hon. Members
have received my letter of 11 November, which set out the background as
to why this part is important, as well as further
details.<a class="bkMark" name="10112542000308">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
we discussed on Second Reading, the deficit in the Royal Mail pension
plan is huge and volatile; as at 31 March 2010, the deficit
was £8.4 billion and the total liabilities of the plan amounted
to £34.4 billion. It is a pension burden that is completely out
of proportion to the size of Royal Mail as a company, and the previous
Government, who are now in opposition, agreed that something had to be
done. The proposals in part 2 enable us to make such provisions. We
will take on the responsibility for the deficit and reduce the size of
the overall plan to a more manageable level. We will do that and at the
same time protect the interests of the beneficiaries, which is a clear
principle that we share with the previous Government.<a class="bkMark" name="10112542000309">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The proposals
will safeguard the pensions benefits accrued by members; member
protection is paramount and it therefore features prominently in the
Bill. We are committed to working closely with the trustees to deliver
a seamless experience for members of the pension trust. Given the size
of the deficit in the plan, I have no doubt that the provisions in part
2 will come as a great comfort to the 437,000 members of the plan and
their dependants. I should point out, at the beginning of our
discussions on the pension plan, that our proposals will be subject to
state aid clearance, which is why some of the detail has to be provided
in secondary legislation. However, we have made our policy position
clear on all the key points, and I look forward to going through those
in more detail with the Committee.<a class="bkMark" name="10112542000310">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment 44,
introduced by the hon. Member for Ochil and South Perthshire, would
mean that the new public scheme could not contain a provision that
would convert defined benefits—pensions based on salaries and
service—into money purchase benefits, or pensions based on the
value of a member’s pot at retirement. I appreciate the
sentiment behind that. A key difference between defined benefits and
money purchase benefits is the level of risk held by the member. Money
purchase benefits depend on investment returns, whereas defined
benefits do not.<a class="bkMark" name="10112542000311">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We recognise
that it would not be right to increase the amount of risk members hold
when benefits transfer to the new scheme, and I assure hon. Members
that the Government will not convert benefits in such a way. Rather, we
are committed to ensuring that benefits are fully protected when they
transfer into the new public scheme—fully protected in terms of
not only their value, but their form—and that commitment is made
squarely in the Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="10112542000312">&#160;</a>

                        </div>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
transferring rights into the new public scheme, the protection in
clause 19(2) would apply, and the hon. Gentleman has anticipated that
response. That protection means a member’s “relevant
pensions provision” must be at least as good in all material
respects after the transfer as it was before. That obligation on the
Secretary of State would prevent the conversion of a defined benefit
into a money purchase benefit. The protection in clause 19(6)—to
ensure that rights in the new scheme are protected—would be
engaged in relation to any subsequent amendment of the new public
scheme. That means that member consent would be required for any
conversion of a defined benefit into a money purchase benefit, which
provides members with the same protection as they would have received
under the Royal Mail pension plan. I repeat that we have absolutely no
intention of proposing any such conversion, so there is absolute
clarity on that
point.<a class="bkMark" name="10112542000313">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Furthermore,
in practice, money purchase benefits could not be offered by the new
public scheme. Money purchase benefits depend on assets being invested,
with any investment returns contributing towards a member’s
pension on retirement. The new public scheme, in common with all major
Government schemes, will be a “pay as you go” scheme.
That means that it will have no access to funds, hence money purchase
benefits could not be
provided.<a class="bkMark" name="10112542000314">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
hope that my assurances about the Government’s intentions and
the solidity of the protection, including that provided by the Bill,
are sufficient for the hon. Gentleman to withdraw his amendment. This
has been a useful short debate, because it has enabled me to go on
record and reassure him, and those reading the transcript of this
debate, about our exact intentions. I hope, therefore, that
he feels able to withdraw his

deficit must be addressed. Here, we are looking at how that will affect
individual pension holders, because we do not want anything in any way

significant that the chairman of the pension plan’s trustees,

the reasons for the deficit, one of which is that we are all living
longer. She put a figure on

                        <p>Living
longer clearly has a tremendous effect on the deficit of the pension
fund, as do the other two factors that she mentioned, which are the
falling bond yields and the timing of the previous formal valuation,

                        <p class="tabbed">I
now want to focus on the situation facing the thousands of pensioners,
as well as those who have deferred their pensions, perhaps because they
have taken different employment, and the sorts of information that
might be made available to them. Although we are eating, sleeping,
breathing and thinking the Bill, many people, although they might hear
the occasional news snippet concerning Royal Mail, may not connect that
with their personal
circumstances.<a class="bkMark" name="10112542000323">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Bill proposes the removal of the bulk of the Royal Mail pension plan
deficit by transferring the liabilities and assets into a new statutory
scheme, which is to be run on a “pay as you go” basis
backed by the UK’s taxpayers. We have analysed that, so we can
see that it provides a lot of security, but members of the public are
worrying about how the change will affect them, their partners, their
families and their homes, and are asking, “What will happen?
Will I be okay? Will everything be okay with this scheme?” We do
not want to see any unnecessary worry or upset. We all know the anxiety
that change can bring. I am sure that every member of the Committee
knows about the administrative nightmare caused by switching from one
energy company to another. It can result in endless streams of bills
being sent through the door requesting further payments of the same
bill. We all have examples of people who feel that administrative
systems do not always recognise them as individuals, so they have to
phone time and again to try to put things
right.<a class="bkMark" name="10112542000324">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That
is particularly true where many people share the same name, as we do in
Wales. David Davies at No. 1 worries that he is going to be mixed up
with David Davies at No. 3, and David Davies at No. 34 worries that he
is going to be mistaken for his son, who lives at the same address.
Some may think that this is a joking matter, but I joke not. Not long
ago, a gathering of police officers thought that they had invited the
right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden (Mr Davis) to be their
guest speaker, only to be taken aback when the hon. Member for Monmouth
(David T. C. Davies) turned up. They were even more taken aback by the
comments he made, and he had to be bundled out of the back door. It is
just as well that a third hon. Member with the same name was soundly
defeated at

people’s pension rights and the income that they need to keep

are trawling the media and trying to discover the Government’s
plans for the future of the Royal Mail, but that does not mean that
everybody knows exactly what is going to happen. Although information
is sent to people, they often put bits of paper to one side and do not
realise that things have changed until something goes wrong at the last
minute and they do not get what they expect through the post. A
significant number of pensioners will be alarmed by the changes and
will worry about the security of their pension rights. As it is the
Government who are introducing the changes, it is the Government who
should take responsibility to ensure that all members of the pension
scheme are fully informed of what the changes will mean to them. That
is precisely what we are asking for in the amendment. They need a well
prepared communication

someone visit our surgeries with a piece of paper with figures and
facts that are a complete mystery, because we never know what is being
chopped off or how things are being laid out. Even a different heading
can frighten people. We know what it can be like when things are taken

                        <p class="tabbed">The
Bill is silent on the important question of how we are going ensure
that everyone will be informed. Even though there has been some press
coverage, many Royal Mail pension plan members will still be ignorant
of the effect of the changes on them personally, because obviously what
is done as one large measure nationally is not the same as what happens
to an individual. It would not surprise me at all if the Government
argue that there is no need for an explicit duty to inform members of
the pension scheme. I always think that is one of those things that
officials have to put in every rebuttal of every amendment—that
there is no need for it. It always seems to be one of the first things
that the Minister says in his responses. He will tell us that there is
no need to spell it out in the Bill because he will give us lots of
assurances. He will expect us to take everything on
trust.<a class="bkMark" name="10112542000329">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
Minister will probably also argue that everything will be fine because
the information will be provided by the trustees of the existing
pension scheme, but I want to raise one issue with him. The
trustees’ responsibility lasts until the point of the transfer,
but many pensioners will realise that their pension is changing only
after the transfer has happened. Imagine the scenario: a circular from
the trustees arrives some considerable time in advance, explaining the
transfer, but of course it gets put in a safe place, because
pensioners—rather unlike me—file everything away very
neatly and always know where to find it. They put it to one side and
forget about it, but what happens at the changeover? At present, it is 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 427<a class="bkMark" name="Column427">&#160;</a>
                           </div>unclear to whom a confused pensioner should turn after the transfer, as
the responsibility of the current trustees will end. There is no
explicit duty to ensure that pensioners will have someone to turn to if
they have questions about the management of the new scheme. Frankly,
that is
scandalous.<a class="bkMark" name="10112542000330">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">All
of us remember those first few months after coming back following the
election, when some of us got a little out of pocket because we had to
wait weeks and weeks to be reimbursed for our weekly train or plane
tickets and our office outgoings. Obviously, we are working people, we
have an income coming in and we can manage somehow, but for pensioners,
if difficulties arise and their pension payments are late, it could
cause them considerable hardship. If they have a number of direct
debits going out of their account and the money does not go in, clearly
they go overdrawn, which incurs charges, and that can lead to a lot of
distress, in particular for older people, who do not like the idea of
being in debt or of getting into trouble with their
bank.<a class="bkMark" name="10112542000331">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">For
such reasons and for all sorts of queries that the pensioners might
have about the future of the scheme, they need to know who to contact,
who is in control and who is looking after their pension
rights—not just who is dealing with the day-to-day,
month-to-month issues, but who is ensuring they get what is due to them
in the long term. If things go wrong, they do not want to be left
listening endlessly to some telephone recorded message, telling them,
“Your call is important to us”—so important that
they will be kept waiting 45
minutes.<a class="bkMark" name="10112542000332">&#160;</a>

Royal Mail scheme is currently administered from the Royal Mail

with the centre for many years. The result, of course, is that the
centre has experienced staff who are used to dealing with all sorts of

setting up new schemes and switching to different staff can all lead to
confusion, inefficiency and frustration—we need only look at the

order to minimise the disruption to pensioners it would make sense if
the Government could consider choosing to administer the payments of
the new scheme from the centre in Chesterfield. In that way, the staff
being used would be experienced and familiar with the system; they
would know the difference between David Davies No. 1 and David Davies
No. 3 and would be used to their customer base. That would make for
smooth running of the new system and would provide much needed
reassurance for pensioners. What consideration has the Minister given
to where the pension scheme might be administered from? Could it be
administered from Chesterfield?<a class="bkMark" name="10112542000336">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
issue of pensions also raises the question of the future governance of
the scheme. The current role of the trustees will end at the point of
transfer and the Government have not made it clear who will represent
the interest of pensioners under a new public sector scheme. We heard
from Jane Newell, the chairman, that there is currently a
pensioner-elected representative. Clearly we would like to have some
indication from the Minister about what will happen in terms of
pensioner representation, because that is the sort of person who can
explain precisely why information is needed. They feed back the
feelings of the pensioners and those with deferred pensions. They
convey what it feels like not to have all the information and to need
more. It is important that we know something about what representation
there will be. The scheme is a long-established one, so the number of
pensioners is likely to significantly outweigh the number of current
employees. It is therefore important that information is provided and
that there is a pensioner voice on the new body.<a class="bkMark" name="10112542000337">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">What measures
does the Minister intend to take to meet the requirements in our
amendment? How will he inform the members who are affected that they
are to be transferred to a new scheme? How will he ensure that those
members know exactly what is going to happen to their accrued rights
and understand how the payments systems will work and how the
administration of the new scheme is likely to work? Those questions are
extremely important to our pensioners. Will he also look at the
existing staffing of the Royal Mail pension plan administration to see
whether it could be used to make the transfer a lot smoother? Can he
tell us how he will give the pensioners themselves a voice on the new

I should like to speak in support of amendment 39. The Bill proposes
the removal of the bulk of the Royal Mail pension plan’s deficit
by transferring the liabilities and assets to the new statutory scheme
run on a “pay as you go” basis and backed by the UK
taxpayers. That represents a significant increase in security for Royal
Mail members but it is a change that might cause some unnecessary upset
and worry, particularly for older pensioners.<a class="bkMark" name="10112542000339">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We have
received a communiqué from the CWU which goes into those points.
It acknowledges the Government’s good intentions in the Bill but
states:<a class="bkMark" name="10112542000340">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“By
taking on the pension the government will gain the assets of the
scheme, which currently stand at £26bn. While it will become
responsible for the liabilities, this is a long-term commitment. In the
short-term it is a major gain for the
Exchequer.”<a class="bkMark" name="10112542000426">&#160;</a>

                        <p>A
pensioner such as my Dad—an 87-year-old second world war Royal
Navy veteran—who is informed that their pension scheme is
changing, is going to be perturbed. It is only natural—it is
just one of those situations in life. Those pensioners do not have a
full grasp or awareness of what is happening. We heard earlier that
despite coverage in the media of the Government’s plans for the
future of the Royal Mail and the efforts of the National Federation of
Pensioners to explain the changes, most members of the scheme will not
realise what is happening to their pension until the transfer happens.
In my father’s case, the assumption was that one paid into a
pension scheme and a team of people would look after it; one could
check it now and again 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 429<a class="bkMark" name="Column429">&#160;</a>
                           </div>until the day one needed to access it. The amendment is about a
reassuring communication process, which could provide a user’s
guide, a simplified system that would make it more digestible for
pensioners.<a class="bkMark" name="10112542000341">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Communication
is essential, as seen in point 95 of the CWU’s
communiqué:<a class="bkMark" name="10112542000342">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“Full
consultation on changes to the pension scheme must take place with the
union, not only with the pension scheme trustees. While the trustees

                        <p>Trade
unions have retired members branches, which will be needed to discuss
such matters. The amendment suggests that they would be able to hold
that dialogue and keep members informed of potential changes. Good
intentions apart, a communication process that is pre-emptive and not
reactive is necessary. In the interim, pensioners who are members of
the scheme probably need to know whom to contact now—in the
space between the scheme transfer and also in the new scheme. Advice in
a digestible, user-guide format would be useful and helpful to
pensioners.<a class="bkMark" name="10112542000343">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">For an
individual member of the scheme perturbed by what is going on, delay
can lead to unnecessary litigation, whether warranted or not, whether
followed through or not. As I have seen with other pension schemes, a
pensioner might decide to see a high street solicitor, to find out what
is going on. That causes that pensioner costs and may cause the
Government expense in trying to calm down the
individual.<a class="bkMark" name="10112542000344">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Royal Mail scheme is currently administered from the Royal Mail
pensions centre in Chesterfield, and pensioners have been used to
dealing with that centre for many years. We know from other schemes
that things can be moved around, and that the setting up of new schemes
and switching to different staff and contracts can lead to confusion
for pension-holders and members of the scheme. It can also lead to
further inefficiency and frustration. The smooth running of the scheme,
in the interests of pensioners and the scheme, also needs to be dealt
with when communicating with those
pensioners.<a class="bkMark" name="10112542000345">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
the scheme is long-established, pensioners will significantly outnumber
current employees. The employee-to-pensioner ratio can distort matters,
so it is important that current pensioners are properly represented in
the system that is designed to govern the new public sector scheme. The
question is: if those pensioners are to be represented, how are they to
be represented? The amendment looks back to the Government as an
organisation, through the National Federation of Occupational
Pensioners—a long-established body with good penetration among
Royal Mail pensioners—to play a significant role in representing
the interests of members of the new
scheme.<a class="bkMark" name="10112542000346">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Hon. Members will be pleased to know that I do not
have a soubriquet to offer for this amendment. It is relatively
straightforward and has been tabled with a sense of consensus. I hope,
therefore, that I can help to clarify some of the points in the spirit
in which they were made by hon. Members. It is quite right that we
should be probed on these critical matters. I may have said this in
previous debates, and I am sure that hon. Members have had the same
experience that I have had when talking to Royal Mail employees over
the years: 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 430<a class="bkMark" name="Column430">&#160;</a>
                           </div>the pension deficit is the thing that worries them most. As the hon.
Member for Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland said, we need to
avoid upset and worry for pensioners, and I think this package will do
that. They have been worried for many years about the deficit, and
sorting it out is very important, so I am grateful for the supportive
remarks from Opposition Members.<a class="bkMark" name="10112542000347">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment 39
would mean that before the transfer of qualifying accrued rights to the
new public scheme, the Secretary of State would have to take certain
steps to inform members of the Royal Mail pension plan about the
pension rights that are being transferred, and other matters. We
entirely agree that good, clear and comprehensive communication with
members is of the utmost importance. As the hon. Gentleman said, we
want to ensure that people, particularly those who have retired, get
clear information, in case they are upset in any way. We are,
therefore, completely committed to the notion that members should be
made fully aware of any changes made to their pension arrangements. I
intend to deal with that in some detail, because it is very important
to put on the record what arrangements we are putting in
place.<a class="bkMark" name="10112542000348">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">First, I just
want to offer some other words of reassurance in the same spirit. I
would like to make it clear that Royal Mail pension plan pensioners
currently receiving pension payments will not see any reduction in
their pension; I want to be absolutely clear that that message has got
across and any fears or worries are dispelled. Thanks to the protection
provided by clause 19, which we will, no doubt, come on to in due
course, their pension entitlements will be the same, but will be paid
from a different source—the new public
scheme.<a class="bkMark" name="10112542000349">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Secondly,
the accrued rights of members who left the service before retirement
will be the same as when they left service, and they will receive the
same amount of revaluation—that is, increases to account for
inflation—before payment. As with the pensioners, at retirement
their pension will be paid from a different source: the new public
scheme.<a class="bkMark" name="10112542000350">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Thirdly,
for active members still employed by Royal Mail, there will be no
reduction in the rights that they have already built up. For those
members, the rights accrued up to the cut-off date will become payable
from the new public scheme as though the member had left service on the
cut-off date. The remainder, including any increases attributable to
real wage growth, will be paid by the Royal Mail pension plan. In other
words, the total amount of pension payable to a member for service
built up prior to the cut-off date will be the same, but it will simply
be funded from two different sources. I think hon. Members will have
got the gist of that from the letter and from what they heard from the
chair of the trustee fund, Jane Newell, but I wanted to get that on the
record.<a class="bkMark" name="10112542000351">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We are keen
to ensure that members of the pension fund are kept up to date before,
during and after the transition of benefits to the new public scheme.
We are also keen to ensure that members receive appropriate assurance
that their pensions are safe, and continue to receive correct and
timely payments as and when they fall due. We share those aims with not
only the hon. Members for Llanelli and for Ochil and South Perthshire,
but—as importantly, or even more importantly––the
trustees of the scheme.<a class="bkMark" name="10112542000352">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We are working
closely with the trustees to ensure that members receive the right
information at the right time, tailored to their particular
circumstances. The trustees already provide regular information on our
proposals to members. Indeed, only this week a pension newsletter was
issued, which provided an update on the proposals in the Bill. I have a
printed-off copy of that newsletter, “Pension News”,
provided by the Royal Mail pension plan, and I am happy to show that to
hon. Members. That is going out to all the beneficiaries. On page 3,
there is an update on the Postal Services Bill, with credits to the
Government, but we did not decide on its contents or on how it should
be laid out; that is a matter for the trustees. The newsletter is going
out now, to bring the beneficiaries up to date, or almost up to date,
so that it is as though they were reading <em>Hansard</em> or following
our proceedings on the internet, as I am sure some people are. We are
working closely with the trustees and we are delighted that they have
taken that approach with the pension
newsletter.<a class="bkMark" name="10112542000353">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In
the evidence sessions, we heard from the chairman of the trustees, Jane
Newell, who emphasised the importance of the partnership, saying that
the trustees were working with the Government to provide “a
seamless member experience.” She said:<a class="bkMark" name="10112542000354">&#160;</a>

                        </p>
                        <p>The
amendment would risk creating such confusion, which is one of the
reasons why we do not want it. As an occupational pension scheme, the
Royal Mail pension plan is already under statutory obligation to
provide certain information to members. For example, it must provide
information to deferred members on their accrued rights when they leave
service. The amendment would result in some members receiving that
information twice, from two different bodies simultaneously. That would
be inefficient at best, and potentially unsettling for members. Once
the new scheme is up and running we intend, at the very least, to
ensure that members continue to receive the information that the Royal
Mail pension plan currently provides, and we will give due regard to
specifying relevant reporting requirements in secondary
legislation.<a class="bkMark" name="10112542000355">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In short, we
are fully committed to ensuring that members receive all the
information that is specified in the amendment, but we need to work
together with the trustees and the members’ representatives to
understand the best way to provide that information. A number of
pertinent questions have been asked about how we intend to do that. For
example, the hon. Member for Llanelli has asked about the role that we
expect the Royal Mail pension plan administrators who are currently
based in Chesterfield to play. Because we want to continue the high
standard of service and support to which members of the pension plan
are accustomed, we want to work with the trustees on ensuring that
administration is in place. No final decision has been made on how the
new governance scheme will be administered, but it is likely that the
Government will look—at least initially—to contract the
administration of the new scheme to the existing Royal Mail pension
plan administrators in Chesterfield. We are speaking with the trustees
about that. I hope that reassures the hon. Lady.<a class="bkMark" name="10112542000356">&#160;</a>

                        </div>
                        <p class="tabbed">A number of
questions have been raised about how the voice of the pensioners and
the potential beneficiaries will be heard, and I will deal with them in
some detail. We should bear in mind that of the 11 members of the
trustee board, five are member-nominated, and three of those five are
nominated by the CWU, so the current trustee board has strong
representation in the discussions. As I have said, Government and
officials have been meeting the CWU to discuss part 2 of the Bill, and
we have tried to answer all their questions as they have arisen. That
is the current state of play, and members have a lot of involvement in
governance, but of course in the new public scheme there is a different
set of arrangements, so the question of how we would try to continue
that involvement under the new approach was pertinent.<a class="bkMark" name="10112542000357">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We understand
the importance of pension scheme members having input into running
their scheme; that is absolutely common ground between us. We will
therefore consider establishing a governance group with member
representation for the new public sector pension scheme for current
beneficiaries. When considering this, we will take account of the views
of stakeholders and practices in other large public sector pension
schemes. For example, the NHS pension scheme and the principal civil
service pension scheme have governance groups that meet regularly and
include employer and member representatives. The remit of those groups
includes such matters as monitoring service delivery and member
communication. They would be the sorts of models that we would be
looking to. Part of the role of this governance group will be ensuring
seamless service within the Royal Mail pension plan. It is absolutely
critical that the public sector pension scheme works with the Royal
Mail pension plan, in terms of administration, governance and
communication. We are absolutely committed to
that.<a class="bkMark" name="10112542000358">&#160;</a>

down, what will happen at the point of transfer? Will that information

that excellent work? They have obviously started with that leaflet.

that transfer, so there is not a sudden hiatus and lack of

                           </strong> There will be no hiatus or lack of information. I
am slightly worried that there may be almost too much information. One
has to ensure that it is digestible and available. The hon. Lady is
saying that the transition period can be complex, and we are extremely
aware of that. We want to ensure that the trustees and the
board—which has member representation and union-nominated
members on it—work in tandem with the governance body that we
propose to set up for the new public sector scheme. We want to ensure
that how members are communicated with is seamless, too. We do not want
a plethora of organisations inundating a member with many different
bits of communication. We want to ensure that there is a single funnel
to the member—a single relationship. The Royal Mail pension plan
trustees have been the guardians of that over the years. As I showed
with the newsletter, they have played a professional and strong role in
that regard. Members, the Government and the company have huge trust in
the way that the trustees have gone about their work. Indeed, they have

just want to pick up on the Minister’s intentions, which he has
displayed over the previous two amendments. I want clarification that
he will continue to take representations on the important issues in the
clause and to ensure that such representations are fully evaluated. If
any are taken during the Committee stage, could he share those that are
relevant to the clause, and any solutions, with the Committee? If any
could be solved with secondary legislation, could he also share that
with us when it is

making an order under this section the Secretary of State must obtain
the consent of the trustees of the
RMPP.’.<p class="tabbed">When
the Minister spoke about amendment 39, I was interested—and
glad—to hear him say that he is working in co-ordination with
the trustees and intends to continue to do so. Amendment 43 gives him
an opportunity to put those words into action. Clause 17 allows the
Secretary of State to split the RMPP into different sections. The
sectionalisation of the pension, like the railway pension scheme, has
nothing to do with the deficit; it is an inevitable consequence of
splitting Royal Mail into different businesses. Different owners will
have their own section of the RMPP. Different sections will not be able
to cross-subsidise each other, and in due course one section might be
amended differently from another section, so they would offer different
benefits. Sectionalising the scheme means that the assets have to be
split between the sections to reflect the age profiles of the different

<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 435<a class="bkMark" name="Column435">&#160;</a>
                           </div>sections. In broader terms, younger sections should have a greater
proportion of equities and older sections should have a greater
proportion of fixed-interest securities, gilts and
bonds.<a class="bkMark" name="10112542000378">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Minister, on behalf of the Secretary of State, will say that he is
obliged under clause 24(1) to consult the trustee and the employers
about the split, but the drive of the amendment is that consultation is
not enough. We must use another C-word: “consent.” After
all, it is the trustee’s not the Secretary of State’s
property. The trustee, not the Secretary of State, has to manage the
scheme after the sectionalisation. Surely, the trustee, and its
actuary, ought to be responsible for the division, and if not, it must
be at least asked for its consent to the division. The trustee owns all
the assets at the moment, so if the Secretary of State proposes
interfering with the trustee’s property rights through the Bill,
he must obtain the trustee’s consent.<a class="bkMark" name="10112542000379">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Different
assets of the same asset class may have different characteristics.
Shares in, say, BP may be more volatile at certain times than shares in
the Royal Bank of Scotland—or perhaps not. Different shares have
different volatilities. The division ought to be equal to or match the
age profiles, and the trustee not the Secretary of State ought to be
the judge of that. Why would the Minister want to create a mechanism in
which someone other than the trustee could make or approve such a
decision? If he can, will he tell the Committee why the Secretary of
State should be that person?<a class="bkMark" name="10112542000380">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">There will be
a range of technical amendments and technical discussions coming
forward, which will be quite short. The fact that a discussion does not
last a long time does not make it any less important. We are talking
about a single word in the Bill; instead of consultation, there should
be consent. The person best charged to make a decision on the split to
the benefit of the beneficiaries is the trustee, with the support of
the actuary. Therefore, I hope that the Minister will see the light,
give me a happy weekend, and accept an amendment that is there to
improve people’s lot and the scheme’s transparency. Many
people within the scheme and many people who the split will affect
would embrace him if he did accept it. I ask him to change
“consultation” to “consent”. I await the
Minister’s response.<a class="bkMark" name="10112542000381">&#160;</a>

more seriously, and I am afraid I am not able to support his amendment.
It is right for trustees to be consulted, and there is provision in the
Bill for that. However, amendment 43 would go further and require
trustees’ consent to be given before an order can be made to
divide the RMPP into sections using the powers of clause
17.<a class="bkMark" name="10112542000382">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
would like to make some initial remarks and then explain why our
consultation provisions are the best approach, rather than the
provisions that the hon. Gentleman is seeking to add in. It is quite
important that the Committee understands our intention on the
sectionalisation of the Royal Mail pension plan. It is almost implied
in the hon. Gentleman’s amendment that there is something afoot
here, but there is not; we think that is a sensible way forward, and is
in the interests of members and employees.<a class="bkMark" name="10112542000383">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">When we
considered provisions in part 1 of the Bill, I detailed how Post Office
Ltd will be separated from Royal Mail so that it is not part of a sale.
The separation will need to be reflected in the continuing pension
arrangements provided by the companies. I think that is almost
self-evident; in separating the companies we will need to make some
sort of separation in the pension arrangements. Clause 17 will allow
the Government to create a separate section in the Royal Mail pension
plan for Post Office Ltd. The Post Office will then become the
sponsoring employer for its own section. We intend to make the two
sections—the Post Office section and the Royal Mail
section—completely separate. Post Office Ltd will have no
exposure to the Royal Mail section and vice versa. However, the
existing trustees will remain responsible for both Post Office and
Royal Mail sections of the Royal Mail pension
plan.<a class="bkMark" name="10112542000384">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Subject
to state aid approval, we intend Post Office members to be treated on
an equivalent basis to Royal Mail members. That means that the
historical benefits that Post Office members have, like Royal Mail
members, will be transferred to the new public scheme. The member
protection that applies under clause 19 will apply equally to Post
Office members as to Royal Mail members. That protection will also
apply to any order made under clause 17. In other words, any order to
divide the Royal Mail pension plan into sections must be done in such a
way that it does not leave members materially worse off after the order
is made than they were
before.<a class="bkMark" name="10112542000385">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
developing the detail of all the proposals, the Government will work
hand in glove with trustees. Indeed, we have included a commitment in
the Bill—in clause 24, which we will come to shortly—to
consult trustees, which means that we will consult them on the
sectionalisation of the Royal Mail pension plan. However, while we
consider it to be imperative to consult trustees on such elements of
the pension solution, it would not be appropriate to require individual
trustees of the Royal Mail pension plan to make a decision in relation
to an order proposed by the Secretary of State.<a class="bkMark" name="10112542000386">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That goes to
the heart of the hon. Gentleman’s amendment. I think it is right
that Government take responsibility for the detail of any order laid
under part 2, and do not seek to put that responsibility on
anyone else. This is the Government’s Bill, and the Government
have to take responsibility for it. I believe that there is precedent
for a consulting approach where the Government take responsibility. The
Transport Act 2000, which provided for the public-private partnership
of air traffic control, was part of the changes. The Civil Aviation
Authority scheme was sectionalised, and the powers of the Bill mirror
those in the 2000 Act, which provided for consultation with trustees of
the CAA scheme before it went
ahead.<a class="bkMark" name="10112542000387">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Indeed,
we have tried to improve part 2 of the Bill, compared with the Postal
Services Bill 2009, in a number of regards. In clause 16(3), which we
have discussed, there is a new provision that differs from the 2009
Bill. We are providing additional comfort to the Royal Mail pension
plan trustees, by clarifying that orders under clause 16 can provide
for relevant liabilities of that plan to be discharged. In other words,
the trustees wanted to ensure that, once the changes were made, all
their duties would have been fully discharged. We agreed with and
understood that reasonable request, which was why we added the
provision that was not in the 2009 Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="10112542000388">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Therefore,
there is a danger that if we make amendments such as amendment 43, we
will go in the direction of putting responsibilities and duties back on
to the trustees, which I would be surprised to see them welcome. It is
important for Government to take and not to shirk such
responsibilities. We will consult, but we think that we have to take
responsibility for the decision and not create any legal liabilities
for anyone else. For that reason, I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw
his
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="10112542000389">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I have listened closely to the Minister. It strikes
me that there is some engagement with the trustees, but maybe not too
much. He has not convinced me that there is anything in the amendment
that would not be in the interests of the beneficiaries of the pension
scheme. He recognises that consultation with the trustees is important,
and also that there might be a potential area of difficulty, otherwise
he would not be consulting
them.<a class="bkMark" name="10112542000390">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
Minister says that the decision taken should not result in any action
that might make the fund worse off. Under the amendment, the judge of
that decision would be the trustees, not the Secretary of State. Of
course, conferring the ability to seek the consent of the trustees
might, dare I say, have the same level of impact as consultation. We
are not saying that the trustees must oppose anything that the
Government do, when proposals are put forward. However, rather than the
trustees only being consulted, they should be able to give their
consent as well as to play a consultation role. If everything goes
well, I have no doubt that there will be little difference between the
consultation role and the consent role. As the consultation role can
cause friction, we think that, as a safety net, the trustees should be
given the ability to consent.<a class="bkMark" name="10112542000391">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Perhaps the
Bill can be improved even more than by the amendment, because both
consultation and consent could be included. The Minister has not said
anything that makes me think that the amendment would be detrimental.
In fact, the force of the argument is that the role of consent should
be added. As there are many ways that that could be done, I wish to
