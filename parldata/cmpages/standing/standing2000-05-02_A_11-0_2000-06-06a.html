<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Ms Beverley Hughes):</B> I beg to move amendment No. 173, in page 22, line 20, at end insert
<P>

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to consider Government amendment No. 174.
<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> The amendment makes a minor change. It ensures that councils that operate alternative arrangements—if they are made available by the Secretary of State following a referendum defeat—will have a constitution that is publicly available. The clause currently requires only councils that operate executive arrangements to have such a constitution. The amendment simply extends that provision to councils with alternative arrangements. Amendment No. 174 is consequential on amendment No. 173, as it removes a later mention in the clause of the provision of information in relation to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>functions which are the responsibility of the executive.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I believe that the clause and amendments are uncontentious. If councils are to be truly transparent and accountable, anybody who has dealings with a local authority should be able to find out easily who is responsible for what within that authority, whatever the arrangement under which its constitution operates. That is why we want to require every council to have a written constitution.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Amendment made: No. 174, in page 22, leave out line 24.—[Ms Beverley Hughes.]
<P>
<B>Mr. Adrian Sanders </B>(Torbay): I beg to move amendment No. 289, in page 22, line 26, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) a copy of the authority's arrangements for members of the public to petition the authority executive, and to attend meetings of the executive to ask questions'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This is a straightforward amendment that tries to place on all local authorities a duty to carry out what is already best practice in most local authorities. It would ensure that all local authorities include in their constitutions and standing orders arrangements for local residents to present petitions to the executive and to put questions to it. If the reforms are to work and accountability is to be genuine—Ministers have repeatedly assured us that it will be—it is important for people to know to whom they should direct their complaints and comments. Enabling residents directly to petition or question members of an executive at a meeting will clarify and improve that accountability and the electorate's knowledge of who makes up the executive and who the people are. It is difficult for members of the public to force issues on to a local authority's agenda without the assistance of a local council. Not all councillors will be able to put items on to the agenda of an executive, as not all of them will be members of it. It would be satisfactory if residents were to have the right to present a petition or to ask questions directly of the executive anywhere in the country. Current arrangements for petitioning or public meetings are a matter of local choice and perhaps the Minister wants them to remain so. Perhaps they would be set out in the standing orders of a local authority. If clause 21 on access to information is not amended, of course, the executive could meet in public or in private. The Bill imposes no obligation on the executive to meet at all. All executive powers could be given to individuals. We believe that the Government's view of good practice should be clear from the Bill; it should be open to all local authorities to allow residents to petition the executive or ask it questions at a properly constituted meeting.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nigel Waterson </B>(Eastbourne): Good morning, Mr. O'Brien. I have nothing to say about the Government amendments. The Minister dealt with them well. I do not propose to set a precedent, but I shall swallow my natural inclinations and say that the Liberal Democrats' amendment is sensible. I suppose by the law of averages they would have to stumble across one sensible amendment at some point in the consideration of the Bill in Committee. As the draft guidance does not seem to include anything about the relevant issues, it might be helpful to tease out from the Minister what the Government have in mind.
<P>
<B>Ms Beverley Hughes:</B> On the face of it I have some sympathy with the purpose of the amendment—although I am not sure that there is not something mischievous behind it, which I shall mention in a moment. It is clearly right for people to know how they can influence decision-makers, whether it be by petitions, by asking questions at meetings or by other means. I fully support the spirit of that approach. However, amending the clause to include those mechanisms in the constitution would be to make provision in the wrong place.
<P>
The purpose of the amendment would be fully covered by the provision that we have made for publication of the forward plan and the key decisions to be made by the council in the ensuing three or four months. Moreover, the standing order requiring the forward plan will be included in the constitution under clause 34(1)(b). The constitution will direct people to the forward plan. That will contain information about important forthcoming decisions and the mechanisms by which people can take part in discussing them, including the council's proposals for consultation. That is the right way for detailed information to be conveyed to local people about what is in prospect and how they can be involved in it. We would also encourage overview and scrutiny committees, when questioning members of the executive, to provide an opportunity for members of the public to do so too. That is not proscribed; we would encourage it.
<P>
I wonder whether there is a little mischief behind the amendment because of the oblique reference to requiring an executive to allow members of the public to attend its meetings and ask questions. As hon. Members know, we have already had an extensive debate, on clause 21, about whether those meetings should be in public. I do not intend to rehearse those issues, but if the amendment is a Trojan horse of sorts to prise open that issue again, Opposition Members will anticipate our response. I am sure that you, Mr. O'Brien would not want that debate again.
<P>
We want to get away from unaccountable informal meetings. The constitution should not be used to force the executive to allow members of the public to attend its meetings. As we have discussed, there may not be meetings of the executive. The Liberal Democrats need to get away from thinking of the executive as a committee and think of it instead as a group of accountable individuals. People will know who is responsible for what. The opportunity and mechanisms for lobbying and talking to that person will be more transparent and open. I share the aim of the hon. Member for Torbay (Mr. Sanders) to ensure that there is proper public accountability in the system.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster </B>(Bath): My hon. Friend the Member for Torbay will take up some of those points, but I want the Minister to reflect on her statement that there may not be meetings of the executive. Does she believe that the arrangements of some councils will mean that the executive will never hold a meeting?
<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> No, I do not envisage that. It is clear that executive meetings will take place. My point was that some decisions—perhaps small decisions—will not necessarily require a meeting of the executive. Clearly, the generality and conduct of business will require meetings.
<P>
Although I accept the spirit of what the hon. Member for Torbay wants to achieve, the constitution and the forward plan provide the public with plenty of information on what is coming up and the mechanisms by which they can discuss those items with members of the executive or in scrutiny committees. The amendment is unnecessary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Sanders:</B> I assure the Minister that the amendment is not a Trojan horse. We are not that machiavellian. I do not share her confidence that people will know who does what on an executive or that the consultation mechanisms will allow people to know what items are coming up. For example, the minimum statutory duty for publicising a planning application is to place an advertisement in a local newspaper. Many councils fulfil only that bear legal minimum.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford </B>(Mole Valley): Does the hon. Gentleman agree from his experience of local government that residents often petition on small, technical matters that have nothing to do with an agenda? It is pie in the sky to think that such people will understand that their little issue will not be considered because it is not in the forward plan and that there is no one for them to petition directly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Sanders:</B> There is truth in that. Some local authorities have a model practice of doing far more than just placing an advertisement to publicise planning applications. That is a matter of local choice. The danger is that the legal minimum is not enough to reach the maximum number of members of the public.
<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> The hon. Gentleman is not convinced that local people will be clear about who is taking what decision. He wants the constitution to contain more than the Bill prescribes, so he must consider it to be an important document. As the constitution will state which member of the executive is responsible for what, does he accept that if local people can find their way to the constitution, they can find their way to the right person?
<P>
<B>Mr. Sanders:</B> If people do not even know who their Member of Parliament is—[HON. MEMBERS: ``No!''] Studies have shown—although not, I believe, those conducted in my constituency—that most people do not know the name of their Member of Parliament, let alone the name of their local councillor or what his duties are, if he is a member of the executive, so I do not share the Under-Secretary's confidence and do not foresee that hundreds of local residents will rush out to consult the council's constitution to find out who its members are.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Ms Hughes:</B> In that case, I question the point of the amendment, because if the hon. Gentleman thinks that people will not find their way to the constitution l cannot see the logic in extending the constitution to tell people how to petition.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Sanders:</B> The logic is that local people can raise points that are of interest to them and not necessarily of interest to the council. Public question times have led to greater involvement among council tax payers and residents in the affairs of the local council and increased the numbers of members of the public in the public galleries.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Loughton </B>(East Worthing and Shoreham): I am slightly astonished at that, given the hon. Gentleman's experience in his constituency. If people are so ignorant of what councils and councillors do, why does he think that there was such a high turnout in the Torbay district council elections this year, in which all but four of his Liberal colleagues lost their seats? Surely it was the greater awareness of what councillors do that resulted in that enormous swing against his colleagues, who have been turfed out on their ears.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I hope that we will not follow that track.
<P>
<B>Mr. Sanders:</B> No, I shall not follow that track, but if the hon. Gentleman thinks that 20 per cent. of the electorate constitutes a high turnout, there are real problems for democracy.
<P>
The Under-Secretary's remarks regarding the questioning of executive members by the scrutiny committee were helpful. Some of her other remarks gave the impression that although she does not want it to be written into the Bill, she would rather like councils to have the greatest possible access to the electorate, which might include public question times and the right to petition. In the light of those helpful remarks, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Ms Beverley Hughes:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 175, in page 22, line 32, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) A local authority must supply a copy of their constitution to any person who requests a copy and who pays to the authority such reasonable fee as the authority may determine.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment provides that, in addition to making a copy of the constitution available for reference, the council must also supply copies of its constitution to anyone who wants one on payment of a reasonable fee. I emphasise that that is in addition to making the constitution available for inspection, so that people may take away a copy if they pay a reasonable charge to cover the cost of production. As I said in relation to the previous group of amendments, if councils are to be truly transparent and accountable, anyone who has dealings with the local authority should be able to scrutinise the constitution if they so wish.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> Amendments Nos.177,178 and 179 are technical amendments to alter the manner by which the general body of local government law as it relates to elected members is applied to the question of directly elected mayors. I must emphasise both to my hon. Friends and to Opposition Members that they represent no change in Government policy or intention. The Government see the mayor as having the same status as a councillor elected by the people, wherever meaningful or relevant. There must be exceptions—provided for in the amendments—to cover, for example, the provisions for election and term of office where specific provision for elected mayors is being made in the Bill.
<P>
On reflection, it appears to me and my colleagues that the drafting of subsection (3) will not work as we had initially hoped. As I have mentioned, our intention is for a directly elected mayor to be treated as a councillor for the purposes of local government legislation relating to councillors. However, because of the need to make exceptions to the principle and because of the lack of clarity concerning what would be classified as enactments relating to local government, the Bill's current approach will not work and cannot be said to be appropriate with acceptable certainty. We have concluded that the only way to proceed is to reverse the approach by providing that regulations will specify the legislative provisions that will apply to directly elected mayors. In that way, we can be precise about what does and does not apply to mayors. That is not a change of policy or intention but simply a drafting amendment to improve the intention.
<P>
Following on from our intention for an elected mayor to be treated like any other councillor, such mayors will have full membership of the council. It further follows that we cannot accept amendment No. 254, tabled by the hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Waterson). I am happy to listen to his comments on that and other amendments in due course. However, given what I have said about an elected mayor also being a councillor, it is inconceivable that the mayor should not be a full voting member of the authority that he has been elected to lead. That point is especially pertinent given the enhanced role that the full council will have. If the hon. Gentleman chose to press the amendment, I would be interested to hear what the difference was between a directly elected mayor and a current leader of a council. If he suggests that a current leader of a council cannot vote in the full council and cannot participate as an elected councillor, what are the Opposition proposing? Would their suggestions extend to the members of a cabinet—would they be denied the vote, too?
<P>
<B>Mr. David Curry </B>(Skipton and Ripon): The Minister is intelligent and must therefore know the difference between a mayor elected on a mandate of a whole local authority and a councillor elected for a ward. Two different mandates are in question. There are no analogies between the two positions. If there were, why would we have the Bill at all?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> As I have said to the hon. Gentleman and to the Committee, the Government intend the mayor to be considered a councillor of the authority despite the directly elected mandate. Such a mayor would still be considered by the Government to be a member of the authority. There are numerous examples abroad—in France, New Zealand, and the United States—of mayors participating fully in the affairs of a council.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> Following on from the point made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon (Mr. Curry), would the Minister explain the relationship between his attitude to amendment No. 254 and his attitude to Government new clause 14, which we will reach shortly? They seem to suggest opposite things. The new clause will not allow a person to be a directly elected mayor and a councillor at the same time.
<P>
<B>The Minister of State for Local Government and the Regions (Ms Hilary Armstrong):</B> There are two different mandates.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> There are two different mandates. In terms of membership of an authority, the Government intend directly elected mayors to be treated in the same way as a councillor; they will have a vote at the council. With regard to other amendments of the hon. Member for Eastbourne, the mayors will be concerned with the same ethical framework as other councillors.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> The Minister should not draw false analogies with France. In that country, where elected representatives form 1.5 per cent. of the population, the mayor is at the head of a list of candidates elected for the whole municipality on proportional representation. There is no distinction between a mayor elected for the whole area and councillors elected to individual wards, so once again, the analogy does not hold water.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> Let me return to the amendment, which denies the mayor a vote at the council. Will the hon. Member for Eastbourne clarify that intention, which the amendment would clearly achieve?
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> I should like to echo the comments about France made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon. Circumstances similar to those in France apply in New Zealand, a country different from this one. Mayors there are elected on a proper mandate, but there is not the same scrutiny system that applies here. The analogy is false.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> I give some credence to the hon. Gentleman's views on New Zealand, as I know that he has a close interest in that country. I do not want to discuss in detail local government in New Zealand, as I am sure that the hon. Gentleman has special knowledge of that subject. The point that we are making is that a person could be elected as councillor for a ward and could then sit on the executive as a mayor and have an overview and scrutiny committee for that position. A councillor should be a full member of the council and the mayor should participate as such. The amendments deal not least with the ethical role of the mayor. Amendment No. 254 would ensure that the mayor would not have a vote in full council. I ask the hon. Member for Eastbourne not to press his amendment, but I ask him to answer my queries about his opinion on whether a mayor should participate fully in the activities of the council.

<P>

<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I am sorry that my innocent little probing amendment has caused the Welsh Minister such discomfiture. It is funny how such amendments sometimes produce an almighty problem. Amendment No. 254 was designed to tease out whether the Government had thought through the aspect of the legislation with which it deals. Lo and behold, the answer that seems to have emerged is no. Two different Ministers seem to be saying slightly different things—one sotto voce, the other not.
<P>
We are not trying to take a vote away from a directly elected mayor. If the Government's legislation on these matters means anything, it is that that mayor has a separate mandate. I believe that those magic words fell from the lips of the Minister for Local Government and the Regions when she made a sedentary intervention on her hon. Friend the Welsh Minister. Such a role must surely mean separation. When push comes to shove, the mayor is not a member of the council, either philosophically or in any other sense. The mayor is the mayor because he or she has been directly elected. If one needs help or guidance on that matter, one has only to turn to new clause 14, which was tabled by the Government, and of whose existence the Welsh Minister seemed blissfully unaware. That new clause makes it clear that, if somebody runs both for the council and as mayor, perhaps to hedge his other bets, he or she must give up one of the jobs if he or she is elected to both. A vacancy will therefore arise.
<P>
That points the way clearly to what is behind the Government's approach and what must be a part of their philosophy: the belief that there is a separate mandate and that the mayor is separate from the council. The mayor and the council may fall out. As I said, that is a far-fetched scenario, although it may happen in London. Who knows? We shall have to wait and see. However, I have cited precisely why there is no earthly point in giving the mayor a right to vote in council deliberations. That is the point of the amendment No. 254, although I never had the remotest intention of pressing it to a vote. It has, however, been fascinating to see what it has brought forth from the Minister.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> It is clear that if a mayor is to participate in the role of the authority, he should have a vote on that authority. The mayor is treated as a councillor with regard to the regulation of councillors' roles and responsibilities and disqualification, so he must able to participate fully in the affairs of the council that he has been elected to lead. That is self-evident and straightforward.
<P>
I should tell the hon. Member for Eastbourne that it is the Government's intention that all the relevant provisions of local government and electoral law that deal with qualification, disqualification, vacancies and other matters should apply to elected mayors. The Government believe that the mayor should be able to participate fully in the affairs of the council that he has been elected to lead.

<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> This group of amendments deals with what I like to call the Mayor Barry issue. As hon. Members may recall, Mayor Barry was a less than distinguished mayor of Washington DC, who was eventually convicted for being a drug dealer as well as a drug abuser. He presided over an administration of monumental incompetence and corruption, but was actually quite popular with the voters. In other words, he was a Minister's ultimate nightmare. Therefore, it is all the more odd that, despite the fact that this is virtually a re-run of debates that took place on the Greater London Authority Act 1999, the Government are still studiously avoiding tackling the question of what will happen if a mayor becomes incapable of performing his duties, loses the confidence of the council and voters, goes mad or is corrupt and incompetent.
<P>
The debates in the House on the Greater London Authority Bill were instructive because the Government resisted the arguments from all other parties that there should be some mechanism to deal with that problem. It was agreed by all concerned that it is not the sort of issue that should be tackled after it has arisen. Before anyone is elected, and certainly before anyone goes off the rails, clear provisions should be enshrined in law to deal with the situation.
<P>
The debates on the GLA Bill referred grandly to impeachment because they took place at around the same time as attempts to impeach the President of the United States for activities, with which I shall not bore the Committee. The resistance from Labour Members to including any such measures in that Bill seem to have been based on concerns about a coup taking place and people ganging up on a directly elected mayor to get rid of him or her shortly after an election or some political disagreement. Of course, we can see the force of that argument, and that actually happened on one famous occasion in the Greater London Council when the now directly elected mayor of London took over shortly after a general election. The problem needs to be addressed. We are giving the Government some latitude on how they deal with it.
<P>
Various options were kicked around when we discussed the GLA Bill, including an 80 per cent. threshold in a vote of no confidence or petitioning. The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey (Mr. Hughes) gave the example of the small town of Waterville in Maine in the United States of America. If we are thinking of having directly elected mayors, it makes sense to examine examples in other countries, such as New Zealand or Spain. The Joint Committee's minutes contain a great deal on Barcelona, but I know nothing about that.
<P>
The USA strikes me as a good place from which to draw the wisdom of experience. Washington DC is not the only example. In our debate on the GLA Bill, the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey told us that the small town of Waterville in Maine was famous for little except for producing Ed Muskie and former Senator George Mitchell. However, he went on to say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>According to the Boston Globe, it is also a town where
<P>
``local politicians occasionally behave less than statesmanlike. Since 1980, Waterville has seen three of its mayors convicted of drunken driving, disorderly conduct, and felony embezzlement''.—[Official Report, Standing Committee A, 2 February 1999; c. 138.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Waterville in Maine may be an unfortunate case. There may be something—[HON. MEMBERS: ``In the water.''] The Committee is well ahead of me—we have a good audience this morning, Mr. O'Brien. Waterville may have had an unfortunate series of mayors who were not up to the job, but it is a town that uses impeachment.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> I am starting to enjoy my hon. Friend's long list. Perhaps he could add the Gough Whitlam situation in Australia.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I hope that we are not going to go as far as Australia. Hon. Members should stick to the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I might roam as far as Doncaster and the Donnygate scandal.
<P>
There is a serious point. It is not unheard of for a mayor who has been directly elected on a separate mandate that uses a different system to our own to fall foul of the law and to be dishonest, corrupt, incompetent or simply lose the plot. There must be a way of getting rid of such people without running the risk of carrying out a political hatchet job if they are popular with the voters but unpopular with other elected politicians. There needs to be a method for house cleaning when there is major problem.
<P>
Politically motivated attempts to rid a city or town of a mayor should be taken seriously. Labour Members who spoke on the GLA Bill were obsessed with the concept of a coup, which might be more attractive in light of the London election on 4 May. Someone—possibly Shakespeare—wrote:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Treason doth never prosper: what's the reason? Why, if it prosper, none dare call it treason.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There is a lot of truth in that. If there are genuine reasons to rid a town or city of a mayor, the Bill's mechanisms should provide for that. Even our national system has the possibility of a vote of no confidence in a Prime Minister and a sitting Government. The convention is that, if the Government lose that vote, the Prime Minister must tender his resignation to the monarch. However, against the background of the recent bitter experience in London, we are trying to put someone in place who cannot be removed by any force on this earth—a bit like his Holiness the Pope. [Interruption.] The Minister for Local Government and the Regions makes my point for me, as she so often obligingly does, by saying that the mayor cannot be removed other than by the electorate. I agree that the electorate are more important than us, but four years is a long time to have a mayor in charge who is abusing drugs, corrupt and incompetent or following his own bizarre agenda, which we might see in London.
<P>
A mayor might simply lose touch with reality and lose the plot, barricading himself in the office and doing things that are wholly damaging to the town or city. Will the Minister tell the Committee, as she told hon. Members with regard to the GLA Bill, that the Government do not want to have any mechanism in place for the removal of the mayor? What if a mayor suffers from mental illness and is incapable of undertaking his functions? Let us consider an example stripped wholly of political dimensions. A mayor might have a nervous breakdown and be unable to do the job, funding it far too difficult. Did the Minister really say from a sedentary position and later while standing that there should be no way of dealing with such a problem? Did she not say anything? The question of a mechanism is extremely important. We propose a power of recall.
<P>
The Government seem to be unwilling to take note of another important issue, which the Joint Committee raised in its report. In paragraph 73 of its report, the Joint Committee said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the present provisions appear to be unique by international comparisons. Most arrangements for elected mayors include some method for removal, either by vote of the legislature (``impeachment'') or through voter petition.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Committee concludes in paragraph 74:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We invite the Government to consider whether a recall provision should be included in the bill before it is introduced.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We can assume only that the Government considered that proposal and dismissed it out of hand.
<P>
An issue was raised earlier in that report regarding vacancies arising in other ways. What would happen if an elected mayor died, was disqualified from office or simply resigned? The Joint Committee said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We recommend that the Government address in the bill the lack of electoral mandate of the deputy in the event that the elected mayor dies, is disqualified or resigns.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The issues are important and Opposition Members are genuinely puzzled that they have not been addressed, not simply because the Government have had all the time in the world to consider the views of the Joint Committee regarding the draft Bill but because the issues were canvassed so comprehensively during the passage of another Bill only last year. It seems to us that the arguments for such provisions are absolutely compelling. On any view, elected mayors are a major constitutional innovation in this country. They will mean the concentration of power in the hands of an individual at a local level, the like of which we have not seen before. Such a person will have the power to hire and fire members of the executive, including, as we have previously debated, the deputy mayor, and to make myriad other appointments.
<P>
People with charisma will be precisely those attracted to stand as directly elected mayors. How often does charisma turn to erratic behaviour in office? We will see what happens in London. If the Government want to put Mussolini-like figures in charge of town halls across the land with a mandate to make the trains run on time, they had better be prepared to deal with the slight problems that might come in the baggage of such an approach to local democracy.
<P>
The Minister will no doubt say, harking back to the debates on the Greater London Authority Bill, that the ability to eject the mayor mid-term would breach the democratic mandate given to the mayor by the people. But that is a wholly circular logic. The power of the elected people in any given town or city would still come from the people and, as I said, four years is a long time.

<P>

<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman accept that if a mayor were recalled for the reasons that he gave, there would be a vacancy and an election? If the deposed person sought re-election, there would be an opportunity for a popular mandate. The public at large would have total control of those circumstances.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a compelling point. There is no democratic deficit in dealing with the problem. To use the national analogy, if a Government lost a vote of no confidence in the House, the Prime Minister would go to the monarch and there would almost certainly be a general election. The Government would either receive a renewed mandate or lose, end of story—that is democracy. But is it right that once a charismatic leader figure has been elected for four years, the electorate should be stuck with him, no matter how bonkers or incompetent he turns out to be? We should not forget that people will be applying for a brand new job that has not existed before in this country. Who knows what kind of people will apply and whether their qualifications will carry them through as elected mayor if they win?
<P>
Evidence to the Joint Committee rightly reflected concerns on the issue. The Government cannot bury their head in the sand. I challenge them to come up with another part of the world that has directly elected mayors without having a mechanism to tackle the problem that I have described. There is no mechanism in the Bill to remove from office, before the end of his term, a mayor who is demonstrably shown to be acting against the best interests of a city or town unless he has committed a criminal offence or, I think, been certified insane. Those are stark options.
<P>
What happens if, a day after winning the election, the mayor decides to tear up his policy commitments and promises? He might announce that he is joining a rival political party and adopting its programme—or even that of the yogic flyers. There is nothing to bar such behaviour. The Government blather on about introducing a new kind of politics and getting away from tribalism—and, boy, have they succeeded in spades in London; we will all have to live with the fall-„out from that. But why do Ministers not heed the genuine concerns that we—myself included—expressed in debates on the Greater London Authority Bill? Why do they not take note of the concerns that were expressed in evidence to the Joint Committee and by the Joint Committee, or pay attention to the experience of places all over the world that know how the system does—or does not—work? We do not want a Mayor Barry situation—God forbid—but if one arises, it needs to be sorted out.
<P>
I hope that the Minister takes the issue seriously and accepts the spirit of the amendments. I should like her to table an amendment so that detailed proposals are included in the Bill and in draft regulations to tackle the problem.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> The Committee enjoyed the speech of the hon. Member for Eastbourne. Immediately before joining this Committee, I served on the Committee on the Transport Bill. The Minister there, the hon. Member for Streatham (Mr. Hill), was wont to give us what he described as a tour d'horizon. We certainly had that from the hon. Member for Eastbourne. We have been around the world with some compelling examples to back up his case. We have had some missed jokes, at least missed by certain hon. Member, and various allusions to Fawlty Towers. We have even had quotes from Shakespeare. The most compelling part of his argument was when he referred to the problem of the individual whose charisma turns to erratic behaviour. Interestingly, that was the one case where he did not refer to anyone specifically. Although I am sure that other examples came to the minds of other hon. Members, my mind turned to Baroness Thatcher. The hon. Gentleman's argument was so compelling in that case where in the view of some people—
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> But she was removed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> The hon. Gentleman, from a sedentary position, gets there before me. When charisma turned to erratic behaviour, there was a mechanism that enabled her removal. In a way that he may not have wished, the hon. Member for Eastbourne has given a completely compelling example. I am delighted to give way to the Minister and to wish her good morning.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> Good morning, Mr. O'Brien. The hon. Gentleman is on slippery territory here. Baroness Thatcher ceased to be Prime Minister, but did not cease to be an elected representative. Whatever Conservative Members thought of her, they were not able to overturn the democratic mandate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I am grateful to the Minister. The Member for Eastbourne has in part answered her question. In the event of the recall of a Prime Minister, to use the language we are now using, there would be a vacancy. There would be an election and an opportunity for the public at large to test whether they support the continuation of that individual.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> No.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> The Minister says no, but before she intervenes again, the problem we face is that in his tour d'horizon the hon. Member for Eastbourne has used a number of examples, all of which have slightly different arrangements. We are debating not the Prime Minister or some of the other examples, but the specifics of the arrangements proposed in the Bill. There is considerable confusion in the Government's mind.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> No.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> The Minister says no again, but only a few minutes ago the Under-Secretary of State for Wales clearly demonstrated the Government's uncertainty about whether the position of the elected mayor is the same as that of an ordinary councillor. I suspect that all hon. Members acknowledge that there is a significant difference between the elected mayor and his or her mandate and the role of an individual councillor serving on the council, yet the Under-Secretary said that that elected mayor is someone who has been elected to lead the council. If that is the case, it is vital that the council as a whole has an opportunity to say whether its leader continues to command its full confidence.
<P>
The hon. Member for Eastbourne moved a number of amendments, which I fully support, about opportunities for recall if that elected mayor becomes incapable of discharging his duties or carrying out his functions. Sensibly, wide discretion would be left to the Government to determine how that should operate in practice. Amendment No. 294 would add an additional area in which recall could become a possibility and that is where there is a loss of confidence in the person holding the post of elected mayor.
<P>
It is vital as the hon. Member for Eastbourne said that we take careful note of what the Joint Committee said. The hon. Member has already drawn our attention to paragraphs 72, 73 and 74 of its recommendations and has rightly pointed out that it would appear that the Government have simply dismissed the Joint Committee's concerns about what should be done in the event of incapacity of the mayor or in the case of loss of confidence in the elected mayor. Those of us who have expressed concerns about the Government's proposals for the future of local government laid down in legislation have used as one of our arguments a genuine concern that far too much power is placed in the hands of a small number of individuals or, as in the case of an elected mayor, an individual. If the Government are to press ahead with their proposals for so much power to be put into the hands of a single person it is vital that there is an opportunity for recall if that person becomes incapable during his or her period of election or if there is a loss of confidence.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> I had sympathy, until the hon. Gentleman got to amendment No. 294. I suddenly lost my sympathy when it looked as though this was a bid for a Liberal group to get rid of a popular elected mayor. We picked a situation, for example, in Scotland where part of the bandwagon of the elected mayor was that he supported the retention of section 28 when the councillors were predominantly opposed. If amendment No. 294 is agreed to, a popular elected mayor, with about 80 per cent. of the population backing him, could be sacked by an unpopular group of councillors.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a fair point and I do not deny the possibility of the scenario he describes, unlikely though it may be. In that event, however, there would be a vacancy. There would then have to be a further election. The person who had gone through the recall process would then be able to put himself or herself up for re-election and, if re-elected, would come back with an even stronger mandate. The electoral futures of those who had forced the recall might be rather short-lived when they sought to seek re-election.
<P>
I share the view of the hon. Member for Eastbourne that the Government must explain why they have rejected the concerns expressed by the Joint Committee and what they believe will happen if the elected mayor is incapable of performing his duties or there is a loss of confidence. Take for example, a situation in which the revelations about Lord Archer came to the public's knowledge after he had been elected as London mayor. I wonder what the Minister and her colleagues think would have happened. It is likely that there would have been a significant loss of public confidence in that elected mayor, but no possibility of action being taken, to do anything about it until the next round of elections. Some mechanism is necessary—as, it appears, is provided in all similar, but not identical, examples from around the world and, indeed, even in our national Parliament—for action to be taken in such circumstances. I look forward to hearing from the Minister why the Government have so decisively rejected the concerns of the Joint Committee.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> We have had a very interesting debate and I have enjoyed listening to the hon. Members for Eastbourne and for Bath (Mr. Foster). The hon. Member for Eastbourne appeared to base his argument on the fact that somebody who was ``bonkers'' could be elected or that someone could become ``bonkers'' after being elected, however ``bonkers'' is defined. There would then be a temptation to seek to remove that person from office. I petitioned in 1983 and 1987 to come to this place against someone whom I perceived as potentially being ``bonkers'' and I failed because the electorate rejected me. That does not mean that I was right or that the other individual was wrong. Ultimately, the electorate was the judge. That is where our mandate rests and is supported.
<P>
The points made by the hon. Member for Eastbourne appear to be reasonable, but they are covered not only by existing legislation but by the provisions in the Bill and the Government's general response. It was interesting to listen to the discussion, but the amendments are largely unnecessary.
<P>
As was stated earlier when we discussed amendments Nos. 177 and 179, it is the intention to apply to elected mayors all the relevant provisions in local government and electoral law relating to councillors that deal with qualification, disqualification, vacancies and so on.
<P>
Under existing legislation, a mayor would become disqualified from holding office on becoming bankrupt, on being a convicted criminal—this potentially covers the Marion Barry example—whether the sentence has been suspended or not, or on being found guilty of a corrupt or illegal practice under the Representation of the People Acts following an election court. A mayor would also be disqualified from office by failure to attend any meeting of the authority for six months or more. Again, that would cover in some instances the circumstances where a mayor became seriously ill and the deputy took over. Disqualification would follow under current legislation if the mayor did not attend the authority for six months or more.
<P>
Another ground for disqualification would be failure to qualify to hold office in the area concerned. If, for example, a person who was elected on 5 May chose to emigrate to Australia, Barcelona or elsewhere on 6 May and did not register again as a member of that authority for electoral purposes would become disqualified on the grounds both of not attending a meeting and of not being a local authority elector for the area.
<P>
The genuine points and concerns about the parameters of a mayor taking up office raised by the hon. Member for Eastbourne are covered by existing legislation, and I hope that satisfies him to some extent. As has been said, even if a mayor should die in office, a vacancy will accrue at a by-election, when the new mayor will be elected to fulfil the remainder of the term of office. Those are genuine and reasonable points that the Committee needs to know have been addressed. However, under existing legislation and under the provisions of the Bill, the mayor will be covered, as described, for any of the eventualities raised.
<P>
Schedule 1 refers to temporary absence or incapacity of the mayor. There is provision for the deputy mayor to act during absences, until the office of mayor becomes vacant, which would be after six months following failure to attend meetings. Again, those provisions are sufficient. It is not right to introduce new and separate provisions for the removal of a mayor from office. If the holder of an elected office is, and continues to be, legally qualified to hold it and is not disqualified for any reason, the holder should not be removed from office simply because he may be ``bonkers''. One person's ``bonkers'' is another person's champion and the holder may have been elected for his personal qualities, whatever they are.
<P>
It is not for us to second-guess the electorate's wishes. We can all think of colourful characters—for example, Jesse Ventura, the American mayor who is the world wrestling champion. Some people may say that he is bonkers and wonder why the electorate voted for him, but the electorate made their choice and have the right to do so. Amendments Nos. 255, 256 and 257 are neither necessary nor desirable.
<P>
I was asked about mayors being subject to recall or impeachment procedure, as envisaged in amendments Nos. 39 and 294. We discussed President Clinton and other potential scenarios, but there is no precedent in this country for public petitioning for the removal of someone elected to office for a fixed term. Why should someone not serve out his or her term of office and be judged at the end of it? In the next 18 months to two years, we will face an election in which we shall be judged on our parties' performances, on our individual performances as Members of Parliament and on what we have done previously. Why should a mayor not be treated similarly? Ultimately, the mayor will stand for re-election and be thrown out of office, or, if he is unable to carry out the office effectively in conformity with current legislation, will be disqualified from office. There is already scope for the mayor to be removed either by the electorate or as a result of current regulations pertaining to councillors.
<P>
Part III provides for serious misconduct or impropriety. If the mayor's conduct falls within potential misconduct or impropriety, part III provides a mechanism for dealing with the problem. As mentioned previously, no provisions for removing the mayor as proposed in the amendments were included in the Greater London Authority Act 1999 in respect of the London mayor and they are inappropriate for the Bill. As I said, mayors as well as other councillors can be disqualified from office in cases of misconduct and impropriety. If the mayor is found guilty of misconduct by an adjudication panel, it will have the power to give notice to the standards committee of the authority stating that he or she should be suspended or disqualified regardless of whether the misconduct constitutes a criminal offence.
<P>
I genuinely recognise the points made by Conservative Members. However, all issues—apart from being ``bonkers'' during a term of office—are covered by the Bill. If someone is, according to the political views of hon. Gentlemen, ``bonkers'', the best body to deal with it is the electorate at the end of the term of office. The electorate will judge whether the mayor's service to the community has been appropriate. I therefore ask hon. Gentlemen not to press the amendments, because the normal electoral procedures provide sufficient safeguards to deal with the problem.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> The Minister has tried to defend the indefensible in his usual engaging way. However, he has become hooked on the word ``bonkers''. The first sign of paranoia is thinking that everybody else is bonkers. One could envisage a mayor hopelessly losing the plot and locking himself away in the belief that everyone it out to get him. To quote the great thespian Kenneth Williams in a ``Carry On'' film:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Infamy, infamy, they've all got it in for me.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is hopeless for the Minister to quote the Greater London Authority Act. Of course that Act does not include such provisions. That is our point. We said that that was wrong, and we say the same about this Bill. Perhaps Governments of all parties learn by their mistakes, but Ministers might feel in retrospect that they should have included such provisions in the Greater London Authority Act. As the months roll on, we shall see how bitterly they regret that.
<P>
It does no good for the Minister to say that our concerns are covered by the Bill, the Government's general response—whatever that means—or existing provisions. The question of mayors going bonkers, although it has the attraction of being a graphic illustration, is the least of our concerns. We are also worried about criminal offences. Of course, the Minister is right, and if a mayor was convicted of a serious criminal offence, as was Marion Barry for drug trafficking and drug abuse, the position would be rectified, sooner or later. However, securing a conviction takes a long time. That is the nature of the criminal justice system, because of successive appeals, and quite right too.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman believe, therefore, that people are guilty at the moment that they are charged?
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> That is exactly the point that I was making. I do not believe that. Under our system, as under the American system, people are innocent until proven guilty. We have all watched with incredulity the slightly grainy video footage of Mayor Barry in a hotel suite in Washington offering to sell people crack cocaine, or whatever it was. However, the system had to grind on for months, if not years, until he was duly convicted and sentenced. We do not suggest that the Government should introduce legislation that prejudices the criminal justice process, but can they not deal with a mayor who is incapable of running his town or city because he is incarcerated pending trial, or dealing with criminal charges?
<P>
Even we can accept that death in office will be dealt with at some point, even if only by the cleaning lady. Clearly, something would happen. However, the important issue is not about whether people go raving mad, die or push drugs—although all those things have happened in America—but about loss of confidence and the linked issue of incompetence. We are embarking on a brave new constitutional process. In their wisdom, the Government chose to pilot the scheme in London. That is a matter for them. The Minister said, and I wrote it down, that there is no precedent for the procedure that we propose. However, there is no precedent for the office. That is the point. We are starting a bold new adventure.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robert Ainsworth (Lord Commissioner to the Treasury):</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> It may be bold, but we shall see whether it is a success.
<P>
There is no mechanism for removing a mayor. The Minister said that the deputy mayor could step in, but only a week or two ago in Committee we tried to stop the provision that allows the mayor to dismiss the deputy mayor out of hand. As the Bill stands, the mayor, bonkers or otherwise, will be able to dismiss the deputy mayor almost on a whim That is not much of a safeguard. Of course, we accept that part III will have an effect, and we shall discuss that in detail later.
<P>
Our concerns remain the same. The Minister was good enough to recognise that they are serious. We should emphasise less the vivid end of the spectrum, involving people going mad, and consider more carefully the question of loss of vital confidence. If a town or city is in gridlock because the mayor has lost the confidence of the elected council and the people, those people could be consigned to a four-year wait until they can do something about it. It is completely different in this place, although the hon. Member for Bath made it clear that there are provisions for the removal of Governments.
<P>
We are sad that yet again the Government have a blind spot on the issue. We do not say that these things will happen or are likely to do so, but powers should be in the drawer in case a problem arises. As I said when I proposed the amendments, the one thing that we can be sure about is that if a very messy situation arises, it will be made messier by an attempt to deal with it.
<P>
Having said all that, clearly the Government are impervious to argument on this and many other subjects and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before we start the stand part debate, may I say that it has been an interesting debate and I shall be interested to hear the debate on clause stand part, but there are only four paragraphs in the clause and I hope that we shall stick to the subject.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> I shall stick to it, Mr. O'Brien. The clause is headed ``Elected mayors etc.'' The ``etc.'' that bothers me is the reference to ``elected Executive members''. The Bill envisages directly elected mayors and directly elected representatives for various executive functions. To quote a phrase that has become common in the Committee, it is absolutely bonkers.
<P>
Presumably, the object of having a directly elected mayor is to provide strong leadership, a clear vision, joined-up government—to which the Government keep telling us that they are partial—and the ability to deliver effective execution of policy. If not, one would have a single chap or lady in charge of the show. The Bill goes on, however, to undermine that by allowing for people to be directly elected on competing mandates, perhaps with different prospectuses.
<P>
To take a hypothetical example, let us assume that two strong personalities coveted a specific job. There was Mr. G. Brown, smouldering with resentment at not being chosen to be the elected mayor. He decided that he would stand as the directly elected director of finance. The man directly elected as mayor was Mr. T. Blair. Mr. G. Brown thought that Mr. T. Blair had nothing like the intellectual and philosophical fibre that he had and did not deserve the job. How would those two work together with competing mandates?
<P>
Let me give a practical example. My hon. Friend the Member for Eastbourne said that there was a disagreement on clause 28, a significant clause. As you will know, Mr. O'Brien, there is a debate about the future of grammar schools. What happens if the leader who is standing in the election for mayor, stands on a mandate and says, ``I'm going to save the grammar schools'' and someone else, standing on a directly elected mandate, says, ``I want to be Director of Education. I'm against grammar schools; I want to get rid of them:''? How does that polity, to use a word that the Minister is keen on, work?
<P>
The Government have built contradictions into the system and it makes no sense. I have stated repeatedly that I am sympathetic to directly elected mayors. They are barmy in London—it is entirely the wrong place to start—but I can see that in some circumstances there is much to be said for directly elected mayors. In places such as Bradford, everything else has been tried and has failed miserably, as we have seen from the series of Ofsted reports on some dreadful Labour-controlled northern cities. You, Mr. O'Brien, will be painfully familiar with some of the difficulties. We might as well try something else. But what happens if people have different mandates?
<P>
To take a complicated case, let us say that, interwoven into this was a different racial background. Some east London authorities have had problems with ethnic minority groups who have adopted political structures. Minority interests have been at odds with the ability to run the local authority as a whole. There is no point in pretending that it has not existed. People know it exists in certain big metropolitan authorities.
<P>
Having decided to have a single person who can give leadership and try to haul the place out of the morass into which it has descended and take the necessary executive action to create a strong executive, why allow for the possibility of people standing on different mandates with different policies? Who will resolve those issues? It does not make sense. If we are to go for charismatic leadership, let us go for it, but let us not build into the system a means of making that undeliverable in practice and for deadlock and chaos in the way in which the local authority is administered. I cannot see why this provision has been included in the Bill. I can think of no one in the entire local authority world who thinks that there is an iota of common sense or practicality in that. I hope that the Government will drop this bizarre idea because it is fundamentally at odds with the purpose of their legislation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> Unusually, I think it appropriate to have a stand part debate. We should have a reasonably brief debate on whether directly elected mayors are a good idea and what the implications are. We have castigated Ministers for being in such a rush to implement their concept of ``modernisation'' for local government. Indeed, some trusty local authorities run by new Labourite councillors have rushed to implement the provisions of the Bill, even before they have become law. Some of them will fall flat on their faces as a result. We have also castigated Ministers for not having any pilot schemes and just decided that this is the way to go. They simply presented the three options—effectively one option for most councils—and said that that is all there is to it. Pilots would have been a useful provision.
<P>
It would be churlish, however, not to recognise that in the instance of directly elected mayors the Government have lighted on a pilot scheme. They ignored any faint hearts who said try a medium-sized or small city or town to see whether it works and went for the big one, London. If the policy is such a marvellous way of revitalising local government and bringing about a renaissance and all these $20 words that they love to bandy about in their talk of local government change and reform, here were the perfect laboratory conditions for this pilot. It is a big city with a relatively politicised electorate in many respects. There is high media interest, because most members of the media do not like to stray much beyond the M25 if they can avoid it, and perfect conditions in the shape not only of the election itself, but the selection process.
<P>
Both major parties managed to turn their selection of candidates into high profile media events in their own right. We had the odd hiccup on our side and the Government deployed all the massive power and authority, not only of the Government machine, but of Millbank, that finely honed Rolls-Royce engine of a political organisation to stop the hon. Member for Brent, East (Mr. Livingstone) becoming the candidate and subsequently mayor. They picked on the unfortunate right hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Mr. Dobson) as the fall guy for the whole process. Showing enormous courage, or perhaps foolhardiness, they decided to go for the London option to see whether it worked.
<P>
Then came the election: not only media coverage of the selection process, but the great ballyhoo of the election itself. Not many elections, apart from general elections, have enjoyed such wall-to-wall coverage in the national and local media. It was difficult to pick up the Evening Standard on any day for months prior to 4 May without encountering big stories about the election and the personalities of the different candidates. We had the perfect opportunity—no excuses at all—for this not to work.
<P>
When all the ballyhoo died down and all the smoke and dust cleared, what did we discover about the turn-„out? It was only 33-and-a-bit per cent.—only 3 per cent. above the national average. The big question is whether Ministers have learned any lessons from the pilot scheme. Do they have any little niggling regrets, perhaps one or two things that they might, looking back, have done differently? Are there areas of policy that they would like to tweak? Has their enthusiasm been dimmed at all by the London experience? I suspect that the answer is no.
<P>
It is all too easy—this is a feature of many Governments—to put the wagons in a circle and to stick to the policy because it is the policy. I have often thought that the last words that left the lips of the ill-„fated General Custer were, ``This is the policy''. He displayed an absolute determination to go down fighting for a policy that had lost any coherence, meaning or relevance to the people who elected the Government in the first place. No wonder the Deputy Prime Minister is on record as saying that he is not a fan of directly elected mayors. It would be interesting to hear whether the Minister has managed to turn him into more of a fan in the light of the London experience.
<P>
The Government are masters of the law of unintended consequences. They produce policies, they launch them on an unsuspecting world and are subsequently as horrified as everyone else when they see what happens.

<P>

<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> What about the poll tax?
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> The right hon. Lady asks about the poll tax. In government, a death wish sets in whereby a policy is arrived at and becomes institutionalised. It becomes ``the policy'' and, no matter how circumstances in the real world change, the policy remains the same. Ministers and civil servants form ranks around it and defend it to the last. Oppositions, by definition, must be flexible on a range of issues. Governments, however, have an institutionalised commitment to a policy. No Opposition were more flexible than Labour in their 18 years of opposition, but Governments develop—again, almost by definition—a hardening of the arteries when it comes to changing or dumping policies. I do not entirely excuse the Conservative Government from that charge on occasions.
<P>
With the London experience behind us and the consequences of the result apparent, what do we hear? Not that the Government have any undimmed enthusiasm for directly elected mayors, but that they want to press ahead. We need to put the issue in context. Recent surveys show that 1 per cent. of authorities—a relatively small number of major authorities—are likely to opt for a directly elected executive mayor.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robert Ainsworth:</B> What about the people?
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I shall come to that interesting point in a minute. At the moment, I am attempting to gauge the enthusiasm of Government Members for this policy; we shall come to what the public think about it later.
<P>
I believe that a secret agenda is at work here, as we suggested earlier. The Government would really like to impose an elected mayor [Interruption.] I am sorry if I am keeping the Minister awake, but somebody has to. She will enjoy this speech. You may remember, Mr. O'Brien—or was Mrs. Michie in the Chair?—that we had a short but interesting debate about Ministers arrogating to themselves the power to select the date of referenda for choosing the directly elected may or—
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> Referendums.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> Or, as my hon. Friend says, referendums. I believe that the Government are trying to breathe some new life into what is rapidly becoming a corpse in the shape of this policy, and will require a whole range of towns and cities to have their referendums on the same day—a sort of super Thursday, as somebody in the Committee described it. There are also some amendments discussing the funding of a Government campaign, which will no doubt be described as an information campaign, a campaign to promote the policy of directly elected mayors across the country in that context. I am keen to hear from the Minister whether that is indeed what is behind their thinking. I think that, left to themselves, Ministers would wish to impose this policy on different towns and cities.
<P>
Part of my evidence for that is the evidence to the Joint Committee by the ubiquitous Professor Gerry Stoker, chairman of the New Local Government Network, an organisation that has an uncanny ability to mirror and reflect the innermost thinking of new Labour on these matters. He was disarmingly open, possibly because he had just returned from Hong Kong and was, by his own admission, jetlagged. On 24 June 1999, he said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That is why we need to think about either lowering the threshold in order to make it easier for people to petition for an elected mayor or possibly talk about a co-ordinated referendum campaign around the option of the elected mayor, or possibly, and I think it is a perfectly constitutional option, consider the idea of imposing elected mayors in, say, a dozen urban areas on the grounds that it is popular and it will help to transform politics in those areas<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I think that is very revealing evidence from somebody who is extremely close to the thinking of new Labour on these matters.
<H4><center>[Mrs. Ray Michie in the Chair]</center></H4>
<P>
The Joint Committee got it right when, in the section on elected mayors, it said that the Government set great store by elected mayors. That also reflects evidence of Professor Stoker. This is a kind of philosopher's stone for the Government. It is the policy that will revitalise local government.
<P>
Professor Stewart, however, who is at least as capable of speaking on these matters as Professor Stoker, told the Committee that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The arguments for a directly elected mayor are finely balanced<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and that requiring every large authority to have an elected mayor would be what he called ``a huge risk''. The Committee says that it agrees with Professor Stewart that there will always be a need for considerable diversity because of the great diversity of local government itself.
<P>
There was quite a lot of evidence at that time setting out the results of various surveys. In 1998, of the members of Lewisham council's citizens' panel, 1,000 local residents, 58 per cent., were in favour of elected mayors. An ICM poll in May 1999 said that 40 per cent. were more likely to turn out and vote if the arrangements included an elected mayor. MORI and the Economic and Social Research Council had similar findings. However, we must be careful not to take these figures at face value. First, they are now somewhat out of date—more recent polls have been conducted and it would be interesting to see what they have to say. Secondly, novelty in principle is always quite popular.
<P>
 We have seen in London—Ministers must get this key point across—that, whatever people might have said in response to surveys, when it came to an election, they could not be bothered to vote. Three per cent. of voters went out and voted. That does not strike me as a dramatic case for the concept of directly elected mayors. There is quite a lot of interesting information in the evidence to the Joint Committee about the experience of other countries, which is far from uniform. I will not go into that in great detail, unless the Committee presses me to do so, but there is by no means clear evidence that directly elected mayors increase turnout; in one or two countries, the opposite seems to happen.
<P>
Returning to the surveys, the Joint Committee also referred to the caveat by MORI that, although the headline figures seemed reasonably clear, beyond them the picture was less so. The public know relatively little about these proposals. Although 59 to 68 per cent. of the people in the metropolitan areas surveyed by MORI say they are in favour, this is not, as they say, a ``high salience'' issue for the public and a sizeable proportion do not feel able to answer either way.
<P>
Ben Page, who is knowledgeable on these matters, said in his evidence for MORI:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The bottom line is that people are more interested in outcomes than political structures.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is a sensible approach. People do not care much about the intricacies of structures. Although we may spend weeks talking about them, how services are delivered and accountability for them are what matters. That is what I call the hole-in-the-road test—whether people know who is responsible and to whom they should complain if a hole appears in the street outside their house.
<P>
Our old friends, the Labour Campaign for Open Local Government, have had something to say on this quite recently. In their view, taken from a letter from Councillor Gerry Harrison, a member of Camden,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The truth is that Britain is not really into ``personality politics'' at local level, and where the Minister thinks she will find enough charismatic mayoral candidates in each major city to run a series of mayoral elections on a hypothetical ``Democracy Day'' next year is anyone's guess.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is an interesting thought. It may be that there is a bunch of new Labour clones waiting out there to go into the fray, but it is also interesting that Councillor Harrison refers to the general feeling in local government that the Government have this notion of a democracy day—what a wonderfully new Labour expression that is—or super Thursday when the full weight of the Government machine will be put behind getting people out to vote positively in referendums across the country for directly elected mayors.
<P>
It is important that we know exactly what the Government think they are doing. There was some confusion earlier in our discussions on the amendments about how separate or otherwise the mayor is from the local council. An interesting document produced by a group from the Local Government Association called ``Directly elected mayors: reinvigorating the debate'' had some fascinating things to say last year. Professor Robin Hambleton, associate dean, faculty of the built environment and director of the centre for local democracy at the university of the West of England, was beside himself with excitement about the potential of a directly elected mayor. That was, of course, well in advance of the election itself. He talked of
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The mayor of London . . . who will not surprisingly have a very high national and international profile—certainly a profile which will make most politicians in Westminster green with envy.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In a moment of unconscious humour, he said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>It is clear then, that the elected mayor of London will have a seismic impact on the politics of local government throughout the UK.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No one can argue with that.
<P>
What benefit do the Government expect in the wake of directly elected mayors? On any view, directly elected mayors will involve more bureaucracy and cost at local level. We are grafting on to the existing system of local government a novel import from other countries. What will the benefit be, if not enhanced interest and involvement of the electorate? The London experience does not suggest that turn-out will be improved. People may be more interested, but they will not bother to vote on the day.
<P>
Other concerns are relevant. The Minister will be aware of the front page of the Local Government Chronicle of 26 May, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Urgent talks about the impact of cabinets and mayors on senior managers have been held between local government's leading professional organisations, amid fears that top jobs could be downgraded.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It also talks about discussions between the Society of Local Chief Executives, the Society of Chief Personnel Officers and the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy—all of which are concerned about the changes that will be wrought by having directly elected mayors.
<P>
We are back to the old routine in Committee. It is not just we Opposition Members are presenting a few Conservative debating points, a sad litany of people of different parties in local government, commentators and academics share the same concerns. In another excellent article in the Local Government Chronicle, George Jones and John Stewart, both professors of local government, went through the issues in detail and concluded:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The arguments for a directly elected mayor are finely balanced . . . The argument in favour is that it creates one clear point of accountability and responsibility.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That puts the Government's case in a nutshell.
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The argument against is that it creates one clear point of accountability and responsibility.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
So what is their point?
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Everything depends on how one interprets the concentration of responsibility at one point.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Harking back to our earlier debate:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Equally one can argue that an individual may prove ineffective and even dangerous.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The conclusions of the Liverpool democracy commission, which set out the job description of a directly elected mayor and make interesting reading, are discussed. The commission set out a range of qualities and attributes, which would be difficult to find in one single human being:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>These qualities are more likely to be found in a team than in one person.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
On the question of turn-out, George Jones and John Stewart argue that the evidence from abroad ``is not clear-cut'':
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In the US, mayoral elections are not distinguished by high turnouts. Continental Europe has far higher turnouts than the UK, but this is true regardless of directly elected mayors.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
They also argue a point about multicultural cities that was made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Multi-cultural cities call for collective leadership.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There is a real danger that a directly elected mayor is, by definition, an individual, not a member of leader of a team. Professors Jones and Stewart also state:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The problem for the UK is greater because the government has refused to counterbalance the mayor by any system of recall.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There is no need to rely solely on what I say. Let us examine the comments of Lord Hattersley—or Roy Hattersley, as he has always been known to some of us. [Interruption.] I am glad that that brought a laugh. In a recent article in The Guardian, he says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>But another blow has been struck against party politics in local government. As a byproduct, immense damage has been done to local government in general The more mayors we have, the less power the city and county councils will enjoy.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He continued:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Behind the facade of photo opportunities—
<P>
</UL></FONT>how well he understands new Labour—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>real local government will be downgraded . . . Owning all those dilapidated tower blocks did not make councillors popular. But it did make them important.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He concludes:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The notion that local government can be rehabilitated by putting ballot boxes in supermarkets is typical of a government which constantly confuses style and substance. Local government will seem interesting only when it becomes important again.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That message is clearly lost on Ministers, who fail to understand that tinkering with structures is not the answer. The answer is to give real powers and responsibilities back to local government.
<P>
The issue of turnouts is crucial. If there is genuine support and enthusiasm in an area for a directly elected mayor, Conservative Members are not saying that such a scheme should not happen However, it should be piloted outside the capital city, and the reality so far has been extremely discouraging.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
An article in The Economist<P>
 in the wake of the local elections said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>No more than one in three Londoners turned out for the much hyped contest for their new mayor and Assembly.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The turnout was
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>more than ten points lower than in the first election for the old Greater London Council in 1964. That hardly sounds like a clarion call for the reformers' holy trinity of regional assemblies, directly-elected mayors and proportional representation that any revitalised Blair-Kennedy project might want to visit upon Britain.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
As I said, this is another example of a policy that simply will not work. I say that because we have the experience of what happened recently in London, where we have a mayor who, according to the kindest view, will be a maverick, constantly at war with the Government. We managed to persuade only 33 per cent. of the electorate to vote, who might otherwise not have voted, despite all the attention and media interest.
<P>
The Government should take the policy away and quietly consider long and hard whether it is what they want. Perhaps they will decide to pilot the scheme outside London and see how it works, particularly in towns and cities where there is a great genuine groundswell of opinion in favour of a directly elected mayor. However, I genuinely fear that the Government will battle on regardless and that, having decided that the electorate in London has not got the point, they intend to hold a series of referendums across the country on the same day, backed by a Government campaign. If all else fails, I think that they will try to impose directly elected mayors on the towns and cities that they believe should have them.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> We have had an interesting morning. The hon. Member for Eastbourne did not know how to handle the issue. He says that he is in favour of local authorities and local people having choice. That is all that the Bill provides for. What is he worried about? All the Bill does is provide local people with the choice to hold a referendum. The power for the Government to impose a directly elected mayor is not buried anywhere in the Bill. The hon. Gentleman has spent hours going through every publication that he can find, to try to justify why the scheme is a bad idea. It is up to the people to decide that. The time is long past when Parliament believed that it knew best about everything and that it should determine how everything happens in every local authority. Governments have not made a good job of that in the past. The Bill gives local people the opportunity to have a choice.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman has shown his true colours. He does not actually believe in choice or local people having a say; he knows best. Then he says, ``Well, maybe we should pilot the scheme.'' How can the Government pilot it, when we are trying to give the power to local people? As we have reminded the hon. Gentleman, a Bill that would have enabled pilots to take place came before this House in the first year of this Session. The Conservative party blocked that Bill and thereby ensured that no one had the opportunity to pilot such a scheme. I want to return to the clause stand part debate, because the general debate that the hon. Gentleman was trying to start simply showed that he is all over the place and has not sorted out his policy, so in the meantime he wants to prevent local people from having any choice.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon raised his problems with directly elected executives. I must say again that the Government will not require things to be done. We have responded to lobbying from interested people who said that they wanted the choice and that they wanted us at least to consider their proposals. We discussed clause 11(6) and (7) earlier. Those provisions will allow people to draw up ideas for a directly elected executive and bring them to the Secretary of State and to Parliament, to find out whether they are workable.
<P>
The etceteras that worry the right hon. Gentleman will simply ensure that elected executive members with direct responsibility are treated as councillors for the purposes of other local government legislation. The hon. Member for Eastbourne got worked up about that. All that clause 36 does is ensure that the whole raft of local government legislation that remains in force will treat the mayor or a directly elected executive member in the same way. Those people will be subject to the same rules of ethics, the same standards and the same rules on disqualification.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> I appreciate that the purpose of the clause is to settle the constitutional position of people who are elected. However, when I said in my earlier intervention that the object of having a directly elected mayor was to provide leadership and clear executive authority, the right hon. Lady nodded in agreement. The Government must have a view on the coherence of its legislation—they cannot simply listen to what everybody wants and say, ``Let's put it in the Bill in case people want to give it a whirl.'' I said that I feared that if the Government permitted other directly elected mandates, people could claim their own mandates on diverse platforms, which would make coherence in administration and policy making impossible in a local authority. Does not the right hon. Lady understand that? Some unspecified people may want such a situation, but that does not mean it makes sense to have it.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> We find it difficult in our democracy, because of its history, to balance the situation when the electorate have deliberately chosen people who have different perspectives. The electorate expect those people to work together, listen to locals and make proposals that do not fit in with the idea of a clear mandate to which we have become accustomed. We have a mainly two-party system, so we have become used to a particular form of clear mandate whereby one party is elected and then puts into practice its policies.
<P>
The public tell us that they do not always like that system. It is not up to me. I am much happier with the absolute clarity that the right hon. Gentleman talked about, but that is my history. My generation prefers that idea, but when I meet younger people, I find that they often want more diversity and more balancing of different views, rather than simple adherence to the party line. It is not up to us to say that we should rule that out for ever or that it is too dangerous and we shall not allow it. That is where there is a balance of power and weight. It is highly unlikely that people will come to us with the option to which the right hon. Gentleman refers. They are, for all I know, more likely to put a proposition for an executive without a directly elected mayor. However, because it was put to us that this may be something that people might like to think about, we said, okay, they could work on it as a model and, if they found local support, bring it to us to ensure that it made sense in the British democratic system.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> The right hon. Lady raises the even more alarming scenario of directly elected executive members, but no directly elected mayor. Surely that would be a building without a roof—the most incoherent outcome possible? I hope that, if someone comes along with that idea, he or she will be given jolly short shrift at the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I was trying to say that we do not have the prerogative here to determine how every democratic organisation will work. Democracy has to evolve and change. Through the provisions in the Bill, we are seeking ways in which we can enable it to grow and change in ways that the public feel will work for them. For this period in the development of democracy, we have devised three coherent frameworks for the future. The clause deals with the way in which we shall make sure that the individuals involved are subject to the local government laws of this land. It is not up to us today to say that any particular way is right and that others will be ruled out. Of course we shall look at how we can help democracy to evolve, but we shall not be so dogmatic that we rule out possibilities that we find extremely difficult to contemplate at this stage.
<P>
<B>Mr. Sanders:</B> Does the hon. Lady envisage that, if a local authority chose the option of a directly elected executive, it would consist of individuals with their own manifestos, who would then come together? Three people might be elected, all of whom wanted to run education, only to find that they were not able to do so. Would they simply stand as members and have their roles sorted out once they were elected?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> The hon. Gentleman tries to define this too carefully. It may be that, as commonly happens, those people would be standing on a slate, as we call it in old-fashioned politics. In other countries, people stand for individual positions. Someone may stand as chair of the education or police board. We do not rule that out. We are saying that, although we do not think that the country is ready for that yet, because we know that there are those who want to explore that cause, we believe that, if they decided to pursue it they would need come to the Secretary of State and, subsequently, to Parliament through secondary legislation to develop the model more effectively.
<P>
I should also say in response to the hon. Gentleman that it is perfectly possible now—indeed, the Opposition moved amendments to that effect—that all parties should be represented in an executive. If I remember rightly, we discussed those amendments before the recess. In that case, there would be people who had been elected on different manifestos, with competing aims, in the same executive. We did not accept those amendments because it is up to local circumstances whether an executive comprises one party or more than one party. If that is the local decision, through the electorate, locally it would have to negotiate and to modify its mandate to accommodate the different mandates on which others were elected. The clause is clear. I hope that that satisfies the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> Is not the obvious thing to do be to allow people to run on a slate? If we envisage a slate of people to take the senior positions, which moves towards the French system, why do so by some curious geometry? Why not simply permit it under the most obvious system, which is proportionality across the local authority with people running on a slate? Everyone would know where he or she stood.
<P>
<H5>12.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> The right hon. Gentleman's Front-Bench team will be interested to know that he pushes proportional representation. I shall not follow him down that route today. What he describes is possible. People could bring forward not the change in the voting system—we feel that Parliament should decide that—but a proposal for a directly elected executive. It would not be a matter of individual posts, each party would put forward six or eight people on a ticket, slate, or whatever we want to call it, and say how it would want to run the whole executive. That would be possible. We simply say that, if any of that happens, the clause will ensure that those people are treated as councillors and will be subject to the legal restrictions to which councillors would otherwise be subject.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 36, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 37</center></H4>
<H4><center>Time of elections etc</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 61, in page 23, leave out lines 15 to 20.
<P>
The clause allows the Secretary of State to issue regulations about the timing of elections for directly elected mayors and other members of the executive and gives him the ability to compel them to follow those provisions. The regulations in draft specify a four-year term, although the further stipulation that mayoral elections should take place in a year when there are no elections to the authority—in other words, an off-year—would mean that the first mayor or mayors elected might have a slightly longer term. I assume that that is what the Government have in mind.
<P>
This is another probing amendment and it would be interesting to hear the Government's rationale, assuming that they have one, for stipulating that mayoral elections should take place in the off-year. Other things being equal, one of the obvious results would be to produce a council and a mayor of different political persuasions. I appreciate that the Minister will have a lot to say about tribalism and all that, but I believe that it could equally lead to gridlock in a local authority area. Why should the Government make that decision on behalf of all local authorities? Are these not matters that could be left open to local councils to decide themselves? They might prefer to have the election for mayor at the same time as elections to the council. Indeed, there is an argument, although I would not take it very far myself, that that might push up turnout. It is a particular cause for concern, for councils that have all-out elections. Those that have that system often value the ability to feel that they can make tough decisions with an eye to the long term without having one eye constantly on imminent elections almost every year. I wonder whether the Government have given this any further thought in the light of the recent experience in London?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> I listened very carefully to the hon. Gentleman. I hope that we can offer some clarification and that ultimately he will be able to withdraw his amendment. The amendment, as drafted, would remove much of the power to make regulations on the timing of mayoral elections. In particular, it would prevent regulations that would provide a smooth transition for mayoral electoral cycles.
<P>
The hon. Member for Eastbourne correctly identified, the fact that clause 37 enables the Secretary of State to make regulations on the timing of mayoral elections. The amendment would prevent those regulations from addressing the intervals at which mayoral elections can take place, the term of office of elected mayors and the filling of vacancies.
<P>
It will be necessary to provide for terms of office—and intervals between elections—which are shorter or longer than the normal term of office of four years specified in clause 36(4) so that the mayoral election cycle can be brought into step with the normal electoral cycle.
<P>
The regulations must cover the wide range of circumstances that will prevail among local authorities wishing to introduce a directly elected mayor. They will therefore include the type of local authority; the pattern of elections currently in place; the year in which an authority decides to introduce an elected mayor; and the relative phasing of all the various electoral cycles—an important consideration. All these factors will affect the options for the timing of mayoral elections, the timing of the first election and the possible need for transitional terms of office that differ in length of service from the normal term of office.
<P>
As the hon. Gentleman will be aware, there are draft regulations to cover eventualities and they can be used by the Secretary of State to cope with different circumstances at a local level.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> We have had considerable discussion about removing mayors who were bonkers. Is it technically possible that the Secretary of State could use this clause to do exactly that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> The clause is about the timing of elections so, I cannot see how a Minister can remove a mayor in office by fixing the first election, which is fixed according to a referendum. I would hope that the amendment will be withdrawn so that the Secretary of State has the flexibility to look at these issues.
<P>
The hon. Member for Eastbourne mentioned the holding of elections in an off-year. The intention is to make the cycles of elections compatible with the policy of having more frequent elections. The Government generally support the principle of having more frequent elections. It would be an opportunity for the electorate to test local government and the mayor, with a range of other elections being held annually or on a more regular basis. That is a very positive step forward.
<P>
I hope that, with that explanation, the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his amendment. The aim is simply to give the Secretary of State the flexibility to look at local circumstances and to determine the electoral date.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his explanation, as far as it goes. However, it is a little alarming that it seems to be a central thrust of Government policy that we need more elections in this country—as if that is somehow going to produce higher turnouts. We will debate this in more detail later in the Bill, but there is plenty of evidence of voter fatigue, as it is called. I can certainly see the force of having a mayoral election on the same day as the council elections, because one might get a more representative turnout. However, this is very much a probing amendment. I am grateful to the Minister for his explanation and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 35, in page 23, line 20, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and (e) as to the number of electors required to sign a valid nomination paper for a candidate for mayor, which shall not be less than 30'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment is simple and would provide a safeguard against frivolous candidates. I am sure that the last thing that Ministers want is for this bold new venture to be sullied by a mass of silly candidates standing with no serious intent—and that is only the Liberals!
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> Is my hon. Friend aware that during the London mayoral elections, posters were put up saying, ``Vote for Frank''. I checked and could not find a Mr. Frank anywhere on the electoral candidates list. Perhaps that is the sort of frivolous candidature that we should guard against in future.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> My right hon. Friend makes a telling point. It may be the shape of things to come that the Labour party went to enormous lengths to make out that its candidate had nothing to do with the Labour party—a case of ``New politics, but not as we know it, Captain.'' It is fascinating and it all comes back to the law of unintended consequences, at which the Government are masters.
<P>
The guidance shows that the Government have set their faces against having a deposit. One can understand the force of that argument. It is difficult these days to fix an appropriate figure for a deposit that would have the desired effect of discouraging people. We all know that deposits were introduced originally to stop people getting out of national service by standing for Parliament. That is no longer important, but deposits have not been remarkably successful in discouraging frivolous candidates such as the late Lord Sutch from taking part in so many elections in this country. Part of Lord Sutch's latterday unhappiness stemmed from being upstaged as a silly party candidate by the Liberal Democrats in so many contests. I am trying to probe the ways envisaged by the Minister to safeguard against frivolous candidates, or is it part of the Government's master strategy to encourage them?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hanson:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his comments. He is obviously winning favour with you, Mrs. Michie, for what he said about the Liberal Democrats, who are here today in such great force.
<P>
One person's frivolous candidate is someone else's serious candidate. The fact that Lord Sutch may have received fewer than 150 votes on some occasions does not mean that he was not serious about his intentions in standing. It is important to recognise that.
<P>
In uncharacteristic form, the hon. Member for Eastbourne has taken the trouble today to amend the wrong clause. We shall not deal in detail with it now, but clause 40 deals with the conduct of elections for directly elected mayors. That aside, the principle of securing nomination rights is important. That is why the Government decided to seek the views of interested parties about nomination requirements. The issue was raised in the consultation paper on the conduct of referendums and elections for directly elected mayors, which the Government issued last month. The paper proposes that mayoral candidates should satisfy the same nomination requirements— including no deposit and 10 signatures—as normally apply to local government elections.
<P>
At the moment, it remains a consultation paper. I accept the hon. Gentleman's point about the possibility of seeking 30 nominations or anything else on the spectrum from no signatures to any number of thresholds. However, I emphasise that the Government's consultation is precisely that: there is no commitment to any particular approach. The Government have suggested terms similar to those applied to local government elections. I hope that the hon. Member for Eastbourne will accept this in the right spirit, but having a debate and coming to a conclusion today would pre-empt the consultation. The Government have set out their stall on applying local government standards to mayoral elections and the hon. Gentleman has set out his stall on the higher thresholds for nominations, so it would be sensible to reflect on the results of the consultation and reconsider the matter in due course.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman will be aware that the regulations under clause 40, which we shall discuss shortly, are subject to the affirmative resolution procedure. Hon. Members from all parties will have the opportunity to debate the issue at a later stage, so while the hon. Gentleman has made his point on nomination rights of 30 and the Government have put their case, there will be an opportunity to hear the views of local government and the wider electorate and to return to it at some point when the Government have listened to the consultation.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> That sounds like a sensible idea. Let us await the results of the consultation and in the meantime I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> The amendment raises the interesting subject of voting systems and, in particular, the attractions or otherwise of proportional representation. [Interruption.] From a sedentary position, the hon. Member for Bath disagrees with what I thought was an uncontroversial opening sentence, but no doubt we shall hear from him later.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman accept that there is a significant difference between proportional representation styles of election that can apply only when there is more than one post available, and the system that is debated at present, which would have difficulty squeezing into the PR definition as normally given?
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I confess to not being an anorak on the subject and I am happy to bow to the hon. Gentleman. His party can be defined by two things: one is Europe and the other is trying to tinker with the electoral system to find ways of getting more Members of Parliament elected. If he tells me that, from the point of view of the purist, this is not proportional representation, I accept what he says. In any event, we are debating the system that will be used for directly elected mayors and it will be different from the first past-the-post system that applies in local government generally.
<P>
The system proposed is also, of course, the same as that used for the election of the London mayor. Two features of that are relevant to the debate. One is something on which we have touched already, which is the effect on turnout. Presumably one strong argument in favour of changing the electoral system is that it would increase voter participation. There are arguments that I presume are loosely termed ``fairness'' arguments, with which I shall deal later, but the other is that it will encourage more people to turn out to vote. It will, I assume, be said that they will feel that their vote will make more of a difference under this system. That seems to have been painfully unsuccessful, as we have already heard, in the London elections, where a marginally increased turnout—though substantially lower than 20 or 30 years ago—was the result.
<P>
There is also the separate but related issue of tinkering with the voting system in other ways. It is worth reminding ourselves that, on 4 May, 32 councils across the country were experimenting with different ways of voting, as part of the pattern to try to attract more voters to the poll.
<P>
Although, as local government first pointed out only the other day, Britain languishes at the foot of the European league table for turnouts at council elections, almost none of these pilot schemes had any substantial impact. In Coventry, for example, polling booths were set up in the shopping precinct on Wednesday to Saturday in the week before polling, but only 1.5 per cent. of the electorate were encouraged to vote early. In Redditch, a similar experiment produced an increase of 1.6 per cent. In Watford, a weekend voting arrangement yielded a drop in turnout from 36 per cent. to 27 per cent. As the returning officer in Coventry, Mr. Folkhart remarked:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>This suggests that convenience is a factor for a relatively small proportion of the electorate.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
When we consider any tinkering with the voting system—the availability of voting or the system—the litmus test is whether it will have an effect.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robert Ainsworth:</B> The results of the experiment in Coventry were disappointing in terms of turnout but the hon. Gentleman should not detract from the fact that it was extremely popular with those who used it—people who probably would have voted in any case. He should not dismiss it entirely as irrelevant.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I am grateful for that intervention and am taken aback in a sense, because of the hon. Gentleman's role in the Committee. I do not seek to denigrate what happened in Coventry. All 32 councils that took the trouble to carry out these experiments should be commended. I am sure that a lot more can be read from the entrails of this experiment. The hon. Gentleman and I can agree that the result was disappointing. There has been a clear difference, however, with postal ballots. Two wards in Gateshead had voting only by post and turnout was 62 per cent. and 46 per cent. compared with an average turnout of 27 per cent. in the other wards in that area, which is interesting. Swindon also had all postal votes and it saw turnouts of between 47 per cent. and 55 per cent. That is interesting as it seems to suggest that going to the front door with a ballot paper and getting people to vote without taking any trouble at all increases the turnout, but again there is more work to be done on that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> We must be careful before we take that too far. We had a postal ballot on the future of Ripon grammar school, for example. It is a limited electorate and the ballot papers went to every house. Even on that specific issue, which was hotly contested and everyone was aware of what it was, only 70 per cent. voted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> That is interesting. It reflects the point that my right hon. Friend made earlier: one can make it as easy as one wants for people to vote, but sometimes people make a conscious decision not to vote. Whether one has PR or universal postal ballots, at the end of the day people must feel that it is worth their while. I was about to say that that was reflected in part by Sir Jeremy Beecham, the chair of the LGA, who said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>People have still got to feel that voting will make a difference to what happens locally.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is the key point. Tinkering with systems is not the answer. I do not want to make a habit of this but I should like to quote Hywel Morgan, the campaigns and development officer for the association of Liberal Democrat councillors. In a piece entitled, ``Were the voting experiments really worth the effort?'', he concludes:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>But even the much vaunted mayoral system did little to enthuse voters to turn out. Turnout for the mayoral elections was virtually identical to that for the London local elections in May 1998.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He makes the similar point that a real increase in the powers of local government will make a difference. Quite why his party is so keen on tinkering with the voting system itself remains a mystery.
<P>
The other issue that is pretty clear is that the new system confuses voters. I remember vividly our activities in Eastbourne town centre during the European election campaign. A lot of people approached me, not about the issues but about the ballot paper. They had seen copies of it in the newspapers and were horrified. They did not know how it worked, whom they could vote for, how they could vote for individuals or a party and so on. I am sure that all hon. Members had a similar experience. The system was difficult, particularly for elderly voters, and I am sure that it put people off voting. There is quite a lot of evidence that the system had precisely that effect in London.
<P>
I recently asked the Home Secretary about the number of spoiled ballot papers. The number was significantly higher than in ordinary elections and high compared with the 0.3 per cent. that seems to be the norm in general elections. Things are slightly complicated in London—I will make the point before anyone else does—because a significant number of ballot papers were left blank. Some people decided to vote only for the assembly and others to vote only for the mayoralty. If we tinker with a tried-and-tested system, there is a danger that the electorate will not embrace or even understand the new system.
<P>
It is difficult to imagine a system that would not have resulted in the hon. Member for Brent, East winning the recent London election, despite all the best efforts of the Government and the Labour party nationally to fiddle the system to try to ensure that he did not win. They tried to fix the nomination, but beyond that it became difficult to fix the system. The Government and the Labour party could not prevent that popular candidate from winning, but that does not mean that the new electoral system is a good one. The fact that second preferences count for the same as first preferences seems to represent a gross distortion. I can never get my head around the argument that that is a fairer system. The hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate (Mr. Twigg) is grimacing. He is something of an anorak on the issue.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stephen Twigg </B>(Enfield, Southgate): And proud of it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> Indeed, and I am happy to give way if the hon. Gentleman wants to intervene. I have never been able to get my head around an electoral system under which second choice votes are counted as equally valid and important as first choice votes. I went through this by looking at the ballot paper for London. One's first choice is usually pretty clear. One has a clear view about whom one wants as mayor of London or, perhaps more importantly, whom one does not want.
<P>
However, the second preference involves an entirely different mental process. Some people will use their second preference to vote for someone whom they think has a limited chance of winning, effectively wasting their ballot. Many people were confused about whether they had to express two preferences. In fact, they did not have to express more than one.
<P>
<B>Mr. Twigg:</B> In the London mayoral election, more than one in three voters' first preferences were for neither of the two main candidates. The hon. Gentleman is correct to say that, in a first-past-the-post system, the same candidate would have won had people voted in the same way. However, one in three voters would have been entirely disfranchised. The supplementary vote system enabled large numbers of those votes also to count towards the outcome. It enabled people who voted for candidates who came third, fourth or fifth—including the Labour candidate—to vote between the first and second choices.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> That is all very interesting, but it does not deal with my main point that people's decisions on a second preference are different from those on a first preference. I do not want to generalise, but their reasons for deciding on a second preference vote are much more likely to be negative. A system such as that in Scotland, where the party that came fourth ended up as a partner in government, is extraordinary. Such a result seems to fly in the face of the whole concept of representative democracy. This is not the right occasion for an open-ended seminar on forms of voting—
