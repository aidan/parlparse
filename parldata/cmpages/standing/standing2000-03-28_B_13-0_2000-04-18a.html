<P>
``feature of the landscape'' includes, but is not limited to, drains, ditches, walls, fences, hedges, buildings (whether operational, disused or abandoned), shooting butts, gates, stiles, footbridges, reservoirs, dams, dewponds, mineshafts, path surfaces (where paths have been provided with a surface), and ancient monuments'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I was addressing the use of the word ``natural'' to describe features in respect of which landowners' liability is removed. Amendment No. 232 seeks to remove the word ``natural'' from the clause, and amendment No. 322 seeks to define the features in question without using that word.
<P>
I mentioned the historical issue involved in the use of the word ``natural''. The Country Landowners Association has stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Natural features'' is not a recognised term and there will be difficulties for the occupier, the public and ultimately for the courts, in deciding what is and is not ``natural''. For example, lakes can be natural or man-made and have been in existence for generations—when does the artificial lake become natural?<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That statement deals with the nub of our main concern, which is shared by others who are worried about implementing the Bill. What is natural? For me, it is something that has existed for ever and a day and in whose creation mankind has had no involvement. Man-made features include lakes, reservoirs, iron age forts, old or modern peat diggings, which are common in some areas, and grouse butts. They also include more obvious features, such as fences, stone walls, gates, stiles, dams and path surfaces that have been created specifically to minimise erosion. Those features are all man-made and are therefore clearly not included in the Bill's ambit with regard to the removal of liability that the Minister keeps professing. I challenge the Government on what they mean by the term ``natural''. One can think of all manner of examples in the hills and uplands which would cause difficulty under the Bill. Upland areas contain many reservoirs. Nobody could maintain that reservoirs are natural, but it seems daft that liability will not apply to falling into a natural lake but it will in relation to an artificial one. That approach seems inconsistent.
<P>
The huge power station at Llanberis is close to the locality of the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd). What was a natural lake has been massively enhanced and its water level rises and falls by many feet twice a day. Above the lake is another lake in the high mountains—I cannot for the life of me remember its name—which is the header tank for the power station, which is also located on the higher ground. That lake also rises and falls. It was natural, but it has been seriously changed by mankind.
<P>
That example illustrates the absurdity of using the word ``natural'' in the Bill and the huge difficulty that lawyers and courts will encounter in trying to ascertain what it means. I suspect that most people would think that the landowner should be liable in relation to a feature that has been established in the past few years and which clearly presents a risk. However, the term ``natural'' implies that anything done by mankind since the year dot is outside the removal of liability ambit.
<P>
That is why amendment No. 322 seeks to define types of features that the clause should cover. The list is not exhaustive, but it contains examples of features that are not put in place with any nefarious motive of trying to cause injury. Many such features have been in place for many hundreds of years. Indeed, some ancient monuments have existed for thousands of years. It is wholly improper to expect the landowner of today to be liable to people who injure themselves on those features. I suspect that the Minister will respond that such liability applies now. That is perfectly true, but the purpose of the Bill is to encourage more people to gain access to the countryside. If they are to do that, the prospect of many more landowners being sued by many more people will open up. That is inevitable if far more people are to roam the countryside than at present. However careful they may be, more will hurt themselves. Under the Bill they will virtually all be able to sue the landowner for having done so. That is a major impost on landowners for features that happen to be on their land but which they did not necessarily have constructed. Clause 13 needs a radical rethink, not least because the Government have so far failed to explain the central term, ``natural feature''.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath </B>(Somerton and Frome): I want to speak to amendment No. 194 tabled in my name, and amendment No. 195, tabled in my name and that of the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy. I do not want to argue against clause 13, which is an important part of the Bill. The fact that the issue of liability has been tackled by the Government is welcome. The difficulty, already alluded to by the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Paice), is the interpretation that could be placed on the term
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>natural feature of the landscape.
<P>
</UL></FONT>It is important to understand what Ministers understand by that phrase. What is natural, in legal terms, and what does landscape comprise in the context of liability? The amendments are intended to explore those issues.
<P>
Amendment No. 194 approaches, in a slightly different way, the issue tackled by the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire. Some features of the landscape that are not natural are a danger to the public. An obvious example would be extinct, ancient mineral workings. I do not know whether they would be on access land, but the Mendips are littered with depressions in the ground, which are Roman and later lead mines. Material has been taken from the ground, which has since reverted to natural habitat or been farmed. The remaining feature is not natural, having been created by the Romans, but it is a significant factor in the landscape. It is permanent. Unless filled in it will remain and it is not, therefore, ephemeral. The amendment would be relevant to such features, and to the plethora of barrows that appear in open land in Wiltshire. Those are man made, but they are significant parts of the landscape.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman aware that there are about 2,000 man-made prehistoric barrows within a two-mile radius of Stonehenge?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> I am not at all surprised. I have not counted them, but I accept the hon. Gentleman's word.
<P>
Some smaller constructions of various kinds are not buildings. For instance, no one suggests that cairns found in the open countryside should be excluded from access land, yet they could be a danger to someone who was foolish enough to stand on top of one to do an imitation of Sir Edmund Hillary and who then fell off. The owner should not be liable in such instances. A folly is a building of sorts; it is a structure and a permanent feature of the landscape, but it is not a natural feature.
<P>
Amendment No. 195 deals with living things. I am not familiar with the law, but other hon. Members will doubtless be able to expatiate at length about whether or not features can act sui generis and whether the owner would be liable for the actions of plants or animals on their land. For instance, the crack willow tree on my land is very large and I am extremely proud of it, but when the wind blows it tends to shed branches. Unfortunately, it overhangs the neighbour's land and I hope that the neighbour will not be standing underneath it when the bough breaks, because I suspect that I might be liable. I do not know, because I have never consulted a solicitor on the matter, but I can do nothing in advance to protect myself except to ruin an extremely fine tree.

<P>

<B>Mr. Gordon Prentice </B>(Pendle): You could kill your neighbour.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> That would be an extreme measure, but it would be one solution.
<P>
Another living thing—it is not a frivolous example, although it may be thought of as a reduction to the absurd—is the pathogen. Would an owner be under a duty of care to eradicate pathogens if his land was open to the public? If my recollection is correct, Lyme disease is carried by ticks that inhabit bracken or heathland. It is an extremely unpleasant disease. If known cases of Lyme disease have been caused by walking on infected land, would the landowner be liable? Neither the ticks nor the microbe that causes the disease could be considered natural features of a landscape, but they are undoubtedly there.
<P>
I want to be satisfied that my fears are groundless and that no liability or duty of care would be imposed on landowners in such circumstances and that the Bill's definitions cover those matters. I want a watertight definition of what the Minister intends with the phrase ``natural feature''. I am not satisfied that we have one. My amendments and those tabled by the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire seek to provide the Government with alternative definitions to strengthen the Bill. If the Minister believes that they are not necessary, will he explain why? Can a sensible construction be put on clause 13 that would make the amendments unnecessary?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Helen Brinton </B>(Peterborough): The hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath) said that he wanted a watertight definition. I want to refer to water in the context of liability. Water companies are concerned that they will be liable for accidents involving water company assets. For example, dams and reservoirs are inherently dangerous features and, where they are open to the public, provision is made to ensure public safety. However, water companies are concerned about whether similar safety measures would be required if access were extended more widely, and, if so, whether they would be required to fund those measures.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Elfyn Llwyd </B>(Meirionnydd Nant Conwy): We have had a useful debate. The words ``natural features'' cannot be left as they are because they will create a field day for the courts. If we can reasonably better define what the Government mean by ``natural feature'', we should do so now and not leave it to litigation.
<P>
Why should the liability regime be different? Much of the natural landscape of the countryside is non-natural because many man-made features make up the look of the countryside that the public rightly enjoy. The Bill will safeguard natural features of the landscape, but there is concern that the provision is too open ended. I hope that the Minister will address the issue of dry stone walls, ditches, dykes and reservoirs, to which the hon. Members for Peterborough (Mrs. Brinton) and for South-East Cambridgeshire referred.
<P>
There are many lakes in my constituency, some of which are natural and others not, but only a local would know the difference between them. It seems somewhat strange that responsibility will not be attached to a lake but will be attached to a reservoir, even though the risks, outward appearance and features of both can be just the same. I hope that the Minister will address that important point. The effect of the clause will be that from day one of the new right of access being granted, the occupier will have to undertake risk assessments of the potential hazards of features that could be argued to be non-natural. Is it really the Government's intention that all obviously man-made structures, such as dry stone walls, must be assessed for their safety or removal? The clause, as drafted, will lead to a great deal of litigation, so I hope that we will be able to explore the subject in detail in Committee, which is the proper forum for that.
<P>
There is a compelling case for features to be listed in the Bill. I say that for one simple reason; the Government are reluctant to curtail access during the hours of darkness, which will make the occupier's life 10 times more difficult because hazards that might be apparent during the day will not be apparent at night. That places an onerous task on occupiers. Of course, occupiers will retain a general duty of care to all trespassers, so we are piling it on pretty thick when occupiers are mostly just trying to make a living rather than working out ingenious ways to avoid being sued.
<P>
Taken together, the amendments would provide that no duty was owed in relation to features of the landscape, whether natural, man-made or non-natural, where features other than natural features include those listed in amendment No. 322. I am sure that that sounds clear.
<P>
The principle behind the amendments is invaluable to the debate and is extremely important. I again return to the perceptions of the Bill. People are prepared to allow access to the Berwyn and Aran mountains in my constituency, but they are concerned about the additional liabilities that will befall them. The Select Committee on Welsh Affairs, of which I am a member, investigated the issue in its discussion with Forest Enterprise. That body slapped us down, saying that there would be increased liability and premiums, but that it could not evaluate what the premiums would ultimately be because nobody knew the scale of the increased access.
<P>
We are now imposing that onerous duty on individuals who have far fewer resources, researchers, legal advisers and other facilities than Forest Enterprise. It seems that it is good enough for such organisations to exempt themselves from the scheme, but not for individuals who might be cash strapped and struggling to maintain a living on the mountains. We are extending the right of access for the best of motives, but I am afraid that we are not considering the huge obligations that we are creating on the other side of the coin.
<P>
Statute and case law show that owners should not be made liable for the state of premises where access is as of right, such as an area where the owner cannot exclude an entrant. That has been the principle hitherto, at least. For example, under section 1(1) of the Occupiers' Liability Act 1984, highways are excluded from the ambit of the Act.
<P>
It is important to remove as much ambiguity as possible. Removing the division between natural and man-made features and listing them will be helpful to all concerned—to members of the Committee and to everybody outside. It will be helpful to landowners who are affected and to their insurance companies, their legal advisers and their estate managers. It will be useful to all those who want to exercise rights of access.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown </B>(Cotswold): On that point, is the hon. Gentleman aware of the representations made by the Yorkshire Dales national park authority on 10 April? In it, the authority says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>some features . . . whilst technically ``man-made'' were so much a part of the ``state of the land'' that they should be recognised as exempt from occupiers liability. Examples are the many miles of dry stone walls, archaeological features—both prehistoric and industrial. Most of these features are not legally protected: owners might be tempted to remove them to avoid potential claims unless they are excepted from liability claims.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> That is another danger. We might find ourselves with the prospect of people removing old and archaeologically interesting features to avoid liability. As the hon. Gentleman knows, that is a big concern outside. People already worried about their cash flows see the matter as another potential problem.
<P>
<B>Mr. Prentice:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman seriously suggesting that people might remove dry stone walls because an accident could occur if people tried to climb over them?
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> I regret to say that I am. If the hon. Gentleman knew the cost of building a yard of dry stone wall, he would understand why I am saying that. [Interruption.] The Whip, leaving the Room, says that that is a stupid remark; that is a good contribution from him.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I did not hear any contribution from the Whip or any other hon. Member. I am sure that we will not have stupid remarks in the Committee. I am satisfied that one was not made.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray rose—</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> I give way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman aware that, in the Cotswolds, from where my hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown) and I come, Cotswold stone walls are at a premium? Farmers often make enormous sums by removing and selling them for the building of houses that would not get planning permission unless such stone was used. The question from the hon. Member for Pendle simply demonstrates how little he knows about the subject.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gordon Prentice rose—</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> I give way.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We do not want serial interventions—they just confuse everyone.
<P>
<B>Mr. Prentice:</B> Huge sums of public money go to the Cotswolds for people to rebuild dry stone walls, at a cost of £80 a wall. I am familiar with the hon. Gentleman's point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> Is that £80 a running yard or a metre?
<P>
<B>Mr. Prentice:</B> A metre.
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> The hon. Gentleman knows more about the Cotswolds than I do, but other Committee members will have heard his point.
<P>
I am concerned that some farmers will, in desperation, prefer to pull down a wall that is in a poor state and replace it with a cheap, nasty fence to avoid the risk of liability. I hope that I am wrong but, regrettably, I suspect that I am right. [Interruption.] We will see just how stupid I am in a few months' time.
<P>
There will be obligations that no landowner would deny, but the Bill is too open ended. It is devoid of real definition and will produce considerable problems. It behoves us all to improve it so that we do not end up with a lawyer's feast and a huge amount of litigation.
<P>
Amendment No. 391 is in line with case law. An occupier cannot control or prevent access to premises. It has been held as unfair and unworkable that the occupier should bear automatic liability for an entrant's safety. The Bill departs from that legal principle.
<P>
Amendment No. 392 would relieve landlords of liability for harm that is caused by defects in their buildings to entrants who exercise the new right of access. The Minister will say that no one has a right to enter a building, but old stone buildings, such as kilns or corn repositories, are all over Wales and the rest of the United Kingdom. They might be in need of repair and are often unlocked. People will be at risk if they enter them.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Gareth Thomas </B>(Clwyd, West): I know that the hon. Gentleman will understand my point. Does he accept that liability in general for people who use the right of access will be reduced to the equivalent liability as set out in the Occupiers' Liability Act 1984, which provides for a much reduced duty of care as it appertains to trespassers? That is the general rule, but the Bill goes further. Does he agree that the clause greatly reduces liability in general and that, in the case of non-natural features of the landscape, there is no liability whatever?
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> No, I do not follow that at all. The hon. Gentleman and I went to the same law department, but he obviously slept through the relevant lecture. However, he is right in general. We are trying to encourage greater access, but a reduced liability could lead to a huge increase in claims. He is right but, because more people will take up the right of access, it is a serious matter. I partly agree with him.<P>
<P>
Amendment No. 392 would relieve landlords of liability for harm caused to walkers by defects in their buildings. It is in line with existing case law, which indicates that landowners' liability should not be increased when access is a right; in other words, when it is imposed upon them. Although the proposals would ensure that the occupiers' liability was generally lower, they contain elements that would increase liability. Many people will visit open land, and I know of many old mills that are semi-derelict and which are just the sort of places that walkers would want to enter if the weather turns rough. I am trying to be constructive, and I am sure that the Minister will reply in his usual constructive manner.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> The debate follows naturally from our discussion of clause 12 and goes to the centre of some of the problems on which general interest in the Bill is based. People who know that their land will become open to general access may have reluctantly come to terms with that, but many of them are understandably concerned about the liabilities that they will now face. This morning, the Minister airily dismissed those concerns. I constantly use the word ``airily'' as the Minister tends to be airy in his dismissals. He said that almost no obligations would be placed on owners. He referred to the installation of a few notices and so on, but he said that the cost would be low and argued that central Government would fund any larger changes.
<P>
In making those remarks, the Minister ignored what landowners will have to do to avoid contingent liabilities. I would prefer him not to focus specifically on the Marlborough downs, which I used as an example of a wider problem. It may be necessary for owners of land on those downs to improve access points, stiles, gates and bridges across streams that are currently slightly hazardous, but which walkers traverse in full knowledge of the risk that they run. The Bill ensures that the owner must recognise that he or she will be liable if somebody falls off a rickety bridge across which people edge slowly because they know that it is rickety. The owner's liability is changing, and the Minister should not seek to dismiss that merely by saying that it does not matter. If access is to be provided, owners will often have to take significant steps to make hazardous land safer.
<P>
This morning, the Minister prayed in aid the Health and Safety at Work Acts and said that farmers are already liable under that legislation to restore land to a safe condition. However, I doubt that that is the case, and I suggest that the Minister should take further legal advice. I would be surprised if farmers who voluntarily give access to walkers are liable for such conditions under health and safety at work legislation.
<P>
Today's debate has mainly concerned the balance between the rights and obligations of the owner and those of walkers. The amendments would go some way towards addressing the current imbalance in that respect. The Bill should seek to avoid conflicts between walkers and owners and consequent litigation. Unless the Minister accepts some of the clear stipulations contained in the amendments— refer especially to amendments Nos. 232 and 322—he will be inviting litigation. The Bill as currently drafted invites somebody who slips off a bridge, falls over on a rutted track or falls down a hole that the owner has inadvertently failed to fill up to sue the owner for compensation. If the Bill—the principle of which we strongly oppose, but have now come to accept as inevitable—is to work, it is terribly important for it to stipulate in plain language the precise obligations of the landowner and what walkers can reasonably expect of them. The Minister might say that such matters are already perfectly plain. However, the very fact of the debate and of the amendments tabled demonstrates at least to us—perhaps we are as intelligent as most walkers, if not more so—that the owners' obligations and liabilities are not clear. It would therefore be reasonable to spell them out in the Bill, as such provision would not affect access; it would merely avoid the possibility of litigation.
<P>
I should like to take issue slightly with my hon. Friend the Member for South-East Cambridgeshire and to echo some of the remarks made by the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy, who said that the Bill imposes more liability than is currently incumbent on owners because the access for which the Bill provides is involuntary. Currently, owners have some liability for land to which they provide voluntary access. However, as the hon. Gentleman said, the Occupiers' Liability Act 1984 ensures that if access is involuntary and is granted without the will or permission of the landowner, the liability is that much greater. Will the Minister comment on that specific legal point?
<P>
Amendments Nos. 232 and 322 address two particular aspects of concern. First, hon. Members have spoken at some length about what constitutes a natural feature. A number of examples are relevant, including hill forts built in the stone age or iron age—my archaeology is not as good as it might be. Badbury rings in Hampshire spring to mind, but there are also a great number of hill forts in Wiltshire. I think that 2,000 man-made barrows are located within a few yards of Stonehenge. People will have access to such sites, which are located on moorland and heathland. What will happen if they fall down on one of the barrows or burial mounds? Silbury hill, which is located in my constituency, is a huge, man-made barrow that was built several thousand years ago. It is extremely hazardous, but paths over it will be open to the public. Who will be liable if somebody falls down Silbury hill? It is plainly not a natural feature; there is no question about the fact that it was made by man, albeit some 2,000 or 3,000 years ago. [Interruption.] The hon. Member for Pendle (Mr. Prentice) finds that amusing, but I think that it is very important.
<P>
What will happen when somebody falls off a hill fort, of which Britain has a great many? Will he sue the landowner? If he does, what will the judge have to say? Under the Bill as it currently stands, the judge will not know what to make of the case and will have to use his judgment to reach a conclusion. Will the Minister spell out who is liable if somebody falls down a hill fort?
<P>
Paths sometimes occur along natural folds of land that are high up and hazardous. Are such paths a natural feature? Of course the fold is natural, but the path is not. Will the Minister consider the definition in that respect? Similarly, Wiltshire has many dew ponds that were created by farmers hundreds of years ago. As their name suggests, the ponds collect dew; in wet weather they are full of water, but in summer they are dry. If somebody falls into a dew pond, will the owner be liable? Wiltshire also has a number of mill ponds that were created by monks in the middle ages. Are monkish ponds in Wiltshire man-made or natural features? Amendment No. 232, which would remove the word ``natural'' from the clause, is eminently sensible.
<P>
The amendments highlight a second concern that has not been mentioned by other hon. Members except in passing. It will be very significant if I am right in thinking that owners will face increased liability in relation to man-made features. As I understand it, the Bill contains a built-in incentive for landowners to remove bridges that are only just passable because they have a few planks missing and no hand rail or to remove duckboards across bogs that are in a similar state. They are likely to ask why they should be liable for someone falling off a duckboard into a bog, some of which are incredibly deep. They may simply say, ``I shall remove the bridge; I do not need it to move the sheep. I shall also remove the duckboard and the other man-made features because I might be liable under the Bill.'' The Government may want to improve access and give walkers what they seek, but the Bill seems to go against it.
<P>
Both of those considerations are particularly pertinent to night access. The Minister went to some lengths to explain why access should be available all night, but I shudder to think what might happen to those who cross the Marlborough downs at night if the bridges have been removed because of the owner's fear of liability. The Government need only clarify what is meant by clauses 12 and 13. We ask merely for clarity. We want to know on what judges should base their decisions if litigation arises. Otherwise, we shall not have reduced but increase the tension and conflict between walkers and owner.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gareth Thomas:</B> Hon. Members are right to press the Government for better clarification of various aspects of clause 13, particularly the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>natural feature of the landscape.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
However, Opposition Members should not over-dramatise or exaggerate the risks to which occupiers of land will be exposed under the new regime.
<P>
During what proved to be a rather unwieldy intervention on the speech of the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy, I tried to stress that the clause substantially reduces liability for occupiers of land over which access is exercised from the common duty of care under the Occupiers' Liability Act 1957, which is a fairly rigorous level of liability, to the much more relaxed and reduced level of liability under common law appertaining to trespass that is codified in the Occupiers' Liability Act 1984.
<P>
At its highest, the level of liability is low and modest. One is not talking about the imposition of strict liability. A litigious rambler would need to prove a breach of the duty of care that applies under the 1984 Act, which defines that duty as taking
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>such care as is reasonable in all the circumstances of the case to see that he—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the trespasser—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>does not suffer injury on the premises.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I seek clarification, although it may not be needed, on whether the owner would be liable if property damage was capable of giving rise to a cause of action for personal injury.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> How would an occupier fulfil his duty of care to a user of his land if a steeply banked reservoir was sited on the centre of his land. How would he make it safe?
<P>
<B>Mr. Thomas:</B> With your indulgence, Mr. Stevenson, I quote from ``Clerk and Lindsell on Torts'', the standard work on the subject. The authors attempt to define the limits of the duty of care under the 1984 Act, which goes some way to answering the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy. The authors state:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Since section 1(4) presumably takes account of the fact that any reasonable occupier is more solicitous for lawful visitors than for trespassers, section 1(3)(c) must have some different function: to make it clear that some classes of trespasser can never complain of the state of the premises, however negligent the occupier. Who are these excepted classes? It is submitted that this matter is best approached from the point of view of the injured trespasser; would this plaintiff be unreasonable if he were to complain of the state of the premises? In outrageous cases, such as the burglar tripping on a missing stair, the answer is clearly yes. Similarly, it is submitted, with any adult who knowingly and without reasonable excuse goes where he is not meant to be (e.g. the tramp who, on his way to the garden shed where he intends to sleep, breaks his leg on an uneven path); such a person has no reasonable expectation that the premises will be safe.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I hope that that demonstrates that we are talking about a much reduced potential liability to take reasonable care in all the circumstances, which must surely take account of the fact that some risks are so hypothetical and speculative that no reasonable man would cater for them.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a helpful contribution to the debate, but what he has just said about the law of tort raises more questions than it answers. Clearly, although the duty of care is lower, anyone who is on the land in that instance would not be a trespasser and would be acting in a reasonable way. Therefore, the measures that a landowner might reasonably be expected to take to ensure the safety of that person must be greater than the measures that he would be expected to take to ensure the safety of a trespasser or burglar. That brings us back to the elemental question of whether the provisions in the clause justify the removal of reasonable liability from the landowner despite the increased numbers of people who will be on his land.
<P>
<B>Mr. Thomas:</B> I shall let the Minister reply to that. The hon. Gentleman raises a legitimate question. Does the new right of access suggest that any person who exercises that right may reasonably expect that the land will be safe in all the circumstances? That is not an academic point and should be clarified. Those who own land that will become access land should have the opportunity to assess risk because there are implications for public liability insurance, although some Opposition Members have exaggerated the point.
<P>
<B>Miss Anne McIntosh </B>(Vale of York): On the hon. Gentleman's last point, I do now know whether I find myself at an advantage or disadvantage. I hate to intrude in a private dispute between two graduates from the same law school. I am in a minority of one as the only person qualified in Scots law. Arguably, trespass is not recognised by Scots law, although that has now been overruled by a case that decided that trespass does exist.
<P>
I seek clarification from the Minister about whether liability will be increased, especially pursuant to the comments of the hon. Member for Clwyd, West (Mr. Thomas). I refer briefly to the House of Lords debate of 30 March 1999. In reply to the direct question of Lord Renton of Mount Harry,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>who will pay the vast claims that might arise?<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Lord Whitty gave a clear and definitive answer when he said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the Government do not expect the new statutory right of access on foot to open countryside to have a significant impact on public insurance costs for landowners. Their liability to people who are exercising that right will be the same as the liability which they already owe to those who are not on the land by their invitation or licence. Therefore landowners and their advisers will wish to decide whether and to what extent insurance, including public liability insurance, is appropriate for their needs. An economic appraisal study by independent consultants for the Government suggests that any increase in the public liability insurance premium will be very small.—[Official Report, House of Lords, 30 March 1999; Vol. 599, c. 201.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I put it to the Minister that that is a matter of debate. I support the group of amendments in the names of my hon. Friends. Both the Minister and Lord Whitty accept that there will be an increase in public liability insurance premium but in their view the increase will be small. That is debatable. However, at least the Government accept that there will be an increase.
<P>
The element of danger involved will be reflected in the increase. The sum by which the premium increases will become apparent over several years from the date on which the Bill comes into effect. Someone might walk across moors and fall down a mineshaft. There would be the question of whether the walker would sue the landowner. Initially, not many might decide to sue and there would be only a slight impact on premiums. The cost of premiums would escalate if there were an increase in the number and variety of injuries to include, perhaps, broken limbs or, at the extreme, the death of a walker as my hon. Friend the Member for North Wiltshire suggested.
<P>
The Government might wish to evade the issue, but how would a walker be made aware of any dangers? There are often no trees on which signs might easily be fixed on moors such as the grouse moors in the north of England, including north Yorkshire and County Durham, with which the Under-Secretary is familiar from his walking excursions. I am not sure about how the Minister intends people to be warned about dangers. Further, in what way might a landowner who wished to exercise his right of closure for the permitted period indicate that? How would a walker be aware of the changes of ownership, during which there might be different days of closure, if the position was not clear?
<P>
The clarification in the amendments is required and I hope that the Minister will support at least some of them. Will he clarify the implications in respect of natural features? We have received several submissions from outside organisations. Could the category ``natural features'' be expanded to include features normally occurring on the land? If he noted that he would accept on Report the recognition of such features as being exempt from occupiers' liabilities, clause 13 could be greatly improved.
<P>
I am slightly confused following the speeches of the hon. Members for Clwyd, West and for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy. Is clause 13 diminishing the duty of care? My hon. Friends and I subscribe to a different view, as is reflected in the amendments. The purpose of the amendments is to fill the gap in the law that clause 13 fails to fill and to reflect case law. The Minister might wish to rule on those points.
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> My point was that the Occupiers' Liability Act would apply only to man-made structures. A definition of natural would clarify the position. That was the thrust of my argument. I accept that the liability will be reduced so that it does not apply to natural features, but more people will be on the land, and that will be a poisoned chalice.
<P>
<B>Miss McIntosh:</B> If we could narrow the debate, Opposition Members would agree that the Minister has an opportunity to clarify the definition. My hon. Friend the Member for North Wiltshire might be interested to know that we have henges in north Yorkshire. They are technically man-made objects. I was slightly alarmed that the hon. Member for Pendle found the point about dry stone walls amusing. Local landowners have said that they would rather remove man-made objects than have the expense of repairing and replacing them while facing claims for liability by those who injure themselves.
<P>
<B>The Minister for the Environment (Mr. Michael Meacher):</B> This has been an interesting and imaginative debate. Some flights of fancy made me wonder whether we were all living on the same planet. I shall, however, try to respond to the genuine points.
<P>
Clause 13 is important. It is designed to reduce occupiers' liability. My hon. Friend the Member for Clwyd, West managed to balance the exaggerated and imaginative ideas that were put forward by drawing attention to the key point that the clause reduces occupiers' liability. Scarcely any other issue occupied as much of our attention when we were preparing the Bill. I had meetings with interested groups before and after the Bill was presented to the House. I understand the widespread concern that landowners and occupiers should not be liable for the foolish actions of people who exercise the new right of access over their land or even be on the receiving end of the litigiousness of some people. People should act sensibly and take proper care when they go out in the open country.
<P>
The original proposals a year ago made an occupier's liability to people who exercised a right of access the same as the liability that he owes trespassers. That is a fairly minimal liability. After all, in general, there is no reason why someone who has entered land without invitation should have a claim on the occupier for injury suffered on that land. However, we recognise that the courts have found that an occupier owes limited liability to trespassers in common law when the occupier is aware that a hazard exists and knows that someone is likely to be at risk from it, even if that person is trespassing. That is sometimes known as the ``duty of common humanity'', which is contained in the Occupiers' Liability Act 1984. In practice, the courts have rarely decided in favour of claims that arise from occupiers' liability towards trespassers.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The point that was put to us in those meetings was that, as a result of the new right of access, many more people might come on to an occupier's land. Indeed, we all expect that to happen. That land might contain any number of hazards—we have heard a pretty comprehensive list this afternoon—including, in particular, natural hazards such as cliffs, lakes, bogs and the like, against which the occupier could not reasonably be expected to guard and about which he could warn visitors only by putting up expensive and unsightly fences and warning notices. Neither users nor owners—nor, indeed, Ministers—want that. One of the many letters that I received was written jointly by the Country Landowners Association and the British Mountaineering Council. It proposed excluding liability from
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>natural features of landscape.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
that is their drafting, not mine, but that is what clause 13(2) provides.
<P>
As hon. Members have been diligent enough to discover, previous legislation contains references to ``landscape'' and ``features of the landscape'', but does not contain that precise phrase. The provision is intended to cover risks associated with mountains, cliffs and rivers, such as steep rock faces and deep waters. As I shall explain later, we are prepared to introduce an amendment to clarify that the provision extends to trees and plants. However, the Bill cannot cover every possible circumstance, and I hope to make the provision clearer, but if necessary the courts will consider, and no doubt reach a sensible conclusion on, the facts of the case.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Clwyd, West made a helpful point. I emphasise that it is no small thing to change such a fundamental provision as the law on occupiers' liability. I believe that the provision in the Bill is about right, but I emphasise that it constitutes a fundamental change in English law to reduce the already minimalist liability owed to a trespasser to none at all.
<P>
The Opposition amendments would go much further and would exclude liability for a variety of man-made hazards, each of which I shall discuss in a moment, and, indeed, for any feature of the landscape. That cannot be right. When a matter is directly under the occupier's control, he should continue to bear at least a minimal liability to strangers on his land. At least one of the amendments—No. 235—would exempt from liability an occupier who puts people's safety at risk intentionally or acts with reckless disregard for their safety. I hope that we all agree that that would be wrong.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for telling us about the problems of amendment No. 235, but it was not selected for debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I was not aware of that, and am grateful for that information. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will nevertheless be advantaged by the information that I have given. Whoever proposed the amendment was wise to withdraw it. It was a rather silly amendment.
<P>
Earlier, I expressed some sympathy with the thought that occupiers should not have to face unjustified litigation. However, the scale of the problem risks being overstated, as my hon. Friend the Member for Clwyd, West said. We have consulted the National Trust, which has extensive experience of managing nearly 1,000 square miles of open countryside and millions of visitors annually, and no more than a handful of claims have been made in any one year. Last year, following 1.5 million visitors, the number of claims was a few tens, and not all of those succeeded in court.
<P>
We have no evidence that those who currently occupy open country subject to statutory rights of access—at least a million people where there is a statutory right and between 1 million and 1.5 million where it is de facto and uncertain—are required to pay higher insurance premiums than others who occupy such land from which the public is excluded.
<P>
<B>Miss McIntosh:</B> Will the right hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I am going to say more about the issue. I will always give way to hon. Members, but I promise that I will return to the point. I believe that hon. Members are exaggerating fears that have little basis in reality. I return to the point that the distinction that the Bill now makes between natural and other features of the landscape is the right place to draw the line.
<P>
<B>Miss McIntosh:</B> I do not think that what the right hon. Gentleman has said is entirely fair, because we are discussing a new, non-voluntary right. It is impossible to say, even though his noble Friend, Lord Whitty has said that there is going to be an increase. We are discussing the size of the increase.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors has considered occupiers' liability, as part of its report published last month entitled ``Land Management Implications of enhanced access to the open countryside.'' The RICS has welcomed the Bill's provisions for reducing occupiers' liability. It believes that the provisions will significantly reduce management problems for landowners.
<P>
The report also records the general perception that interest costs will not rise. That may turn out to be incorrect. However, when a body as prestigious as the RICS gives its opinion, we should take account of it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> The longer the Minister's response goes on, the more disappointed I become. I wish that he had read the whole RICS document, rather than only the short extract that he has been given. In my speech this morning, I quoted from the document, in which the RICS clearly states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>There seems to be a perception that insurance costs will not rise but this is based on current use and no insurance company will advise in advance that it will put up its premiums. There is wide concern that the increasingly litigious nature of the public will push up these costs.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I could go on. The Minister's extract was used wholly out of context. He should take all the advice of the RICS into account.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> The hon. Gentleman is protesting a little over much. I made it clear that there could be some increase in insurance costs. I am not ruling that out. However, I think that the idea that an increase is certain and that it will be substantial is not supported by the RICS. We will have to see what the experience leads to.
<P>
The hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy raised a point about Forest Enterprise this morning, when he said that there could be no increase in public access, because insurance premiums would go through the roof. That is run by the Forestry Commission, which already provides extensive access. I am rather puzzled at the hon. Gentleman's remark, because he is a conscientious contributor to our debates. The Forestry Commission does not insure; it does not take out insurance premiums. It is a Government Department, so there is no question of increasing insurance premiums at all.
<P>
We must be careful about the assumption that there will be a big increase in insurance premiums, because I would also make the case—I am now on less certain ground—that millions of acres of land are already subject to access. My advice is that there has been no increase in premiums as a result. I do not guarantee that in no circumstances, with no insurance company and no owner-occupier or landowner, will there be any increase in insurance cost, but we need to see the matter in perspective, and it has been grossly exaggerated in this debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> In ease my recollection is wrong, I shall investigate and bring the report with me to our next sitting. I recall that the matter was in connection to access to forestry land and the location of logging. If the Minister is saying that Forest Enterprise is uninsured for access during those times, I would be surprised. If I am wrong, I shall advise the Committee accordingly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I entirely accept that point. The Forestry Commission is, of course, a Government Department, and such Departments do not take out insurance. If they incur liability, I am afraid that taxpayers rather than insurance companies pay.
<P>
Many points were raised about liability with regard to man-made features. The word ``man-made'' is not in the Bill, and presumably refers to features of the landscape that are not natural. The hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire asked about lakes, which may be man-made, and reservoirs, which are. We need to bear in mind that minimal liability would be owed to trespassers. I do not think that the hon. Gentleman should simply shrug, because that is relevant. The Bill contains provisions for closures or restrictions where, exceptionally, man-made features pose a threat to public safety. It would be reasonable for a landowner or occupier to seek closure if he would face unacceptable cost or could not provide for adequate protection for the public, and I would expect that closure to be granted.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Peterborough raised the subject of reservoirs. If a reservoir or dam presents a danger, I would expect the occupier—a water company—to take reasonable precautions. The answer that I gave to the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy applies to my hon. Friend as well. When it was not practicable to guard against risk in such a cases—and I would have thought that it was practicable in most cases—the Bill would allow closures or restrictions on access. That is the position that the water company ought to take.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I want to challenge the Minister on that. We accept that any landowners, be they water companies or anyone else, can seek to exclude an area for safety reasons. However, he seems to miss the critical issue of consistency. There will be inconsistency unless it is proposed that all lakes be excluded, as the Government insist should not be the case. If people were at risk from a lake, they would be at risk from a natural feature, but the exclusion in the clause would not apply if they were at risk from a reservoir or man-made lake. Whoever put the water there in the first place, the risk of drowning would be identical. It is inconsistent to suggest one approach for a man-made lake and another for one that was there anyway.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> The hon. Gentleman is making far too much of the matter. I have repeated that walkers and ramblers on open country should use due care and attention in where they go and how they act. If, as could be the case, the lake or reservoir were dangerously situated at the bottom of a steep hill, it might be justified to close it off. There could be notices, but it would be difficult to prevent, say, young children from picnicking families from walking off and falling into the water. That would be an exceptional case. One has to exercise common sense. A Bill such as this cannot exhaustively take account of every nook and cranny in the landscape.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath:</B> I am trying to be clear about what the Minister is saying. To return to the point of the hon. Member for Clwyd, West; setting aside the reckless landowner or the landowner who deliberately creates dangers, does a walker using access land have a reasonable expectation that the owner or occupier will exercise a duty of care to make that land safe for walkers? There is an implication of costs or liability in the legislation—issues that are crucial to its end result.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> Yes. A walker does have a reasonable expectation that the landowner or occupier will show proper concern to ensure that man-made structures on the land are in a reasonable state of repair and maintenance. The hon. Member for North Wiltshire mentioned a rickety bridge. If a bridge were in such a state of disrepair that someone fell into a river and was hurt, that person would have a case against the landowner. If someone fell and hurt himself from a bridge in a proper state of repair—through carelessness, negligence or foolishness—in my view he would have no case against the landowner. That is the reasonable position at present, in regard to trespassers. The clause reduces landowners' liability, provided the man-made structures on the land are in a reasonable state of repair.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> In a moment; I want first to address the hon. Gentleman's point about 2,000 man-made borrows and mounds within a certain distance—which I forget—of Stonehenge. I am sure, without checking, that he is right but the advice that I have received is that there has not been a single claim by someone who has fallen down or over such land or features. Large areas of the country are walled, and while the landowner owes a duty to walkers, as to trespassers, there are very few claims. There is no liability for people who are stupid enough to jump off mounds, for example. Listening to hon. Members' comments on walls, one might think it remarkable that there are any walls left on Dartmoor, much of the lake district, Snowdonia or many other areas that already have statutory rights of access—often with liability greater than proposed in the Bill.
<P>
For the sake of expedition—the issue is probably tangential to the main thrust of our discussion—I will not discuss amendment No. 392 and liability for defective premises, under the Defective Premises Act 1972. On amendment No. 391, I accept that the Occupiers' Liability Act 1984 may create liability for damage to trespassers' property. However, any such liability would be at a very low level—the duty of common humanity—as set out in the case of Herrington v. British Railways Board. In addition, given the considerable restrictions on the right of access, for example not use a vehicle and not to engage in commercial activities, we do not believe that occupiers will be faced with a significant number of claims in respect of property.
<P>
Amendment No. 394, aside from removing occupiers' liability in respect of any risk, natural or man-made, would leave intact the existing liability owed to trespassers. That would be perverse and would not be the right approach. It would mean that someone on the land who complied with, for example, the restrictions under schedule 2, would be in a worse position than someone who breached them. Clause 13(2) removes the liability for natural features of the landscape, for both those exercising the statutory right and trespassers.
<P>
I turn now to the points raised by the hon. Members for Somerton and Frome and for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy. Occupiers' liability under the Occupiers' Liability Act 1984 does not apply to animals, so the amendment in respect of fauna would have no effect. I am not convinced that any change in the law is justified in relation to animals. However, I accept that trees and plants are natural features of the landscape from which occupiers' liability should be removed. I shall consider whether some clarification is necessary to ensure that any trees or plants, whether growing naturally or otherwise, are excluded. In conclusion, the clause draws the line in about the right place, but I shall think further about whether clarification is needed in relation to trees and plants. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Paice:</B> As I said in my intervention, I am disappointed with the Minister's response and I maintain my position. Obviously, I am pleased that he will consider the point raised by the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome. It would be churlish of me not to welcome that. However, the right hon. Gentleman is being extremely complacent about the potential impact of the Bill. He used the National Trust to justify his position, saying that there had been only ``a few tens'' of cases. I do not know what he meant by that, but even one case can cost an individual landowner many tens of thousands of pounds. We want to minimise the potential for that to happen.
<P>
The Minister said that accidents were caused by the foolish actions of walkers. No one suggested that it was necessarily that. If it were a foolish action, I should hope that a court would rule against the walker, not the landowner. However, accidents do happen and they may not be the result of foolish actions, but of inadvertent mistakes. We want to address that problem and to minimise the risk.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I wish to raise a point to which reference has not so far been made in the debate. Insurance for property owners is at a low level because very few claims are made. The problem is that some such claims can amount to a lot of money and it would not take many claims before the rates rose considerably.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> My hon. Friend has professional knowledge of such matters and I am sure that we all accept his point. The suit is not just the cost of the damages that may be awarded to the walker, but the huge cost of pursuing the matter through the courts in defence of the case, which can often amount to much more money than the damages. I shall not proceed with the obvious argument that has been made many times about the costs of lawyers. Great cost is involved. Even if the landowner defends his case successfully, he may not receive back the money for whatever costs he incurred in defending his position.
<P>
The Minister has been misadvised about stone walls. Of course, there are probably many thousands of miles of stone walls, but anyone who spends time in such areas knows that some of them are disappearing, as the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy will know, given that he represents such an area.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> And in the Cotswolds.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> Indeed. The temptation is to remove the walls if the potential cost of leaving them will run into tens of thousands of pounds and the risk of law suits.
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> That is a vital issue, relating to whether access is linear or merely to cross the land including all the walls.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right. I said this morning that linear access may keep walkers away from stone walls or any other hazard, but that does not apply with open access.
<P>
The Minister and the hon. Member for Clwyd, West referred to the reduction in the owner's liability. I know that my hon. Friend the Member for North Wiltshire differs from me, but I accept that an attempt has been made to reduce the owner's liability. What matters to the owner is not under how many laws he is liable, but how many law suits he may have to face. My contention is that land owners, even under the reduced breadth of liability, will be open to far more cases against them, because of the massively increased numbers that are expected and the movement from linear access to open access. Any case could cost a considerable sum to an individual landowner on the wrong end of it.
<P>
I am disappointed in the Minister's response. I do not see much point in pursuing the matter now, much as I would want to. I hope that he will reflect on the points, which have been seriously made without the exaggeration that I think that he attributes to them.

<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss amendment No. 196, in page 8, line 22, at end add—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(4) A person who, having been convicted of an offence under subsection (1), is convicted of a further offence relating to the same access land is liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding level 3 on the standard scale.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> The amendments demonstrate my even-handedness in my approach to the legislation. They seek to deal with the unintentional offender, and more stringently with the persistent offender, which seems the right balance.
<P>
Amendment No. 368 would insert ``without reasonable excuse'' into the clause. As worded, the clause would create the absolute offence of placing or maintaining
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a notice containing any false or misleading information likely to deter the public from exercising the right.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I agree that some provision should prevent people from warning others off exercising their legitimate rights, but there may be circumstances in which a landowner has not sought to do that and has nevertheless placed a notice with that effect. The previous clause increased my concerns on that front. It was clear from what the Minister said in reply to my intervention that there was an exercisable duty of care on the part of landowners to prevent someone from coming to grief on their land. One of the ways in which they might reasonably be expected to exercise that duty of care would be to publish warning notices.
<P>
Some landowners may have recourse to lawyers who could advise them on how to word such notices, but I suspect that most will not. With the best of intentions, they may put up a sign intended to warn people of hazards on their land that would deter those who did not know the land from exercising their right of access. It would be perverse if someone were to be prosecuted under those circumstances, and I have reasonable confidence that prosecuting authorities would not bring such a case. However, there will inevitably be a grey area whereby somebody has a reasonable excuse for having put up a notice that deters the public, although the notice was not put up with the intention of unlawfully deterring the public. We have all seen signs saying, ``Beware of the bull'', but perhaps there should be something more subtle. In my part of the world, one would frequently see signs saying, ``Beware of adders''. Adders are not seen as such a threat now, because of better access to antidotes. When I was a child, however, if one saw a sign saying, ``Beware of adders'', one kept clear of the land, as adders were potentially fatal.
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
A landowner exercising his proper duty of care may feel that he must put up signs saying, ``Do not enter—adders''. Is that deterring the public from gaining access to the land? Is the landowner guilty of an offence under the clause? What would happen if there were no adders? Would the landowner be compounding the offence? Alternatively, is he merely misled as to what livestock might be on his land? The Minister should consider the issue of reasonable excuse—[Interruption.] The hon. Member for Mid-Sussex was quoting from a well-known folk song from the county of Somerset, which is not suitable for quoting in public.
<P>
Amendment No. 196 deals with the serial offender—the landowner who simply wants to stop people going on to his land, and uses whatever measures are necessary to do so. Having put up a sign, been convicted, paid the fine and been told to take the sign down, such an offender, after taking it down, immediately puts it up again. Anyone who has been involved in rights of way enforcement and legislation knows that such an offender is too common a species. There are people who lock gates, are told to unlock them and are forced by law to unlock them, but who, a month later, lock them again. An escalator—if that is no longer a rude word in parliamentary circles-might deter such serial offenders. The amendment would ensure that the courts had an enhanced sanction to deal with those who continue, by whatever means is available, to prevent people from coming on to their land. Currently, the sanction does not increase. The person is guilty of an additional offence if he fails to comply with the court, under clause 14(3), but he is not guilty of a greater offence if, having complied with the court, he simply repeats the initial offence. The suggested provision is sensible—it would stop people doing something that we all hope that they will not do—and I ask the Minister to give the amendments due consideration.
<P>
<B>Mr. Llwyd:</B> I shall be brief. I support the ideology behind the amendments. I am also wary of creating absolute offences, when, with the best will in the world, there could be a reasonable excuse. If there were a temporary closure, and, due to inclement weather, lambing or whatever reason, the landowner or occupier forgot to take the sign down—he should have taken it down yesterday, but he forgot—that would be an absolute offence.
<P>
That is not what the law should be aiming for, and it concerns me that such a person would be caught under it. I hope that the law will be used as a power of last resort, because I would not like to see innocent people being prosecuted in that way. It makes room for the conviction of innocent people, it creates an absolute offence and, if there is a reasonable excuse, the law will not recognise it.
<P>
I ask the Minister to think again about imposing that absolute offence regime. I would not support anyone who put up misleading signs; I agree with the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome about the serial transgressor in that respect, and that is why I put my name to his amendment. However, we must be wary of creating absolute offences. There was a farmer in Betws-y-Coed who was regularly upset by people from the village crossing his land. He put up a sign saying, ``Beware Pythonicus Maximus'', and people stopped walking across his land, but now he will be advised to pull that sign down. However, on a serious note, I am concerned about creating absolute offences.

<P>

<B>Mr. Nicholas Soames </B>(Mid-Sussex): Almost for the first time in our proceedings, I disagree with the hon. Gentleman. Although I have seen the pleasing benefit of signs advertising the presence of adders, broken glass, Rottweilers and goodness knows what else, and the salutary effect that those signs have, I have also seen signs to which the public have, rightly, not paid the blindest bit of attention. The mistake of the amendment, however, is that it would create a second offence when there is a perfectly good clause under which any offence can be dealt with.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman raises a good point about farmers who put up signs. One of the disadvantages of the regime is that the uplands in particular will be covered in hideous signs. Because of the Government's stupid refusal to accede on the question of linear access, people will be able to go on to the moor at any point, and signs will have to be placed all along the moor telling them what they may or may not do. I am concerned that farmers, driven mad by the legislation and by all the other things with which they must cope, may innocently forget to take down signs put up for lambing, heather burning or to keep the public away from an area for any other reason. To add amendment No. 196 to the clause would be placing them in double jeopardy and would be surplus, because the offence is already dealt with by the provisions.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Mr. Chris Mullin):</B> As the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome said, there is a balance in the two amendments taken together, with which I have some sympathy. However, I hope to convince him that neither is necessary.
<P>
Amendment No. 368 would mean that an offence would not have been committed if a person could show that he had a reasonable excuse for displaying a misleading notice. It is important that walkers are able to exercise their statutory right without being misled by notices, and I think we would all agree about that. Some may argue that the Bill does not go far enough in preventing misleading information from being given to walkers. The limited provision is intended to ensure that walkers can be reasonably confident that a notice is not giving false information. Those erecting notices will simply need to ensure that the information is correct. If they are uncertain, they should not put up the notice. We believe that that is right. If a notice were put up and there were extenuating circumstances—the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy mentioned a good example of a legitimate notice that is left up inadvertently—a prosecution would be highly unlikely. The hon. Member for Somerton and Frome pointed that out in his opening remarks. Were a prosecution to be brought, any sentence would almost certainly be minimal; probably a conditional discharge.
<P>
I should perhaps add that there is a similar offence in section 57 of the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949 in relation to placing misleading notices on a public path. Prosecutions under the Act are extremely rare. We are anxious to avoid creating a grey area where someone who has put up a notice saying ``Lambing season—Keep out'', deliberately leaves it. That would be hard to prove one way or another. A certain amount of common sense will be required, but where the odd notice is left up it is unlikely that a prosecution would follow if a reasonable explanation were offered.
<P>
Amendment No. 196 suggests that those who are guilty of repeat offences should be subject to heavier penalties. It provides that where a landowner has previously been convicted of displaying a misleading notice on a particular piece of land, any further offences on the same land will be subject to heavier penalties. I understand that the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome wants to introduce a deterrent for those who may be intent on flouting that aspect of the legislation and I have some sympathy with that. However, it is a general principle that the penalty prescribed by law for an offence should be sufficient to provide an appropriate punishment both for a first-„time offence and for a worst-„case scenario.
<P>
Where an offender is brought before the courts on the first occasion on which the offence is committed, the penalty would normally be considerably less than the maximum allowed by law, although that would of course depend on the seriousness of the initial breach. If the offence is repeated, the courts can use their discretion to impose higher penalties up to the maximum. I understand the hon. Gentleman's point that the maximum might be inadequate for that purpose. As a last resort, where it is apparent to the access authority that an offender is determined to flout the law and that the maximum penalty is inadequate as a deterrent, the authority can seek an injunction against the repetition of the offence and breach of the injunction would amount to a contempt of court. The penalties for that are unlimited. That would meet the point that the hon. Gentleman is making.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> I am most grateful to the Minister. He is addressing the amendment properly. However, there is already the implicit assumption in clause 14 that the initial penalty may not be sufficient to deter the offence. Under subsection (3) there is a higher penalty for non-compliance following prosecution. There is some inconsistency in the Minister's approach. If it is necessary to have the higher offence for non-compliance, it should be necessary to have that penalty for future non-compliance, too.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> We anticipate that a modest fine is likely to be imposed for an initial offence. Where the offence is repeated the fine would be a bit less modest, subject to the maximum that is allowed for. If it is clear that the person is determined to flout the law, the access authority can seek an injunction. The penalties for breach of an injunction are unlimited; in other words, they are much higher than those that the hon. Gentleman proposes. We expect that that would carry sufficient weight to deal with the problems that he envisages. That is the reason and I hope that it seems as reasonable to him as it does to me. That is the basis on which I ask him to withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> I thank the Minister for that reply. I do not need to detain the Committee for long. I accept the reasoning in the second part of his answer, although an injunction is a cumbersome mechanism for an access authority, and, as I understand it, a specific action from the accused person is required to justify the injunction. I firmly expect that in those circumstances, the person involved would change the way in which he tried to block access to his land.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
For his ``without reasonable excuse'' argument, the Minister relies entirely on the good sense of the prosecuting authorities. Although I accept that one can normally rely on that good sense, such reliance puts those authorities in some difficulty when a member of the public complains to them that a person has put in place a sign covered by the clause. When the clause creates an absolute offence and an offence has clearly been committed, there is the question of mitigation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> Ordinarily, if a sign is left up accidentally or there is a reasonable explanation, it will be enough merely to draw the sign to the attention of the person who put it up. That person will remove it and the problem will melt away. I do not anticipate that prosecution would be contemplated, unless the person who stuck the notice up declined to co-operate after having the fact that he was acting outwith the law drawn to his attention.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> I hope that the Minister is right, but some members of the rural community can be remarkably obstinate. If they feel that they need to put a sign up because some peril awaits walkers on their land, I can envisage them persisting with the offence, even if they do not intend to contravene the provision. However, I will not pursue that argument further. The Minister has considered the matter, and I hope that he will continue to consider it in the light of what I said. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<H4><center>Rights of access under other enactments</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Damian Green </B>(Ashford): I beg to move amendment No. 377, in page 8, line 28, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) section 19 of the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979 (public access to monuments under public control) applies to it,'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment probes the relationship between access land and existing public access to ancient monuments. As the Minister will be aware, the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979 gives the public access to any monument under the ownership or guardianship of the Secretary of State, English Heritage or a local authority, and access regulations may be made under that Act. Although I am sure that the Committee visualises an ancient monument as a building, many monuments are buried, or situated where the area controlled by that Act goes beyond the curtilage. That word has dominated our debates, but we have not yet discussed the curtilage of buried ancient monuments. I would be interested to hear the Minister's views on that knotty subject.
<P>
If we do not include the amendment, we risk duplication by operating two regimes for the same purpose. It would be better to recognise the specialised rights of access under other legislation than to bring them under the general regime in the Bill. Such a plan would be more sensible and would implement the more clear-cut regime that already operates satisfactorily.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I hope to spare the Committee my detailed views on ancient monuments by saying that the amendment is helpful and provides a solution to a problem on which we have reflected for some time. It would exclude from the new statutory right, any monuments that were in the care of the Secretary of State, English Heritage, or a local authority. Section 19 of the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979 provides for public access to any such monument, subject to the imposition of restrictions as to time of day. It also provides for the exclusion of public access where the Secretary of State, English Heritage or the local authority believe it necessary for the protection of a monument—similar to chapter II directions. We agree that the access provided under the 1979 Act is an enforceable right of access on the part of the public similar to the right of access under the Bill, and that it may well be possible for such monuments to be excluded from the new right of access.
<P>
We would like to consider the amendment further—and we shall do so sympathetically—and return to it on Report. I accordingly ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw it.

<B>Mr. Green:</B> I am grateful for that response. I regret only that we did not have the benefit of the Minister's views on ancient monuments, to which I was greatly looking forward. We accept his response and we are delighted that he is thinking along the same lines as us. In view of his assurance that the Government will return with a similar amendment on Report, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 378, in page 8, line 28, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) it is owned by National Trust,'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take amendment No. 379, in page 8, line 28, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) it is common or commonable land vested in the National Trust,'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I rise with hope—perhaps misplaced from the look on the Minister's face. The amendment raises similar issues to the previous one. We seek to probe the effect of the Bill on National Trust land. We have already talked about the regime under which the National Trust operates. Frankly, it is one of the glories of this country and I doubt whether that would be disputed in Committee. A considerable amount of land that would otherwise fall open under the Bill is already open to the public because of the National Trust.
<P>
The two amendments seek to establish whether National Trust land falls under clause 15 as being accessible by reason of a ``private Act''—the National Trust Act 1907. As we know, the Trust is empowered to maintain and manage open spaces for public recreation. As amendment No. 379 makes clear, much of it is common land. The National Trust is able to make its own byelaws to regulate the use of its land. I know of few complaints, if any, about the way in which the National Trust exercises its stewardship of land. We fear that if the amendments are not accepted, we could be changing a formula that has been shown to be hugely successful for the best part of 100 years. I invite the Minister to consider avoiding any potentially damaging changes to the National Trust's way of operating. Would it not be better to include it in the list of bodies and Acts contained in clause 15, which would allow the National Trust to carry on as it always has—very successfully?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> Would it encourage the hon. Member for Ashford (Mr. Green) to withdraw the amendment if I said that we have consulted the National Trust and it does not want its land to be excluded from the new statutory right and, thus, does not support the amendments?
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> It certainly would, but I should be grateful to know why the National Trust takes such an approach.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> The trust opens much of its land to the public. It is a model in its management of that land, from which others could profitably learn. The obligation under the Bill does not amount to the grant of a clear and permanent right of access to specific trust land. We consider that land owned by the trust should not be excluded from the right of access. The killer point is that the hon. Gentleman wants to assist the National Trust, when it does not wish to be assisted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> It is indeed a killer point. I am not sure that I have received an answer from the Minister to my question, but I am sure that I shall find it out from the National Trust.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I have received a large amount of correspondence from officers and members of the British Horse Society, who I presume have written to all members of the Committee. It is concerned that people may lose riding access to land on which they can currently ride, particularly common land. Mrs. Clarke of Aspley Guise wrote:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Under part I of the Act, I am concerned at the possible loss of riding rights on common land, whether provided under section 193 of the Law of Property Act 1925—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
which is covered under clause 15—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>or by riding taking place at present,<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
which means that members of the British Horse Society wish to preserve the status quo.
<P>
Another member of the society wrote:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Many riders have de facto access to moorland and commons. As the restrictions stand they would be criminalised since no animal other than a dog is allowed under this bill. I would suggest that horses are allowed on existing tracks, after all that is what happened in the past, since the horse was the original means of transport.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Now seems the most appropriate time to raise such issues, given that we are dealing with access under other enactments. There is obviously widespread concern about the implications of the Bill throughout the horse world. I am sure that it is not the Government's intention to reduce access, but I should be grateful if the Minister could deal with the matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I think that I can set the hon. Gentleman's mind at rest. The new statutory right will not apply to those categories of land that he is worried about, which include the so-called urban commons. I say ``so-called'', because that countryside includes large areas of the Lake district and Snowdonia. I hope that members of the Committee do not test me on why such districts should be called urban. The statutory right will apply if
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>an access agreement or access order under Part V of the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949 is in force.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Existing statutory access measures give rise to rights of access that are often subject to fewer restrictions, reduced opportunities for closure and wider rights of recreation than the relatively modest right of access afforded by the Bill.
<P>
For example, the rights awarded under the Law of Property Act 1925 include access for horse riders. We have repeatedly said that we do not wish to reduce existing access opportunities in the countryside, particularly for those on horseback who do not directly benefit from part I of the Bill. According to the advice that I have received, clause 15 protects such rights and does not threaten them in any way.

<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 433, in page 8, line 42, leave out from `person' to `may' in line 43 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`who, in respect of any land, holds—
<P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) a legal term of years absolute of which not less than 90 years remain unexpired,'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 434, 458 and 435.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> This small group of amendments will allow the dedication of access over land under clause 16 by long leaseholders as well as freeholders. Clause 16 is intended to allow landowners who choose to do so—I stress that this is an entirely voluntary measure—to opt in to the statutory right of access. They may do that by executing an instrument of dedication, the form of which will be prescribed by regulations. Once that has been done, the dedicated land will become just like open country or registered common land and subject to the same obligations and restrictions as any other such land.
<P>
We have also made provision in subsection (3) for the person making the dedication to lift any of the restrictions specified in schedule 2 so as to permit, for example, camping on the land or the riding of horses as an integral part of the statutory right of access to that land. Allowing the right of access to be extended to land in this way will, we believe, be of interest to landowners who wish to make a permanent commitment to public access to their land in a way that will bind both themselves and their successors in title.
<P>
Dedications will help to deliver the clarity, certainty and permanence of access that we seek. It will benefit recreational users, who will be able to find out about new permanent opportunities for walking and, in some cases, other recreational opportunities. The amendments will extend the power to dedicate to others with an interest in the land, including those with a leasehold interest with an unexpired term of at least 90 years. In such cases the dedication will last only for the term of the lease.
<P>
The Secretary of State will be able to make regulations to prescribe the consents that will be required of others with an interest in the land. So, for example, where the freeholder wishes to dedicate land that is subject to a lease, the leaseholder may be required to join in making the dedication or consent to it and regulations will prescribe the form that such joining, or consent, must take. We believe that this is a valuable and useful addition to the statutory right of access in part I. I commend the amendments to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> My response to the Minister is brief and appreciative. He has rightly sought to enhance the opportunity for voluntary access. That is entirely sensible. We shall come to some other amendments that we have tabled in a few moments. My only question on this group—the answer may be blatantly obvious, although not to me—is why 90 years? I appreciate the need for some figure, but it is an interesting one to have chosen.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for giving way. I am not about to give him the answer. I leave that to the Minister. The Minister asserted that the leaseholder can make the dedication only for the period of the lease, which is sensible. It is not obvious from the amendment as drafted that there is a provision that backs up the Minister's assertion. I should be grateful if he would point it out to me.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> My hon. Friend was perceptive enough to find another question for the Minister—[Interruption.] We shall require an answer. I have asked why the figure should be 90, and my hon. Friend asked where in the amendments it is made clear that people other than leaseholder must be taken into consideration. The Minister may wish to respond to those questions.

<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I apologise to the hon. Gentleman. During the Easter recess I undertake to engage in a technological exercise to shift the alarm on my watch.
<P>
The hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire asked about 90 years. I am advised that that is a sufficiently long period. I presume that 80, 100, 70 or 110 years would equally be a sufficiently long period, but we chose 90 years. It is relatively arbitrary, but it is intended to exclude those who have a short lease; it is no more than that.

The answer to the question asked by the hon. Member for Ashford is clause 16(2)(b), which provides for regulations to specify who has to give consent. I hope that my answers provide a general contentment with the proposal.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> The amendments build on the principle that the Minister established in earlier amendments: to encourage more land to be opened up and dedicated as access land under clause 16.
<P>
Amendment No. 323 moves the ball park; it is very different from the proposal for 90 years, which is why I challenged the Minister about that period. My amendment refers to a 10-year period, the principle for which is straightforward. Ninety years is a very long time; it means at least two generations of ownership and possibly three or four. It is also a long period in which to forecast land management. The previous 90 years includes two world wars. During the second world war, vast areas of the open country referred to in the Bill were ploughed up for food production. That was followed by the Labour Government's Agriculture Act 1947, which brought in the concept of price support to increase sustainability.
<P>
I do not suggest that we will go through such experiences again, but I use those examples to show that 90 years is an extremely long time. If we want people to dedicate their land, I question whether such a long period is right. My contention is that people are much more likely to dedicate land for 10 years than for 90 years, which is likely to mean in perpetuity. The amendments would allow voluntary dedications under clause 16 to be made in a way that is revocable or of limited fashion. I am sure that both sides of the Committee want voluntary dedication—public access to land that will not otherwise be opened up under the Bill—to be encouraged. However, dedication will be discouraged if landowners see that it is being given away in perpetuity. I do not want to revisit the arguments we had this morning about property rights, and whether they are being given up.
<P>
In relation to other legislation, if the intention is to promote voluntary provision, and extreme levels of security are introduced for those who utilise the provision, that has a discouraging effect. For reasons with which the Committee is fully familiar, the Rent Acts introduced extreme protection for tenants, but, as a result, the supply of private housing to let dried up. In relation to agricultural land, when the Labour Government of 1976 introduced the right of succession to farm tenancy, it increased security for the tenant but resulted in far fewer opportunities. The more that one tries to ensure long-term arrangements, the more likely it is that one will discourage the arrangement in the first place. The purpose of the amendments is to encourage more landowners to dedicate their land under clause 16, albeit for a much shorter period than that envisaged by the Government. Access, even for 10 years—which may be repeatable—provides an opportunity for landowners if a change of approach to ownership or land management is required. I hope that the Minister will respond positively to such a constructive way of trying to encourage more landowners to dedicate their land.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I appreciate the points made by the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire, but extensive provisions already exist for anyone who wishes to dedicate land in the short term. The purpose of clause 16 is to ensure permanent access to the countryside, especially to land that would not otherwise qualify as open country or registered common land—[Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am grateful for the Minister's swift action.
<P>
<B>Mr. Soames:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Stevenson. Will you join me, in deprecating this further evidence of control freakery? The Minister is capable of making his own mind up.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> That is not a point of order. In the circumstances, however, I am sure it is relevant.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> If it is a comfort to you, Mr. Stevenson, I lack a pager and a mobile telephone. It has not so far caused me difficulty.
<P>
<B>Mr. Soames:</B> It will.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> Perhaps that is a dangerous assertion.
<P>
Clause 16 is not intended to be a mechanism for short-term access agreements between the landowner and third parties. There is already extensive provision for these, including that in section 39 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, and under the countryside stewardships scheme.
<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Amendment No. 323 would provide for fixed-term dedications of 10 years or more. The other amendments would allow dedications to be revocable at some future time as well as in perpetuity. Other options are already available to landowners who wish to pursue short-term agreements to allow people access to their land. The clause is about giving long-term protection to rights of access over land. Government amendments Nos. 433 and 458 will permit a lessee of land who has a lease of at least 90 years to make a dedication for the duration of the unexpired lease. In such cases, the dedication will have effect for a substantial period of at least 90 years and it makes sense to apply the dedicated system of management that the Bill provides. Where landowners wish to open their land to access for a limited period, they will frequently do so in response to grants or incentives offered in consideration of that access and other obligations entered into.
<P>
My right hon. Friend the Minister or State has mentioned the countryside stewardship scheme, which is managed by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. There is also the woodland grant scheme which is operated by the Forestry Commission. Clause 16 was not drafted in terms such an agreement and without an irrevocable commitment, this may be done on a voluntary basis, as now.
<P>
<B>Miss McIntosh:</B> The Minister omitted to mention the rural development regulations which have been referred to. Does he accept that landowners could apply to that fund also?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> Landowners can take a number of routes if they wish to dedicate their land in the short term, but clause 16 is not one of them, as it is intended to deal with the long term.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> The Minister is right to say that there are a number of schemes, most of which are operated by MAFF, that provide for short-term access. However, the emphasis is on the short term. We do not know the duration of the schemes. Most are for five years. Some are for 10 years and, in one or two instances, for 20 years. However, there is a huge gulf between that and 90 years, which was established previously. Given the type of land in question, some landowners may not even be eligible for the schemes because some of them are wholly irrelevant for open countryside. Such landowners would be prepared to dedicate their land but do not want to bind their heirs and successors for ever and a day with that commitment. I should have thought that a justifiable case could be made for a period of considerably less than 90 years. The Minister is adopting extreme short-term and long-term approaches without the good old British compromise of going somewhere in the middle to encourage people to open up their land. However, that is a point for another day. I am sure that the Minister will examine ways of encouraging more dedication because it fits alongside his own motivation. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Amendment made:
<P>
No. 458, in page 9, line 1, leave out subsection (2) and insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(2) Where any person other than the person making the dedication holds—
<P>
(a) any leasehold interest in any of the land to be dedicated, or

<B>Mr. Green:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 371, in page 9, line 10, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`or extending'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 380, in page 9, line 15, after `exclude', insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`or include'.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Green:</B> The amendment continues the debate about the way in which we, through the Bill, can encourage the voluntary dedication of land for access. After the debate on the previous set of clauses, Conservative Members and the Minister can now feel comfortable in our customary positions. The Minister said earlier that he was the deregulatory member of the Committee; we will continue to propose increased flexibility for dedication of access. If he continues to refuse that, we shall both be comfortable. We will be flexible and deregulatory; he will be inflexible and more regulatory than us.
<P>
We seek greater flexibility over restrictions in making and amending dedications. Although access would be desirable and practical for some land, there may be particular issues that are not covered by the general restrictions. Amendment No. 371 would allow these to be dealt with at the outset of the dedication. Landowners would then know what restrictions there were and be encouraged to go down the voluntary dedication route.
<P>
Amendment No. 380 gives flexibility in amending the restrictions after the dedication has been made. As it stands at present, clause 16(3)(c) only allows amendments that exclude the application of restrictions. Ministers have already recognised in schedule 2(6), and in the debate on that provision, that a decision to exclude restrictions may have to be revoked or modified. Access land dedicated voluntarily should be subject to flexibility, which if the Minister wishes to encourage dedication of access, should be vested in the owner. As it stands, the flexibility of schedule 2 may apply, but it is at the discretion of the countryside body or the national park authority. It is self evident that if flexibility can be extended to owners of the land, more of them will feel inclined to go down the voluntary dedication route and no doubt all members of the Committee consider that to be desirable.

<P>

<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> We are in favour of flexibility, but not of introducing any loopholes into the arrangement that has been so carefully crafted. These two amendments would interfere with the fundamental principles underlying the statutory right of access under the Bill: the requirements for quality, permanence, clarity and certainty.
<P>
Amendment No. 371 would allow an instrument of dedication of access land, under clause 16, to modify schedule 2, so that the restrictions over that land would be greater than those prevailing elsewhere. My right hon. Friend the Minister of State and I have described the right of access under the Bill as modest. It is already subject to a large number of restrictions, set out in schedule 2, as well as the provision for exclusions and restrictions provided for in Chapter II. The amendment would risk rendering the right of access over dedicated land barely worth having. The owner would be able to place whatever restrictions he chose on those exercising their right of access. I shall not try the patience of the Committee by going over the long list of attempts to add to schedule 2 that we went through some weeks ago, but it should suffice to say that to permit this would offend against the minimum standards that we have set in the Bill.
<P>
We have no objection to landowners voluntarily welcoming the public onto their land on whatever terms they choose. However, we do not intend that that will be treated in the same way as the statutory right of access. Clause 16 therefore provides that on a dedication of land, the restrictions in schedule 2 should be capable of exclusion from operation over that land, but not of extension.
<P>
Amendment No. 380 would also have regrettable consequences. It would allow a dedication to be modified subsequently, not only to exclude the operation of any of the restrictions under schedule 2, but to include any restrictions that had been omitted from the original dedication.
<P>
As I explained earlier, the purpose of clause 16 is to allow the voluntary permanent dedication of access over land, which will be binding on the landowner and his successors. Those who wish to open up their land for a limited period may continue to do so, but not under the Bill. In making a dedication, a landowner may choose to exclude the operation of any of the restrictions in schedule 2 so as to allow access on horseback—I know that the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire is in favour of that—as well as on foot, for example.
<P>
By including provision for the landowner or his successors to revoke such modifications, the permanence of these new rights would be lost and the right of access would be no different in practice from any other voluntary access concession for riders, canoeists and so forth, which may be withdrawn at a moment's notice. I therefore ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> The Minister was given a choice in this and the previous group of amendments between certainty and flexibility. He has decided against flexibility—
<P>
<B>Mr. Soames:</B> Again.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Indeed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> In favour of certainty.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Yes, but in favour to some extent of the certainty of less access being granted, which is regrettable. Greater flexibility in clause 16 would provide greater access. The Minister has repeated that the clause is not about that. I suggest that it should be in order to achieve more voluntary dedication of access land. Nevertheless, I heard what the Minister said and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Amendment made: No. 435, in page 9, line 20, after `and' insert `subject to subsection (2B)'.—[Mr. Meacher.]
<P>
<B>Mr. David Kidney </B>(Stafford): I beg to move amendment No. 359, in page 9, line 24, at end add—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) A dedication under this section does not constitute a disposal or disposition of land for any statutory purpose.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take amendment No. 360 in page 9, line 24, at end add—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) Where the trustees or governing body of a charity properly and reasonably believe that a dedication under this section of land owned by the charity would not prejudice fulfilment of the charity's objects—
<P>
(a) the charity shall have power to make such a dedication; and
<P>
(b) any such dedication shall not be deemed ultra vires the powers and objects of the charity.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Kidney:</B> My first amendment probes the Minister on whether he has considered the possible bureaucratic obstructions to dedications by certain landowners—local authorities and charitable trusts, for example. Has he also considered potential obstructions from other legislation? Has the clause been drafted to take account of those problems?
<P>
If a local authority makes a disposal of land, it will generally be under a duty to obtain the best consideration for that disposal. Local government legislation on disposal includes the creation of any right. It could be argued that a dedication creates a new right to permanent access to open land. It is difficult to understand how a local authority, faced with having to obtain the best consideration for the creation of a new right, would be able to carry out the dedication at all. It could well be stymied.
<P>
In the case of a charitable trust making a disposition of land, a formal statutory procedure has to be followed. A disposition again includes the grant of an interest in or right over land. The question arises whether a dedication for the purposes of the clause would be a disposition. The simplest way of overcoming such problems would be to make it clear that a dedication would not be a disposal or a disposition for those statutory purposes. Amendment No. 359 would provide for that.
<P>
Amendment No. 360 deals with the powers of the trustees in the charitable trust example. What the trusts can and cannot do is governed entirely by the trustees. When the rights of the trustees were drawn up however many years ago, this particular right and the dedication granted in the Bill may not have been anticipated. If no provision is made for trustees, nothing can be done. Sometimes land might already be in use informally for access, or it could be eminently suitable for access and the trustees wish to grant it, but they cannot do so because of the strict wording of provisions for trustees. Amendment No. 360 would allow a charity to dedicate access rights over its land, as long as the trustees judged that that did not conflict with any of their duties due to the charity's objects.
<P>
I commend both amendments to my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary, and would like to hear that he has considered the obstacles that I have mentioned. I thank the Countryside Agency for its assistance with formulating the amendments.
<P>
<H5>7 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Mullin:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford (Mr. Kidney) for that explanation of the amendments. I am as keen as he is to see sensible use made of the power to dedicate land to public access. When public or corporate bodies such as charities hold land that might reasonably be open to the public, I agree that it would be a pity if the rules governing such bodies were an unnecessary obstacle to their making dedications.
<P>
Amendment No. 359 would try to deal with the issue by providing that a dedication was not a disposal or a disposition for any statutory purpose. I understand that disposition is the word used in charities law for what is otherwise known as a disposal; I think that we are disappearing into the undergrowth. There is a general question about whether a dedication under the clause is a disposal or disposition, and there are specific questions about the implications of clause 16 for the transactions of certain types of bodies. I take my hon. Friend's point, which is that clarity is desirable, and I am willing to give further thought to the principle underlying amendment No. 359.
<P>
Amendment No. 360 seeks to ensure that the rules governing charities' actions do not stand in the way of their dedicating land to public access, even if that is not one of their objectives. I am advised that charities already have some freedom in that respect. In general, a charity's trustees can already take actions that they believe are in the best interests of the charity, as long as those actions are consistent with the charity's constitutional objects and powers. Trustees can make a dedication if they can justify that it is in the best interests of the charity. However, I would be unwilling to go further by, in effect, changing the constitutional objects and powers of charities. To take an extreme and unlikely example, I do not believe that the Bill should enable a charity to dedicate land to public access when the charity's constitution expressly forbids it.
<P>
We sympathise with the objectives behind amendment No. 360, but cannot include it in the Bill. However, we will consider amendment No. 359 further.
<P>
<B>Mr. Kidney:</B> My hon. Friend's answer to amendment No. 359 is encouraging and I shall be happy to withdraw it, given that he will consider it further. Perhaps I shall make a proposal more to his liking later on.
<P>
The Charity Commission can ignore the statutory procedure under the charities legislation to which I referred if that is stated in a specific Act. The purpose of amendment No. 360 was to make the Bill state that. I hope that my hon. Friend will consider those narrow and technical points further. Like him, I believe that dedication is a good deed and should be encouraged. I would not like to think that people are discouraged because it is too much trouble. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
