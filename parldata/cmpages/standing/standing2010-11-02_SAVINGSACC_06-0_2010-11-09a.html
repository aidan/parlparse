                        <p class="tabbed">Before
the break we were discussing amendment 23, which provides that formal
consultation be undertaken with the Welsh Assembly Government, the
Scottish Parliament and the Northern Ireland Executive before the
implementation of clause 1. I indicated why I felt it important to
discuss the matter with the National Assembly for Wales, which will
contribute an additional top-up to the child trust fund of some
£50 in 2010-11 for children who were born in the defined period,
have a trust fund account and are resident in Wales on a given date.
There is a further top-up of £100 for children who are claiming
free school meals, or are in receipt of child tax credit or other
benefits, which I listed.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000012">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Focusing
on the National Assembly for Wales, it is important to ask the Minister
what formal consultation has taken place, not just at official level,
but at ministerial level. Several issues bear consideration in relation
to the impact on the National Assembly of clause 1, not least of which
is the impact on its continuing to contribute the £50 and
£100 to child trust funds after 3 January 2011.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000013">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
refer the Minister to the proceedings of the National Assembly for
Wales on 16 June 2010, when Jane Hutt, who is the Minister for Business
and Budget in Wales indicated her concern that the reduction and
stopping of all Government contributions to child trust funds would
have a dramatic effect. In the Record from that date, she
stated:<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000014">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“That
will affect around 32,000 children in Wales annually, who will miss out
on a child trust fund account altogether, as well as at least 135,000
children who will now not receive the additional UK Government
contribution at the age of seven. The greatest effect will be felt by
those who are already living in relative
poverty.”<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000575">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>Her
contribution leads me to believe that the National Assembly for Wales
wishes the child trust fund to continue, because it is contributing,
and the fund is a valuable asset in Wales that is helping to achieve

discussions with the Minister in the Assembly? If so, it might help the
debate if he let me know so that we can decide whether to continue
discussing such
matters.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000015">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> We have had discussions with both the Minister and
her officials in Wales and it is clear that the Welsh Assembly
Government can continue to make payments into child trust funds for
some time to come, because they make such payments at school age. It
will also be open to the Welsh Assembly Government to continue to make
payments into the junior ISA if they choose to do
so.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000018">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am grateful to the Financial Secretary. Those
contributions will help. I do not know whether the consultations were
formal and whether there has been a formal decision from the Assembly.
The Financial Secretary has mentioned the junior ISA, but as yet, even
Committee members do not know what its final format will be, which is
why the amendment is drafted as it is. The provisions under clause 1
will come into effect on 3 January 2011. The National Assembly for
Wales does not yet know—neither do we—the position with
regard to the junior
ISA.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000019">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
am asking not that the Minister stops his policy objective, but that
before he implements the provisions in clause 1, there should be formal
consultation with the Welsh Assembly, Scottish Parliament and Northern
Ireland Executive. That seems perfectly fair because, for example, when
the junior ISA is finally developed, it might be something that they
wish to have a view on; I will elaborate in a moment. It seems to me
that the Minister could continue the provisions of the child trust fund
for eight, nine or 10 months until the junior ISA is in place, so that
the Welsh Assembly, Scottish Parliament and Northern Ireland Executive
can have a view on that and other matters.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000020">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Let
me explain why, with the junior ISA. I have figures about the take-up
of the current child trust fund with the National Assembly for Wales,
the Scottish Parliament and the Northern Ireland Executive, which I
will try to share with the Committee. I will compare them with a random
borough and constituency, say Fareham, where there is an 83.5% take-up
of the child trust fund before the automatic trigger comes into play
and the state opens the trust fund for individuals. In none of the
constituencies or boroughs in Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland does
take-up occur at anywhere near that level. It is 70.2% in Aberdeen, 78%
in Aberdeenshire, 75% in Angus, 69.5% in Clackmannan and 67% in East
Ayrshire. In Wales, it is 67.8% in Blaenau Gwent, 74.4% in my own area
in Flintshire, and 80.5% in Powys, which is relatively high, but still
not as high as in the Minister’s constituency. In Northern
Ireland, the figure is 68.3% in Ards, and 54.8% in Antrim, which is a
very low figure; it is 58% in Strabane, and around 68.8% in Down, in
the area of my hon. Friend the Member for South Down. I could give all
the figures if I wanted to filibuster, but I do
not.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000021">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
am simply making the point that if there is an 83.5% take-up in Fareham
of the child trust fund opened by parents, compared with a figure as
low as 54% in Strabane or Ards in Northern Ireland, or the lower
figures in Wales, it may be interpreted in a number of ways, but it
tells me that the chances of a junior ISA being opened and parents
choosing to contribute to it would be higher in Fareham than they would
be in Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland. It would be worth while for
the Minister, before he implements the legislation, formally to ask for
the views of the Executives in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales
about the figures and how we can make the junior ISA work better. If it
is the case that clause 1 ends the child trust fund, I want the junior
ISA to become a success and parents to try to contribute to it. If
there is low take-up by parents of the current child trust
fund—although there is 100% take-up, there is still low initial
take-up by parents in opening the accounts in some areas—and in
every county, constituency and borough in Scotland, Northern Ireland
and Wales, it is lower than it is in Fareham, I want to see how we can
generate take-up and ensure that we do that. The partners in the
Executives of all three devolved Administrations will be keen to do
that.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000024">&#160;</a>

the issues raised by the Minister regarding the pupil premium, there is
an important point about how it is implemented in Scotland, Wales and
Northern Ireland; we touched on it briefly before lunch. The Minister
has made great play of the fact that the pupil premium exists and is a
substitute for action on the poorest third of children in our
community. I am pleased that my hon. Friend the Member for South Down,

were full and frank discussions with the three devolved Administrations

whether they will use it. He should know whether the pupil premium will
be in place in, say, the constituency of Wirral South, which I can see
from my bedroom window a mile across the River Dee, but not in place in
my constituency of Delyn, which is directly opposite. My hon. Friend
the Member for Wirral South might have a pupil premium and I might not,

simply say to the Financial Secretary that the amendment would give him
an opportunity to discuss in detail with Scotland, Wales and Northern
Ireland those and other issues, such as the implementation of the
junior ISA, and disability questions, which are largely devolved
matters in the three areas. He would be able to have discussions with
the Administrations before he abolishes the child trust fund. Whatever
discussions he has had, a range of issues have been thrown up by this
debate alone, so there needs to be further discussion. I would say, if
I may be so honest, that if he gets his clause and abolishes the child
trust fund, by all means let him do it, but let it be at a time when he
has formally discussed the implications of that abolition with all the
devolved
Administrations.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000031">&#160;</a>

morning, the Financial Secretary said that he believes local
authorities could contribute to the junior ISA for looked-after
children. I recall that local government is devolved in Northern
Ireland, Scotland and Wales, so it is important that he discusses with
Ministers for local government in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales
what the impact would be of local councils’ donating resources
to looked-after children. I do not know if he has done that to date; he
may want to tell the Committee whether he has met the three local
government Ministers to discuss that issue, or whether he has had
representations from them. He raised those issues this morning, and I
think he should discuss them with the three devolved
Administrations.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000032">&#160;</a>

make the same point in relation to tackling child poverty in Scotland,
on which my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh East may wish to
comment. There are proposals before the Scottish Executive to produce
by April 2011 the Scottish implementation plan and strategy for the
Scottish response to the UK Child Poverty Act 2010. That Act created
statutory responsibilities for England, Scotland and Northern Ireland
to meet targets to tackle poverty and the 2020 goal of eradicating
child poverty. My hon. Friends and I, and indeed, the witnesses,
believe that the abolition of the child trust fund will increase
inequalities in our society. Has Financial Secretary discussed the 2010
Act with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, and will the abolition
of the fund make harder their task of eradicating child poverty in the
three devolved regions?<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000033">&#160;</a>

are many areas of extreme poverty in England, and my hon. Friends
represent some of them. Having been a Northern Ireland Minister for two
years, I know that it has areas of extreme poverty. I can go to parts
of Belfast West, Foyle, Strabane, and Belfast North and parts of the
constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for South Down and see
poverty that is greater than in England. The Minister could accompany
me to the south Wales valleys to see the poverty that exists there and
the challenges that people face. There are different extremes of
poverty in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. I accept that places
such as West Ham and your constituency of Knowsley, Mr Howarth, have
areas of extreme poverty. However, I contend that the level of poverty
is proportionally higher in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The
Minister has a duty to consider the implications of abolition on
looked-after children, the poorest third, disabled children and others
in each of the devolved Administration
areas.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000034">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Has
the Minister met Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish nationalist Deputy First
Minister who has a responsibility for child poverty in Scotland? Has he
had representations from the Scottish Executive on these issues? Will
he, prior to the abolition of the child trust fund, discuss the issues
with her? Has he met Alex Attwood, the Member of the Legislative
Assembly who has taken over from my hon. Friend the Member for South
Down? She was previously a Minister in the Department for Social
Development, which has devolved responsibility for the child benefit
system, child support, housing and other issues, all of which will feel
the impact of child trust fund abolition and the wider poverty issues.
That is worth discussing. Indeed, I have before me information dated 3
November. I looked up whether Alex Attwood had formally met the
Minister—I googled that this very day. The answer was no, he had
not, but he had met the Minister of State, Department for Work and
Pensions, the right hon. Member for Epsom and Ewell (Chris Grayling) to
discuss the impact on employment. If Mr Attwood had met the
Minister, he would have put something out, as he did about his meeting
with the right hon. Member for Epsom and Ewell. I wonder whether Mr
Attwood has met the Financial Secretary to discuss these issues. My
hon. Friend the Member for South Down indicates that he has not. In the
evidence, it was very clear that some of the issues in the
Bill—not just the clause that we are debating—are
extremely important in Northern Ireland, and I hope that the Minister
will look at all those issues in
detail.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000035">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Finally,
the amendment is important because the Welsh Assembly has budgeted for
allocating this resource in addition to the child trust fund. It did so
in good faith. It believed the Minister’s manifesto commitment
before the election. The Northern Ireland Assembly and the Scottish
Parliament would also have believed that manifesto commitment. On 6
October 2009, the Chancellor of the Exchequer said in a speech that is
on the Conservative party

                        <p class="tabbed">There
has been long-term planning for child trust funds not only by the
Treasury but by the Welsh Assembly Government, who invested time and
money in developing a scheme, and by the Northern Ireland Executive and
the Scottish Parliament, which have targets to reduce poverty. Frankly,
the Minister should formally consult them before implementation, given
all the things that we have said today on the new ISAs, disability and
looked-after children. I want to ensure that all those issues are
sorted out between the three devolved Administrations, who have a key
role in helping to meet child poverty targets, and who will have a key
view on whether the child trust fund abolition will help meet them.
What type of discussions has the Minister had with the devolved
Administrations? What was the quality of those discussions, and what
feedback has he received? Does he intend to discuss with them the
matters that he has considered since meeting them, such as child ISAs,
disability living allowance and looked-after children, before
implementation?<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000039">&#160;</a>

are 36 neighbourhood renewal areas in Northern Ireland, which are
defined by the Noble statistics on deprivation. Over the past few
years, we have tried to alleviate poverty in Northern Ireland by
directing funding to those areas on a cross-departmental basis. I am
led to believe that the Northern Ireland Executive, of whom I used to
be a member, were not consulted about the abolition of child trust
funds. There is considerable concern given that it is an area with high
levels of deprivation. Was the Northern Ireland Commissioner for
Children and Young People consulted about the legislation? That post is
dedicated to addressing the needs of

is interesting that children’s funds were established in the

recognise the issue of parity, it is possible to exercise flexibility

particular needs of rural areas, perhaps relating to
inaccessibility.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000044">&#160;</a>

is vital in taking account of the more acute levels of poverty. It is
also important to address the particular needs of a region that is
coming out of conflict. We are dealing with a legacy of nigh on 40
years of conflict and violence. The levels of deprivation are higher in
areas of conflict. My right hon. Friend highlighted areas where the
dependence on free school meals, benefits and other measures associated
with poverty is much greater. There is a need for consultation with the
Northern Ireland Executive, who are trying to address not only the
levels of poverty, but the legacy of conflict. There is a need to
underpin the new devolutionary measures in Northern Ireland and the new
institutions of Government. One way to do that is to undertake the
necessary consultation on the abolition of the child trust fund, and on
the Government’s proposals to replace it. I therefore support

are devolved, which may happen in the future—I understand that
the Government are committed to implementing the recommendations of the
Calman report—receives a set amount of money from Westminster.
Changes that are made in Westminster directly affect what is happening
in Scotland. Yes, the Scottish Government have the ability to decide
within that overall package how it is split up, but the fundamental
decision on that total amount is very important.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000047">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
important as that total funding package is the impact of changes in
provisions, which in this case come from the Treasury, but in other
cases will come from the Department for Work and Pensions. What happens
here will have an impact. The Scottish Government may take a different
view, as other devolved Administrations have, of how they want to set
about dealing with child poverty, but it is important first to have
advanced notice of what may be happening, to be able to plan and to
have consultation. That is not taking place, which is
regrettable.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000048">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">If
the Government are committed to retaining the Union, and do not want to
see further pressure from Scotland for independence, they are going
absolutely the wrong way about it. We heard a lot about the respect
agenda for the devolved Administrations initially, but in measure after
measure we find that there has been little consultation and opportunity
for those Administrations to come forward and say, “That
doesn’t work, here is our other proposal”, or,
“What can we work out to make this work better for us.”
It has not taken place here and it does not take place in other
measures. We are treading dangerous political ground if we keep that
up.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000049">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Given
that there are implications, it may be that the Barnett consequentials
of increased spending, which may come through in the pupil premium in
England,

                           </div>will affect Scotland. That may be the case, although I understand that
overall the pupil premium is likely to be a substitute for other
elements of education spending in England, in which case there will be
no Barnett consequential. That is what we need to know and that is
exactly what the Scottish Parliament needs to know. In that respect, I
urge the Minister to accept the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000050">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship,
Mr Howarth. Let us be clear about the measures in front of us today and
their relationship to the devolution settlement. The balance of the UK
Government’s and the devolved Administrations’ roles and
responsibilities is clearly set out in the devolution settlement. Child
trust funds are a reserved UK-wide matter and therefore lie within the
competence of Parliament. Given that, a formal consultation process
with the devolved Administrations would not be appropriate. I do not
believe that a requirement for that should be set out in legislation.
As I said in an intervention on the right hon. Member for Delyn, the
Welsh Assembly Government have been in contact with me about the
abolition of the child trust fund, but neither the Northern Ireland
Executive nor the Scottish Government have been.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000051">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
will continue to work with the devolved Administrations to ensure that
they are aware of the Government’s plans, including how they
might impact on individual Administrations’ current practices.
My officials are happy to talk to their counterparts about it, and they
have been in contact with the Welsh Assembly Government in particular.
That Government will be the most directly affected devolved
Administration because, unlike the Scottish Government or the Northern
Ireland Executive, they make payment into CTFs for children living in
Wales. What happens with those payments is entirely a matter for the
Welsh Assembly Government. As I have said, they are currently made to
Welsh children entering primary school and they will continue to be
made for several years. It will be possible for the Welsh Assembly
Government to make payments into junior
ISAs.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000052">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Let
me deal with whether CTF abolition will make child poverty targets
harder to meet. That matter has cropped up a couple of times in our
discussions. The reality is that, because child poverty targets are
measured on household income, CTFs fall outside that calculation. They
are deemed to be locked up until a child is 18 and are therefore not
part of the calculation of child poverty. As I have said several times,
delaying the end of eligibility for child trust funds would mean
additional costs of up to £20 million a year if eligibility were
to continue until April 2011, for example. If we accept the amendment,
we would delay the date of abolition. That would not be a good use of
taxpayers’ funds, particularly given that it is a United Kingdom
matter not a matter for devolved Administrations. If the right hon.
Gentleman chooses to press the amendment to a Division, I will ask my
hon. Friends to oppose
it.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000053">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> That was short and sweet. I thank the Minister.
Our discussions are greatly appreciated, but I do not accept his
assessment. I fully accept that we are debating a non-devolved matter.
As a Member of this House, I want clarity about what is a UK-reserved 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 209<a class="bkMark" name="Column209">&#160;</a>
                           </div>matter and what are devolved matters for the Welsh Assembly Government,
the Scottish Parliament and the Northern Ireland Executive. I drafted
the amendments in such a way because the devolved Administration in
Wales have made a commitment to fund additional payments to the child
trust fund for the future. I am still not clear about matters. I might
be at fault, but perhaps the Minister can clarify whether the Welsh
Assembly Government could set up a fund for children born post-3
January 2011. I suspect that, under clause 1, they could
not.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000054">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> To be clear again and as I said in my remarks, the
Welsh Assembly Government could continue to put money into junior ISAs
for children in Wales. I said that in the context of local authorities,
and the children in their care. The same applies to the Welsh Assembly
Government. Third parties will be able to contribute to
children’s ISAs so that children born after 3 January 2011 who
live in Wales could, if the Welsh Assembly Government chose to spend
their money in that way, receive a contribution from them into their
junior
ISA.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000055">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am grateful to the Minister. I understood the
junior ISA point. All I wanted to know was whether, if the child trust
fund is abolished from 3 January as is set out in clause 1, there was
still scope for the Welsh Assembly Government to contribute money to a
new child trust fund. The only option for the Welsh Assembly Government
to consider as part of their budget considerations is whether they wish
to put money into a junior ISA—a tax-free saving vehicle for
those who happen to pay tax. It would not be a universal payment, as
the child trust fund payment is. The Welsh Assembly Government will
have to consider and examine whether they wish to continue their
contribution, based on the revised
discussions.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000056">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
do not want to be repetitive, because we can fill our discussion time
until 4 o’clock on Thursday without my needing to repeat myself,
but we do not yet know the form of the new ISA. The Minister has not
yet been able to come to us today and say, “This is what the new
junior ISA looks like, this is what we have consulted on, this is its
final form, this is the capped level, this is how contributions are
made.” There are a whole range of issues that we do not yet
know. According to the Minister’s own press release, which we
discussed in an earlier sitting, the junior ISA, which is to replace
the child trust fund, will not be in place probably until October next
year, although admittedly it will be backdated to 3
January.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000057">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
Minister is asking the Welsh Assembly Government to take budgetary
decisions in two weeks’ time on whether they wish to continue a
£50 or £100 contribution without formal consultation,
without knowing what the junior ISA is or how the backdating mechanism
will work, and without their having yet decided whether they wish to
continue that funding at a time when they are losing £1 billion
because of the comprehensive spending review settlement. The Minister
argues that, to compensate for poverty, the pupil premium will be put
in place, yet the Welsh Assembly Government  are already losing
£1 billion of resources from the

                        <p class="tabbed">My
hon. Friend the Member for South Down has made valid points about the
levels of poverty in the north of Ireland. There are real levels of
poverty in Northern Ireland. That is in addition to the higher levels
of poverty that we have in other parts of the United Kingdom, for the
very reasons she mentioned. I was a Northern Ireland Office Minister
for two years, and I would meet people who were the children and
grandchildren of poverty. They were poverty-linked because of the
difficulties with the troubles in the late ’60s and early
’70s. There was inter-religious and inter-community violence for
many years, which has added to the poverty and the lack of investment
in the area. The child trust fund, as a cross-community and
cross-religion asset-building base, would have been particularly
valuable in helping people when they reached the age of
18.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000059">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Again,
I would not expect the Minister to spend the Northern Ireland
Executive’s resource on their behalf, but I would expect him to
discuss with them their challenging issues of poverty and what role the
child trust fund played in that regard. A similar argument applies for
Scotland. I am afraid that I am not happy with the Minister’s
response. We need formal consultation and, in the interests of ensuring
that the devolved Administrations get that, I would like to press the
amendment to a

undertake by 3 January 2012 a formal review of section 1 of the Savings
Accounts and Health in Pregnancy Grant Bill and the Child Trust Funds
(Amendment No. 3) Regulations
2010.’.<p class="tabbed">I
hope that the amendment, which I have moved to secure discussion of the
issues, can be accepted by the Minister. Again, it may not be perfectly
formed, and he may want to talk about the way in which we have crafted
it, but surely the principle is right. We are not denying the Minister
any legislative competencies under the order that we agreed on, I
think, 20 July—that order reduced the payments for the child
trust fund. We are not asking him to not abolish the child trust fund
under clause 1. What we are asking him to do through the 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 211<a class="bkMark" name="Column211">&#160;</a>
                           </div>amendment is simply look in 12 months’ time at what the
implications are, and produce a report for the House and the public at
large on how well it is all going, as I am sure it will be going very
well at that particular point in time.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000084">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
starting point for the amendment is that we are looking at the
situation from 3 January 2011. Let me remind the Committee of what that
will be. All Government contributions to child trust funds will have
ended. The eligibility of children born after that date will have been
scrapped. That means that there will be no £50 for every
child—or no £250 before the Child Trust Funds (Amendment
No. 3) Regulations 2010—no £50 top-up for the poorest, no
top-up for disabled people, and no additional payments for children in
care. It means none of the payments for seven-year-olds that were put
in place before the regulations, and it potentially means that we will
have a new child ISA in place at some point in 2011, but on what date
we do not yet know. It also means that current providers will have
provided, for 12 months, a child trust fund for people who
were eligible before the abolition, and will be looking at how that
impacts them in
2011.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000085">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendment does not seek in any way, shape or form to negate the frankly
appalling impacts of the Bill, and of the regulations in July. All it
seeks to do is ask the Minister, “Please, by 3 January
2011—one year away—will you bring to the public domain an
assessment of how it is all going?” I hope that he can do that
on a regular basis, post-2012. We have rehearsed the arguments here in
much detail, but there are several points that I think we need to look
at, and we need to look at the impact of the policies 12 months
on—perhaps even  five years on and beyond, but
certainly, in principle, 12 months
on.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000086">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
first point is: what will be the impact on the savings ratio, which the
child trust fund has been so successful, in my view, in improving to
date? We have seen incontrovertible evidence during the course of the
debate that the level of saving has risen because of the child trust
fund, which is focused on children. I would like to know whether, in
the 12 months after the abolition of the child trust fund and the
contributions, the savings ratio goes up or down, whether it stays the
same or changes, and whether the parents of the poorest children in our
communities are saving less, the same amount, or more. I would like to
know whether payments, either at the higher level or the lower level,
have been a major kick-start and a generator of
contributions—that is the case we made in Committee. It would be
useful to know, 12 months after the abolition of the child trust fund,
whether saving has tailed off. I would like to know that, but not in
order to beat the Minister over the head with it. I hope that whatever
succeeds the child trust fund, hard though we are fighting to save it,
has a useful function, is worth while, and meets the objectives that we
in Committee seek—the objectives of raising savings and dealing
with some of the most challenging people in our
community.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000087">&#160;</a>

Hanson:<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000713">&#160;</a>
                              </span>
                           </strong> My hon. Friend makes a valid point. Echoing what
my hon. Friend the Member for Wirral South said this morning, we had
some challenging years when the economy was in a difficult place, and
the efforts of the previous Government and this Government to get us
out of that are important. We need to look at the trajectory over the
first few years of the child trust fund and over the next 12
months.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000089">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">My
first contention is that the review would be useful; not to revisit the
battles that we are having in Committee, on the Floor of the House and,
possibly, in another place, but simply for the world to know whether
the child trust fund did what it said on the tin, which was to raise
the savings ratio and deal with the poorest in our society. We should
see whether the next 12 months see a rise, a fall or stability in the
level of saving compared with previous years and that period
particularly.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000090">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Secondly,
what is the impact in terms of some of the issues we talked about this
morning—for example in relation to looked-after children? The
payments will stop on 3 January and we will have 12 months, if the
review happens, to see what has happened. The Minister said that local
authorities could give money towards the ISAs. I would like to know,
formally, in 12 months’ time how many local authorities have
done so, which ones, and how much they put in. We do not want a
postcode lottery of local authorities determining who provides the
money.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000091">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
might be fair for Cornwall county council, the hon. Member for Truro
and Falmouth’s council, to put money into the child ISA, but
Hereford and Worcester county council—Worcestershire county
council, or whatever it is called nowadays—might not put in
money. In my area, Flintshire county council might be able to do it.
The borough of Newham might not be able to, because it has a range of
pressures due to poverty and other difficulties faced by the
constituents of my hon. Friend the Member for West Ham, which we can
compare with the pressures in Reading, for example. I do not know the
answers, but in 12 months it will be worth examining whether
looked-after children are being treated as equally as they were under
the child trust fund by whatever arrangements replace it on 3 January
next
year.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000092">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
is fair to make an assessment. The proposal is not meant to be
politically charged; it may be that Tory authorities put money in and
Labour authorities do not. The assessment might show my colleagues in
local government in a bad light or show the Liberal Democrats in a bad
light. I do not know, but we need to know which authorities are
paying—urban, rural or city. We need to know about those issues.
It is an important thing to consider 12 months
on.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000093">&#160;</a>

agree that the discussions we had this morning were instructive in
showing how difficult it can be to get the right products to encourage
the savings culture that we all want? A report, after a year, would
give us all a chance to check and ensure that the product is
right.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000094">&#160;</a>

                              </span>
                           </strong> Indeed. The difficulty I face with the general
suggestion, and which I put to the Committee in relation to my
amendment, is that perhaps 12 months is too soon. Maybe we need a
review later on. We learned today that the junior ISA will not be ready
until October next year, so it will not have been running successfully
or for very long before the review takes place. I hope that the
Minister will indicate that he accepts the amendment and, potentially,
will review it further down the
line.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000095">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendment is not about being malicious about the revised product or
about the abolition of the child trust fund. I simply want to say to my
hon. Friends and to the Committee that when we take action it is
important that we do not simply forget about it; we need to review it
to see whether the replacement product meets the objectives for the
previous product. Those were to increase the savings ratio and to try
to give cash assets to the poorest and most vulnerable in our society.
We need to look at the impact of the measure on the three devolved
Administrations and to ensure that we do so in a way that learns
lessons from the 12-month
operation.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000096">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
I said, the effect on looked-after children could be one area we look
at. The Minister suggested that looked-after children could be
supported by local authority contributions. It is important to consider
the point about a postcode lottery. We will know within 12 months what
the policies are of each local authority in relation to that. The
impact on children with disabilities, through the abolition of the
disabled person’s additional finance, is equally important.
Scope’s evidence suggested that it was extremely worried about
that. I have taken that evidence in good faith, and I would like to see
a review of whether the evidence rolls out in practice to impact on
those particular areas.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000097">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
have had some fun, kicking around different manifesto commitments. The
important point, however, is that the Minister believed, earlier this
year, that in making a manifesto commitment to look at the poorest
third of children, it was important to maintain the child trust fund.
He must have had a reason for that. He needs an opportunity to reflect
on whether the total abolition of the scheme is detrimental to the
poorest third of children. I want him to go back to his electorate and
say that he has completed his manifesto commitments. If the removal of
the child trust fund, as witnesses have said, will increase inequality,
damage the poorest third of our community and make the poor poorer, he
needs to reflect on that in 12 months’ time to see whether he
needs to tweak his junior
ISA.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000098">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
need to look at how the junior ISA is operating in practice, although I
accept that January 2012 may be a little early to do that. We need a
formal review of whether that product is meeting its objectives. That
could be commenced in January 2012. I hope the Minister will do it on a
regular basis. The review could first look at who is contributing to
the junior ISA. Is it, as in the figures I have quoted on the child
trust fund, the wealthier areas of the country that have higher
take-up, such as, dare I say, Fareham? Those areas have a higher
take-up, as high as 83%, than some areas in Northern Ireland where it
was as low as 50%. Is the junior ISA being taken up by those in the
poorest third of constituencies? Are people in West Ham contributing to
the junior ISA to the same degree as those in Fareham? That is not to
be qualitative about the outcome of the discussion, but 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 214<a class="bkMark" name="Column214">&#160;</a>
                           </div>we need to know how the junior ISA is working in practice, downstream,
so that we can judge whether it is meeting its
objectives.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000099">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
also need oversight of what the impact is of the loss of that resource
going into the child trust fund as a whole, in relation to the higher
and lower payments across the board. That would be useful. I need the
Minister to tell me what the costs of administering the remaining child
trust fund scheme are in that 12-month period, how those costs are
being borne by the Treasury and what their impact will be on his
deficit reduction plan. We need to look at those issues as a
whole.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000100">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">My
last point is about the providers of existing child trust funds. We
have heard from the Children’s Mutual and others.
Children’s Mutual is the major provider of existing child trust
funds. It will have a legacy provision for many years to
come—possibly as many as 18 years from 3 January 2011. It is
important that we look at what impact clause 1 has on the providers in
12 months’ time. Each and every provider entered into the child
trust fund in good faith. They invested resources in developing the
child trust fund product in good faith. They even, before the general
election, looked at the lie of the land and thought, in good faith,
that of the two parties that were likely to form the Government, one
supported the current objectives of the child trust fund and the other
supported its being operated for the poorest third, looked-after
children and children with disabilities. They accepted, in principle,
that they have put investment into the child trust fund, which will
continue for some time. They now find that if clause 1 is accepted, on
3 January all the things that they believed were truths will disappear
and the landscape of the child trust fund will be dramatically altered
by policy decisions. The Minister is entitled to take such decisions,
but they will change the landscape completely.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000101">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
is important that 12 months on, and two or three years on, we consider
what such a change means for the providers of the existing child trust
funds in relation to their economic viability, and to their ability to
generate a rate of return that will ensure a reasonable dowry at age 18
that is of value to people who have the funds now. Again, I declare a
semi-interest in that one of my four children is the recipient of a
child trust fund.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000102">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">A
key point is that this morning my hon. Friend the Member for West Ham
expressed a degree of scepticism, which I pooh-poohed, about the
ability of the child trust fund to survive for the next 18 years; I
want it to survive for people who currently have it. I am worried that
if we do not review the fund in a positive way after the first 12
months, the current fund providers might at some point in the next two
years come to the Minister and say, “We’ve been trying to
make the best of this. You have sliced our legs off—and our
head, and our arms—but we’re struggling along as best we
can. Unfortunately, we can’t run this profitably to make a
return for the child trust fund investors, and we’re making a
loss on the costs of providing the fund to date.” The Minister
will say, “I’m sorry about that—that’s a
great shame. I can’t do much about it—the
deficit’s this and we’re trying to do that. These things
happen—it’s part of the policy consequences of what we
have done and, unfortunately, that’s the way it is.” At
some point in future, there might be demands to fold the existing child
trust fund.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000103">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

			Column number: 215<a class="bkMark" name="Column215">&#160;</a>
                        </div>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendment would give the Minister the chance to consider formally those
pressures over the next 12 months; to consider how such pressures are
being developed; to consider whether Children’s Mutual is able
to continue providing its current level of service; to consider whether
the smaller providers, which are much more dependent on the level of
Government contribution, can continue; and to consider whether he wants
to review such issues in a positive way.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000104">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
think that the Minister will want to ensure that those who have put
their own private money into supporting the public contribution to the
existing child trust funds get the best return. Such people, who have
contributed from their own savings and who are from all sections of the
community, might be worried if the capacity of organisations such as

                        <p class="tabbed">I
would particularly like to see whether the savings contributions by
parents to the existing child trust funds, which operate until 3
January 2011, continue at the same level after that date. There may be
a temptation for people to think that because the child trust fund is
dead, they should not put any more money into the existing funds.
People might wonder why they should do that when they could transfer to
the new junior ISA. That would make the current child trust funds,
which will still operate, even less viable than they are now, because
of the scale of the operations. The Minister should review such matters
seriously in the next 12 months and reach
conclusions.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000106">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendment is straightforward. With the integrity with which I have
tabled it, it would not deny the Minister’s abolishing the trust
fund under clause 1, nor would it deny his having already reduced the
payments in July. We opposed both those measures, and we will oppose
clause 1 when the opportunity arises. The amendment would not stop the
Minister doing those things, however; it simply requires him to produce
a report in 12 months’ time to consider the impact of the
provision on the providers, the recipients, the savings ratio, the
contributions, the success of the junior ISA, and all the issues that
we have discussed at great length today.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000107">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
hope the Minister will not see the proposal as a wrecking amendment in
any way, shape or form. It cannot stop him doing whatever he wants to
do. It is simply an opportunity for him to come back to the House and
put a formal review in the Library. We can then learn lessons and see
whether we need to tweak the decisions that we will be taking in the
next few weeks and
months.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000108">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I want to make a few brief remarks in support of
the amendment and also to ask the Minister a couple of questions.
Earlier today, I raised an issue about the statistic that he provided
for the 2008-09 financial year and what a strange year that was. In our
opinion, it was a very distressing year for many, especially those on
low incomes. That point is at the heart of my remarks, and I hope the
Minister will take this opportunity to provide the Committee with
further information that the Treasury may have on savings rates and
ratios across the past decade or so, and how the child trust fund has
contributed to building a savings culture.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000109">&#160;</a>

                        </div>
                        <p class="tabbed">Some
economists believe that savings ratios may be counter-cyclical. There
is some statistical evidence that the savings ratio moves in an
opposite direction to the economic cycle, which is odd, because when
interest rates are low, it seems that the rate of interest people might
expect is not necessarily connected to their propensity to save.
However, that propensity may be affected by feelings of uncertainty and
nervousness, although, globally, propensities to save can be observed
to be related to a wide variety of things. In China, we know that it is
connected to the absence of a welfare state, the inability to join a
trade union and the lack of family support. I digress, but we have an
opportunity for the Government to examine the savings culture,
especially of those on low incomes.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000110">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
statistics mentioned earlier on how much low-income families have put
into child trust funds could be explained by a number of factors. I
could imagine a correlation for people on low incomes who faced either
the threat of redundancy or actually being made redundant in the
financial year 2008-09. That could have had a grave effect on their
ability to pay into a child trust fund. The amendment is important in
providing us with an opportunity to look at that point in depth. If we
believe the economists who say that the savings ratio is likely to be
counter-cyclical, that would mean that the child trust fund came into
existence in an economy in which we might have expected the savings
ratio to be steadily falling as the economy was perceived by many to be
steadily
growing.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000111">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
had a long period of growth from 2000 onwards. The child trust fund
came into being after people had expected steady rates of growth,
because that is what they had grown used to. It might be the case that
the child trust fund meant savings were being made at a time when we
might have expected the savings ratio to decline. From the perspective
of economists in the Treasury and elsewhere, and from the perspective
of non-governmental organisations and the third sector, a review
carried out by the Government would be extremely important. It would
help to inform debates in the House and elsewhere about how we
encourage the savings culture, especially for those on low incomes and
for children who are likely to be asset-poor in the
future.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000112">&#160;</a>

might have on the savings ratio, which they both commented on, I am
interested in the right hon. Gentleman’s view that the CTF has
driven it up, because in 2008 the savings ratio hit its lowest point
since the 1950s, when it was actually negative. I cannot see a causal
link between the savings ratio and the child trust fund, and if there
is one, it did not work in 2008. The amount of money in CTFs is
unlikely to have an impact on the overall level of that
ratio.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000118">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
has been mentioned, in relation to whether CTFs have been effective, we
know that only 13% of the poorest families contributed to such a fund
in 2008-09, and the Committee should bear in mind the number of
families on low incomes who still contribute to ISAs. The hon. Member
for Wirral South suggested that 2008 was just a bad year for that
group, but CTFs started in 2005, and the years 2006 and 2007 were also
bad years for savings. In 2006, the figure was 14.6%, in 2007 it was
13.8% and in 2008 it was 13.3%, so 2008 was not a particularly bad
year.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000119">&#160;</a>

security by continuing economic growth and therefore they did not save.
Perhaps they believed the former Prime Minister, when he said that
there would be no return to boom and bust. If they had disbelieved him,
they might have saved a bit more for a rainy day. The previous
Government’s record on savings was lamentable, and Opposition
Members can take no comfort whatever from the measures that they
introduced to improve the savings ratio, given that it fell during
their time in

badly—to make was rather more subtle: given the way the savings
ratio moves or the way in which the data appear to move, it is
difficult to unpack the impact of the child trust fund without
considerable work to control for other factors. The hon. Member for
West Worcestershire made an interesting remark about the impact or
otherwise of the child trust fund, but there is a micro-macro question.
The report might look both at the micro impact on families and on what
they might otherwise have done, and at the macro effect that such
Government measures might have on the child trust fund. I do not think
that I ever suggested that the child trust fund had a driving-off
impact. The most important point, however, is that an inquiry of that
nature—whether this year, next year or in five years’
time—would be incredibly useful, and the amendment is trying to
make that
point.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000123">&#160;</a>

                           </div>Treasury Benches that there should be a pilot study about the impact of
the child trust fund. However, that did not happen. Such a study would
have proven whether child trust funds were effective at that point. We
have made our choice about the direction we want to take savings
policy, part of which is the junior ISA. I do not want to get
sidetracked into a long debate about that. Other measures have been
taken to improve the savings environment in this
country.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000124">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">If
people want to save, there are vehicles that will succeed the child
trust fund. There is a view on the Opposition Benches that people on
lower incomes just do not understand ISAs. That is surprising, given
that the evidence shows that 12 million people with incomes of less
than £20,000 have an ISA. The product is well known among people
with lower incomes. Someone on the Opposition Benches suggested that
the product is the preserve of the elderly. Only 20% of ISAs are held
by the over-64s, whereas twice that proportion are held by the
under-44s. Clearly, the product is understood by people on low incomes
and by people who are at the younger end of the age
spectrum.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000125">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">There
was a discussion about the impact of the end of the CTF on providers.
The advantage I have, for obvious reasons, over the right hon. Member
for Delyn is that I spoke to a number of providers during the
formulation of the policy, so I understand the impact that it will
have. The argument in relation to existing providers is that the amount
in the child trust fund will be sufficient to enable them to service
the back book of business, as it were. A number of providers were
concerned about the lower rates that we announced in July and said it
would not be economically viable for them to continue. As a consequence
of representations made by providers, we laid regulations last month
that would enable child trust providers to close to new child trust
fund business in order to secure their long-term
viability.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000126">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Of
course, the new replacement product has been warmly welcomed by
existing providers and other financial institutions. We are working
with them to ensure that the sunk costs they have invested in the
systems can, as far as possible, be recycled into arrangements for the
new product, and that they reuse those schemes, rather than spend money
on new software and IT. We have already done an awful lot of work on
developing the policy. We thought about the implications for saving and
for providers, and considered the data we already have available. In
reality, producing a report—whether for next January or the
January after—would be a poor waste of taxpayers’ money.

potentially even as part of the Red Book, which is now the Green Book

report. It shows that everything you said in Committee was tosh and
that what we as the Government said was correct.” If that were
the case, I would take a kicking from the hon. Gentleman and have to
accept the
position.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000130">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">However,
the Minister does not want to produce the report and publish it
because, secretly, he knows that the measures he is taking today will
increase inequality, hit the poorest hardest, damage the interests of
disabled children, and wreck the existing savings that are being
undertaken for the current child trust fund. It will not necessarily
show that the current revision of the product that he is bringing
forward some time next year, details of which we are not sure about,
will be a positive incentive. It will not show what the savings will be
as a result of the new product, and it will not show whether it is just
middle-class, well-off people putting in the money. None of the facts
will emerge unless we assiduously table questions to find out such
answers by stealth, as I promise him I will do if I still have the
honour to hold this
position.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000131">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Minister could author and produce a report under his own volition or he
could find himself answering 500 parliamentary questions tabled by me
and my hon. Friends in 18 months’ time about the impact of the
measure. That is the choice before him today. He can avoid some of the
discussions, but he cannot hide from some of the arguments. In due
course, we will table questions to discover whether inequality has
risen, whether the take-up has not been as good and the trust fund is
attracting only those who can afford to put money into it, and whether
the disabled or looked-after family have been disadvantaged. We will
find a way in which to find out those things. Treasury Committees can
product reports on such issues. Parliamentary questions can be tabled.
Debates can be held. We can discuss the issues.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000132">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
am simply giving the hon. Gentleman an opportunity to frame the debate
around a report in which he can put the issues in context and produce
it for the interests of all the people involved. I remind him that the
amendment would not stop him doing anything. He can do all that he has
said he wants to do. It simply asks him to produce a report on the
impacts of the policy in due course. I would be happy to withdraw the
amendment if he suggested that I table one on Report to ask for a
review in three years’ time, and picked the date of 3
January 2014. Would the hon. Gentleman accept such an amendment? I give
him the opportunity to intervene and tell me whether he would accept an
amendment whereby he would produce a report in three years’ time
rather than the 12 months that we have outlined today. Does he want to
intervene?<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000133">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Just for the record, the Minister has said no. He
is not interested in knowing the impact of his policy in 12
months’ time, in two years’ time, in three years’
time—not ever. It will therefore have to be for me and my hon.
Friends to find a way in which to ensure that we get that information
to date. The hon. Gentleman might well find himself in 18
months’ time before the Treasury Committee having to examine
such issues. He might find himself answering 500 parliamentary
questions tabled by me and my hon. Friends. He might find himself in
debates. We might pick Opposition days to discuss the matters. He will
be a lot busier than if he just accepted the amendment and produced a
report for us to scrutinise, comment on and use accordingly. However,
if he wants to waste Treasury resources to deal with matters in that
way rather than accept the amendment, so be it.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000135">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
art of opposition was not lost on Ministers such as myself when we were
in government. We have seen and learnt some lessons from the hon.
Member for Fareham and his colleagues. We can make life difficult for
Ministers. We can fill the hon. Gentleman’s box every week of
the year with questions, letters, preparation for debates and Treasury
Committee briefs, all because he does not want to have a report of his
own in 12 or  18 months’ time on this particular issue.
If that is the Minister’s choice, let him vote for it.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000136">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Perhaps
I can invite his hon. Friends behind him to vote with the Opposition on
this occasion, simply to relieve him of the some of the burdens that he
will have to face by answering the questions further down the line in a
different format. Perhaps the hon. Member for Bristol West, who I know
is a considered individual—I am pleased that he
stayed—could help, in the spirit of co-operation in the
coalition, by voting with us, to relieve the Minister of that burden in
18 months. Perhaps the hon. Members for Truro and Falmouth and for
Devizes could do the same, simply to relieve the pressure on the
Minister, because I do not want to see him overburdened and stressed in
18
months.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000137">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The amendment is there because we feel strongly
that we should review the policy. It is good management practice to
implement something, look at how it works, learn lessons, be open and
transparent about the lessons, and potentially make changes. I am not
stopping the Minister doing anything. What I am doing today is
exercising the historic rights of people in this place to argue a case
for certain issues—if chuntering is the word for it, so be it.
If the Minister does not like it, that, I am afraid, is tough. We have
until 4 o’clock on Thursday to debate the Bill. We feel strongly
about it, and if I wish to debate the Bill until 4 o’clock on
Thursday, I and my hon. Friends will debate it until then. We will
continue to debate it for as long as we wish to. That is the nature of

13 years, I sat where the Minister sits and I listened to arguments
from the Opposition Benches, and occasionally, dare I say, I have
accepted some of them and tabled amendments to the House based on some
of the points made by the Opposition. The amendment simply says to the
Minister, “Review it,” which is a valuable point. If he
wants to bring it back in three years’ time to review it, that
is fine by me. I will table an amendment, come what may, on Report,
which I hope will be selected by Mr Speaker, which will give an
opportunity to review it in three years. Today, however, I will press
the amendment to a vote, and I hope that the Committee will speak. I
expect to lose—that is the nature of the business of where I sit
now—but it does not mean that I am wrong.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000142">&#160;</a>

this Bill will impact hardest on the poorest in society, disabled

is real concern that, as with other measures, there has not been

families with disabled children, and disabled people themselves. My
concern is that if we put a new saving mechanism in place and it does
not have that level of scrutiny or, especially, that impact assessment,
we will not know what the impact will be of transitioning from a child
trust fund to a junior ISA. For us, that is a real

out the baby with the bathwater. There needs to be a responsibility to

will mean and what the impact assessment will be. We owe it to those

the issue and make those decisions

refer hon. Members to the table at the back of the equality impact
assessment. Under “Equality Group” it says
“Different racial groups” and under “Impact on
population” it says “None identified”. Does that
mean that the Treasury impact assessment has not looked  at the
“Why Do Assets Matter?” publication by the Runnymede
Trust, which was submitted to the Committee? That document states,
independently, that black and ethnic minority people will be
disproportionately affected by the child trust fund abolition. It
strikes me that “None identified” reflects a relatively
cursory look at the impact of the issues on the black and ethnic
minority population. Under “Different gender groups” the
answer is “None identified,” with “No significant
impact identified” of the Bill as a whole. Clause 1 relates to
the child trust fund, but the assessment could have made in relation to
the saving gateway and the maternity grant, both of which we will
consider later. There is a real need for an

			Column number: 224<a class="bkMark" name="Column224">&#160;</a>
                           </div>impact assessment on those issues. Under “Different age
groups” and “Transsexual or transgender” the
answer, again, is “None identified”. Under
“Different political opinion”—we can accept that
there is a bit of a difference there, and an impact—the
assessment states “None identified”, in the broadest
sense of the
word.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000179">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
impact assessment that has been done, welcome though it is, is not as
thorough as a full impact assessment could be. Try as the Minister
might, he will not convince me that the Bill will not increase
inequality and unfairness, and do great damage to disabled people,
looked-after children, women and black and ethnic minority populations.
Therefore, I ask again that he consider the amendment. I do so,
finally, because the amendment will not stop the Minister doing
anything.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000180">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Clause
1 will, undoubtedly in short order, sail through the Committee. It will
shortly again be considered on the Floor of the House of Commons, and
in another place in the next few weeks. At some point the matter will
be settled, and the child trust fund, if my runes are read correctly,
will be abolished. All I want to ensure from the Minister, before that
final statement is taken, is that we look at every nook and cranny to
ensure that no groups are disadvantaged disproportionately by the
legislation, and that we do so in a way that means, if the Minister
continues to force the Bill on the British public, at least he does so
in the full knowledge of the impact of the Bill—in relation to
not just the groups I mentioned but also, referring to an earlier
debate, to the differences for the populations in Northern Ireland,
Wales, Scotland and across the
country.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000181">&#160;</a>

want to highlight that such communities are  often particularly
reluctant to use mainstream financial institutions. Sometimes that is
because they are intimidated—I guess it would be reasonable to
say—by the institutions or feel that the institutions would not
welcome or serve their needs well. Sometimes, indeed, the products of
those financial institutions might be inimical to the cultural values
of some of the ethnic minorities who are potential customers but,
because of the nature of some of the services provided by the
institutions, who might feel that they cannot be the customer of such
an institution at
all.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000185">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
draw no conclusions about whether the child trust fund in any way
served to get around some of those difficulties or opened up access to
a different range of financial institutions for black and minority
ethnic savers. However, I consider the Government’s impact
assessment to be slight. I would like to have seen it review much more
fully a group that significantly under-saves and 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 225<a class="bkMark" name="Column225">&#160;</a>
                           </div>lacks assets. Therefore, it would have been useful to understand the
attitudes to financial institutions and whether the child trust fund
offered any learning
points.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000186">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
other point that I would highlight specifically is, again, quite
typical in some of the black and minority ethnic communities in my
constituency—indeed, in some white communities too. As my right
hon. Friend the Member for Delyn suggested, there is a sort of indirect
equality impact issue in relation to women, because mothers are
probably particularly likely to have taken an interest in the savings
that were undertaken for their children through the child trust fund.
Again, I draw no conclusion as to what might have been uncovered by a
proper equality impact assessment, but I am genuinely interested that
we should have had one. That is why I support the amendment and I hope
that the Minister will address the
points.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000187">&#160;</a>

Member for Delyn rather brushed off the intervention of my hon. Friend
the Member for Devizes. The right hon. Gentleman should be commending
us for going further than his Government went with equality impact
assessments and for making an initial assessment. I cannot remember one
being done for the 10p tax rate, which had a huge impact. The shadow
Minister and the hon. Member for Stretford and Urmston should,
therefore, be congratulating us for what we have done, because the
previous Government, which the hon. Lady would have supported, did not
do such things. We have actually made a significant move forward in
meeting our statutory obligations. It is right that we pay due regard
to the need to eliminate discrimination and promote equality when we
consider policy options. If policies have a disproportionate impact on
a particular group, it is right that we consider what actions can be
taken to avoid or mitigate any unfair impact. A full equality impact
assessment is only one way of demonstrating that we are taking these
factors into account. The absence of a full assessment does not mean
that we have not taken them into account, and full equality impact
assessments do not need to be used in all circumstances. However, they
should be used when they have effectively contributed to the analysis
and development of policy
options.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000188">&#160;</a>

15 September, we prepared and published our initial assessments of the
equality impact measures, including in relation to this Bill. The
various mitigating measures have been rather more extensive in covering
different groups than the right hon. Member for Delyn implied. He
simply mentioned the first two lines in one box of the impact
assessment, which state “none identified,” without taking

assessment we published back in September sets out the impact of the
measures in the same way that any further equality impact assessment
would. It demonstrates that the ending of CTF eligibility will have an
impact on people with disabilities and on different age groups.
However, that impact is likely to be limited. We have already made it
clear how we will mitigate the effects of child trust fund changes on
disabled people by recycling the money that would have been used for
additional payments into additional respite breaks. We have talked

assets with the new junior ISA, which will assist in their transition
to adulthood. We will make sure that the junior ISA is accessible to
disabled children, looked-after children and children from lower income

me pick up on a couple of points on the current
assessment—copies of which are available to all members of the
Committee. First, I will look at different language users. The current
assessment states:<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000200">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“Some
of the affected population will have different language needs, but
there is not expected to be a disproportionate impact on these
groups.”<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000583">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>Fair
enough, we will accept that as a starting point. Secondly, it
states:<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000201">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“HMRC

these changes to be in languages other than

                        </p>
                        <p>At
the moment, the Bill will abolish the child trust fund and it will do
so in English. It “will consider requests” from
individuals or groups for the changes to be communicated in other
languages. For example, what information will there be on the new child
trust fund ISA that is being established? I happen to represent a
constituency where the language is predominantly English, but 16% of my
constituents speak Welsh as a first language. I have few other
languages spoken in my constituency, but I could point to others in
inner-city London where 30, 40 or 50 languages may be
prevalent.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000202">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> My right hon. Friend draws attention to an
important issue in relation to community languages. Many different
languages are spoken, particularly in the Old Trafford ward in my
constituency. I am very aware of what he his discussing. Does he agree
that—in addition to the need to consider the provision by HMRC
of information about the proposals in community languages—one of
the reasons that an impact assessment would have been helpful is that
it would have enabled us to compare how information was given about the
launch of the child trust fund and the entitlement to the child trust
fund in different languages with what commercial organisations offer?
That might offer some useful learning points for the Minister, who is
thinking of introducing the replacement junior ISA through a commercial
vehicle.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000203">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> My hon. Friend makes a valuable point based on her
constituents’ experience in the Greater Manchester area where a
number of different languages are spoken. The current assessment, which
is not detailed enough to meet the objectives that I would want to have
in place, states:<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000204">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                        </p>
                        <p>That
presumes that people know to request those things in the first place.
It presumes that the languages that are used will provide sufficient
information. I would not want to see the new child ISA fail,
particularly for the poor, the black or the illiterate, because the
information was lacking, because the only language was English or that
HMRC will only “consider” requests for the information to
be provided in other languages. Before I withdraw the amendment, will
the Minister give a commitment to the Committee that, before Report
stage,

                           </div>he will produce some information about how in many languages, in what
form and when, HMRC expects to transmit information about the new child
ISA and the abolition of the child trust fund to the many people who
will require it? I am afraid that that backs up the comments made by
the Runnymede Trust that insufficient consideration has been given to
the transmission of the information and that the changes will
disproportionately hit those from black and ethnic minority
communities.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000205">&#160;</a>

addresses their immediate need. Saying, “The money will be spent

and Whitby says that we will save time. Just to make the point, I will
say it, anyway. My hon. Friend the Member for Wirral South says she
would like to hear it. Let me say to the hon. Member for Scarborough
and Whitby and to my hon. Friend the Member for Wirral South that the
proposal for providing 8,000 week-long respite breaks each year for
disabled children in England—not in Wales, Scotland or Northern
Ireland—trivialises the nature of the child trust fund, to echo
the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Stretford and Urmston.
The fund was about building a capital asset for people at the age of 18
to help them meet the needs of their 18th birthday and
beyond, and to help with accommodation, tuition fees, employment and
training, and the challenges that will affect them in the years 2020 to
2029 and beyond. It is an entirely different product if one of the
mitigating factors in terms of the impact on disabled people is to say,
“Well, give them a respite break for a couple of weeks”,
welcome though that
is.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000209">&#160;</a>

the constituents of my hon. Friend the Member for Wirral South can have
a respite break across the border in Heswall, so be it. We will look
from our side of the border with great admiration at the fact that
those 8,000 children can have that respite break, but it is
not

substitute, as my hon. Friend the Member for Stretford and Urmston
said, for the capital asset-building product that it is replacing. So,
I do not think that the impact assessment has done justice to the
impact of this measure on children and others with
disabilities.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000210">&#160;</a>

                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“CTF:
While parents are involved in opening and managing CTFs, they are the

                        <p>We
have spent hours discussing the question of looked-after children.
Under “Mitigating Action”, the impact assessment says,
“No mitigating action necessary.” So the impact
assessment says that there is no impact on looked-after children, and
there is no mitigating action. The Minister has missed a trick.
Whatever previous Labour Governments have done, I do not think that
their legislation was about increasing inequality, unfairness and
poverty and removing life chances. They were about trying to tackle
those issues. I wish I could give the Minister chapter and verse on
what previous Finance Ministers have done in relation to equality
impact assessments. Unfortunately, I cannot. I am trying to explain in
a helpful way. I was in the Home Office, the Ministry of Justice, the
Northern Ireland Office and the Wales Office at No. 10. I cannot be
responsible for what happened in Treasury Departments. I cannot give
him chapter and verse on that off the top of my head; I can say that
the Bill will damage equality. It will hit the poorest
hardest—disabled people, black people, people from ethnic
minorities and looked-after children—and will damage their life
chances. A thorough impact assessment has not been carried out and,
just on the points that I have made, we cannot accept the measure and
must press it to a vote. Before I do so, I would welcome the
Minister’s response to my comments.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000212">&#160;</a>

I place on the record that the Minister does not wish to respond to the
fact that Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs would
“consider requests” from communications in languages
other than English? There are ways in which we can deal with these
matters: we can be friendly and co-operative in Committee and we can
ask questions gently, which the Minister can reflect on and respond to.
If he does not do so, we must consider other ways to tease out from him
which languages HMRC will produce information in, and how and when.
That will involve our tabling parliamentary questions on a range of
issues and perhaps segmenting each language in turn, which will fill
the Minister’s box and create—possibly only a
night’s—inconvenience for him. He could agree today to
ask his officials to consider the matter. He could say, “The
Opposition spokesperson has made a valid point about how people with a
non-English language understand the new ISA, the abolition of the
previous scheme, and the later issues concerning the health and
pregnancy grant and the saving gateway.” I would hope that on
occasion he would, as a Minister, recognise that there might be a
scintilla of point in what the Opposition say.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000213">&#160;</a>

have been thinking about the number of questions on child trust funds
that I have answered from the right hon. Gentleman today. One might
have thought that he had tabled 20, 30, 40 or 50, but he has tabled
none to me. If he is as serious about the matter as he appears to be,
he will recognise and know from his experience from having an extensive
role in different Government Departments that such Departments are
skilled in communicating in different

                           </strong> The important point is that I am being asked to
accept that the impact assessment on equality has been thorough and has
dealt with all the concerns. Yet, in the mitigating action, on
different language users, for example, it simply
states:<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000217">&#160;</a>

                        <p>It
would be much more proactive to say, “HMRC will undertake to
ensure that there are communications in languages other than
English.” That would satisfy me on the matter. In my view, a
thorough impact assessment has not been undertaken, so I wish to press
the amendment to a vote.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000218">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendment is designed to test whether the Government’s decision
not to introduce the saving gateway is about saving money or, once
again, about dogma. The proposal in the Bill will certainly save an
element of resources because the saving gateway will not be rolled out.
However, we need to first consider whether we need an immediate
abolition of the saving gateway, or whether we need to reflect during a
three-year gap, when we can consider several issues, not least whether
the economic situation improves, whether we wish to see the pilots
further evaluated, and whether we believe that the saving gateway
scheme is a good idea in principle.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000270">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
Saving Gateway Accounts Act 2009 (Commencement No. 2)
Order 2010 was made on 24 March 2010, again by the Labour Government,
to ensure that we had the development of the saving gateway scheme.
That order was revoked by the Saving Gateway Accounts Act 2009
(Revocation of Commencement) Order 2010 on 26 June. That revocation
meant that, unfortunately, the first account for savers could not be
opened in July 2010, as planned by the previous
Government.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000271">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
live in hope that the Minister will reflect on such matters and accept
the amendment. Should he do so, I will be the first to go outside this
building and praise him. My hon. Friend the Member for West Ham
suggests that I buy the Minister a drink. I will happily do that and I
will happily put out a press release to say that he has done a good job
in accepting an amendment to defer the repeal of the Act for three
years. If the

                           </div>amendment is accepted, the saving gateway scheme could be introduced in
three years’ time, if the coalition Government believe that the
UK economic situation has improved. Will the Minister tell us the
coalition’s view on the saving gateway
scheme?<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000273">&#160;</a>

                        <p>He
said that it was a bit like setting sail; if the wind changes, one has
to tack about to get to the destination. He added that global growth
could be either higher or lower over the next three years.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000276">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Let
us accept that there is a three-year deficit reduction plan. Whatever
our disagreements on that plan—they are many and they are
deep—the Government have a plan and if it works, there will be a
reduction in the deficit. Savings in public spending will be achieved
by that plan, by taking out 500,000 public sector workers, for example,
or by generally decimating services. However, savings will be
made.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000277">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Growth
may occur in the economy as a whole; there may be the creation of
further jobs and successful economies. All sorts of things could
happen—who knows? By accepting the amendment, the Minister could
freeze the pilots with effect from today, maintain the Act on the
statute book, and ensure that in three years’ time he revisits
the issue and looks at whether revocation of the legislation should
progress.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000278">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
would be interested to know whether there is any cost to keeping the
Act on the statute book for three years. We would not be taking
anything away or developing something that involved a major cost. All
we would do is not progress from the pilots to a fully rolled-out
scheme. The pilots have happened and they involved a cost. There is no
cost in not progressing with the scheme at the moment. Nevertheless,
the Minister seeks to abolish the saving gateway scheme and the
relevant legislation as soon as the Bill receives Royal Assent. My
question to the Minister is about the principle of the saving gateway
scheme.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000279">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
know from extensive piloting that the saving gateway scheme was proving
successful. It demonstrated that it could generate new savers and new
savings. Crucially, individuals continued to save after the end of
their accounts. We know that because the Bill had support from across
the House.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000280">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
may be uncomfortable for me to remind the Minister of this—I
hope that it is not—but when the Saving Gateway Accounts Act
2009 was going through the House, and when he sat where I sit now, he
said:<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000281">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“The
Bill serves a valuable purpose in encouraging people, particularly
those on low incomes, to save. People on higher incomes have an
opportunity to smooth out fluctuations in income and expenses to which
those on low incomes do not have access. If the Bill is successful in
encouraging people to save, it will enable them to create a modest
buffer against variations in income, such as the unexpected expense of
being laid-off for a short period. It will give people a degree of
financial security they have not had hitherto.”<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000590">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>That
is what the Minister said more than 18 months ago. At that time, the
official Opposition did not oppose the Bill, but supported it; they
recognised that it had some merits and they sanctioned the carrying out
of pilots.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000282">&#160;</a>

Third Reading of the then Saving Gateway Accounts Bill. He said
that<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000283">&#160;</a>

is the equivalent of the share-owning democracy being extended to

widespread social benefits if the Bill works out as successfully as we
all hope.”—[<em>Official Report</em>, 25 February 2009;

                        <p>Some
18 months ago, before the general election, the Liberal Democrats and
the Conservatives were happy to support the principle of saving
gateways, because they recognised—I do not wish to put words
into their mouths—that contributions from the state to help
poorer people to save were a good use of state resources to help
generate income and ensure that those on lower incomes saved for their
concerns at the
time.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000284">&#160;</a>

of £115 million a year mean that he does not now wish to proceed
with
it.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000287">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
will give the Financial Secretary the opportunity not to proceed in
that way now, so that he can have the next three years to reconsider.
He does not need to do it immediately. He would not need to repeal the
Act or scrap the scheme, but he could reconsider it over the next three
years. At any point during that time, when the economy picks up, he can
introduce the scheme and adjust the costs accordingly. If he believes
in it, why is he abolishing it? Why is he not just taking the payment
holiday that the amendment would give
him?<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000288">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">As
a good judge of what is right and what is wrong, my hon. Friend the
Member for West Ham keeps me on a fair track on these matters. I know
that she and other members of the Committee would say to me, as the
Opposition spokesman, “Go ahead with the scheme now.”
That is my favoured option and, for the avoidance of doubt, if the
amendment is not agreed, I will ask my hon. Friends to vote against
clause stand part in due course. My favoured option would ensure that
we do not wreck a lot of work on the saving gateway, that we do not
throw out the pilots that we have had, that we do not waste those
opportunities, and that we do not let the Financial Secretary stand on
his head again by saying one thing in opposition and another in
government.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000289">&#160;</a>

hon. Member for Bristol West is in the Committee Room at the moment.

and urged that the pilots be made a success. I looked forward to his
supporting that policy during the election, and he made no manifesto
commitment to abolish the saving gateway. The Financial Secretary did
not do so either, but the amendment would give him the chance to look
at the economic situation, to put the roll-out of the pilots on hold
for whatever period of time he feels it necessary to do so, and to bank
whatever savings he wishes. He could do that without our having to
think again, in 2014, that this was a good idea, which should have been
taken forward, and without the whole of the legislation having to be
revisited and looked at again in
detail.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000290">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
Financial Secretary will know that the saving gateway was to be a
tax-free cash savings account for working people on lower incomes, with
eligibility passported from receipt of certain benefits and tax
credits. Under the saving gateway, accounts would have lasted for two
years. At their maturity, the Government would have made a contribution
of 50p for each pound saved, up to a maximum of £300. We would
be encouraging poorer people on lower incomes and on certain benefits,
with strict eligibility, to put some money aside for their future. Let
us encourage people on lower incomes to save in partnership with the
Government, by putting in at the end of that process—not at the
start or in the middle—50p for each pound saved, up to a maximum
of
£300.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000291">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">A
savings culture is important. We need to ensure that not only those
with trust funds from their families, not only those who are wealthy
millionaires or just the well-off in society, but those who are poorer
save towards their future. A proven method was used. The pilots showed
that it was important that people could save and have independence and
security throughout their lives. The then Government introduced
individual savings accounts to develop a fairer distribution of tax
relief, but the objective of the saving gateway was simple. It was
first to kick-start a savings habit among people on lower incomes by
providing a strong incentive to save through matching Government
contributions. Secondly, it was to promote financial inclusion by
encouraging people to engage with mainstream financial
services—something that had cross-party agreement.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000292">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Such
a scheme was good. It was positive. Will the Minister tell me first and
foremost whether he still believes that the scheme is good? Let us put
aside for one moment the £150 million a year that he has
estimated it will cost this year, next year and the year after. Does he
believe that the scheme is a good thing? If he does, I urge him to
accept the amendment. Again, we are making some sacrifices. We should
have started the scheme in July this year. That has now not proved
possible because the current Government have wrecked the proposal. I am
willing to reflect on our amendment in order to save the scheme. Let us
look at matters when the economy picks up. Let us look at whether the
Minister actually believes what he said in February 2009, and let us
see whether the Liberal Democrats believe what they said in February
2009.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000293">&#160;</a>

facilities. The first pilots ran from August 2002 to November 2004 with
individual accounts open for an 18-month period, and about 1,500
participants took part. The initial pilot covered five areas. It ran in
Cambridge, east London—part of which my hon. Friend the Member
for West Ham represents—and the city of Hull, a fine city,
although it has great poverty. I went to university there and I know it
well. My right hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull West and
Hessle (Alan Johnson), the shadow Chancellor, represents a seat in that
area. The county of Cumbria was another area, as was the city of
Manchester, which is close to the constituency of my hon. Friend the
Member for Stretford and
Urmston.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000294">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">People
living in those areas were eligible to open an account if they were of
working age between 16 and 65 and if they fulfilled three particular
criteria: they formed a household earning less than £15,000 a
year; they earned less than £11,000 a year, or they received
out-of-work benefits or benefits generally. Individuals could save up
to £25 a month under the saving gateway pilot and up to a
maximum of £375 overall, for which they received a
pound-for-pound match when the account matured. The final evaluation of
the first pilot was published in March
2005.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000295">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
accept that the Minister will undoubtedly make great play of the fact
that the Labour Government took a while to get the scheme up and
running. Hands up on that one. It was much slower than we wished, but
then the initial pilot was in place. It ran and we did the first
evaluation in March 2005. That led to the second, larger saving gateway
pilot, which ran in the same five locations of Cambridge, east London,
Hull, Cumbria and Manchester and was also piloted in the additional
area of South Yorkshire. That pilot started in 2005. Accounts were open
for 18 months, as under the first pilot, and about 22,000 accounts were
opened. That was a success. Twenty-two thousand accounts were opened,
which would not have existed before, by people on low incomes who had
not been
saving.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000296">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
second pilot was open to a wider income group in order to see whether
we could extend demand in due course. Individuals in the second pilot
were of working age—16 to 65—and had household incomes of
less than £50,000 a year or individual incomes of less than
£25,000 a year, or were, as before, out of work or receiving
benefits.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000297">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
welcome the Minister’s view on the success of the pilots.
Although I am sure that he will give it, I ask him formally: does he
think that the pilots were a success? I think that they pointed to a
success in matching a targeted incentive to lower-income savers. The
pilots’ key findings were that the saving gateway generated both
new savers and new saving among existing savers and brought individuals
into contact with mainstream financial institutions, often for the
first time in their lives.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000298">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
research showed that 60% of participants were still saving regularly
two years after the pilot ended and that three in 10 participants who
had not saved regularly before taking part in the pilot were doing so
at the time of the further research. Participants were also positive
about the saving gateway: 98% of people who took part in the pilots
said that they would open another saving gateway account if given the
chance, and 99% would

                           </div>recommend it to a friend. I emphasise that people who were not saving
before and were on low incomes saved money, and 99% said that they
would recommend the scheme to a friend. That shows that the pilot was
successful in its objective of encouraging people on lower incomes to
save.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000299">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">My
right hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh South West, then the
Chancellor of the Exchequer, announced in the Budget on 24 March this
year that the first saving gateway accounts would be available in July
2010 and that Lloyds Banking Group, Post Office and the Royal Bank of
Scotland Group intended to offer the accounts in 2010. The Government
also expected at the time that several credit unions would offer the
accounts, and continued to discuss the saving gateway with potential
providers. The point about the credit unions is particularly important
to my hon. Friend the Member for South Down, because as we heard in
earlier evidence—and, I think, as she said herself—credit
unions are a preferred method of saving in Northern Ireland, and they
could and should take up the slack where the major banks that I
mentioned could not offer the
accounts.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000300">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">A
key feature of the saving gateway is the fund matching element; the
Government offered a contribution for each £1 saved. The pilots
showed that that provided a simple, transparent and easily understood
incentive to save. Building on that, the Government recognised the need
for a wider section of society to develop the savings habit earlier in
life. The Budget 2010 announced that the Government would explore
options for widening access to matched savings accounts, with the
potential addition of more support by the end of this
Parliament.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000301">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Obviously,
things have changed, and we are no longer the Government, but the
principle was accepted by the Opposition and the Liberal Democrats as a
good thing. The only problem now appears to be the fact that it will
cost £150 million a year. Again, I accept that it might be the
Minister’s choice to make those on lower incomes the issue when
it comes to funding the deficit reduction plan, but I cannot see why he
will not accept the amendment and offer the payment holiday.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000302">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
is difficult for me to propose such an amendment, because we were
looking forward to the beginning of the scheme in July this year, but
the Minister has the chance to say that he will maintain the Act on the
statute book and reflect on it over the next three years. At any point
in that three-year period, he can introduce amendments that start the
scheme in July, as initially planned. He can commence it in 2011, 2012
or 2013; indeed, in 2014, at the end of the three-year period, he can
consider whether to pass another measure to defer the scheme for
another year or bring it on board.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000303">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">If
the Minister believed that the scheme was a good thing when it was
introduced in 2009, and if his only objection now is the cost, the
amendment will give him a chance to put the cost aside and not roll out
the scheme, while maintaining the principle of it so that at some
point, the cross-party co-operation on this issue among the Liberals,
the previous Government and him could come into
play.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000304">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
saving gateway account is open for those on income support,
jobseeker’s allowance, incapacity benefit, employment support
allowance, severe disability allowance, carer’s allowance or tax
credits. There will be a lot more people on jobseeker’s
allowance in the near future due

save for the future. Incapacity benefit changes are in play, and I
accept that, but we need to look at the issues. The basic principle is
there: there is a scheme in place, which could provide a vehicle, that
does not need the £150 million the Minister mentioned.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000305">&#160;</a>

coalition agreement. There is no coalition agreement to abolish the
saving gateway; there is no agreement by the Liberals or the

was concerned about savings and poor people having an opportunity to
save? If that is the case, perhaps he could say so today, but if, as I
hope, he believed what he said at the time and thought that the saving
gateway was a good thing, and, with the Liberal Democrats, believed
that it was a mechanism to encourage saving, to allow contributions
from the state to poorer people and to have the partnership that we
have talked about throughout our proceedings, will he reflect on that

Accounts Act 2009, but reconsider it when the economic situation

reading of the current Budget proposals and the previous Budget
proposals. The question I ask might make me look foolish, but it is
important to ask it anyway. The March 2009 Labour Budget, “Table

funding spend was £10 million for 2010-11,

£10 million. That is in column 21 of the Red Book for the Labour
Government’s Budget. In the Budget policy decisions, part of
June’s Conservative Budget, item 28 on page 40
says:<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000313">&#160;</a>

it says that the savings in 2010 will be £10 million.
That tallies with the Labour Government proposal—savings of

tallies with the Labour Government proposal. Savings in 2012-13 are
£75 million. Savings for 2012-13 under the Labour Government

                           </strong> Let me be clear at the outset. As I said on Second
Reading, I support the aims that lie behind the saving gateway. The
right hon. Gentleman quoted at length from my speech when the original
debate took place and I do not back away from those words at all. Also,
I recognise the attraction of matching as a means of encouraging
savings. There is quite a lively debate in the pensions and savings
world about that issue.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000319">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">However,
we have also been absolutely clear that we will not launch a saving
gateway scheme during this Parliament, and there are two principal
reasons for that. The first is that the scheme would cost more than
£300 million during the next five years and in the context of
the deficit that we face, it is unavoidable that we have to cancel this
scheme.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000320">&#160;</a>

right hon. Gentleman talked about the gap between what was in the
Budget document this year and what was in the previous
Government’s Budget document. I think that he will find that the
cost of the saving gateway scheme was score-carded in an earlier Budget
by the right hon. Member for Edinburgh South West (Mr Darling), the
former Chancellor.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000321">&#160;</a>

subject on a number of occasions, so I understand its enthusiasm, but
there are more effective ways of helping credit unions than this
expensive scheme. The £10 million mentioned in the 2010 Budget
was the cost of rolling the scheme out to post offices; the scorecard
cost was from 2008.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000328">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
evidence is mixed. It is not entirely clear that the saving gateway
account would have added to savings. On that basis, and given the
fiscal position that the country faces, it is not appropriate to
continue with the programme, and I expressed those concerns during the
debate on the saving gateway account. Indeed, before the second pilot,
questions were raised about whether the scheme would be effective in
meeting the objective of increasing savings. There was no statistically
significant evidence that, in delivering genuine net savings, the
saving gateway account would still deliver higher net worth. The
evidence is uncertain. Carl Emmerson of the IFS made the same
point.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000329">&#160;</a>

roll it out in this Parliament. It is best that the measure is removed
from the statute book, and that is the purpose of clause 2. It provides
absolute clarity to all who are interested that the Government do not
intend to pursue it. Anyone who came forward with a scheme at a later

encourage people to make greater use of the post office network, and I
know that the post office will offer greater service, acting as a
conduit and allowing customers of other banks to use it for
transactions. That has already happened in a number of cases. The
credit unions have put forward a proposal to use the post office
infrastructure to help the growth of their business. We are looking a
range of activities that could strengthen the post office network. It
is important when tackling financial inclusion to increase the number
of access points. One problem with that project is that there would
clearly not be enough access points. That was one reason why we chose

too quickly to abolish something that many people have said would have
been a good thing in principle—even the Minister said that again
just now. Why is it necessary at this point to do away with the

ice—although I would much rather see it start to

the event, we would have been in a position to incentivise people on
very low incomes to save—they will not be incentivised by tax
schemes because they do not pay tax, which was the particular reason
for a matching scheme. We do not want to reinvent it, to re-legislate
and to set up again everything that went into the legislation—we
saw how long it took from when the legislation went through in 2009
until the point in 2010 when it was about to come into force. Why is it
necessary to do away with it, unless it is not actually a good
thing—although that has not been clear from what the Minister
has
said?<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000340">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">There
is so much ambiguity in what is being said. On the one hand, changes of
this sort are presented as being an economic necessity—they have
to be done because of the deficit. On the other, there is a lot of
criticism of the proposed scheme itself—it is not necessarily
the best way to help people to save, and we can help credit unions in
some other way, although
unspecified.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000341">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
clear evidence of the credit unions to the Committee was that the
scheme was by no means the only way  in which people could
save. Equally, however, the representatives of the credit unions said
that it was an important means of doing so. It was one way in which the
business could be built up. People could be incentivised to save and
put in contact with credit unions, some perhaps having not been in such
contact before. In so doing, those people would become eligible for
cheaper loans on a short-term basis, if needed to face a crisis. By
making contact with a credit union, they would be open to getting
advice and assistance that they might not have sought before, which, in
turn, would also help them with their wider financial problems. As a
means of helping people not just save but actually get in touch with
cheaper forms of credit and financial advice, that important vehicle
enabled that to
happen.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000342">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">If
credit unions do not have enough outlets, one of the things under
discussion—I hope still under discussion—is the
suggestion that they might be able to operate in partnership with post
offices. That would give people another means of getting in contact
with credit unions, which would be a good thing. The lack of it having
happened prior to July 2010 does not seem to be a reason for not going
ahead with such a proposal. If the scheme had gone ahead and people had
started to use it, that would have been an opportunity to widen
provision and would have strengthened the case for that link with the
Post
Office.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000343">&#160;</a>

wait for ever. People need to see their friends and neighbours and the
people in their community being enabled to save in this way—one
of the biggest ways that people are helped, initially at least, to make
contact with organisations such as the credit unions is through word of

                           </strong> I certainly agree with my hon. Friend that it is
regrettable that the idea of a Post Office bank seems to have gone the
way of many other proposals. I hope that the proposals on partnerships
between credit unions and post offices will not go the same way
because, regardless of whether there is the saving gateway or not, such
partnerships would immensely benefit both credit unions and local
communities.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000347">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">My
point about the second pilot was that although there was evidence that
some people who had saved in this manner would have saved otherwise,
that generally related to people on higher incomes. The second part of
the saving gateway spanned a broad level of income, which the proposal
in the Act would not—a much more limited scheme was legislated
on. The people on the lowest incomes and on benefits who were in that
saving gateway pilot were the very people who did save when they had
previously not saved, albeit the amounts were small. As was much
discussed in the evidence given by various people to the Committee,
small savings can make a tremendous difference to people’s
financial position and to their ability to weather the storms that they
come across.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000348">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Is
the Minister saying that the scheme is such a thoroughly bad idea that
it should not be reopened at a future date without having to go through
a legislative process? If that is the case, it means starting again
from scratch with all the paraphernalia of legislation. That is
absolutely not necessary. I still fundamentally believe that it is
regrettable even to suggest putting the scheme on ice because, in such
a difficult time, people are experiencing greater financial difficulty,
and I suspect that many will go to much less creditable places to get
loans.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000349">&#160;</a>

that putting the scheme on ice was not the preferred option, in fact I
hoped that even the three-year gap that we have now suggested could, in
fact, be a six-month gap. The simple objective is to avoid the
cancellation that clause 2 currently provides
for.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000350">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I thank my right hon. Friend for clarifying the
position that he was putting forward. This is a particularly difficult
time not just for the country, but for people on low incomes.
Unemployment has risen and hours of work have shrunk. People are
struggling to keep going. The evidence given to the Committee from
various witnesses demonstrated that if people can be assisted to make
some financial provision during the times when they have a bit more
income, they will be in a stronger position to be resilient when they
perhaps lose their job or are asked to go on to short time or
experience any of the other financial difficulties that could
arise.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000351">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">If
people do not make such a provision and they find themselves in
difficulties, they might have to get more deeply into debt. That will
significantly worsen their position. In the end, in many ways, the
costs will have to be picked up by the taxpayer regardless, because
more people may have to seek crisis loans through the DWP or people
will get into such difficulty with their finances that they will not
only take out loans, but end up in rent arrears, lose their homes and
have to be re-housed in temporary accommodation. Those people will make
even greater calls on the taxpayer in due
course.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000352">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Small-scale
schemes that help people’s financial resilience may, in fact, be
a saving to the taxpayer, rather than being in any way a drain. In some
ways, this measure is one of the most important parts of the three
proposals in the Bill. If I were asked to pick one of these to save, it
would be this one in particular, because it is so important to such a
wide range of communities. That said, I am unhappy to see any of them
going. If it has to go into abeyance in the meantime, at least we would
have the structure to pick it up again. If the Government are correct,
we should be in a position in due course to see things improving and,
at that point, perhaps even the Government will be prepared to pick up
the scheme again. I urge the Minister to accept the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000353">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I want to comment on the message that the
abolition of this scheme would send to two groups of people. First of
all, consider the message to the small savers. People want to save and
the success of savings companies such as Farepak proves that. They do
not, however, always save in the right places. For me, the saving
gateway steered people to organisations that they trusted and were in
the community, like credit unions. It stopped unscrupulous
organisations taking advantage of them. It was said in the evidence
that it was the distance from organisations that stopped people saving.
Often, it comes down to how far people have to walk. In my local
community of Makerfield, they do not have to walk that far to get to a
credit union. A savings gateway would have given people the nudge that
Mark Lyonette, the president of ABCUL, said was so important to start
people saving. There was a lot of discussion about whether the saving
is simply about moving money from one place to another. I make no
apology for saying that if people are ceasing to pay phenomenal amounts
of interest and phenomenal amounts for goods to organisations such as
BrightHouse, because they have no savings, I for one will be
grateful.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000354">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
other message is to the institutions. The credit unions said that they
were concerned that that they would find it difficult to trust
Government schemes in the future, given the withdrawal of the original
scheme 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 244<a class="bkMark" name="Column244">&#160;</a>
                           </div>at such short notice. By freezing the scheme—I would still like
to see it go ahead—the message to the organisations that have
planned for it is that it will happen in the future, that they have not
wasted their time and that their business planning did have a purpose.
In my area, the credit unions are fragile. They do not get a lot of
money in and this scheme was important to them in expanding, as was the
growth fund produced by the previous Government, which gave them a
tremendous boost. A small amount of money gives an organisation such as
a credit union a tremendous boost.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000355">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
support the idea of placing the saving gateway with the credit unions
because of the unions’ reach into the community, their ability
to touch those who are financially excluded and their work to combat
financial inclusion. Although it is not their primary purpose, we have
heard that 500 credit unions already run financial inclusion schemes,
working with the people who invest with them. We could build on that
and assist people so that they do not get into debt and so that they do
not go to organisations that take advantage of them. The saving gateway
would have assisted in encouraging the small savers—giving them
that nudge—to start saving with a reputable organisation. It
would also help those organisations to expand their reach and to assist
people by giving them the advice that they need at a particular time of
their life. I suggest that we do not abolish the saving gateway. We
should keep it on the books so that we can return to it. It is a scheme
that was welcomed by everyone—do not send the message that it
will not come
back.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000356">&#160;</a>

have had a useful debate, but some issues relating to the amendment
still need to be teased out. First, I refer to the Committee’s

gateway scheme. She asked him what his experience was of the saving
gateway pilots, and I am grateful for her help in raising those issues.

38 would give the Government the opportunity not to cancel, scrap or
end the saving gateway pilots, but to continue to ask whether they
should be rolled out at any time between now and 1 January
2014—or indeed after that. It would also give the Minister an
opportunity to reflect on the success of the scheme. Mr Lyonette said

for Christmas. He said, citing his comments to the

perhaps larger financial institutions can. Does my right hon. Friend

disaster that had an impact on her constituents and many other people.
Hon. Members will remember that Farepak hampers were a way for
individuals to save for Christmas through a scheme that, as my hon.
Friend said, was extremely important. Farepak collapsed in 2006 causing
much discomfort across the country, with many thousands of people
losing their savings. There was no Government-organised saving scheme
or saving gateway network for poor people, such as the scheme that
would have been put in place for those on lower incomes and benefits.
Because of that, the Farepak scheme was in place. Thousands of families
saved with Farepak, believing that their money was safe in a scheme
that was not underwritten by major companies such as HBOS, the Post
Office or the Lloyds Bank Group, as this scheme would have been. People
saved with what turned out to be a completely useless scheme that lost
them lots of money.

hon. Members if they have been in Parliament for a long time. They will
have seen people who borrowed a small amount of
money—£50, £60 or £70—from an
unscrupulous lender, and because of that, they have to pay vast amounts
of interest and are in hock. I know of an individual in a nearby
constituency who recently went to prison to serve a long sentence. The
Assets Recovery Agency has taken away his home because of his
unscrupulous lending. Poor people in Runcorn, Widnes, Warrington,
Cheshire, Chester and Liverpool—my part of the world on the
English side of the border—were ripped off by unscrupulous
lenders because of a small amount of money.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000395">&#160;</a>

rolled out, this scheme would have ensured help and support for poorer
people on low incomes, or no income at all, to help them save with
support from the Government and ensure that should a crisis happen,
they might have £100 in a savings account. At the end of the
two-year period, as currently constituted, that account would have been
matched by the Government and could have been a little more than the
initial saving. That amount of money might have made the difference
between facing a loan shark, and not having to do that; between someone
losing their resources and finding themselves paying exorbitant rates
of interest, and that not happening. That is why it is an important

bad debt and, in the longer term, a partnership between the Government

want the Committee just to take matters from me, but we are faced with
the abolition of the scheme under the clause. The amendment would hold
the abolition for three years and provide for the evidence to be
reconsidered in detail. It does not want matters to be rushed, but for
time to be devoted to such

may be overlooked by many but the 2010 budget announced that the Saving
Gateway has been deemed ‘unaffordable’ and so will not go
ahead as planned. The Saving Gateway was a ground-breaking scheme
designed to incentivise and reward saving among low-income families by
providing a ‘match’ for each £1 saved. Rigorous
pilots have shown that the Saving Gateway has been effective in
increasing saving amongst low-income
families.”<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000618">&#160;</a>

                        <p>Evidence
from the IPPR’s consumer-spending and debt research showed that
low-income families spend, save and borrow, that most families wanted
to save and that many successfully saved for Christmas and birthdays
because of the scheme. She cites an example, which is worth putting on
the record, of a 33-year-old parent with two children who told the IPPR
that she had not been one for long-term saving, but that she can now
save for a
purpose.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000400">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="hs_brev">“Families
had often interpreted ‘saving’ as not spending and were
able to juggle income and expenditure for a particular event. But most
families did not manage to build up any ‘rainy day’
savings.”<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000619">&#160;</a>

on low incomes often do not have insurance, so when the crisis hits,
the washing machine breaks down or there is a flood, they are driven
into the hands of the loan shark and into debt, and, dare I say it,
that debt sometimes drives them to crime. Those things are avoidable.

scope to reduce the Government contribution, therefore potentially
making the product more affordable in the medium and long term. Does my
hon. Friend agree that, given that there is a discrepancy even among
expert witnesses who are committed to the product in terms of their
attitude to the Government’s match funding, it would allow time

would cost £115 million this year, next year and the year after.

does not need to scrap it, and could, if I dare say so, scrap it after
three years if he so chooses. It would not cost him a penny in the

scheme when it was in opposition, votes against the amendment to delay
the abolition, and on clause stand part, votes to abolish the scheme,
he will deprive 3,490 people as of September 2010 in his constituency
who are on jobseeker’s allowance, never mind those on income
support, incapacity benefit, disability allowance, carer’s
allowance and all those who are earning less than £16,000 a
year. That applies only to jobseeker’s allowance; those are the
only statistics that I have been able to garner in the past hour, but
they illustrate the impact on people. The hon. Gentleman will deprive
those people of the ability to participate in the saving gateway

particularly relevant, let us look for example at the constituency of

2,185 people on jobseeker’s allowance at this moment in time.
The hon. Member for Congleton, who I come to next on my alphabetical
list, has 1,237 people on jobseeker’s allowance in her
constituency. So, the proportional impact, which we shall come on to in
a moment in terms of the equality assessment, is greater in the

constituency of the hon. Member for Congleton, in terms of

                        <p class="tabbed">The
scheme was supported by the hon. Lady’s party and the Liberal
Democrats in opposition, as well as by the then Government. The scheme
would have been operational from July. Of the 1,237 people in Congleton
constituency, let us say that just 237 of them decided to save. That
would have been 237 people who could have saved in her constituency and
had match-funding from the Government, as part of the £115
million—yet now they
cannot.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000440">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">My
amendment asks the Minister to reflect on that concern in Congleton and
to say whether he wishes to deny those people the opportunity to
save—remember, they are unemployed, low income,
jobseeker’s allowance individuals, who are not in any of the
other categories. So, only 1,237 in Congleton on JSA, but I am sure
there would have been more people in due course on all the other
things. They are being denied this benefit, disproportionately more
even than those in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for

people in my constituency on jobseeker’s allowance, which is
pretty much on a par with the hon. Member for Congleton, except that my
constituency is smaller than hers and I have a large number of people
unemployed. They would have benefited. In my own patch, the Flintshire
credit union would have been happy to help develop the scheme. Still in
my constituency, there are some 15 or 16 post offices that would have
been happy to participate in the scheme. I know that many of my wards,
including the Flint Castle ward in the town I live in, are among the
most deprived wards in Wales. They would have benefited—poorer
people in my constituency, who are unemployed and need the support of
the state, would have been able to access the scheme and to put money
aside for the problems that they
face.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000442">&#160;</a>

people on JSA is the best way to promote a savings habit and financial
inclusion, rather than for example getting those people into work
through the extensive Work programme that we will be implementing, then
I imagine that he might have something to justify to his own unemployed
constituents. I think that simply justifying that these people should
be left on unemployment benefit and given various rather meaningless
pieces of money such as this rather than getting them into sustainable
work is the sort of new Labour gimmickry that my unemployed

is completely wrong, because we want to try to secure full employment.
I am simply saying to her that, as of today, the 957 people—she
was almost right—in her constituency who were on
jobseeker’s allowance in September would have qualified for this
scheme and would now be able to put money aside. Moreover, if they came
off JSA and they went into a low-paid job, paying less than
£16,000 a year, as they may do initially, they could still
continue that saving gateway.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000444">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
saving gateway was a way in which we could help people to save even
when they were on incapacity benefit, on JSA, on income support, on
disability allowance and indeed if they were going to work at lower
levels of pay. It particularly applied to part-time women workers who
might take a job and come off jobseeker’s allowance, but they
would have been able to maintain that savings culture
accordingly.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000445">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> That is a fascinating point and I am grateful to
the right hon. Gentleman for actually keeping us awake in this extended
sitting. However, the point that I am trying to make—perhaps I
am not making it very well—is that we have heard a lot of
evidence that low income and unemployment is associated with poor
savings habits, and I think that all of us have grave concerns about
that. Therefore, if we are suggesting the opposite, which is that
earning more is a way to stimulate saving, surely the best way to help
people to save is to get them into better-paid, sustainable work, as
our Government are proposing to do and as the last Government failed so
dismally to do.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000446">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I pay tribute to the hon. Lady for wanting to
create employment opportunities and I will support her in those
efforts. However, the fact of the matter is that at the moment there
are 957 people in her own constituency on JSA and they could have
qualified, however temporarily, for the saving gateway scheme that
would have operated from July and people on JSA could have qualified in
the future for the same scheme. If they had come off JSA and gone into
low-paid employment, they could still have qualified for that scheme.
It is important to keep that savings culture going.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000447">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
mentioned Devizes, but equally I could go on—as I will
do—to my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh East, who is next
in the alphabet. In her constituency, there are 2,375 people on JSA. As
a relatively small constituency, it has a much higher proportion of
people on JSA than is the case in the constituencies of the hon.
Members for Congleton and for Devizes.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000448">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Again,
I hope that we will be able to develop further employment opportunities
in Edinburgh, but at the same time that we are doing that this saving
gateway scheme would have been available and the Minister has an
opportunity during the next three years to keep it available.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000449">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Let
me look at Fareham—how could I possibly avoid Fareham in this
round-robin review of the Committee? In Fareham, there are currently
978 people on JSA. That number has fallen during the last year. In
every other constituency that I have talked about to date, the number
of people on JSA has risen, but in the last year in Fareham the number
of people on JSA has gone from 1,291 to 978. So it is no wonder that
the Minister is not too worried about what happens to people on JSA and
the savings culture, because the number of people on JSA in his
constituency is falling. I accept that there are still 978 people in
his constituency on JSA, but there has been a fall over the past 12
months and the Minister is now denying those 978 people the opportunity
to be considered for that particular scheme.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000450">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Let
me look next at Makerfield. Currently, there are 2,182 people in
Makerfield on JSA. There is a pattern here, Mr Howarth, and the pattern
is that those areas that have greater deprivation have a higher level

                           </strong> It is important, Mr Howarth, that we reflect upon
the impact of this measure on individual constituencies. I was simply
trying to say that before Members vote on these matters, they need to
consider that.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000453">&#160;</a>

have received some news from my hon. Friend the Member for West Ham,
which will relate to the comments that I am able to make in the
Committee and the new strictures, Mr Howarth, may indeed be of help in
coming to a conclusion on this matter very shortly. For the sake of
accuracy and so we do not think they have missed out on these matters,
I will just say that the hon. Member for Reading West has 2,323 people
on jobseeker’s allowance; in the constituency of the hon. Member
for Scarborough and Whitby, the Government Whip, that number is
currently 2,188; and in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member
for South Down a very disturbing level of 3,655 people are on
jobseeker’s allowance. Again, that backs up the points I have
made
today.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000454">&#160;</a>

say to the hon. Member for Truro and Falmouth that one of the benefits
of being a ‘T’ is that it takes a while to get around to
her constituency. I did not want to miss her out; it is just that she
is quite low down in the alphabet—although not as low as Wirral
West and West Ham. In Truro and Falmouth, she has 1,208 people on
jobseeker’s
allowance.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000455">&#160;</a>

Urmston— I am sorry. My hon. Friend will have to excuse
me, but I put this together in haste during the half hour between
half-past 7 and 8 o’clock. I have been rushing through it.
Stretford and Urmston has 2,625 people on jobseeker’s allowance.
On the last three—I do not wish to test your patience any
further, Mr Howarth—I say to my hon. Friend that West Ham has
5,931 people on jobseeker’s allowance. Again, the pattern is
that hon. Members who represent Labour seats, where there is a higher
level of people claiming jobseeker’s allowance, will be
disproportionately hit by the measure. In Wirral South the number of
people claiming jobseeker’s allowance is 1,188 and in West
Worcestershire the figure is 1,235. I am grateful to you, Mr Howarth,
for your patience in allowing me to run through those figures. The
point I am trying to make is that there are some key issues
here.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000457">&#160;</a>

non-abolition will not cost the Minister or the state any resource over
the next three years. I have moved a long way in giving up the
£115 million next year, the year after and the year after. I
hope that the Minister will accept the amendment and will revise and
listen to the representations made in evidence sessions by my hon.

nurturing and fostering a saving habit among women on low incomes, I
think that it is particularly important to note that, generally, women
are in charge of household finances, and they live in areas where they
are perhaps more vulnerable to pressure from loan sharks, doorstep
lenders, and all of the other issues that my right hon. Friend raised
when he talked about the importance of the saving gateway scheme.
Endless research by child poverty groups—I am sure that my hon.
Friend the Member for Stretford and Urmston could back me up on
this—shows that having some money set aside, a little lump sum
in reserve, for difficult times is incredibly important and incredibly
useful for those struggling to get by and struggling to make ends meet
on a low income. Usually people in such situations, who are used 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 259<a class="bkMark" name="Column259">&#160;</a>
                           </div>to coping on a very low income, are very careful and know exactly how
much they have to get by on and have to eke out. They know when they
are getting towards the end, before the next money comes in, and there
are often examples of women going without food so that they can feed
their
children.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000484">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">When
something goes wrong, it really hits hard: if, for example, they have
just about managed to get the money together for a car, and then
suddenly the car breaks down and needs major repair—without that
car they cannot get the kids to school and they cannot go to their
part-time job—or if the fridge stops working; or if the heating
breaks down and the boiler needs repairing. Those are the things that
knock people completely off course. Although that is not specific to
women on low incomes, it tends to be women—90% of lone parents,
for example, are women—who are much more likely to find
themselves in such a vulnerable position. As I said, they are also far
more vulnerable to people who prey on them and force them down other
routes, such as the loan sharks, the doorstep lenders or the people who
charge absolutely phenomenal interest rates. They are also far more
likely to be in sporadic employment, partly because of having to take
maternity leave and so on, but also because women tend to be in
part-time jobs that do not have the same job
security.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000485">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
purpose of the saving gateway is to promote a saving habit among people
on lower incomes, and, because of that, the Bill is very disappointing.
We have already debated whether equality impact assessments were
carried out prior to previous legislation, but in some ways that is not
relevant to what we are talking about today. Moving forward, now that
we have the Equality Act 2010 legislation and the framework for
carrying out equality impact assessments, we should be looking at the
specific impact of these measures on people from excluded
communities.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000486">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We
took evidence from the Association of British Credit Unions Limited
during the evidence session, and my right hon. Friend the Member for
Delyn has talked in some detail about the credit union movement. I know
that there is cross-party support for the credit union movement,
because I set up the all-party group on credit unions. My successor as
chair of the group when I was appointed to the Whips Office was Ian
McCartney, who was the previous Member for the constituency of my hon.
Friend the Member for Makerfield. The current chair of the group is a
Conservative Member, and I certainly know that when I was drumming up
support it was one of the best subscribed all-party
groups.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000487">&#160;</a>

are people who really appreciate the role of the credit unions, and we
have already heard that the credit union movement is very disappointed
that the saving gateway is not going to be rolled out. The reason I
refer again to the credit union movement, as my right hon. Friend the
Member for Delyn has done, is because I asked ABCUL for statistics on
who its client base would be, assuming that the saving gateway would be
rolled out in part through the credit union movement. ABCUL has said
that women make up more than two thirds of its membership. So 67% of
credit union customers are women, and 19% of its customers—that
is nearly one in five—are from BME backgrounds. Considering that
many credit unions are located in rural areas, there is quite a
substantial take up from the BME community in those areas that have a
high BME population.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000488">&#160;</a>

their own homes, who are in part-time employment or who are unemployed,
the Bristol credit union found that—based on the people who gave
them statistics about their background—25% are from the BME
community and 52% live in social housing. It is clear that the
demographics of some of those affected by the Bill are
disproportionately likely to be women and from BME groups, because the
credit union will not be able to roll out the saving gateway or to
encourage a savings habit among
them.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000489">&#160;</a>

have been told that the credit union movement will be reluctant to
venture into new financial products in future, so there will be other
knock-on effects. We have also heard powerful evidence from Marc Bush
of Scope about the importance of the saving gateway for people with
disabilities. Members are probably anxious to get home or to attend the
end of the debate in the Chamber, so I will not quote him at length,
but he said that the saving gateway

a good thing in that they gave people an opportunity to save without
penalty at a reasonable rate of return, which is really important,
because those products just do not exist for disabled adults. The
national roll-out would have pushed that forward to a whole group of
disabled people who are financially excluded from the products that are
on the market at the moment.”<em>––</em>[<em>Official

plug pulled, that looks less likely to happen. I do not think that just
because the service would not be available to everybody across the

most deprived areas—that one should say it is not a good thing.

                           </strong> That is a negative way of looking at the issue.
It works well if people, who would otherwise be financially excluded,
are able to access financial services because there is a good credit
union in their neighbourhood. We have such a credit union in Bristol
with Money Go Round, which is five credit unions merged into one and
which reaches out to communities. As I have said, 25% of its clients
are from a BME background and 52% are in social housing. It reaches out
to people who were not previously served by financial
services.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000494">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">When
the Treasury Committee had an inquiry into financial inclusion, we
looked at basic bank accounts and the reluctance of high street lenders
to offer them to people from poorer backgrounds, partly on the basis of
postcodes and partly because they were not seen as good customers from
a commercial point of view. If one says that the system works well, but
because some people cannot benefit from it at the moment, we should
scrap it, that is showing a very defeatist attitude. I would also say
that communities without credit unions are often those that do not need
them, because they are better served by mainstream banking services.
The focus should be on those who are financially excluded, who tend to
be in urban areas, many of which are well served by the credit union
movement. As I have said, I have had long conversations with ABCUL, so
I am well versed in that movement. I appreciate that there are plenty
of parts of the country that would benefit from having a credit
union.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000495">&#160;</a>

cannot say that there is a geographical disadvantage, without looking
at the problem in relation to income levels and whether people belong
to an excluded group, have disabilities or are from the BME background.
That helps to make our point that unless there is an equality impact
assessment, how does one know which people will be affected by the
proposed changes—that is the whole nub of it. A comprehensive
equality impact assessment would show whether the geographical
variances had an impact on minority groups or those who are financially
excluded, or whether that was less of a
problem.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000496">&#160;</a>

We are rushing into axing child trust funds and the health in pregnancy
grant, and not proceeding with the saving gateway, when all those
schemes are in their early stages. As my right hon. Friend the Member
for Delyn said when debating his amendments, we are not necessarily
saying that money must be pumped into the schemes now; we are only
saying, “Let’s look into the impact that axing them would
have and whether it’s possible to keep them going.”
Perhaps as far as the child trust funds are concerned, we could keep
the framework. Then, when the economy recovers, we might be able to put
some money into the scheme, rather than throwing the baby out with the
bathwater and axing everything completely.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000498">&#160;</a>

return to the evidence, Mr Bush from Scope identified three aggravating
features that affect disabled people’s access to mainstream
financial services: inadequate financial capability and skills, lack of
financial information and advice and the absence of appropriate
financial products. He said that because people with disabilities often
live on a mixture of benefits and income, mainstream financial services
do not cope well with trying to analyse 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 262<a class="bkMark" name="Column262">&#160;</a>
                           </div>their household income. Sometimes they do not take the benefits into
account, will not accept gaps in employment and so on.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000499">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Mr
Bush thought that the saving gateway, tied as it is to advice on
financial capability issues, offered people with disabilities an
opportunity. As he pointed out, through the personalisation programme,
which I know the Government are keen on, disabled people are now being
given significant lump sums of money of their own—up to
£50,000—to manage and to buy in services. That is quite a
step for someone who has relied on fairly small amounts of weekly
income. He thought that it was important that people should be given
financial advice and support to manage that income. He also highlighted
the fact that people with disabilities are vulnerable to less reputable
lenders and loan sharks.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000500">&#160;</a>

the former Government believed so strongly in the importance of
equality impact assessments—they put them into legislation, as
the hon. Member for West Ham pointed out, in 2010—surely she, as
a member of the Government, should have been arguing those very points.
Will she assure me that she at least made those points robustly to

Howarth. Regardless of the history relating to whether there should
have been more equality impact assessments, I would argue that the
initial impact assessment was half-hearted. A long time ago, I was
about to quote the chief executive of the Fawcett Society. She said
that the assessment that was carried out was<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000509">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“only
partial and almost flippant in its lack of detail. The Treasury has
explicitly chosen not to undertake any detailed consideration of the
impact of benefit cuts, job losses or the slashed local authority
budget – the three areas the Fawcett Society identified as
particularly harmful to women's future economic independence and
financial security.”<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000626">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">When
the Minister for Women and Equalities was pressed on whether she
planned to publish equality impact assessments as part of the CSR, a
vague, fudged answer was given. At one point, she said that she had no
plans to commission separate work on how the provisions in the Budget
would affect women. During an Adjournment debate on the impact of the
Budget on women, the issue was again fudged, despite my hon. Friend the
Member for Slough (Fiona Mactaggart) trying to get an answer. Given
that the saving gateway project is targeted at particular groups, the
removal of that scheme will have, at least potentially, a
disproportionate impact on people from black and minority ethnic
backgrounds and on people with disabilities in particular. I think that
we would all agree that Marc Bush from Scope gave particularly powerful
evidence highlighting the problems that people with disabilities have
in accessing any financial services, but particularly in trying to get
on to the savings ladder and in trying to access financial
advice.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000510">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Finally,
on the impact that the measures would have on women, it is absolutely
crucial that before the Government go ahead with axing the
scheme—as my right hon. Friend the Member for Delyn has said,
there is no need to rush into this; they could postpone the end
date—a detailed equality impact assessment is carried out. We
could then see whether some of those harder-to-reach groups and groups
that are more disadvantaged could be helped, perhaps through other
measures, or perhaps through the continuation of the scheme. I urge the
Minister to think again and consider supporting the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000511">&#160;</a>

made on amendment 36 about why we went down this route and why we went
for an initial assessment rather than the full equality impact
assessment; I do not want to test the patience of the Committee. In the
initial assessment, we went through the impact on various groups, and
we acknowledged that our decision not to launch the saving gateway
could have a greater impact on people with disabilities. They are
disproportionally affected, in the sense that two of the passported
benefits relate to disability and incapacity benefit. The measures will
affect people in particular age groups, which we bear in mind. However,
the impact on women is not significant, as they only made up slightly
more than half of the eligible
population.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000512">&#160;</a>

hon. Member for Bristol East referred to the points raised by Scope and
mentioned access to financial information. She makes an important
point. Access to such information is an important way of encouraging
people to save, enabling them to manage their money; that way, they can
try to avoid the clutches of loan sharks and try to understand some of
the issues about pay-day loans. That is why, to tackle some of the
issues, we support the roll-out of a national financial advice service
and the provision of an annual financial health check, available to all
families for free; that will be funded by industry but organised by the
Consumer Financial Education Body. It will ensure that some of the
difficult-to-reach groups have access to information. That goes
alongside the national roll-out of pilot projects that were started
last year, with face-to-face advice for difficult-to-reach
groups.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000513">&#160;</a>

I do not believe that anyone should be discriminated against when it
comes to the provision of financial services. We must ensure that
proper steps are taken, so that there is widespread availability of
financial services products. One of the downfalls, unfortunately, of
the saving gateway scheme is that there would not have been such
availability, and there would not have been enough outlets to enable us
to spread the scheme across the whole country. Some groups would have
been excluded, on a geographical basis, from experiencing the
advantages of the scheme. There is more work to be done in this area,
and I do not believe that the saving gateway product would have
delivered the benefits that we would have liked, which is why we have
decided to scrap it. However, I think we have tried to identify some of
the issues relating to the equalities impact, and tried to look at how
we could mitigate some of those effects.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000516">&#160;</a>

equality impact assessments. I think I have made it quite clear that I
feel that a lot of what the Government have done since they were
elected in May, particularly in economic terms—in the Budget and
the spending review—has completely disregarded any concerns for
the disproportionate impact on certain groups, particularly women and
people from poorer

I tried to point out that in my own city, if there was involvement of

eligible for the saving gateway project would be high among particular
ethnic
groups.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000520">&#160;</a>

other day, and I know that there is a good credit union there. It has a
big customer base that again includes a large number of people from
black and ethnic minority backgrounds. That is obviously not the case
across the country, but that is why the issue is important. At the
moment, all the Government know is that there is no detailed breakdown

going too far to put in place the bureaucracy and expense necessary to
collect all that information. However, it seems that the Government
have so far done very little that would allow even the most rudimentary
research on which racial groups would be affected and whether it would
have a disproportionate impact on people from BME

people with a disability than the general
population.”<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000628">&#160;</a>

                        <p>Therefore,
it is accepted that more people with disabilities might be affected by
the measure being introduced than people from the general population.
For mitigating action, however, it states, “No specific
mitigation appropriate”. The Government seem to be
flagging  up the fact that people with disabilities will be
disproportionately affected, but they do not seem to think that that is
a problem worth doing something
about.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000526">&#160;</a>

on different gender groups, the impact assessment states that women
would have made up about 55% of the eligible population. I would argue
that one cannot look at it strictly in numerical terms and conclude
that 55% of the people who would qualify for it are women; one has to
look at the circumstances of women’s lives. In particular, they
are more likely to go in and out of employment, to be trying to juggle
many different things, such as part-time work and child care, and to be
moving from being totally reliant on wages to being totally reliant on
benefits, and sometimes a mixture in between.<a class="bkMark" name="10111036000527">&#160;</a>

think that there would have been a higher take-up by women of the
service that the saving gateway product would have offered, but I am
again speculating because the Government have not done the work in
determining whether that would be the case. That is a real opportunity
missed, because even if the Bill is passed and we end up without a
saving gateway scheme, I hope that the Government will take financial
inclusion and the idea of promoting a savings culture seriously enough
to look at putting something else in its place. We could have used that
