<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> It may be for the convenience of the 
Committee to know that the chair is entirely content if 
hon. Members wish to remove their jackets.
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Department of Social Security (Mr. Stephen Timms):</B> I beg to move,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That, during proceedings on the Welfare Reform and Pensions 
Bill, the Committee do meet on Tuesdays at half-past Ten o'clock 
and at half-past Four o'clock, except on Tuesday 9th March when 
the Committee will meet at half-past Ten o'clock only, and on 
Thursdays at Ten o'clock and at half-past Two o'clock.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I begin by welcoming all members of the Committee. 
May I say how pleased we all are to be working under our 
two Chairmen you, Mr. Malins, and Mr. McWilliam. I 
know that you will both guide us ably through this 
substantial Bill. both of you were with some of us during 
our deliberations on the Contributions Agency Transfer 
Bill the week before last. Few of us will wish to repeat 
the hours that we clocked up on that occasion, but in other 
respects it augured well for our work under your 
chairmanship and that of Mr. McWilliam.
<P>
I also welcome to the Committee the hon. Members for 
Grantham and Stamford (Mr. Davies) and for Newbury 
(Mr. Rendel), who will lead for the Opposition parties. 
Government Members look forward to the vigour with 
which they will no doubt press their arguments.
<P>
I also welcome my hon. Friend the Parliamentary 
Under-Secretary of State for Social Security, He will 
address much of the Bill at different stages of our 
deliberations, in particular the parts dealing with changes 
to disability benefits. I also take this opportunity to 
welcome my right hon. Friend the Minister for 
Employment, Welfare to Work and Equal Opportunities. 
He and I have worked closely together in the past and I 
look forward to our doing so again on this Committee. He 
will guide the Committee through the part of the Bill 
dealing with our central reforms on the single 
work-focused gateway to the benefit system, employment 
zones and other measures relating to job seekers' 
allowance.
<P>
Other hon. Members bring to the Committee a wide 
variety of experience. The hon. Member for Arundel and 
South Downs (Mr. Flight) and my hon. Friends the 
Members for Doncaster, North (Mr. Hughes), for Colne 
Valley (Kali Mountford) and for Gravesham (Mr. Pond) 
clearly enjoyed their experience on the previous Session's 
Social Security Bill and have come back for more. I am 
also pleased to see that the hon. Members for Beckenham 
(Mrs. Lait), for Canterbury (Mr. Brazier) and for 
Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh) and my hon. Friend the 
Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth (Mrs. McKenna) 
are on the Committee. I enjoyed their contributions on 
second Reading, although there was not much that I could 
agree with in what Opposition members said, except 
where the hon. members for Canterbury, for 
Gainsborough and for Grantham and Stamford revealed 
that they had not agreed with large chunks of the previous 
Government's programme. Perhaps we shall return to that 
matter during our deliberations. Other members of the 
Committee bring experience from the Social Security 
Select Committee, previous social security and education 
bills and elsewhere.
<P>
It may be helpful if I briefly outline the measures in 
the Bill so that the Committee can judge whether the 
sittings motion allows for their appropriate scrutiny.
<P>
The Bill introduces radical modernisation of the 
benefits and pensions system. The world has changed 
dramatically since Beveridge designed our welfare system 
50 years ago. Then, women worked mainly at home and 
Beveridge assumed that the would stay there. Today, two 
out of three women of working age work outside the 
home. Fifty years ago, the average life expectancy for 
men in retirement was about a year. Today, things have 
changed enormously for the better. Disabled people's 
expectations have changed dramatically: they are not 
willing to be consigned to the margins. Beveridge simply 
assumed that disabled people would not work. Today, 
disabled people rightly want to play a full part in our 
society and to fulfil their ambitions alongside everyone 
else.
<P>
The Bill has four key areas: a package of 
welfare-to-work measures, modernisation of disability 
benefits, modernisation of bereavement benefits and 
reform of the pension system.
<P>
The first area that we shall consider is pension 
reform. The Bill will establish the statutory basis for 
stakeholder pension schemes. By providing the 
framework for our new low-cost pension schemes, the 
Bill will give up to 5 million people who are without 
a second funded pension the chance to save for their 
retirement with the benefits of one.
<P>
The second major aspect of pension reform is delivery 
of our commitment to enable pension sharing. Pension 
rights will be treated like other assets, providing greater 
flexibility for those going through divorce and for the 
courts. There has been extensive consultation on those 
measures. The draft legislation was scrutinised in detail 
by the Social Security Select Committee, which produced 
a valuable report. The Select Committee included some 
hon. Members who are members of this Standing 
Committee the hon. Members for Arundel and South 
Downs and for Gainsborough and my hon. Friend the 
Member for Gravesham. The Bill also makes 
improvements to the regulatory regime for occupational 
and personal pensions.
<P>
The second key area is reform of bereavement benefits. 
The Bill will extend the bereavement benefit to men for 
the first time. The lump sum payable to provide more help 
with immediate costs, such as funeral expenses, will be 
doubled and, again for the first time, will be payable to 
widowers as well as widows. Bereavement benefit will be 
time limited where there are no children involved, but the 
Bill provides for transitional non-means-tested help for 
widows and widowers without children for the six months 
following bereavement.
<P>
The third key area is a package of welfare-to-work 
measures. The Bill will introduce the new single gateway 
for people of working age. That will ensure that, for the 
first time, people of working age can have the help and 
support that they need to get into or return to work, 
bringing the Employment Service, the Benefits Agency 
and local authorities together in a way that suits the 
individual rather than the bureaucracy. That will be a 
fundamental change for the better in the way in which our 
welfare system works and it will have far-reaching 
implications.
<P>
The second welfare-to-work measure in the Bill is the 
introduction of a requirement for joint claims to 
jobseeker's allowance from young couples without 
children. That will ensure that both members of a couple 
have access to the support and advice that they need from 
the Employment Service and, if they have been 
unemployed for more than six months, access to the new 
deal for young people.
<P>
The Bill also provides for the new programme of 
employment zones to focus resources on areas that suffer 
from persistently high unemployment, building on the 
prototype zones which are already operating. The new 
personal job account will help unemployed people aged 
25 or over to improve their skills, obtain extra help in 
finding work and even obtain help to set up in business 
for themselves.
<P>
The Bill will reform and modernise support for disabled 
people and includes provisions to introduce a personal 
capability assessment. The reforms will end the 
assumption that people on incapacity benefit cannot be 
helped, in the right circumstances, to work.
<P>
The Bill will restore incapacity benefit to its original 
intention of helping people who lose their income when 
illness or disability forces them to give up work. In future, 
it will be paid to those who have worked and made the 
right level of contributions in one of the previous two tax 
years. In addition, further provisions in the Bill introduce 
a fairer partnership between the state and employers by 
changing the way in which occupational or personal 
pensions are treated.
<P>
The Bill contains other changes in disability and 
sickness benefits, which were welcomed by hon. 
Members on both sides of the House on Second Reading. 
It will extend the higher rate mobility payment in 
disability living allowance to severely disabled children 
aged three and four. In future, people who are disabled in 
youth will be entitled to incapacity benefit without having 
to meet the usual contribution conditions. My right hon. 
Friend the Secretary of State for Social Security 
announced on Second Reading that the age limit for entry 
for that benefit will be increased to 25 for disabled young 
people in higher education. We propose to introduce an 
amendment in Committee to achieve that.
<P>
The Bill is wide-ranging and important. It begins the 
vital task of transforming and modernising our welfare 
system. We shall no longer abandon people merely to 
receiving benefits, when their position could be 
transformed by active help and advice. We have a major 
task ahead of us as we scrutinise the Bill clause by clause 
and I am confident that we shall be able to carry out our 
task in a good-natured and friendly Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies </B>(Grantham and Stamford): May I 
endorse what the Minister of State said, Mr. Malins, about 
the pleasure that we all feel in seeing you presiding over 
the Committee? We had a dress rehearsal for this 
Committee the other day, in another Committee, which 
had many of the same faces on both sides and, indeed, 
behind the Table. We observed the elegant and civilised 
manner in which you presided over that other sitting. 
Although it went on to a late hour, tempers never frayed 
and we owe much to you, Mr. Malins, for the fact that we 
were able to get through the business effectively and in a 
congenial fashion.
<P>
I should also like to pay tribute in advance to my 
colleagues who will support me during our deliberations. 
My hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar 
(Mr. Pickles), will support me as the other Opposition 
Front-Bench spokesman. He and I will share the burden 
a considerable one, as we have seen of ensuring that the 
Bill is thoroughly scrutinised and debated as it goes 
through Parliament and, where we can muster the voting 
strength to do so, of improving it. It is certainly badly in 
need of improvement.
<P>
It is also a great pleasure to see in Committee several 
colleagues with considerable experience and background 
knowledge to bring to our deliberations. They all have a 
distinguished record; we have not merely put anyone who 
was around on to the Committee; we have not 
press-ganged people. Hon. Members have come forward 
because they are keen to play a major part in the 
consideration of this important Bill. I trust that they will 
do so, when we hear from them. My hon. Friend the 
Member for Gainsborough has experience both in 
government and on the Back Benches, and has for many 
years played a major part on the Select Committee on 
Social Security.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South 
Downs has considerable professional experience in 
pensions and I hope that we shall hear from him on that 
subject and on others. He will bring a distinguished record 
to our debate. My hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury 
has, as the Minister mentioned, taken a great interest in 
family issues, in the House, as has my hon. Friend the 
Member for Beckenham, who will act as my Whip. With 
her looking at me with her usual eagle eye, and you 
looking at me with your's Mr. Malins, I shall have little 
chance of going astray.
<P>
I should also like to say what a pleasure it is to be 
debating with the Minister. He and I have known each 
other since he came into the House and in the previous 
Parliament we served as Back Benches on the Select 
Committee on Treasury, in which there were many 
occasions when we were able to agree constructively. 
May I congratulate him on his party's elevation to 
government and on his rapid promotion within it? It is a 
pleasure to be opposite him again, although I doubt that 
we shall always see eye to eye on the Bill.
<P>
The Minister for Employment, Welfare to Work and 
Equal Opportunities is also an old friend; I believe that he 
and I are exact contemporaries in the House. I recall that 
when we started here in 1987, we served together once or 
twice as Back Benchers on Standing Committees whose 
sittings were very long, so we have a great deal of 
experience there. He subsequently joined the then 
Opposition Treasury Front Bench, and we had some 
memorable times on opposite sides of Finance Bill 
Committees.
<P>
I should also like to welcome the Under-Secretary of 
State for Social Security, who has mastered his 
complicated brief very well in the time that he has been 
here, although he draws some peculiar conclusions from 
the facts that he has amassed and the briefs that he has 
digested. However, we can always hope that good 
argument will persuade sound and open minds and I do 
not doubt that Labour Members' minds are sound and 
open. We start our consideration of the Bill with 
optimism, despite the fact that the prevailing 
circumstances are not favourable or encouraging.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
On Second Reading, I said that one of the over-arching 
facts about the Bill is that it is a peculiar piece of 
legislation. It is really three Bills in one. Proper 
parliamentary consideration should be given to its 
provisions on stakeholder pensions and pension splitting 
on divorce and to its welfare measures, although the Bill 
should be called the welfare destruction Bill rather than 
the Welfare Reform and Pensions Bill. Our Second 
Reading debate was curtailed to just over four hours  it 
was deliberately held on the same day that there was a 
euro statement and a business statement. We spent less 
than one and a half hours considering each of the Bill's 
important themes. Frankly, that is pretty insulting to 
Parliament and it is not a good augury. I hope that the 
Government will not be tempted to try to steamroller the 
Committee in the way that they tried to steamroller 
Parliament on Second Reading. It is unfortunate to begin 
our sittings without having had the normal debate and 
scrutiny that a Bill's principles normally receive on 
Second Reading.
<P>
However, there is an even more disturbing 
development. I have not tabled an amendment proposing 
that we defer consideration of the provisions relating to 
stakeholder pensions until after 31 March because, for 
technical reasons, that would not be an acceptable 
amendment to a Bill. The Government have given the 
public assurances that are not in the Bill and we cannot 
therefore discuss them. That is a glaring inadequacy of 
the present situation and a clear example of Parliament 
and of the public who sent us here being treated with 
much less than the respect that they deserve.
<P>
The Government published their or perhaps I should 
say the Department of Social Security published its Green 
Paper on stakeholder pensions in December, and about six 
weeks later the Treasury produced different proposals on 
stakeholder pensions, involving the so-called lifelong 
individual savings account. Those documents stated that 
the consultation period would last until 31 March and 
comments were invited by that date. I am not making a 
rhetorical point. Many organisations have been working to 
try to meet that deadline. They believed that the 
Government's word could be taken at face value, the 
Government's invitation to the public to respond was 
genuine and given in good faith, and that there would be a 
proper consultation exercise. However, those organisations 
found that they had been cheated the Government had no 
such intentions. The Bill appeared on 15 February and it 
was steamrollered through on Second Reading in the 
manner that I described earlier. We are still a month away 
from the deadline of 31 March, but we are beginning the 
Bill's Committee stage. People may submit their comments 
by 31 March, but they have no chance of influencing the 
Bill's shape.
<P>
The public and Parliament have been made a fool of. 
Many worthy and important organisations in our national 
life, including industrial organisations, the pensions 
industry, actuaries, voluntary organisations, charitable 
groups, especially those that focus on the needs of the 
disabled and widows, and groups concerned with marriage 
and family life, including lawyers and the churches, have 
been ripped off. They have the same experience that one 
has when one makes a fool of oneself doing a deal with a 
secondhand car salesman, who is cleverer or more ruthless 
than one had anticipated, and who gets away with it. The 
Government's reprehensible behaviour has left just such a 
taste in the mouths of the entire country. If they intended to 
produce a Bill on 15 February, they should have said so 
when the Green Paper was introduced. If the Green Paper 
states that the consultation period will end on 31 March, the 
Government should respect that.
<P>
Do the Government intend to continue in that vein by 
publishing meaningless dates for the conclusion of 
consultation periods? Will their efforts to make fools of 
the public become a general habit? Such behaviour would 
seriously undermine the cause of good, honest 
government and the respect with which British people 
regard institutions such as the legislature and executive. 
It would also result in legislation that is even more 
unworkable and contradictory than that which the 
Government have hitherto produced.
<P>
That is a serious matter. The Government are using 
their majority to spew out legislation that has not been 
properly considered. If those on whom such legislation 
may impact are denied the opportunity to bring potential 
flaws to the Government's attention before Bills are 
drafted and Committee proceedings have begun, the 
inevitable result will be worse laws. Courts will be 
clogged up with unnecessary litigation and people will 
feel disappointment and injustice. Legislation will reduce, 
rather than enhance, justice and the sum of human 
happiness in this country.
<P>
I am sorry to say that the Minister, who probably feels 
ashamed at the Government's behaviour, did not have the 
decency to apologise to the public. I hope that he takes 
the opportunity to do so by catching your eye, Mr. Malins, 
before we finish debating the sittings motion.
<P>
The convention is that one should not recognise 
members of the public who attend Standing Committee 
proceedings. However, one or two representatives of 
organisations are present who did not comment on the Bill 
because they were cheated into believing that they had 
until 31 March to do so. I asked representatives of the 
National Association of Pension Funds for their views on 
the Bill. Their letter, which I have in front of me, states 
that they had yet to respond because they believed that 
the deadline was 31 March. Many other organisations are 
in the same position.
<P>
This is an extremely bad day's work by the 
Government, for which, I dare say, the Minister of State's 
boss, the Secretary of State, may be responsible. It is even 
more likely that those who drive the Government from 
No. 10 Downing street, such as Alastair Campbell, and 
who treat the public with contempt and mock the principle 
of consultation, are responsible. The Government should 
think again, because the Opposition will not accept lightly 
such behaviour, which will generate a wave of indignation 
in the country as a whole. This is a sophisticated 
democracy and the Government have set an appalling 
example.
<P>
I turn to aspects of the Bill relating to the time allowed 
by the sittings motion for debate, the order in which 
matters will be considered, and the appropriateness to the 
Bill's substance of the logic set out in the motion. The 
Bill's first few clauses deal with the stakeholder issue. 
Easy access for everyone to pension provision is, at first 
sight, naturally attractive to all reasonably minded men 
and women, and to Opposition Members. The desirability 
of more savings and long-term savings, and of people 
having better provision for their old age and retirement, 
should be the substance of political consensus. We would 
be only too delighted to facilitate such developments.
<P>
I do not know whether the Government mean their 
rhetoric I do not like to accuse people of being 
two-faced or using double-speak. If contradictions exist 
between the rhetoric and the deeds of the Government, I 
prefer to think that the lesser of two evils is the 
explanation and that it is the result of a lack of homework, 
consideration, proper planning, and I repeat a lack of 
consultation. If the Government are not prepared to listen 
to anyone else and if their majority has made them so 
arrogant that they do not recognise such a need, they will 
make bad mistakes.
<P>
The Bill contains evident contradictions rather than 
mere weaknesses not least in relation to stakeholder 
pensions. First, it is, sadly, far from true that everyone 
would be advantaged by greater pension provision and 
greater savings. Not only is it a lie, but it would be 
irresponsible and cruel to promote the idea that 
everyone would necessarily gain by saving more for 
their retirement. I explained on the Floor of the House 
why that is the case. At current annuity rates, it is 
necessary to accumulate at least £80,000 or possibly 
£100,000 to generate an income in retirement that will 
correspond to means-tested benefits that would be 
forgone such as income support, housing benefit and 
council tax relief. Consequently, those who saved 
more £150,000 to £200,000 would gain some 
positive return, but it would be small. Setting aside 
such an amount might not be worth the sacrifice of 
current consumption or the investment risk.
<P>
Saving such an amount from a modest salary requires an 
inordinate I use the term advisedly sacrifice. Someone 
on average earnings of £18,000 a year would have to save 
£1,000 a year throughout 40 years of working life he or 
she might save more in some years and less in others, but 
would have to maintain the level of saving. An 
accumulation of £40,000, which at a 3 per cent. real 
investment return would yield £75,000 to £80,000, would 
put the saver at the break-even point, which makes it 
pointless to save.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman should 
realise that this is a sittings motion. To an extent, he is 
moving the Committee into a series of clause stand part 
debates, for which there will be ample opportunity in due 
course. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will restrict 
himself to the sittings motion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> As always, Mr. Malins, I shall be guided 
by you. I appreciate that I must not anticipate clause stand 
part debates, but I was dealing with a principle that 
underlies the stakeholder pension, which cannot be 
covered under any individual clause. When considering 
the stakeholder, we should recognise that any sort of 
pension provision may be inappropriate and, indeed, a 
mis-selling for large numbers of our fellow citizens.
<P>
Another worrying aspect of the stakeholder clauses is 
that they are influenced throughout by an extraordinarily 
old-fashioned and inept perception of the current labour 
market. The Department of Social Security not the 
Treasury, as the rival lifelong individual savings account 
proposals do not reflect such a view is clearly obsessed 
with the idea that any pension vehicle must be set up in 
the form of a trust. We have nothing against trusts: they 
often work extremely well. However, the trust idea is 
fundamentally based on the concept that employees can 
come together in sufficient numbers to make setting up a 
trust worthwhile and that employees and pensioners will 
stay together in an identifiable group for the rest of their 
working lives. In some big companies, in both the public 
and private sectors, that remains true, and I am delighted 
that it does. Where people work for smaller employers, 
they may be able to come together on a trade, trade union 
or friendly society basis in a trust vehicle. Only in that 
context, where trustees nominate pensioners or workers, 
do trusts make sense.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
In a world in which people tend to move jobs and 
change employers, and in which technology changes the 
fundamental structure of industry every decade or so, 
the obsession with trusts is inappropriate. In considering 
the Bill, we must bear in mind that the Government's 
view of the world needs serious updating and revision. 
One understands why, without consultation, the 
Government fall into such traps.
<P>
The stakeholder proposals a serious matter that bears 
directly on the issue of how much consideration we 
should give the Bill present the most appalling 
confusion in the Government's mind. The Bill does not 
even mention lifelong individual savings accounts or the 
Treasury's rival proposals for the kind of pension vehicle 
that should be made available in future. As I have said 
elsewhere, in many cases leases are probably more 
appropriate in principle than stakeholder pensions for 
those pensioners who should, in their own rational 
interests, make greater pension provision.
<P>
The Bill is a complete and utter mess. our amendments, 
some of which I see, Mr. Malins, you have accepted we 
are grateful for that and we shall need some time to debate 
them try to redress the damage done by the 
fragmentation of the whole pension area as a result of this 
Government's decisions and ill thought-through and ill 
co-ordinated initiatives. We have occupational pensions, 
personal pensions, the stakeholder pension concept and 
the LISA concept. It is not clear to anybody how they will 
relate to each other. The Bill is full of things like "The 
stakeholder pension must be a trust, but, on the other 
hand, it does not have to be, because regulations might be 
introduced which waive that"	. The Government are 
clearly in a complete mess about how they will resolve 
those issues.
<P>
The issues must be clarified during our debates and I 
hope that, whether the Bill proceeds or not, at least the 
general public know at the end of our proceedings, 
because of assurances that are made in Committee or 
changes that we make to the Bill, exactly what the 
pensions regime is, what qualifies as a stakeholder 
pension and what options are available, so that people can 
take advice and decided whether they should be taking 
out a pension and, if so, what kind of pension. That is 
fundamental.
<P>
The fourth aspect that the Government have not 
considered and is not in the Bill again we have tabled 
some amendments that we hope will redress that evident 
lack is the difficulties for employers. The Government 
continually pile new obligations on employers. You will 
not want me to go into the details of that now, Mr. Malins, 
but they are doing so, and they are doing it again in the 
Bill. They think that it is simple to say, "Employers can 
lay all this on. Employers can do this, that and the other."	 
They do not realise that an appallingly bad day's work 
would be done if, as a result of further burdens on 
employers, employers become less likely to employ 
people or, if self-employed people became reluctant to 
take on their first or second employee at a crucial stage. 
To deprive a person of a job because of a notional pension 
benefit would be deeply ironic and foolish.
<P>
We must consider carefully the economic impact of the 
Government's proposals and the direct impact on 
employers and therefore on their propensity to 
employ and on employment levels. The Government 
appear to have given that no consideration. That is not 
surprising, because they will not consult with people and 
they make it clear that they are not interested in listening 
to people. It is inevitable that they will make serious 
errors.
<P>
Some hon. Members may think that I am speaking for 
a long time on a sittings motion, but we are really 
discussing three Bills and there should be three Standing 
Committees and three sittings motions. I have no 
influence with Mr. Alastair Campbell and it is not my 
fault that the Government have taken this route. I 
deprecate and deplore it, and I hope that our view is 
becoming clear.
<P>
There are serious errors in the way in which pension 
sharing has been developed and promoted in Parliament. 
However, as a fair-minded man I shall give credit where 
it is due and criticism where that is due. The Government 
set a good example when they asked the Social Security 
Select Committee to examine the proposals. I hope that 
they will follow that procedure in future, but they have 
undermined some of the benefits with other pieces of 
foolishness.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman is in 
danger of re-running the Second Reading debate. There 
will be opportunities in due course to raise such matters 
and he must try to remain within the sittings motion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Thank you, Mr. Malins. I shall return to 
the matter in due course.
<P>
I hope that it is in order to raise another aspect of the 
Government's proposals of which I do not approve. The 
Bill is important and has been presented as part of a 
feminist agenda. I refer to the previous Secretary of 
State's foreword to the consultation document it was 
called a consultation document, but we know what the 
Government mean by consultation last summer, which 
stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"We believe pension provision should be fair for women ... "<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
we all agree with that and we might add that it should be 
fair to men also 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the main beneficiaries will be women."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
You will not want me to read great extracts of the 
document now, Mr. Malins, but anyone who wants to read 
it should do so. They will see that pension sharing is being 
presented as part of a feminist agenda. New Labour and 
political correctness mean doing something for women.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman is amusing 
the Committee, but he is out of order and must remain 
within the sittings motion. He knows that I said that 
earlier.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Leigh </B>(Gainsborough): On a point of 
order, Mr. Malins. The Minister enlightened the 
Committee at length on why the Bill was useful, so why 
cannot the Opposition spokesman enlighten the 
Committee on why it is destructive?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The sitting motion is, by definition, 
fairly narrow. There will be many opportunities in due 
course to raise such matters on clause stand part debate. 
We must remain within the sittings motion. The 
Committee knows that I allow a little latitude now and 
again.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> I am trying hard, Mr. Malins, not 
to say anything which should more properly be said in a 
clause stand part debate or elsewhere in our proceedings. 
This is our opportunity to decide how the Bill should be 
considered, in what order and in what time. It is important 
to describe to the Committee how the Government have 
presented the Bill There is a fundamental divide between 
the Opposition and the Government. We believe that 
Parliament's task is to enhance justice. We should 
legislate for human beings: for men and women. Our 
agenda should not be to legislate for one category of 
humanity because that happens to be politically correct or 
fashionable. We all know of cases among constituents or 
our friends of women who have been treated unjustly 
under the present system and who might have received 
better justice under our divorce laws, had an opportunity 
for pension sharing existed. A wife who is deserted after 
a long marriage and left without resources, when her 
husband has a substantial asset in the form of a pension, 
might have been able to share that pension. That goes to 
the heart of the Bill. Equally, the opposite may arise. A 
friend of mine, who is a highly paid director of a City 
merchant bank, has a husband who, by any standards, 
would be described as a ne'er-do-well: he frequently gets 
drunk, he has beaten her up on one or two occasions, he 
is having an affair with someone else at present, he has 
no income of his own and he lives off her. If he divorced 
her once the Bill came into effect, he would walk away 
with a substantial share of her pension, for which she has 
worked and he had done absolutely nothing. Therefore, 
injustice can be on both sides.
<P>
Our considerations should not be influenced by a 
person's sex, age or religion, by the colour of their hair 
or skin or by any other extraneous factors. We should do 
justice for individuals. The one distinction that we might 
make and Parliament properly has always made as I 
believe that the laws of the land in any civilised nation 
do should be between adults, who to some extent can 
look after themselves, and children, because any 
legislature has a responsibility to protect those who cannot 
protect themselves.
<P>
What is extraordinary about the Bill this goes to the 
heart of the issue about how we should debate it, how 
much time we need on it and what amendments are 
required is that it says nothing at all about children. I 
looked at the Bill and all the supporting documentation. 
The Labour Government are not interested in children: 
they do not mention them. We will put that to rights, if 
one or two of our amendments are accepted. It is a key 
issue.
<P>
Another extraordinary thing about the Bill is that the 
Government are utterly unco-ordinated. They think that 
there is rivalry between different Departments, each doing 
its own thing. The Lord Chancellor is on record as saying 
that he is carrying out a review of ancillary relief. We 
do not know the result of that review or what legislative 
proposals the Lord Chancellor will make to the House. 
Unless the Government decide to abolish Parliament and 
rule by decree, presumably the Lord Chancellor will 
eventually make some legislative proposals to the House, 
if he wants to change the rules on ancillary relief. We do 
not know whether he does want to or in what direction. 
Clearly that will cut completely across the issue before 
us now.
<P>
After all, the varying of pension-sharing orders and 
other pension-splitting arrangements, including 
earmarking, which is modified in the Bill, go to the heart 
of ancillary relief. It is extraordinary that the Government 
are introducing the Bill while another Department, we are 
told, is considering the matter, and clearly doing so more 
in the round than the Department of Social Security, and 
we do not know the results of those deliberations. That 
might lead to our wasting our time completely in the 
Committee, because the provisions will all be overtaken 
and have to be revised when the Lord Chancellor makes 
up his mind and makes other proposals. Alternatively, we 
will have contradictory legislation. Either of those 
developments would be extremely undesirable and 
Parliament would be doing a bad day's work if that were 
allowed to happen.
<P>
Then the Lord Chancellor said that he is considering 
whether pre-nuptial agreements should be enforceable in 
a court of law. I accept right now that, if he decides that 
there should be clear pre-nuptial agreements, some of the 
amendments that I shall table to improve protections for 
individuals will not be necessary. We can save time now 
if we know that the Government will opt for recognition 
of pre-nuptial agreements. However, if we only know that 
they are considering that option and that the Lord 
Chancellor has said that he is favourably minded to it, 
again we are completely wasting our time. This goes to 
the heart of the matter, the sittings motion and the time 
of this Committee.

<P>

<B>Mr. Julian Brazier (Canterbury):</B> Surely the essence 
of the point that my hon. Friend is reaching for is that 
the Family Law Bill, which went through the previous 
Parliament, was one of the longest, most complicated and 
most controversial pieces of legislation that that 
Parliament dealt with. We have all these provisions 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We are now even talking about 
a different Bill. It is important that we restrict ourselves 
to the sittings motion, which is narrow by definition. I 
remind the Committee that in due course there will be an 
order of consideration motion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brazier:</B> Indeed, Mr. Malins. My point was that it 
will take many sittings to cover that group of clauses, 
which should not be tacked on to the end of a social 
security Bill.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> I much appreciate the 
intervention of my hon. Friend the Member for 
Canterbury. He is absolutely right in his comments about 
existing family law. I accept your ruling, Mr. Malins, but 
if we are considering a Bill that has a fundamental impact 
on family law, it is right to consider the extent to which 
it contradicts other legislation.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman may be 
making a good point, but it is not appropriate to consider 
it during the sittings motion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I understand the distinction completely, I 
am sure that we will hear from my hon. Friend the 
Member for Canterbury on the important issue of family 
law and pension splitting during our proceedings.
<P>
We must provide in the sittings motion, however, for 
consideration of an aspect of the Government's 
pension-sharing proposal, which I do not think is even 
their idea. By not consulting or thinking issues through 
properly, they will pay the price and learn the lesson the 
hard way. However, they still have time to accept 
Opposition amendments and to reconsider matters.
<P>
Opposition Members are anxious to avoid enacting an 
ill-thought-through pension-splitting or pension-sharing, 
as the Government prefer to call it measure, which will 
induce a distortion of people's behaviour or produce 
perverse behavioural consequences. That is a technical 
term meaning people behaving in self-destructive and 
unfortunate ways, which are not in their interests or those 
of society. A clear example would be the extent to which 
people might be deterred from marrying because they 
have a considerable pension and they know that if there 
is even a small chance of the marriage breaking up they 
will lose a large part of it. For those who live together 
without getting married, no such consequences would 
follow. No Committee member should have any illusions 
that the Bill in its present form could directly contribute 
to people who might otherwise marry deciding not to do 
so. That has consequences for families, to which my hon. 
Friend the Member for Canterbury tried to draw the 
Committee's attention.
<P>
On the other hand, the enactment of ill-thought-through 
legislation might lead to people who otherwise might not 
divorce having an inducement to do so. There may be tax 
reasons for doing so, if one party to a marriage has a 
substantial pension entitlement giving him or her a level of 
pension income that would incur taxation at 40 per cent 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman must 
know that he is outside the sittings motion. The issue he 
is discussing will crop up later in the Bill. I urge him to 
stay within the sittings motion. The hon. Gentleman 
knows that I have mentioned this a number of times.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> If I may say so, Mr. Malins, this important 
matter is not provided for in the sittings motion, which is 
a great mistake. It is essential that the behavioural 
consequences of any Bill, and whether they are benign or 
malevolent for society, are considered. Committee 
members may have different values and different 
objectives, but that should become clear as a result of our 
debates. Another inducement to divorce might occur if 
one party who had a substantial annuity income had a 
fatal illness. In those circumstance, it might be sensible to 
divorce so that a large part of the value of the pension 
could be handed over to the surviving spouse. That would 
not otherwise be possible and would be lost 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman is an 
experienced parliamentarian. He knows that I have 
mentioned on probably half a dozen occasions that we are 
straying outside the sittings motion. It is a narrow motion 
and there will be many opportunities to deal with 
individual cases, points of principle and so on, during the 
debates that lie ahead. I urge the hon. Gentleman to stay 
within the sittings motion, and I remind him that a time 
will shortly come when I may take a view on the matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Of course, I accept that, Mr. Malins. I 
am also grateful for your assurance which I assume is a 
bankable assurance to which I may subsequently refer 
that there will be opportunities to discuss the important 
matters on which I touched, but which, under your 
guidance, I shall now leave. However, I shall not leave 
them definitively.
<P>
The Minister of State spoke at length about welfare 
reform, as he calls it, or welfare destruction, as I call it. 
You would think it unnatural of me. Mr. Malins, as an 
Opposition spokesman, not to touch on the Bill's so-called 
merits, which the Minister of State proclaimed so 
explicitly. My comments on the matter will take up no 
more of the Committee's time than the Minister of State's.
<P>
The Conservative party is in favour of genuine welfare 
reform. The welfare system is extremely expensive and 
does not always procure the results that it should. It does 
not always contribute to the maximising of job 
opportunities, to the pursuit of socially responsible 
behaviour on the part of individuals, or to behaviour that 
is in individuals' own interests. Some aspects of the 
system are wasteful, perverse, corrupting and incite 
dependency. That is damaging.
<P>
The difference between the Conservative party and the 
Labour party is that the latter appears to think that we 
should get rid of the social insurance aspects of the 
welfare system and steadily means-test universal 
contributory benefits. Where the Government think that 
means-testing is part of the solution, we think that it is 
part of the problem. That fundamental divide will inform 
consideration of the Bill.
<P>
The Government are doing one or two things with 
which we are perfectly happy, and which we would have 
done ourselves. Indeed, in one respect, they are continuing 
our policies. A Conservative Government introduced the 
jobseeker's allowance, the purpose of which was to ensure 
a greater connection between the activities of unemployed 
people looking for work, taking appropriate courses and 
acting on advice given and the benefit that they receive.
<P>
We are happy with the extension of that principle to 
single mothers, provided that they are not forced to 
work rather than stay at home and look after their 
children. Single mothers were rightly worried about the 
Government's initial proposals and I am glad to say 
that we have already secured that concession from the 
Government on the Floor of the House. I am sure that 
you will agree, Mr. Malins, that our being at one with 
the Government on the matter is directly relevant to the 
sittings motion. Our consensus should help the 
Committee's proceedings, because less time may be 
needed for debate.
<P>
Labour Members may not be convinced by our 
arguments. They may like means-testing and want to 
destroy the national insurance system; if so, I hope that 
we can convert them to our point of view. However, they 
cannot deny that our arguments are consistent with the 
way in which we believe that other parts of their proposals 
ought to be treated. We are bitterly opposed to the 
means-testing and destruction of existing contributory 
benefits. People have planned their lives on the basis that 
they will receive those benefits as long as they have 
maintaine their national insurance contribution record. 
That applies both to widow's benefit, which will be 
obliterated and replaced by means-tested bereavement 
benefit, and to incapacity benefit. Therefore, we disagree 
strongly with the Government and we shall need time to 
go into those matters in detail.
<P>
There is a connection between two aspects of the 
provisions the Government's approach to disability and 
incapacity and the disciplines associated with the 
jobseeker's allowance, which includes a requirement for 
interviews which the Government have not thought 
through properly. We should distinguish between those 
two issues, which are combined in the Bill's provisions 
and in the sittings motion. It is reasonable that there 
should be some kind of all-work test there has to be a 
test to determine whether people qualify for incapacity 
benefit or other disability benefits. We are also in favour 
of people who receive benefits getting help and advice 
about returning to work. However, those two interviews 
should be separated.
<P>
We do not want people to attend interviews with 
someone who calls himself a counsellor the counsellor's 
job is to try to help them, whether they are disabled, single 
mothers, or able-bodied people without family 
commitments who would therefore have an obligation to 
go back to work. In all cases, we want people to regard 
the interview with the counsellor as something positive, 
where they can talk frankly about their interests, 
background, hopes, aspirations and difficulties. We do not 
want that to be combined with an interview designed to 
trick people into admitting to some capacity that they 
would not otherwise have or would not have on most 
days, but might have on a good day and thereby lose 
their entitlement to benefit. We want to separate those two 
interviews and that point is not dealt with in the Bill. The 
sittings motion should therefore be modified, so that we 
can consider it.
<P>
You will be relieved to hear, Mr. Malins, that from now 
on I do not propose to make further comments on the 
substance of the Bill, or on the considerable divide that 
exists between the Government and the Opposition on the 
Bill's fundamental principles. I shall, however, make a 
general point. The Opposition are committed to looking 
seriously and constructively at all the issues. We are not 
in the business of wasting time. Everything that I have 
said so far, and everything that I and my colleagues will 
say in the Committee, will be said because it needs to be 
said and for no other reason. The Government must take 
the proceedings seriously, and not succumb to the 
temptation, which they find difficult to resist, of saying, 
"We have an enormous majority and a wonderful 
media-manipulating machine outside the House, so we 
can get away with absolutely anything."	 They must take 
seriously their responsibility to explain the proposals in 
the Bill, listen open-mindedly to the arguments on them, 
and ensure that all those matters are considered in the 
round, from all the angles that they should be, even 
though in many cases they have not been subject to the 
proper consultation period before the Bill was introduced. 
If they will take that responsibility seriously, we shall 
respond in the same spirit. To use an old English phrase, 
if the Government will play cricket, then we shall play 
cricket. This is an important Bill and it would be 
damaging for society and for some fundamental values in 
our country if it were allowed to reach the statute book 
without considerable amendment. It will be the 
Committee's task to ensure that it receives the 
consultation that, regrettably and disgracefully, it did not 
receive before entering this legislative phase, and to 
ensure that wherever possible it is amended in the right 
direction.

<P>

<B>Kali Mountford </B>(Colne Valley): I welcome you,
Mr. Malins, to the Chair. It is the first time that I have 
had an opportunity to sit on a Committee under your 
chairmanship. I have sat on a Committee that was 
chaired by Mr. McWilliam. I look forward to his taking 
the Chair our previous encounters have been 
enjoyable. Some Opposition Members have sat on 
similar Committees and I know that we are in for 
a treat.
<P>
We have already had a treat this morning the speech 
of the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford. I must 
lift the veil from his eyes. He is obviously under the 
impression that Labour Members were press-ganged into 
sitting on the Committee. I assure him that I am here 
willingly, happily and voluntarily and that I am full of 
excitement about our debates in the coming weeks. I am 
also delighted to have an opportunity to examine the Bill 
in the round. I should be disappointed if Opposition 
Members were not interested in all aspects of the Bill I 
listened carefully the hon. Gentleman's comments, and I 
was surprised by many of them. There seems to have been 
a wholehearted change of approach and style among 
Opposition Members.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
From 1975 to 1996, I worked in what was then called 
the Department of Employment. For the first 10 of those 
years, I was involved in the delivery and calculation of 
benefits. I was a member of the civil service and I recall 
the Thatcher Government introducing the reforms that 
broke the principle of contributed benefits and which 
moved closer to a means-testing benefits system. I am 
surprised by some of the comments that we heard earlier. 
The general thrust of the delivery of benefits has been 
increasingly towards means-tested and I look forward to 
hearing in due course the hon. Member for Grantham and 
Stamford explain the need for that change.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> Will the hon. Lady give way?
<P>
<B>Kali Mountford:</B> No, I shall continue. The hon. 
Gentleman made a long and gallant speech and it would 
be a shame not to make a little progress.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman discussed in part the Bill's 
main thrust, which is about equality in relation to all 
recipients and all benefits, and the benefits relating to 
pensions and divorce. The Government's bereavement 
benefits will have the opposite effect to that which he 
suggested men who were not previously recipients of 
the benefit will receive it. Such equality should be 
welcomed by all members of the public.
<P>
The Bill will take us away from a system involving 
benefits policing, which I encountered when I was a civil 
servant, towards a supportive system, which will treat 
claimants and recipients of pensions, benefits and support 
entirely differently. It was difficult to work in a benefits 
system in which a clerk's main duties were to police the 
behaviour of the recipients of benefits. A move from that 
system is welcome.
<P>
For some years, I was on the management committee 
of a welfare rights organisation. I witnessed changes in 
people's lives, which Opposition Members are obviously 
trying to forget. It is particularly important to give support 
to people when they are incapacitated or ill. Conservative 
Members have forgotten the time when people who were 
ill were used as a way of getting numbers off the benefit 
register, to massage the unemployment figures. That 
approach did nothing for the person who was 
incapacitated, ill or disabled.
<P>
When we examine the Bill in the round, we need to 
consider equality, equal treatment and independent living, 
which is another of the Bill's themes. On Second Reading, 
I felt that Opposition Members had missed the importance 
of independent living. During our consideration in 
Committee, we must pay attention to fairness, equal 
treatment and, primarily, support. If we are not cognisant 
of the fact that someone with a disability also has many 
abilities and should have an opportunity to play a full part 
in society, we will do him or her a great disservice. I 
am looking forward to our discussion of those aspects of 
the Bill.
<P>
The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford referred 
to the all-work test. He will recall that it was his 
Government that introduced the all-work test. That was a 
bitter blow to people because it focused on what they 
cannot do, rather than on what they can do. I look forward 
to a change in attitude towards people who have 
apparently been left on benefits so that they will have a 
whole new life with hope, expectation and aspiration. 
That flows through the Bill.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman said that there was little mention 
of children in the Bill. He has not read those parts of the 
Bill covering severe disablement benefits for children.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Will the hon. Lady give way?
<P>
<B>Kali Mountford:</B> I cannot resist indulging the hon. 
Gentleman.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> My mention of children referred to the 
pension-sharing provisions and I stand by that.
<P>
Will not the hon. Lady apply to herself the consistency 
that she demands of others? Will she join me in saying 
that there was too much means-testing in the welfare 
system on 1 May 1997, but that, if means-testing is 
thought to be dangerous, it is pretty stupid greatly to 
extend it and to attack the elements of social insurance 
with contributory benefit? That is precisely what the 
Government have done since coming to power.
<P>
<B>Kali Mountford:</B> The hon. Gentleman seems to be 
trying to rewrite history. He totally misunderstands the 
thrust not just of the Bill, but of other Bills and the 
changes that we have already seen. The contributory 
principle lies at the heart of all the Government's 
proposals. On stakeholder pensions, the hon. Gentleman 
would find it difficult to suggest that people should not 
contribute to their own pensions. Let us not forget the 
other part of the Government's proposals for second 
pension schemes. That is not in the Bill, so I shall not go 
too far down that line. Every Bill must be considered in 
the context of change. The hon. Gentleman ignores some 
of the comments that he made in the Opposition day 
debate on pensions. He was inconsistent in his comments 
on how people should make contributions to their own 
pensions. I wondered whether the Opposition had changed 
their minds about people contributing to their own 
pensions. He seemed to be making a case for an entirely 
state-provided pension scheme, which I know was not his 
party's proposal when in Government.
<P>
I see no problem in extending opportunities to people 
to enable them to make provision for their own old age. 
That is what the first part of the Bill does. it is an 
extension of the main thrust of the Bill independence 
and independent living.
<P>
In my 20 years' experience of working in benefits, I 
have never met anyone who luxuriated in a life on 
benefits. It is not a happy life. People on benefit are on 
the breadline and we do not want people to stay there. 
benefits should be temporary, even when people have 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am showing patience, but the 
hon. Lady knows that she is straying, so perhaps she will 
return to the narrow subject of the debate.
<P>
<B>Kali Mountford:</B> Of course, Mr. Malins. You are 
absolutely right. The temptation is too great when 
responding to the hon. Gentleman because he set a poor 
example and I apologise.
<P>
I look forward to our future sittings because the Bill 
extends the important principles of equality between the 
sexes, opportunity for all, fairness and fundamental 
support from the system for people in their hour of need, 
and replaces the policing of people who are in receipt of 
benefits. The previous Government's over-dependence on 
tightening legislation to prevent fraud rather than looking 
at people in the round was a mistake. The Bill opens the 
opportunity to provide people with support.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Rendel </B>(Newbury): I think that I am the 
third or fourth hon. Member to welcome you to the Chair 
today, Mr. Malins. I am particularly pleased to do so 
because we recently sat together on another Committee. I 
think that it is fair to say that on that occasion you did 
not pick me up on a single point of procedure, which 
shows that you are extremely fair and very wise 
Chairman.
<P>
I also want to extend a warm welcome to my hon. 
Friend the Member for Winchester (Mr. Oaten) I think 
that he has not so far been welcomed by anybody, so it is 
right that I should do so particularly as he has now 
recovered from the illness that, sadly, meant that he could 
not attend the previous Committee on which we were due 
to sit. I am pleased to see him in his place today.
<P>
I want to help the Committee I hope that it will help 
you too, Mr. Malins by listing some aspects of the Bill 
on which we shall want to speak in more detail and some 
on which we shall speak less, so that you can see how we 
think that the Committee sittings should go.
<P>
We do not expect to table many amendments to the 
pensions aspects of the Bill, which are dealt with in 
clauses 1 to 43, or to take up much of the Committee's 
time on them. I have no doubt that we shall table a number 
of probing amendments; indeed, one or two have already 
been tabled. We shall want to investigate in greater detail 
some aspects of the way in which state earnings-related 
pensions scheme contributions are treated at present, and 
will be treated in future, and the payments that people can 
expect as a result of having made SERPS contributions.
<P>
We want to spend most of our time on the remainder 
of the Bill and we want to change many provisions, 
particularly as we regard most of it as a case of severe 
benefit cutting and an increase in means-testing, to which 
we object strongly. It is true that we approve of some 
provisions. In particular, we are pleased at the extension 
of bereavement benefits to widowers and we shall not 
object to that. We also approve of the fact that that 
extends sex equality as the hon. Member for Colne Valley 
just said. We shall not table amendments to reject that 
change.
<P>
However, there are strong objections to be made to the 
extent of the benefit cuts. I think that it was the Minister 
who said on Second Reading that we should not object to 
the cuts, as they were the means of paying for what we 
approve of. It is wrong to say that all those cuts are 
needed: they amount to some six times the total cost of 
the parts of the Bill of which we approve.
<P>
We do not believe that clause 47, which is known as 
the single work-focused gateway, contains adequate 
safeguards, so we shall table amendments to add 
safeguards and we hope to spend time discussing that 
clause.
<P>
We want to spend most time on the remaining clauses, 
which deal with disability benefit cuts, in particular cuts 
to incapacity benefit. It has been said that those cuts are 
right, because too many people are taking incapacity 
benefits in place of retirement pensions. If that is so, the 
right way to deal with the problem is to ensure that people 
who are ineligible for the benefits do not get them, instead 
of cutting the level for everybody. That is the wrong way 
to do it.
<P>
The fact that in future people will need to have made 
recent contributions to national insurance was described 
on Second Reading as getting nothing for something. That 
is a point that we shall want to make again in Committee 
when we reach that clause. Therefore, we shall want to 
spend some time on it.
<P>
We are also concerned about the clauses that introduce 
the means-testing of incapacity benefits against pensions, 
as we do not think that that is the right way to go either. 
Means-testing is the wrong way to deal with benefits, if 
they must be changed at all.
<P>
We also object to the cutting of severe disablement 
allowance in clause 54, so I have no doubt that we shall 
table some amendments to that clause. We welcome the 
increase in the cut-off age to 25 for students or carers, 
which the Minister announced on Second Reading. 
However, there is a good case to be made for saying that 
the cut-off should not exist at all.
<P>
Overall, we shall table some amendments and shall 
wish to discuss in detail some of the later clauses. We 
shall not take up too much of the Committee's time in the 
early sittings. The overall total of £1.2 billion worth of 
cuts means that this is not a welfare reform but a welfare 
removal Bill. We strongly object to that.

<P>

<B>Mr. Eric Pickles </B>(Brentwood and Ongar): This is the 
first time that I have had the pleasure of serving on a 
Committee under your chairmanship, Mr. Malins. I took 
the opportunity to watch you chair the Committee that 
considered the Social Security Contributions (Transfer of 
Functions, etc.) Bill, but I regret that I was unable to stay 
for long as I found the subject matter and the exchange 
between Labour and Opposition Members a little too 
exciting. I found it necessary to retire to a darkened room.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I suspect that the hon. Member for Doncaster, North, 
who is about to leave the Committee, will become a 
familiar figure to Committee members. As the Bill is 
effectively three bills, our deliberations will be long and 
we are likely to see more of the hon. Gentleman than of 
our families. So accustomed will we have come to him 
that, when we open our Easter eggs with happy little 
hands during the Easter recess, the moment will not be 
complete without his presence.
<P>
I have listened carefully, Mr. Malins, to your directions 
about not straying from the sittings motion. I have 
therefore jettisoned three quarters of what I was about to 
say. We must consider the Bill slowly and deliberately, 
however, to help not only members of the public but the 
Government.
<P>
I want to refer briefly to the experience with a recent 
Bill, to show why the sittings motions should be 
absolutely right. We know from the newspapers that the 
Government have cold feet over the Tax Credits Bill. The 
Secretary of State for Trade and Industry and the Minister 
of Agriculture have grave reservations about it. The main 
reason is that the Committee that considered the Bill was 
allowed to develop points and to sit for a long period. 
Opposition Members are therefore not merely assisting 
the general public but giving the Government the 
opportunity once they have realised their mistake on 
pensions and especially on widow's benefit to abandon 
their proposals and return with improved ones.
<P>
The Bill represents a fundamental shift from national 
insurance to means-testing. For that reason, we will need 
a considerable amount of time to decide on the right 
course. The briefing that hon. Members received from the 
National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux, which 
is directly relevant to the sittings motion, describes the 
position. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Before such a shift is made, the CB Service would like to see 
the Government make a clear statement on what sort of social 
security system it is trying to build and how National Insurance fits 
into its vision of work and security."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That could not be better put. The Government have not 
given much indication of their intentions in that respect.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tom Levitt (High Peak):</B> Will the hon. Gentleman 
accept that while means-testing may be a sin, targeting 
resources on those most in need is undeniably a virtue?
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> The Hon. Gentleman is missing the point 
if he thinks that Opposition Members believe that all 
means-testing is wrong. Our concern is the balance 
between means-testing and contributions. If the 
Committee acts as a teach-in for the Under-Secretary of 
State for Social Security, the hon. Member for City of 
York (Mr. Bayley), that is marvellous. It shows why we 
need to take things slowly. We do not mind helping the 
Government to progress on their learning curve 
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> My hon. Friend should not go too far.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> My hon. Friend is too doctrinaire. I 
believe in a consensus in this context.
<P>
The Green Paper, on which the Government's 
proposals are based, was careful to say that it did not 
want a low-grade safety net for the destitute. However, 
the Bill's provisions make it clear that that is exactly the 
road down which we are travelling. That is clearest in the 
abolition of widow's pension and widow's benefit, which 
the Minister of State euphemistically said offered a time 
limit. The Government's proposal is a thin veneer, which 
will allow them to cut away at a vulnerable section of 
the community. Unlike other provisions relating to social 
security, a dramatic rise in the number of claimants is not 
involved. The number of widows claiming the benefit has 
dropped dramatically. In 1983, slightly more than 400,000 
claimed it, but a couple of years ago slightly less than 
300,000 claimed it.
<P>
We need to go a little more slowly in our considerations 
for emotive reasons, which I shall put as nicely as I can. 
I do not believe that anyone who has experienced a 
bereavement of an aunt, mother, sister or friend could 
have drafted the Bill, which proposes an unrealistic way 
to deal with a person who is bereaved and terribly 
vulnerable. To lose a spouse is, I suspect, the cruellest 
blow that anyone can suffer, and it places particular 
hardship on widows. To subject widows to a means test 
after six months is unrealistic.
<P>
The need for the Committee to proceed slowly in this 
context was put neatly in two sentences by the hon. 
Member for Newbury on Second Reading, which explains 
why we may have to sit well beyond Whitsun. I apologise 
to the hon. Gentleman for quoting him I am a great 
support of his, and I do not want to damage his chances 
in his party's leadership contest. As someone with 
impeccable working-class roots, I think that it would be 
marvellous to see a toff lead a political party. On Second 
Reading, which was on 23 February, he said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"In case any hon. Members thinks that six months sounds 
reasonable, let no one forget that a widow who knows that her 
bereavement allowance will run out after only six months will 
worry about how she will manage thereafter many months before 
it does run out. The restriction of the bereavement allowance to 
just six months is unnecessary and cruel, and an attack on human 
beings when they are at their most vulnerable."	 [Official Report 
23 February 1999; Vol. 326, c. 245.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That sums up the reasons why we shall have to spend an 
enormous length of time discussing the widow's benefit. 
The White Paper states that the proposals will affect older 
bereaved people in particular, especially women without 
dependent children.
<P>
Concerns have also been expressed by the Social 
Security Advisory Committee, which said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The emphasis on...regaining financial independence through 
employment we regard as unrealistic."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Many people offer support to older teenagers. The Green 
Paper says, "Do not worry about that. About 16 per cent. 
of widows receive incomes support"	 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman knows 
that during our consideration of the Bill we shall have 
opportunities to discuss the matters that he is raising. I 
must ask him, please, to restrict his remarks to the 
sittings motion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I am so sorry, Mr. Malins. I entirely 
accept your rebuke. I was straying out of order, but that 
was because of the strong emotions 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I was only apologising, Mr. Malins.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> What slightly concerned me was that 
the hon. Gentleman said that he had thrown away three 
quarters of his speech, which he thought was outside the 
motion. No doubt he believes that the remaining quarter 
is within it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> That is absolutely right, Mr. Malins. I was 
in fear and trepidation when I saw the strict way in which 
you dealt with my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham 
and Stamford and the hon. Member for Newbury. The 
hon. Member for Colne Valley was a model which I shall 
try to emulate.
<P>
I turn to other aspects of the problem. The hon. Member 
for Colne Valley said that the Bill introduces equality. I 
welcome the fact that the grants are being increased, as 
the hon. Member for Newbury said, but the hard truth is 
that it is based on the other spouse's income and women 
tend to earn less than men. That is one aspect that we 
must discuss.
<P>
The Bill inevitably increases the level of dependency 
on means-tested benefits. Our concern is that that will 
result in a significant increase in the number of people 
who are not only caught in the poverty trap, but, as the 
right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) said 
recently in the press, encapsulated in those means-tested 
benefits.
<P>
The hon. Member for Colne Valley said that the 
provision covering disability benefit is a matter of 
equality. Incapacity benefit will be affected if claimants 
have personal pensions, occupational pensions or other 
sources of income because that will be taken into 
consideration and, as my hon. Friend the Member for 
Grantham and Stamford said, those who save for the 
future will be penalised. It will not be worth saving. The 
Bill will put a raft of new people on to means-tested 
benefits and it will not be worth their while to save. 
During our proceedings, Conservative Members will try 
to find ways to make the system work. We are not against 
stakeholding far from it but it has not been properly 
thought out. We shall table amendments to try to ensure 
that it works and I suspect that clauses 1 to 7 will take 
several weeks to consider.
<P>
I am sure that you are pleased, Mr. Malins, that I threw 
away three quarters of my speech. There will be more 
than adequate opportunity to raise these important 
matters. I repeat that it is our intention to improve the Bill 
and considerable time will be needed to do that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howard Flight </B>(Arundel and South Downs): 
First, may I add my welcome to you, Mr. Malins, and 
to Mr. McWilliam? I am particularly pleased to be a 
member of the Committee and I thank the Minister for 
his comments.
<P>
It is a sad mistake to have mixed the separate territories 
of pension reform and welfare reform. Both are crucial, 
but I shall concentrate now on pensions. It is all too easy 
for Members of Parliament and civil servants, who have 
generous occupational final salary pensions, to overlook 
the problem of adequate pension provision in the country 
as a whole. We must remember that the legislation will 
last a long time and will affect future generations.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
I should declare an interest, which is not at a pensions 
consultant but as chairman of an investment management 
company. I am unhappy at the lack of a consultation 
period in respect of pension reform. Problems arising 
from the legislation and from pension mis-selling have 
encouraged the industry to think hard about getting the 
legislation right. Pensions could have been separated into 
two categories within the stakeholder concept: 
occupational pensions, which are related to the final 
salary, or the simpler and cheaper provision of "DIY"	 
pensions. Stakeholder schemes are supposedly pension 
arrangements for those who are earning but have no 
pension provision. Most of the people in that category 
are self-employed and cannot, by definition, belong to a 
company scheme. Separate arrangements exist for carers.
<P>
The Government claimed that the concept of the LISA 
was integral to the Green Paper. That announcement 
seemed to shine a ray of light on dealing properly with 
the self-employed. Those who campaigned for the 
arrangement intended it to be simple and analogous to 
the personal equity plan, which will shortly become the 
individual savings account. Simple rules would have 
governed the appropriateness of an investment, but a 
self-employed person could have gone through a LISA 
wrapper, saved for retirement and, upon retirement, 
bought an annuity or operated a draw-down arrangement.
<P>
However, that appears not to be the intention. Whether 
a stakeholder pension should have a trustee is central to 
the issue. According to the Bill. LISAs appear simply to 
be a way of managing money, but methods of managing 
pension portfolios, such as unitised trusts, already exist.
<P>
The lack of consultation and the different approaches 
taken by the Treasury and the Department of Social 
Security have resulted in the dropping of a terrible 
clanger. An opportunity has been missed for rational 
reform and the provision of low-cost pension 
arrangements, which is the ultimate objective of the 
stakeholder concept. Trustees, trustee reporting and 
associated paraphernalia inevitably increase costs. Where 
both pension trustee and fund management aspects must 
be paid for, charges will increase, regardless of any 
provisions for maximum charges.

<P>

<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> I have been listening to my hon. 
Friend with great interest. Has he noticed, as many of us 
have, the extraordinary pang of embarrassment and the 
frisson of jealousy that come over the faces of DSS 
Ministers whenever the acronym LISA is mentioned? 
They clearly wish that it had never been mentioned; they 
have not mentioned it in their Bill, they do not mention it 
in their speeches and they hope that the whole thing will 
go away.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Again, that is right outside the 
sittings motion. I must ask hon. Members to stay within it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Had the full time for consultation been 
allowed, some important comments and proposals from 
the Committee would have emerged as we went through 
the pensions section. The Government had 20 months to 
prepare their Green Paper, which was delayed on several 
occasions. Clearly, it has stirred up a great deal of thought 
among all concerned. When we address the pension 
clauses and, in particular, the stakeholder clauses, will the 
Minister consider what I have said and the need for 
substantial amendment of the Bill to achieve a simple, 
low-cost pension for the self-employed?
<P>
<B>Mr. Brazier:</B> In considering the sittings motion, I 
thought that it might be interesting to see what the 
Government's explanatory notes say. Paragraph 3 of the 
introduction states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Because this Bill contains a large number of provisions, covering 
several subject areas, each of the main areas is introduced and 
described separately in the notes."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In other words, we have before us, as my hon. Friend the 
Member for Grantham and Stamford so cogently put it, 
three Bills welded together, each of which will require as 
much consideration as a whole Bill normally would.
<P>
You rightly restrained me earlier, Mr. Malins, from 
straying to the Family Law Act 1996. However, I want to 
illustrate why, besides the welfare and pensions, which 
the explanatory notes show are two separate areas, 
pension splitting is a separate area, which will need a huge 
amount of consideration on its own. We shall be 
considering the whole nature of the divorce process, 
which is far removed from the two other main sections of 
the Bill. The previous Government said that it was 
extremely complicated and difficult, and should be treated 
separately from their main measures on divorce. To tack 
it on to a Bill dealing with welfare and other more general 
pension matters presents a huge challenge to this 
Committee in the coming weeks. As we shall be still hard 
at it in the spillover after the summer recess, the Ministers 
will have the opportunity for further consultation on that 
subject, which mercifully comes towards the end of the 
Bill. That will help to make up for the premature 
curtailing of the consultation on earlier provisions.
<P>
One of the duties of Standing Committee members is 
to deal with the correspondence that comes to them when 
they are considering a Bill. Given the huge amount of 
ground covered by the Bill and the fact that the 
consultation period was curtailed, we will need a great 
deal of time to fill in the gaps from that consultation.
<P>
I want to clarify the record, as the Minister went a little 
wide in his opening remarks. He said that a number of 
Conservative Members in the Committee had strongly 
attacked the introduction by the previous Government of 
means-testing. That is true, although had he been his 
normal charitable self, he would have mentioned that the 
measures were introduced in 1988, when most of us had 
only just arrived in the House of Commons [Hon. 
Members: "Oh, that's all right then."	] I hope that 
Back-Bench Members of this Standing Committee, all of 
whom have at least a year's more experience in the House 
than I had in 1988, will show some independence of spirit.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I doubt it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brazier:</B> We are hoping.
<P>
Conservative Members have published many papers 
attacking means-testing. I have published four that have 
been reviewed in the broadsheet press. As we consider the 
provision, week after week, Labour Members must be 
clear that the bulk of the Bill takes the welfare state 
several steps further down the road that we began to go 
down in 1988.. many of their hon. Friends rightly 
predicted at the time, as did a number of Conservative 
colleagues, including Sir Brandon Rhys Williams, who is 
sadly no longer with us, that it would have consequences 
for increasing dependency. As we look hard over the next 
few weeks at pension and welfare provisions, it will be 
very much part of my duty to explain in detail why they 
will increase dependency and reduce thrift. For that 
reason, this will have to be a very long Standing 
Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I want to make one point that is directly 
relevant to the sittings motion. I do not intend to deal with 
the substance or merits of the Bill.
<P>
Some members of the Committee, like members of 
Select Committees, have devoted a considerable portion 
of their life to considering pension splitting on divorce, 
and we produced a well-received and detailed report. One 
of my many interests in the Bill is to ensure that we have 
adequate and full debate on pension splitting on divorce, 
which is an immensely complicated procedure. I have my 
own criticisms of it, which I do not need to go into now, 
but the provision could affect many millions of people in 
the next 50 years. The courts have traditionally found it 
difficult to intervene and we are opening up new ground. 
Without trying to be alarmist, I have always felt that this 
provision was a similar issue to the Child Support 
Agency, although not as disastrous. Therefore, I want to 
ensure that we have a full debate.
<P>
There are some controversial aspects early in the Bill, 
which, in view of what hon. Members have said, we shall 
have to debate at considerable length. I have one concern 
and I hope that the Minister can give me a commitment 
now, because pensions splitting on divorce is so important 
and is not a party political issue. I am fearful that at some 
stage the Government may say, "We have debated this for 
so many hours. We shall now move a guillotine and we 
shall do so before we reach pension splitting on divorce."	 
From previous experience I know that one moves 
suddenly into a guillotine timetable, where debate is 
severely curtailed. We could rightly spend a considerable 
amount of time I make no complaint about it on the 
earlier aspects of the Bill, which are politically 
contentious, and then have a hugely curtailed debate on 
pension splitting on divorce, which would not accord it 
the importance that it merits. Therefore, I hope that the 
Government will give a commitment that, whatever 
happens, the House will not fail in its duty to allow the 
Committee to devote the right amount of time to the 
debates on pension splitting on divorce.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I want to respond briefly to some of the 
points that have been raised in this interesting debate. The 
hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford said at the start 
of his speech that he thought that we should have three 
sittings motion debates. I think that the length of his 
speech was roughly equivalent to five and, although I will 
not replicate that, I make no apology for the fact that this 
is a wide-ranging, radical and far-reaching Bill. The 
Government are ambitious. We want to change the way 
in which the welfare system works by modernising and 
reforming it. The Bill is an important step in the right 
direction.
<P>
I was grateful for the comments of my hon. Friend the 
Member for Colne Valley. She spoke of her enthusiasm 
for sitting on the Committee and we look forward with 
enthusiasm to her contributions to our deliberations. I was 
especially grateful to her for eliciting from the hon. 
Member for Grantham and Stamford the withdrawal of 
his misleading remark about children. The Bill contains 
important improvements for the position of children. The 
well-being of children is a central concern of the 
Government. I was also grateful to my hon. Friend the 
Member for High Peak (Mr. Levitt) for his intervention, 
which caused a good deal of confusion among 
Opposition Members.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I want to respond to one point that is particularly 
relevant to the motion. The hon. Members for Grantham 
and Stamford and for Arundel and South Downs 
suggested that there had been inadequate consultation. 
There is some misunderstanding about the background 
and it is important that I set the record straight. There was 
thorough consultation on the framework for stakeholder 
pensions. Opposition Members should know that a 
consultation paper on stakeholder pensions was issued in 
November 1997. It received more than 200 detailed 
responses, which were taken into account when we 
developed the Green Paper proposals and the framework 
that is in the Bill. There have also been extensive 
discussions with representatives of the pensions industry. 
Full consultation has taken place on the measures before 
us. Beyond the framework in the Bill there will be as 
there always is with pensions legislation a raft of 
regulations. The consultation period is continuing to help 
to develop those.
<P>
The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford 
mentioned the National Association of Pension Funds. I 
met its chairman for the second time last week. I can 
reassure the hon. Gentleman that there are no complaints 
from the NAPF or any other part of the industry about the 
haste with which the process is proceeding. The 
commitment in the Queen's Speech to legislate on 
stakeholder pensions is honoured in the Bill. Hon. 
Members on the Committee and elsewhere will want to 
move swiftly to improve the woefully inadequate 
availability of funded pensions. There are many people 
for whom no appropriate funded pension is available. It 
is time for that to change. We are moving quickly, on the 
basis of full and thorough consultation, to put that right.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Flight:</B> At the time that stakeholder contributions 
were invited and received last November, the LISA 
proposal was not an option; it came later.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The measures represent the results of the 
full consultation on the proposals that were published in 
November 1997. The Green Paper, "A new contract for 
welfare: PARTNERSHIP IN PENSIONS,"	 made a clear 
and full reference to the fact that the Treasury would issue 
a consultation paper I refer the hon. Gentleman to 
paragraphs 38 and 39 on page 55. That is what has 
happened. The Treasury consultation document, which 
was issued and launched jointly by the Chancellor and my 
right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, makes it clear 
that no primary legislation is required to implement its 
contents; only secondary legislation is required. That is 
why the Bill contains nothing on that point. In response 
to the point made by the hon. Member for Gainsborough, 
I am confident that ample time will be available to 
consider all the measures in the Bill. At a relatively early 
stage of our deliberations we shall consider the measures 
on pension splitting on divorce. I want to speak briefly 
about that in a moment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> The Minister made a point about 
regulations in relation to the LISA and the stakeholder. 
Will he give the Committee an indication of the timing of 
those regulations? Will we have an opportunity to see 
some of the regulations in conjunction with the Bill, so 
that we can understand their implementation?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> We envisage that a series of consultation 
documents will be issued. Some of those will be issued 
before all stages of the Bill are complete, but the pattern 
that we are following is similar to that which was 
followed in previous pensions legislation. The framework 
in the Bill alone will allow the Committee to reach firm 
conclusions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> Are there any consultations or draft 
regulations that the Committee might be able to see in 
relation to early clauses? If so, our deliberations would be 
speeded up.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> No, it would not be appropriate to do so. 
Consultation documents will be issued before the summer 
and draft regulations will be published according to the 
normal process, which is similar to that which was 
followed in relation to the Pensions Act 1995.
<P>
On pension splitting divorce, I want to make one point 
to correct a misapprehension that could result from a 
remark made by the hon. Member for Grantham and 
Stamford. The Bill will not make pension sharing 
automatic; neither will the beneficiary gain a half share of 
the pension the hon. Gentleman gave the example of a 
friend. Each case will be agreed by the parties or the 
courts, on the merits of the individual case. The Bill will 
make that possible in a way that did not exist in the past, 
which is an important step forward. The key points are 
fairness and allowing pensions to be treated in the same 
way as other assets.
<P>
The Bill moves the welfare system in a radically 
different direction. We are changing the old passive 
system, which had many of the flaws that the hon. 
Gentleman had started to talk about 
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> Before the Minister completes his 
peroration he has been kind enough to mention my 
point will he make one easy commitment? It would only 
be necessary for the Government to move a guillote if 
hon. Members were filibustering. It would be out of order 
for hon. Members to do so, however, and it would not 
therefore happen. Opposition Members are not going to 
filibuster anyway. Will the Minister make a commitment 
that a guillotine motion will not be introduced before we 
reach the issue of pension splitting on divorce? I am sure 
that he can make such a commitment with great ease.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> If hon. Members look at the order of 
consideration motion, they will see that we will quickly 
reach the pension splitting on divorce measures, and I 
have no doubt that we will deal with them fully.
<P>
The Bill represents a radical change of direction for the 
welfare system. We inherited a passive system, which led 
to a number of the problems to which Opposition 
Members have rightly drawn attention. We want an active 
system, which is what the Bill will achieve. I look forward 
to our deliberations over the coming weeks, in accordance 
with the sittings motion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> I had not intended to catch your 
eye at all, Mr. Malins. I will not speak for long, but in the 
light of the Minister's remarks I must make one point, 
which goes to the heart of our proceedings. I hope that 
we have a straightforward and honest debate and that we 
discuss in turn the important points that arise. If the 
Government find themselves in difficulty, I hope that they 
will not try to extricate themselves by sleight of hand. My 
criticism of the Government for not taking children into 
account in the provisions on pension-splitting is serous 
and valid. The Government were embarrassed about that, 
so the Minister rose to his feet and said that they are 
mentioned in another part of the Bill, but he was thinking 
of the mobility allowance, which is a different matter. 
Children are not mentioned in the pension splitting 
provisions and we shall try to ensure that they are. We do 
not want the Government to shilly-shally.
<P>
What the Minister said about the consultation exercise 
was more of the same and worse. I am aware that the 
Government produced a document in November 1997, but 
it was a list of questions, not legislative proposals. It 
contained no framework and it was not a consultation 
paper because there were no proposals on which to 
consult The Government did not know what they were 
doing at that stage, so they sent out a list of questions and 
received all sorts of answers. They then took a very long 
time over a year to produce the Green Paper. That was 
the document on which there was consultation and which 
carried a deadline of 31 March. It was the document on 
which people were set to work in the hope that they would 
be able to influence the proposals that the Government 
were making for the first time. The Treasury then 
produced the LISA proposals a month or so ago, which 
were not anticipated in the original Green Paper.
<P>
The Government did not allow the consultation period 
to expire before introducing the Bill. They cannot get 
away from the fact that the Green Paper had a consultation 
period and a deadline, and the Government have breached 
both. I had asked the National Association of Pension 
Funds for comments on the Bill and it stated in a letter 
dated 24 February:
<P>
"As you are aware, the NAPF is still in the process of 
drawing up its response to the Green Paper. It is unlikely 
that we shall submit our response until shortly before the 
31 March deadline".<P>

<P>
So much for the idea of the NAPF being happy with the 
present situation or being able to formulate their proposals 
to the consultation exercise before the Bill was 
introduced.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<H4><center>"Meaning of stakeholder pension scheme"	</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> I beg to move, amendment
 No. 1, in page 1, leave out lines 7 to 11 and insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(a) A pension scheme is a stakeholder scheme for the purposes 
of this Part if it fulfils all the conditions of this section.'<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take 
amendment No. 7, in Clause 2, page 2, leave out lines 31 
to 33.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Clause 1 establishes the concept of 
stakeholder pensions. The Government are in considerable 
confusion. The Department of Social Security has an 
attachment to the idea of a stakeholder pension, which 
it states explicitly in its consultation document will be 
established by means of a trust. That is clear and there is 
no suggestion in the consultation document that any other 
formula or structure will be introduced and there is no 
statement that the Treasury will bring forward a 
non-trust-based alternative pension view. The DSS is 
committed to the idea of a trust. We believe that trusts 
form a valuable part of English law and have played a 
valuable part in our pensions industry and its history.
This country's substantial pension provision about £800 
billion which is largely managed by trusts, is extremely 
well managed, on the whole, on behalf of its beneficiaries. 
Of course, there have been some nasty scandals for 
example, the Maxwell scandal. The previous Government 
rightly responded by strengthening the protection for 
those pension assets that exist under trust law.
<P>
I would have thought that there was common ground 
between the Opposition and the Government on that 
matter, but I do not know whether the Government have 
thought through the issues sufficiently to have a clear 
view on many of them. However, that is certainly the 
ground on which the Conservative party has stood and 
will continue to stand. Nothing in the amendment should 
be interpreted as casting aspersions on the validity of the 
trust system and its appropriateness for many sorts of 
pension vehicles, or on the excellent work done by unpaid 
trustees throughout the country, who sit on the boards of 
the many pension schemes. I pay tribute to their work, as 
I have had the privilege of meeting many of them in my 
present capacity as Opposition spokesman on the subject.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
However, is it sensible to ensure that all stakeholder 
pensions are set up in the form of trusts? The Green Paper 
stated that that would be the case, but the Government do 
not really know. They have suggested that there should 
be a trust. However, clause 1(2) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The first condition is that the scheme is established under a 
trust"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
but it goes on 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"or in such other way as may be prescribed."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If the Government continue to want all stakeholder 
schemes to be set up under a trust they stated that in 
the Green Paper presumably only the first few words of 
subsection (2) will be appropriate. However, if they 
think as we do and as the Treasury and other 
Government Departments appear to do that other 
vehicles may be equally appropriate, why mention a trust 
anyway? It seems otiose and potentially deceptive to do 
so.
<P>
We established this morning that, unfortunately, the 
Government's attitude to welfare reform means that the 
number of people in whose interests it is to be involved 
in a stakeholder scheme is steadily reducing. However, 
we should make it as easy and cheap as possible for those 
people to become involved in such schemes. We want to 
move into the new regime with a minimum of disruption. 
We want a system that is not exclusive, but inclusive and 
that is not limiting but incremental. In other words, we 
want a system that will preserve the perfectly good 
pension provisions, pension instruments and pension 
vehicles that exist and that will encourage people to make 
further contributions to them. However, were an 
alternative vehicle to be more appropriate or more 
attractive, for which there is no current provision, we 
would not only be open-minded but enthusiastic about the 
introduction of such provisions, and we would readily 
work with the Government on that matter.
<P>
The first part of the amendment deals with the right of 
the trustees of a personal pension scheme to adjust that 
scheme so as to ensure that it qualifies as a stakeholder 
pension. The Bill is ambiguous as to what qualifies as a 
stakeholder pension. A subsequent amendment deals with 
whether one could still be prevented from holding a 
stakeholder pension, whatever one did, because the 
Occupational Pensions Regulator Authority had refused to 
register the pension holder. However, that is covered by 
a subsequent amendment and I shall not dwell on it now.
<P>
We have tabled the amendment because we believe 
that, where existing pension vehicles serve their purpose, 
they should continue and should be subsumed in the new 
regime. People should not be discouraged from continuing 
to contribute to them least of all should such pensions 
be ruled out as an appropriate stakeholder scheme. Our 
approach, which is different from the Government's, is 
permissive rather than restrictive, particularly in regard to 
vehicles that have proved their worth in the past.
<P>
Amendment No. 7 deals with the continuation of 
occupational pension schemes. Amendment No. 1 deals 
with personal pension schemes. In the regime that we 
believe would be appropriate I see no reason why the 
Government should object to it and I hope that they are 
listening with a genuinely open mind employers would 
have an obligation to make a stakeholder facility available 
to their employees: that is to say, they will make available 
information and a payroll deduction facility for pension 
provision. In a later amendment we seek a reduction, so 
that not all employers but only those employing more than 
10 people would have that obligation. For reasons that I 
shall subsequently explain, we believe that it would not 
be appropriate for all employers.
<P>
However, employers who have an obligation could 
allow employees to choose any appropriate vehicle and to 
set up the payroll deduction facility in response to that 
vehicle. Where the employee has a personal pension 
facility, perhaps because the employer does not offer an 
occupational pension or because the employee brought it 
from a previous employment or previous period of 
self-employment, it may be against his interests to have 
to abandon it and take up another personal pension or 
invest in another vehicle. It could be disruptive and 
expensive, because he may already have paid set-up 
charges that he was hoping would be amortised over his 
future working life. The charges will be spread over fewer 
years if he has to move out of that personal pension 
scheme and into something else.
<P>
Therefore, we want to encourage the qualification of 
personal pension schemes as stakeholder pensions rather 
than exclude them a priori, as I fear will be the effect of 
the Bill. One can never be certain what the effect of a Bill 
will be when it includes so much provision for so many 
regulations, which the Government have not told us about 
in advance. They have now said that they will not tell us 
about them.
<P>
Throughout our proceedings, if I make a good case 
against a provision in the Bill, Labour Members will be 
able to stand up and say either that I am wrong for reasons 
X, Y and Z or, "The hon. Member is perfectly right, but 
the Government were proposing changes anyway. That is 
why we provided ourselves with this open-ended 
regulatory power."	 We shall play that game in every 
debate. I mention it now so that it will not come as a 
surprise to us if that is the response.
<P>
If we ignore the open-ended regulatory power, the Bill 
will exclude personal pensions, which would be extremely 
unreasonable and undesirable for individuals. We want 
people to have as wide a choice as possible. Where 
personal pensions are the most appropriate choice, we 
want the pension holder to be able to continue with it. 
The Minister of State may have two legitimate objections 
to that. He may say that, in some cases, the personal 
pension is not the best choice, that there is something 
better: it may be cheaper to move into a LISA. He is 
unlikely to say that, because the LISA is the Treasury's 
baby. I doubt whether we shall hear anything nice about 
LISAs during our debates. The Minister of State will say 
that his own trust-based, stakeholder pensions are the best 
choice. Where it is sensible to make a change, we are the 
first to say that the employee should be able to make it 
and that the change should be facilitated. Indeed, we have 
tabled amendments dealing with the cost of making such 
transfers. The presumption is that, where a person has a 
good pension scheme, it may not be sensible to change. 
There may be cost implications of changing, which would 
be negative, or the policy holder may be happy with the 
scheme and its fund management. He may say, "I don't 
want to be taken away from this fund management. It is 
doing rather well for me."	
<P>
I anticipate that the objection will be that a personal 
pension is not appropriate. That is fine because our 
amendments would open choices to enable people to do 
what is in their best interest. I also anticipate the objection 
that in certain circumstances a personal pension scheme 
would not qualify as a stakeholder pension because it 
would be inappropriate. There is no point in taking up our 
time by considering various theoretical examples, such as 
what would happen if a scheme were run by Mr. Maxwell. 
The second half of the amendment provides for that. It 
says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Occupational Pensions Regulatory Authority shall have the 
power to make rules to specify on what terms and under which 
conditions the power under subsection (1AA) may be exercised.<P>

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman is 
speaking to amendment No. 8, which he knows has not 
been selected.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> All our amendments serve the same 
objectives and fall within the same framework. 
Amendment No. 1 is, as you have rightly decided,
Mr. Malins, the logical amendment with which to start 
our debate. It makes it clear that we want an open 
choice. The amendments that follow it would ensure 
that a LISA, a personal pension or an occupational 
pension, including a final salary-related occupational 
pension, are apart of the choices available. This 
extraordinary Bill is drafted in such a way that only 
pensions that offer money-purchase benefits can qualify 
as stakeholders. That must be wrong. Universal 
consensus among the pensions industry and pensions 
advisers is that salary-related schemes if a person is 
lucky enough to have access to one are extremely 
good value and, in most cases, the best value. The 
Government are, sadly, allowing those schemes to be 
run down, but I see no reason to exclude a 
salary-related occupational pension scheme. The 
permissive, facilitating provision that we wish to 
introduce is set out in the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> Will my hon. Friend explain why the 
Government believe that a scheme established under trust 
is both better protected and more advantageous for the 
recipient than an alternative scheme? What merit is there 
in a trust? I am not aware of any merit but my hon. Friend, 
with his considerable knowledge, may be able to 
enlighten me.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I do not always have an insight into what 
is in the mind of Labour Members. My hon. Friend raises 
a good point. However, it is not the Government who are 
obsessed with the idea of trust, but the Department of 
Social Security. The Treasury has issued a rival pension 
vehicle the LISA which the Department of Social 
Security does not like to mention, although I have referred 
to it several times this morning. It is extraordinary that 
that important alternative proposal, which was produced 
a few weeks after the Government's Green Paper, is not 
mentioned in the Bill because it does not involve a trust. 
A LISA allows a person to package a holding in a unit 
trust or a share in an investment trust or an open-ended 
investment company and treat it as a pension. That is an 
attractive idea. Indeed, other amendments will endeavour 
to make it clear that a LISA should also qualify as a 
stakeholder pension.
<P>
Why does the Treasury like LISAs? Because it 
understands the market better than the Department of 
Social Security. Why is the Department of Social Security 
so hung up on trusts? Either because it is a legacy from 
the past or because the Ministers, who are gentlemen in 
every sense of the word, are not experienced in aspects of 
financial markets that do not involve trusts and are 
unhappy about moving into them. That is my only 
explanation. Another explanation might be that parts of 
the Labour party remain attached to a traditional model 
that accounted for approximately 80 per cent. of the 
labour market 50 years ago, or 80 years ago, when the 
Labour party ceased to think. People stayed for a long 
time in labour-intensive industries with enormous work 
forces, such as coal mining and ship building. Because 
they were likely to stay together for most of their working 
lives and to continue to live in the same area, it was 
sensible for a pension scheme to embrace all such 
employees. The scheme could be administered easily and 
trustees with whom employees and former employees 
were familiar could be elected.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
That model is fine, but the labour market has moved 
away from it. People change jobs more frequently. As a 
result of technological progress, businesses are often less 
labour-intensive and more capital intensive. One no 
longer has large gatherings of employees who stay 
together. For such employees, a trust had obvious 
advantages that could not be exploited through the 
movement of individuals from one business to another or 
from one part of the country to another, through the 
different parts of the single market, and in other contexts 
such as self-employment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> Would it be fair to say that, since the 
announcement of the LISA scheme, stakeholder schemes 
have begun to look somewhat out of date and inadequate? 
The amendment's purpose is to give stakeholder schemes 
a chance to make the system more workable. It is a clear 
indication of the Opposition's intention to make the 
stakeholder scheme work.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend, who 
summarised in a few sentences what I had said less lucidly 
in several paragraphs. Our view is represented in a broad, 
permissive amendment, which would open the gates to 
any reasonable, respectable pension vehicle. Any scheme 
that offers good value to pensioners should be allowed as 
a stakeholder scheme. My hon. Friend is right: had we 
left unchallenged the Bill's restrictive drafting and the 
restrictive vision demonstrated in the Department of 
Social Security's Green Paper, the resulting trust-based 
stakeholder scheme would have been used only in 
connection with mis-selling. For example, it would have 
been used where an employer has to wind down an 
occupational pension scheme or a group personal pension 
scheme and replace it with a so-called stakeholder 
pension, or where unless the amendment to which I 
prematurely referred were to be adopted a personal 
pension is replaced with something less desirable than a 
stakeholder pension. That would be barmy and very 
damaging.
<P>
The Government have not thought through the issue, 
and the lack of consultation has made the problem 
inevitable. Even if my hon. Friend and I were in 
Government, we would not have the arrogance to suppose 
that we knew everything. We would not introduce such a 
Bill before the consultation period had expired. We would 
want to hear what the National Association of Pension 
Funds, and groups such as trade unions and friendly 
societies had to say on the matter. We would want to 
hear from those sections of the industry that can exploit a 
trust-based stakeholder pension as the Government 
narrowly conceive it, from the unit trust and investment 
trust industries, or from the new OEICs open-ended 
investment companies. Some people are more excited 
about the prospects associated with the Treasury's rival 
LISA scheme. The question is whether to adopt a 
restrictive or a permissive approach. If one adopts a 
permissive approach, one should agree to the amendment. 
We have also tabled other amendments that will leave out 
many of the clause's subsequent provisions.
<P>
Pension scheme and stakeholder scheme proposals will 
meet the clause's conditions. That suggests that the Bill 
should not require a scheme to have OPRA registration to 
qualify, which is a tricky issue. We have no objection to 
the idea of OPRA maintaining a register, or to it or 
another appropriate regulator, such as the Financial 
Services Authority overseeing the whole system and 
carefully investigating allegations of abuse. There must 
be an appropriate regulatory framework. We have 
considerable objections, however, to the idea of involving 
more than one regulatory authority. That would be 
unreasonable, either because differential burdens would 
be placed on different types of pension vehicle, further 
fragmenting the market and complicating individuals' 
choice, which is inherently undesirable, or because gaps 
would appear in the responsibilities of regulators. The 
clause means that anybody could offer a stakeholder 
pension so long as certain requirements were observed.
<P>
If our amendments were agreed to, those requirements 
will be minimal but essential,a nd, importantly, 
registration will not be a requirement. If they are not 
agreed to, only those schemes that have been explicitly 
accepted by OPRA will be accepted as stakeholder 
pensions on day one of the Bill's enactment. Even if 
OPRA does its job conscientiously and thoroughly, as I 
am sure it will, a tremendous backlog of work will 
develop. It will take months perhaps even years to go 
through all the personal and occupational pension 
schemes in this country, whether final salary or money 
purchase. As I said, we will come to an Opposition 
amendment that will, I hope, rule out that anomaly. It will 
take months or years for all such schemes to be registered 
and to decide who can play in this pool, and that is not 
good for anyone.
<P>
The Government's proposals will produce a peculiar 
situation. An employer will have a legal obligation to 
provide a stakeholder pension but, because one or more 
of his employees has a personal pension that has not been 
registered by OPRA, for example, he will not be able to 
satisfy his legal obligation by pointing to an employee's 
existing personal pension. What will happen? The 
employer might say to the employee, "I am sorry, I shall 
be fined by OPRA unless you give up your personal 
pension tomorrow and take out a stakeholder pension."	 
The employee might say, "For God's sake, the trustees 
tell me that OPRA has an appointment to see them in six 
weeks' time. It cannot come earlier, and I am sure that 
my personal pension, which is entirely respectable, will 
be duly registered."	
<P>
The amendment has two purposes: first, it would allow 
personal pensions to qualify; and, secondly, in 
combination with other amendments, which we shall 
discuss later, it would ensure that occupational pension 
schemes, final salary schemes and LISAs also qualify by 
meeting the clause's minimal requirements. Registration 
should not be an essential part of that mechanism.
<P>
I hope that the amendment's purpose is clear and that 
the Government will accept it. They should do so, unless 
their real agenda is to have a restrictive version of the 
personal pension scheme, which will exclude vehicles that 
currently give good value, and to restrict rather than 
enhance the choice available to people who seek to 
provide for their retirement.
