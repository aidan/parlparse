               <p class="tabbed">As
a general rule, I and my fellow Chairs do not intend to call starred
amendments, which have not been tabled with adequate notice. The
required notice period in Public Bill Committees is three working days.
Therefore, amendments should be tabled by the rise of the House on
Monday for consideration on a Thursday, and by the rise of the House on
Thursday for consideration on a Tuesday.<a class="bkMark" name="11071270000018">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Not everyone
is familiar with the process of taking oral evidence in Public Bill
Committees, so it might help everyone if I briefly explain how we will
proceed. The Committee will first be asked to consider the programme
motion on the amendment paper. Debate on that is limited to half an
hour. The Government have tabled an amendment to the motion. We will
then proceed to a motion to report written evidence and then to a
motion, which I hope we can take formally, to commit the Committee to
deliberate in private in advance of the oral evidence
sessions.<a class="bkMark" name="11071270000019">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Assuming
that the second motion is agreed to, the Committee will move into
private session. Once the Committee has deliberated, witnesses and
members of the public will be invited back into the room, and our oral
evidence session will begin. If the Committee agrees to the programme
motion, we will start to hear oral evidence this
morning.<a class="bkMark" name="11071270000020">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> Thank you, Mr Hollobone, for that introduction.
I and my colleagues are looking forward to serving under your
chairmanship over the coming weeks. The dates are set out in the
motion. There will be 18 sittings over nine days, including four
sittings to hear evidence. We think that that is adequate time for
consideration of the Bill. We have invited a broad range of witnesses
and taken some helpful suggestions from the Opposition about them, and
we look forward to hearing from them over the coming days. We propose
to consider the Bill in order, with schedules taken with relevant
clauses. We propose to debate any new clauses and schedules when we get
to the end of each part of the Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11071270000024">&#160;</a>

it is to serve under your chairmanship this morning, Mr

               </p>
               <p class="hs_ParaIndent">The
Opposition have already made it clear to the Government that we think
that the timetable for the Bill’s Committee stage is not
adequate, and that at least one extra day is needed for taking
evidence. The fact that the Minister has to amend the timetable for
evidence, because one of the important witnesses, the
Council of Her Majesty’s Circuit Judges, cannot come at that
time, is evident of the rushed nature of the proceedings. That began by
not allowing adequate time between the publication of the Bill and the
debate on Second Reading, and it is continuing now. We have already
made it clear that we think there should be more days for line-by-line
consideration of the Bill extending further into October. We will
oppose the programme motion this
morning</p>

                  </span> I also look forward to
serving under your chairmanship today and throughout the course of the
Bill in Committee, Mr Hollobone.<a class="bkMark" name="11071270000026">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I will be
brief because there is an irony in taking a long time to debate the
programme motion—it takes time from witnesses. However, this is
a very important point. It particularly refers to the two days of
witness evidence. In a way, it is a tribute Clerks’ work in
accommodating almost all the 35-odd witnesses who have been suggested
by the Government and the Opposition. The consequence of that is that
there is such a short time to deal with each witness that their
evidence becomes, not irrelevant, but so severely curtailed as not to
give fair representation of their views.<a class="bkMark" name="11071270000027">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Let me
consider two examples of that. Today, we have one hour to hear from the
Law Society, the Bar Council and two other very important witnesses in
one session. The Law Society and the Bar Council alone no doubt have
comments to make about all the different aspects. This is a Christmas
tree Bill, which has many important and differing parts to it. On
Thursday 14<p class="Sup"> </p>July, we will take, in the course of
four to five minutes, evidence from Shelter, Citizens Advice, the Law
Centres Federation, the Advice Services Alliance and R3, which has a
particular brief on insolvency. How on earth can the Committee, with
the number of Members it has, adequately question those witnesses in
that time? We made a very reasonable request for a third day of
evidence, which, at least, would have given the expanded time to do
that. We have not been granted that.<a class="bkMark" name="11071270000028">&#160;</a>

               </div>
               <p class="tabbed">We also asked
for a modest four additional days for consideration, clause by clause,
of the Bill. Let me specifically comment on the evidence today. The
oral evidence sessions will not be adequate to the task. It is a
subversion of the purpose of those sessions, which is to allow adequate
time for these very important witnesses to give evidence. We will
oppose the programme motion on the clear basis that we wish to see one
additional day’s evidence.<a class="bkMark" name="11071270000029">&#160;</a>

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I wonder
whether I could give a little reassurance to the hon. Member for
Hammersmith. The Justice Committee has looked in great detail at the
Government’s legal aid proposals—considerable detail over
many weeks and many thousands of words of evidence. The Government have
made some key changes in response to their consultation, but the great
bulk of proposals is as presented to the Justice Committee, and we
investigated them at considerable length.<a class="bkMark" name="11071270000031">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I know that
the hon. Gentleman is a keen reader of the Justice Committee’s
official journal, but if he were to reacquaint himself with it, he
would find ample time given to the Law Society, the Bar Council, the
Family Law Bar Association, and a whole series of other organisations
that gave evidence in detail. He could inform himself thereby. This
afternoon’s evidence session is perfectly adequate for looking
at the Government’s changes to the existing
proposals.<a class="bkMark" name="11071270000032">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Adverting to
what the hon. Member for Ipswich just said, I am also a member of the
Justice Committee. We do not have a monopoly on wisdom. If it means
anything at all, this process means starting again. We cannot dictate
to a Standing Committee what should be changed in the law. It seems to
me the whole purpose of today is to ask experts in the field to give
their opinion of a very important measure. I do not know how the three
esteemed bodies are going to do it in half an hour each. It is almost
offensive to them. We are just going through the motions and that is
not good enough.<a class="bkMark" name="11071270000034">&#160;</a>

want to add that, in my previous experience of sitting on a Public Bill

<div class="columnNumber">

               <p class="tabbed">I am rather
surprised to be lectured on programme motions by the Opposition, and
from someone who, in the previous Parliament, was in a Government who
abused the guillotine to such an extent. I remember sitting in this
very room waiting for some evidence from a former director of MI5 that
was blocked by the previous Government in case she said something that
they did not like. “Pot” and “kettle black”
comes to mind.<a class="bkMark" name="11071270000038">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The
Opposition are asking us to reconsider the programme motion when, so
far, the Opposition have not tabled a single amendment to the Bill. How
can we disagree with a programme motion when we do not know what the
Opposition are going to put forward to amend the Bill? So far, their
ideas—like their policy—are completely blank on this
Bill. They are asking us to vote against a programme motion just
because they do not like it, but there is a deafening silence on any
alternatives to the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11071270000039">&#160;</a>

Lyon:</strong>
                  </em> I would like to say that the Prison Reform
Trust welcomes many of the opportunities and measures in the
Bill—I am careful not to say all—in a valiant and useful
effort to try and sort out various messes that have occurred within the
justice system, which we fear over years has responded to populist
concerns. The inflation in sentencing has led to undue pressure on the
Prison Service, on other criminal justice bodies and, of course, on
prisoners themselves and their families. We think that the moderation
and proportionality within the Bill are to be
welcomed.<a class="bkMark" name="11071270000090">&#160;</a>

                     <strong>Frances
Crook:</strong>
                  </em> I would like to echo that. The Howard League
for Penal Reform does welcome many of the measures in the Bill. It is
very important to exert downward pressure on the system, because over
the last 10 to 15 years, the prison system has sucked in far too many
resources and too much attention, and it is important to exert some
downward pressure. We welcome the general thrust and think some of the
tidying up is very important. We are concerned about some of the
clauses in the legislation that I think are a bit muddled. In the
spirit of constructive discussion, we would like to offer some helpful
suggestions to the Committee about how that can be tidied
up.<a class="bkMark" name="11071270000091">&#160;</a>

procedure as I go. Probation trusts across the country are facing
severe cuts. Is there capacity within the service—in youth

                  </em> That is one of our concerns. The Government
does appear to be looking to make cuts across the board in the criminal
justice system. We do not have a problem with cuts that are related to
reducing the prison population, but we have to understand that that
does put pressure on the community end. The danger if we cut probation
as well is that we are setting people up to fail. It is very important

                  </em> It is important to note that, if the Bill
succeeds in reducing prison numbers to something like an unavoidable
minimum, there is the prospect or possibility of justice reinvestment.
That would be something we would welcome. It is a subject that the
Justice Committee turned its attention to last year. We would like to
see moneys freed up for proper work by probation and youth offending
teams. It is a very important question. It is also important to note
that youth offending teams have succeeded thus far in working
effectively with young people, to the extent that they have
succeeded—along with others—in reducing the number of
under-18-year-olds in custody by about a third within the last three
years. That indicates the prospect for more work of that kind,
particularly for 18 to 20-years-olds. We would share your concerns that
success will be to do with implementation and adequate
resourcing.<a class="bkMark" name="11071270000094">&#160;</a>

custody—but there is scope for more opportunities to alert local
authorities as to their conjoined responsibilities. That would make a

reducing costs outside the criminal justice system, but surely there is
a lot of cost just in the process of the system? Could you identify any
savings that could be made in the National

prisons? So could you identify savings in the cost per place and the

cutting regimes or staff numbers, but in the end that is not really
going to make a huge amount of difference. Real savings can be made
only by closing institutions and reinvesting that money in community
provision and community prevention. We know that, for the majority of
people who commit offences, that is a safe and effective way of
managing them in the community. That is where the costs have to be
diverted and where the better community provision will prevent people
from committing future

prison to prison and what kind of establishment you use. The cost in
this country for provision for young people, for example, is very high,
but you cut it at your peril. If you are going to lock up young people,
the cost will be high because they have to be safe. You cannot do
incarceration on the cheap, because the consequences are more

add that the costs of reoffending in this system and the costs of
reoffending by people who have come out of custody are extremely high.
We have long campaigned for community sentences that actually
achieve a lower reoffending rate than often short
custodial sentences. There is a significant saving that can be made
from that move towards community sentences as opposed to prison
sentences.<a class="bkMark" name="11071270000103">&#160;</a>

research shows that community sentences are now outperforming a short
prison sentence by at least 7%. That is heartening news, although there
is further scope. To answer your point directly, I am very much with
colleagues here that if you reduce the £45,000 average cost of a
prison place—over £50,000 for women and considerably
higher for children—you risk even higher reoffending rates. So
it is a very short-term saving for a very long-term

out—the recent example is Birmingham, which is a large prison,
with 1,500 prisoners and a lot of problems—a succession of
inspectorate reports have said that the problems
in that prison are around safety and staff-prisoner relationships.
These are both things that are related to the amount of staff in a
prison—there are not enough. What we have seen is that the
private contractor that will now be running that prison is actually
cutting staff, so those problems will increase. So there are not just
problems with reoffending, but problems in institutions that will be
exacerbated
potentially.<a class="bkMark" name="11071270000105">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> May I go back to finance? What you describe is
a virtuous circle whereby the money saved from prison places is
invested in community punishments, which in turn may prevent
reoffending, which in turn may save money. There are some signs that
that has been happening in youth offending, with places being taken
out. What I suggest, and I ask you to comment on, is that this Bill is
a vicious circle downwards, because the money is simply being taken out
of the system. We have cuts of up to 10% in probation services and
average cuts of 18% in youth offending teams this year. Do you not
think that those services are being set up to fail? New
responsibilities are being put on those bodies by the Bill, but they
will have many fewer resources to deal with
them?<a class="bkMark" name="11071270000106">&#160;</a>

                  </em> It certainly seems to us that we currently
place far too much store on what imprisonment can achieve.
Consequently, we welcome the idea that prison would take a
disproportionate proportion of the cuts if, and only if, numbers can be
reduced. One would certainly not be arguing for fewer staff
or less effective institutions. Far from it. But it is true that until
a whole institution is closed significant savings cannot be made. It
seems to us that the Ministry of Justice should be working towards
rationalising the prison estate and, on the basis of a thorough-going
review, making clear decisions about how many establishments they need,
in what order and where those establishments have to be sited. That is
where the savings will come. Without that, it is going to be very
piecemeal and difficult to achieve.<a class="bkMark" name="11071270000107">&#160;</a>

Let us say those savings are made and are going to the Treasury. What
then happens? There are very high levels of cuts,

consequences will be in terms of rehabilitation on the ability of those
services to deal with their current work load or an additional work
load? There are no extra resources being put

authorities and other people. We would like to see a downward pressure
so that resources are diverted to prevention. I would much prefer that
the crimes were not committed in the first place rather than trying to
pick up the pieces afterwards. At the moment the criminal justice
system puts huge resources into cleaning up the mess after, and tends
to make it worse rather than better. We want to see a downward pressure
in prevention. We have seen that in the youth justice system. Not only
are fewer children going into custody, which in itself is good because
it is cheaper and better for the kids and the community; but we have
also seen a reduction in first-time entrants and arrest rates. We need
a downward pressure all the way down. You are absolutely right. The
resources cannot just be taken out of one place and put back into the
Treasury. What has to happen is that those resources have to be put
into the prevention side, into children’s services for example,
so that children do not commit the crimes and do not get into trouble
in the first place: fewer victims, less crime, fewer people in prison
and safer communities.<a class="bkMark" name="11071270000109">&#160;</a>

to ensure that we are doing the right thing by older teenagers and

Crook:</strong>
                  </em> I have campaigned for work in prisons for 15
years, and I think that long-term, adult male prisoners should have the
opportunity to do a day’s work and should be contributing to
society by paying tax. The Prisoners’ Earnings Act was promoted
by my local Member of Parliament. I told him at the time it was not the
right answer to the question and I still do not think it is. I welcome
the Government’s commitment to this. It is a fantastic
opportunity. We could be showing the world how long-term, adult male
prisoners could be contributing—keeping their families, paying
some contribution to victims’ charities and doing an honest
day’s work for an honest day’s pay—rather than
lying idle on their bunk for 20 years at a cost of £2 million to
the taxpayer. That is a problem and work in prisons is a solution.
However, not only is the Prisoners’ Earnings Act flawed, I think
the clauses in this Bill are misguided. It is not necessary to have
legislation on this; the powers already exist. In fact, I am in
discussion with a prison at the moment about starting a business inside
a prison.

power within the Prison Service to allow people to work. They can be
properly employed by outside companies, paid the rate for the job and

to bring in other legislation. We are very keen to work with the
Government on this and welcome the proposals, but I do not think the

“Time is Money” looking at financial exclusion of people
both while they are in prison, when debts can continue to mount up, and
when they leave and cannot get bank accounts or insurance, or they
leave with a discharge grant which cannot possibly last the two weeks
after they leave. Alongside the Prisoners’ Earnings Act, and the
emphasis on responsible work in prison, we have to think about the ways
we sometimes make it impossible for people to take responsibility,

Crook:</strong>
                  </em> I think I am the only person who has ever run
a real business inside a prison and employed
prisoners on a real wage on the same terms and conditions as I was
employed, including holiday pay and sick pay. We deducted tax and had a
voluntary compact with our prisoner employees to deduct 30% of their
net wages and pay that into a victims fund. As a condition of being
able to apply to go to a working prison, prisoners would sign up to
having a proportion of their wages deducted to go to a fund for
victims, which would be a symbolic in lieu of bed and board, because
bed and board costs cannot be deducted. It is possible to do
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11071270000121">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The important
thing is that prisoners should be employed by outside bodies, not by
the Prison Service. This Bill is replicating the flaw that assumes that
it is the Prison Service that will be subcontracting the industries
from outside businesses and then employing prisoners again. The Prison
Service, with the best will in the world, cannot run businesses and
they cannot employ people. They failed for 100 years and they will
continue failing. We need to get outside businesses employing prisoners
inside prisons on real wages, on real businesses, in the real world.

all.<a class="bkMark" name="11071270000122">&#160;</a>

                  </em> We have already gone through some of this in
earlier answers. There is danger in a reduction in funds for the
system. At the same time, we have to ask the question: is the system
too large and are we putting too many people, never mind in prison, but
on probation, too? There is overcrowding in both systems and it is the
reach of the criminal justice system, the fact that it now takes in
more people than ever before, and that it costs more than in many other
countries, that means that although all our organisations are worried
about the balance of cuts, we see scope for a much reduced criminal
justice system. That is an important point to
make.<a class="bkMark" name="11071270000125">&#160;</a>

might have been bolder, but there is a bigger question about what is

at all, or possibly as a footnote, I gather. This is remarkable, given
the work that was done by a number of bodies including, most recently,
the Corston review. We firmly believe, and we now have the findings of
the Women’s Justice Taskforce to back it up, that the number of
women in prison could easily be reduced by the same degree as the
number of under 18-year-olds, given the level of vulnerability, the
petty, persistent nature of much of the offending and the need to work
on addictions, enabling women to get out of debt and so
forth.<a class="bkMark" name="11071270000128">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">What has
really impressed us, and the members of the Women’s Justice
Taskforce, has been a range of schemes outside prison walls,
particularly women’s centres, where women can attend, continue
to take responsibility for their children and address the particular
causes of their offending. They are showing very good results. We think
there are solutions, but we regret very much that the Government have
not chosen at this stage to indicate that they are prepared to take
particular steps in relation to women. We think there is a good case
for a national strategy to reduce women’s imprisonment and
respond to their particular needs. There is a good case for much
improved leadership on this issue, which is indicative of the fact that
women have not appeared in the Bill. You will see a set of coherent
clauses about youth justice, but nothing about women’s justice.

case we do not come on to them, I want to flag up that the bail and
remand provisions will have a positive effect on women. At the moment,
one third of women offenders remanded into custody do not go on to
receive a custodial sentence. That is hugely disproportionate. Often
women are carers of children, there is disruption to the family home
and to employment and caring responsibilities, so the CJA is supportive
of the provisions on bail and remand in the way they will impact on
women, for whom they are used far too frequently and with very severe
consequences.<a class="bkMark" name="11071270000130">&#160;</a>

decide on bail. How do you think the outcome of a case can be predicted

a provision such that when somebody is found not guilty, or after a

reality is that currently more than 50,000 people a year enter prison
to serve a period on remand in custody. Of those, more than 11,000 are
acquitted and about a half do not go on to a further custodial penalty.

ways of doing that, and there are other ways of ensuring that people
turn up for trial. It is a timely review, in fact way over time, so we

sentences. Could you give us your view, because it is slightly elephant
in the room when you are talking about cost and waste. Locking up 6,000
people, 3,500 of whom have already served their tariff and are lolling
around in their cells, is a vast waste of money, even if that money
could have been used to re-educate them or do something else and be cut
from rehabilitation. What is your impression of the IPP policy as it

sentences and the proposal to bring the review and findings from that
back into the Bill. This is another instance of massive unfairness, and
I do not think they are “lolling around in their cells.”
We run an advice and information service that responds to about 6,000
prisoners and their families each year. Very many of them are serving
an IPP or are concerned about someone serving an IPP. Our experience is
that people are chasing courses; that is the best way of putting it.
Given that the only way out of the maze for many people is to do an
offending behaviour programme, they are trying to transfer from one
prison to another, desperately trying to gain a place on a
course.<a class="bkMark" name="11071270000136">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Last week,
somebody phoned us who had a 71-day tariff. He has currently served
five years and is still asking for advice on where courses might be
available or when he might have a parole hearing. This is totally
unacceptable. May I give you one other example, because it concentrates
the mind? There was a woman who went into Holloway prison on remand.
During that time, she set fire to herself and her cell because she
wanted to kill herself. When she came to court she was acquitted of the
remand charge, the offence for which she had been remanded, but she was
given an IPP sentence by the judge because he said that arson was a
serious offence and she might well commit that same offence again
outside in the community.<a class="bkMark" name="11071270000137">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">We do not
know what has happened to her, but the odds are, I fear, that she may
well be still serving that period of time in custody. It is Kafkaesque
and unfair, and has attracted the disapproval and criticism of almost
everyone in the criminal justice system, from judges to the Prison
Governors Association and the staff who have to work and manage the
system. We would dearly love to see the provision brought under control
and disposed of in its current form.<a class="bkMark" name="11071270000138">&#160;</a>

enacted with the idea of being tough on crime, that these people would
never get out—or certainly not without going through many
courses and proving that they are safe—it has not worked. We
have seen this in high-profile cases, for example Baby P’s
mother, who received an IPP sentence. All the media coverage focused on
the minimum tariff, so it seemed as if—I cannot 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 16<a class="bkMark" name="Column16">&#160;</a>
                  </div>remember the exact figure—she was going to serve four years. The
media focused on that and whipped up public outrage that that was all
she was getting, whether that was correct or not. The IPP has not even
worked in that sense. It is a sentence, as Juliet has said, which has
been a complete disaster. Anyone working in the system will tell you
that. The Howard League would say that it is wrong in principle,
because in the end you are locking people up, not for what they have
done, but for what they might do, and we believe that is unjust. Even
beyond principle, it has practically failed and, in fact, in a system
where you will see budget cuts, there will be even less opportunity for
people to do courses and even less opportunity to progress through
their sentence. We have to get the IPP

The evidence from the young men themselves was very clear: it is not
the sentencing that is the deterrent. Their lives were so chaotic and
so violent that they were much more afraid of each other and being
knifed, than of carrying a knife or being arrested. Sometimes mandatory
minimum sentences constrain judges’ discretion irrelevantly and

work back to England that has been offshore. I am very pleased to see,
for example, that BT has brought back its call centres. That sort of
work could be put into prisons; it could be done competitively inside
prisons, which would not take work away from local people, but it has
to be run by outside businesses. The central flaw here is that the

benefited from increased money within the prison economy, so they could
buy extra bits and pieces within the prison. Most importantly, they
could send money out to their families. At the moment what families
have to do is send money in to prisoners; and if the families are on
benefits, that is a huge tax on them.<a class="bkMark" name="11071270000148">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I think the
other thing that is missing here is support for families. If a man is
earning a real wage in a prison, why should he not be asked to keep his
family? At the moment there is a sleight of hand with the Benefits
Agency, which means that they are not required to do that. They are not
required to support their children or their families, and I think that
is a huge
mistake.<a class="bkMark" name="11071270000149">&#160;</a>

the prison population. We know that they are likely to be the poorest
people in our society. I think there is a very important lesson for
Government—that if you are going to do criminal justice reform
you have to link it up to social welfare provision. You have to think
seriously about joining up services, and not having a separate silo for
justice.<a class="bkMark" name="11071270000151">&#160;</a>

engagement of other public and voluntary services, so that while they
are in prison the whole purpose of their time there is to spend it

witnesses who gave evidence this morning included IPPs when they made

opportunity to ask for their view of an IPP, and as the Government have
openly said that measures on IPP may come forward at some stage in the

You have to look at the detail, but at the moment, there is no detail

39 hours a week, so it is ridiculous to consider that prisoners should
be working for 40 hours a week when the staff are not going to be there
to implement that. That is one of the resource implications that we
would have. Of course, prison officer numbers are actually going to

                  </em> Answers to parliamentary questions about
prisoners work activity show that, on average, it was about 13.9 hours
in 2009-10. Last week I was in Holme House, which has managed to get
100 prisoners working up to 34 hours a week, but that is keeping
prisoners out over lunch time. The governor’s worry is that once
budget cuts start to kick in over the next three or four years, he will
have to cut back
again.<a class="bkMark" name="11071270000180">&#160;</a>

<div class="columnNumber">

                  </div>this morning that there is a feeling that prisons are not equipped to

Gillan:</strong>
                  </em> It depends what prison you are looking at.
Some local prisons are severely overcrowded, and do not have the
correct work spaces and workshops that prisoners can go to, to do the
work. For example, Holme House is a newish prison, but it has over
1,000 prisoners and only 100 of them were allocated to the workshop
doing 34 hours of work. That is a tiny proportion in relation to Holme
House. We would have a problem with other aspects of prisoners working
and the amount of money involved, and I am happy to elaborate on that
later.<a class="bkMark" name="11071270000182">&#160;</a>

work you are talking about—the workshops that are already there.
If we are talking about external companies coming in and setting up a
business within a prison, then surely it would be up to them to set up
the infrastructure to allow those prisoners to do the meaningful work.

forward?<a class="bkMark" name="11071270000183">&#160;</a>

the reality is there is no meat on the bone at this moment in time, and
we do not know what individual companies may be talking about. We are
broadly supportive of prisoners working, but it has to be meaningful,
constructive and worthwhile, not putting knives and forks in plastic
envelopes for airlines, which does not assist at all. Of course, you
have to look at the situation with regard to companies that may well be
laying people off on the outside and coming into prisons and setting up
work forces. I am not sure how the general public would view
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11071270000184">&#160;</a>

“meaningful”— that it has to be meaningful
work—and then give the example of putting knives and forks
together. Plenty of people outside prison are doing that type of work
and regard it as meaningful because of what it achieves for them.
Surely that is what we are trying to get for the prisoners. That sense
of meaningful work is in supporting their families and giving something
back to society.<a class="bkMark" name="11071270000185">&#160;</a>

in time, for the simple reason that we do not know enough about payment

awaiting the results of those pilots, which are not due out until 2015.
To lay all your eggs in one basket, as we have just seen in the market

not been measured and we seem to be playing a little bit of fast and

very little at the moment, and the signs are that the project in
Peterborough will take some time to assess. It seems to be something of
a side issue in terms of those working on the ground and those who are
dealing with community supervision on a day-to-day basis. At the
moment, that has had no impact at all. We are concerned that there are
issues about how you measure payment by results, and what you are
looking to find out. Are you looking to improve things such as
recidivism rates? We would all support that, but the problem is that
with some sort of profit motive or financial incentive around it, we
fear that the wrong motivation may begin to underpin a
payment-by-results system. That is something that we would expect to be
rigorously
scrutinised.<a class="bkMark" name="11071270000189">&#160;</a>

                  </em> From the NAPO perspective, we have argued
consistently—we argued this very strongly in our response to the
Green Paper—for an increase in resources for the probation
services in order to focus on offenders, particularly those in the
category that you have just described, so that we could target the
problem behaviour that they were presenting and intervene intensively
and frequently at an early stage post sentence. The concern is that
something of the revolution has been lost in the resulting
Bill—we welcomed much of the original Green Paper—and we
fear that there is now less of a focus on how we intervene positively
to change lives, to use the old chestnut. That is how we protect
communities and reduce the number of victims in our communities. It
would be true to say that there has been a shift away from the focus on
early intervention and rehabilitation, which may have unfortunate
consequences.<a class="bkMark" name="11071270000193">&#160;</a>

identified as being prolific and prison officers are attached to them
now in a multi-agency approach from outside in the community. We did
this sort of thing probably 20 years ago, when it was called through
care, but because of resources it goes by the wayside. It is very
important that we get back to that ethos of investment. If we invest in
the right areas, the prison population will come down and the general

approximately 43,000 prisoners and now we have 85,000 prisoners and
roughly the same number of prison staff to work with them. Prisoners
have doubled but staff have not. We have to get back to multi-agency
networks working. There has to be a balance between community-based
stuff and prison because the reality is that the general public want to

need to have the same resources that are there if you wanted to do
things like the Work programme and more work in prisons. It seems to
me—I do not know about other members of the
Committee—that there is a contradiction here. There seems to be
the easy hit. First, the Treasury takes a lump sum out of the system,
then we transfer some into preventive services in probation and youth
offending and that comes from your budget when you are saying that

the resources are interlinked in that sense. We have argued from a NAPO
perspective that fewer people should go to prison for short

POA perspective. We also think it is not always easy for prisons to
intervene in a positive way and they end up being warehouses
essentially, rather than positively intervening in the lives of those
they have custody of. That argument is not about taking resources away.
It is about freeing up resources in the prison system to be able to
work effectively in the way Steve described

report was absolutely key to sentences in terms of making a judgment.
One of the things you did, through the process of preparing a report,
was to explain sentences to those you were working with, so the
offenders got the explanation from you of whether it was going to be a
custodial sentence or some sort of community sentence.</p>

                  </em> That is partially correct. I believe that you
cannot just look at the Bill in isolation from everything else that is
going on with the cuts generally: police budgets have been cut,
probation, even voluntary and community services. Inevitably—and
there is some evidence out there—we believe that when
unemployment goes up, crime will go up. So we do not believe that the
prison population will fall as dramatically as anticipated; and, of
course, with the U-turn on the discount rate  of 50%, there is
now a black hole in that budget of £130 million. We
are greatly concerned about how that is going to be
achieved.<a class="bkMark" name="11071270000207">&#160;</a>

reflecting on what I said earlier, that is why we are so disappointed
in many ways by some of the shifts in the Bill away from the Green
Paper that originally prompted it. Certainly the elements that may be
added that I know have been discussed by Government, like introducing
more mandatory imprisonment for certain types of behaviour and
effectively reducing the discretion of the judiciary, are
disappointing. They have run the risk of increasing the prison
population considerably, meaning that prison staff have to deal with
longer-term and disaffected prisoners who are being retained
longer.<a class="bkMark" name="11071270000210">&#160;</a>

is also an impact on the work of the probation service because judicial
discretion is very much based on the advice and assessments that we
provide. Again, where there is less discretion to be used, there is
less opportunity to explore fully the reasons why offending behaviour
has taken place and identify in those reasons ways in which you can
deal with it and address it in the hope of stopping it in
future.<a class="bkMark" name="11071270000211">&#160;</a>

We want to see the prison population fall, but we want to see it fall
so that communities are safer and reoffending decreases. I do not see
how that can be married up with the budget cuts over the next four or
five years in every area and walk of life. I just do not see how that

they came from in the first place, only to come back six weeks later. I
do not think that that helps the taxpayer or prisons, and we have seen

                  </em> Hi, my name is Sally Gimson. I am head of
public policy at Victim Support. I think that you know about Victim
Support, but I would like to tell you a little bit about us. We are an
independent charity for victims and witnesses of crime. We were set up
35 years ago. We cover England and Wales. We are volunteer
based with 6,500 volunteers and some 1,600 staff up and down the
country. We contact more than 1 million victims a year. We run the
witness service, which means that we have volunteers in every criminal
court in the country, from the Old Bailey to Newcastle. Since April
2010, we have had a specialist homicide service, so we support almost
all families bereaved through homicide. We are also the biggest
employer of independent domestic violence advocates in the country,
employing about 92 of them. At the moment, we are funded by the victims
commissioner for victims service
advocates.<a class="bkMark" name="11071270000229">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We
want to say three things. First, we welcome the introduction of the
powers to enable money to be deducted from prisoners’ wages to
go towards victim support services. We are very supportive of that.
Overall, 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 28<a class="bkMark" name="Column28">&#160;</a>
                  </div>however, we think that the Bill represents a missed opportunity to make
the criminal justice system work better for
victims.<a class="bkMark" name="11071270000230">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We
are particularly concerned about three things. One is that suspended
sentences do not necessarily have a community requirement attached,
which means that offenders in serious cases could simply walk free. We
know that victims want the offender to be punished. In this case, there
would effectively be no punishment. Even in some cases where that was
breached, the only sanction would be a
fine.<a class="bkMark" name="11071270000231">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Secondly,
we think that the Bill could have done more to make provision for the
victims compensation fund. We are happy that there is a duty for the
compensation fund, but we are worried that victims will not necessarily
get the money and that there is no means to enforce that better than at
the moment. The Government have not done that, and it is a missed
opportunity, because victims tell us that money comes through from
offenders in dribs and drabs. We would like there to be a compensation
fund, so that the money is funded up front and so that the fund would
get the money from the
offenders.<a class="bkMark" name="11071270000232">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We
are also concerned that the Bill does not include a duty to explain
sentences to victims. It includes a provision to explain them in
ordinary language only to offenders. We recently asked victims what one
thing they would change to make the criminal justice system better, and
48% said that they wanted more clarity in
sentencing.<a class="bkMark" name="11071270000233">&#160;</a>

                     <strong>Louise
Casey:</strong>
                  </em> Chairman, I am very grateful for the
opportunity to appear before the scrutiny Committee today. I want to
take a slightly different approach. The first thing that I would say as
the victims commissioner is that we completely understand and are very
supportive of the need for the criminal justice system to do a better
job in the rehabilitation of criminals and offenders. That is a right
and proper thing to happen. I feel that all too often I am under
pressure to be a victims commissioner who says, “Don’t
spend money on rehabilitating criminals. You should do this and not
that.” You get into a world where if you are pro-offender, that
means you are anti-victim, and if you are pro-victim, that means you
are anti-offender. That is not where this victims commissioner is. I
also feel very strongly that the evidence in terms of our Green Paper
response is that victims, too, do not want offenders to go on
committing further offences and creating more and more victims. I
therefore think it is right and proper that the Bill is before the
House and enjoying this
scrutiny.<a class="bkMark" name="11071270000234">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
issue is not just the financial cost of what criminals do to us in our
society, but the human, personal, emotional and social cost, which I
think I highlighted pretty squarely in the report that I delivered to
Ministers last week on the needs of families bereaved through murder
and manslaughter. I believe it is right that we are rehabilitating
criminals and spending time and energy on that. That said, I can say on
behalf of, I think, Victim Support and myself that it is a huge step
forward that this Committee has asked to hear victims’ voices as
part of what you are doing as the Bill proceeds. Given that we know
that more than two thirds of the public believe that the criminal
justice system respects the rights of perpetrators, offenders and
criminals more than the rights of victims, it is really important at
every single point when issues about crime, justice and offenders are
discussed that we look at what happens with victims—I have the
privilege of being the statutory voice of victims. 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 29<a class="bkMark" name="Column29">&#160;</a>
                  </div>That is why I have taken myself down the route of
suggesting that we need legislation for victims—a victims
law.<a class="bkMark" name="11071270000235">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
am therefore very pleased that we are here today. I am pleased that as
we look at elements of the measures—my friend and colleague has
mentioned a number of them—we will be looking at them through
the eyes of the victim, because the eyes of the victim are also where
the wider public are. There is a connection between the
two.<a class="bkMark" name="11071270000236">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We
were really pleased with the Government’s response to the Green
Paper consultation. There were a couple of elements—particularly
the not guilty early credit—that victims and I felt stretched
the integrity of the principle of the sentence too far. We were really
pleased—in fact, I felt relief—that that was not
proceeded with. That showed real willingness by the Government to look
at the issue through the eyes of victims, and we were very grateful for
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11071270000237">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">My
last point—I will keep it brief because I am sure that you want
to get on—is that, overall, it is important that all the
different elements, whether it is suspended sentences, compensation
orders, curfews or whatever, are looked at through the principles that
underlie the criminal justice system. What the public and therefore
victims want is that, when someone breaks a law, there is a punitive
consequence. That is why I support Victim Support’s position.
For example, it is the right thing to do, possibly, to give more
discretion to judges to suspend sentences for longer. That might be a
right and proper place to be; I think that it is probably correct.
However, the quid pro quo is that it cannot be the case that it is just
seen as two years to keep your nose clean and there is no consequence
to it—that is, it is like a bind-over; you are just told to get
on with your business for a couple of years and there is no
punishment.<a class="bkMark" name="11071270000238">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In
the same way, I am really pleased with the Government’s position
on criminals essentially paying back to victims and to society more
broadly. That is a very big political principle that I and victims
would sign up to. The quid pro quo is that, once it has been put in a
Bill and is a reality in the street and in the courts, victims have to
know that they will not be strung along—that they will not be
given a pound a week from a compensation order and then it will drop
off. It is not that the principle of it is wrong; it is just that
delivery of it is a really tall order. That is not necessarily about a
Bill that goes through Parliament; it is more about the huge pressure
that arises as you consider, perhaps rightly, whether to have a
downward trend in custodial
sentences.<a class="bkMark" name="11071270000239">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">What
you have to do, therefore, is make non-custodial sentences much more
punitive and much more up front and in the face of the public, so that
they can have greater confidence in them. No one in this House should
underestimate what a tall order that is. I suppose I may be jumping to
when it is happening, and saying “Compo orders don’t
always get paid back; how are they going to be?” I was very
involved with the changes to community payback and trying to get people
to don an orange jacket with the words “Community
payback” on the back. Under the last Administration, that was a
really tall order to drive through, so I think the delivery of some of
these things will be the test of whether the Bill stands or
fails.<a class="bkMark" name="11071270000240">&#160;</a>

have said it, has been for a number of years, ever since I did a review
of the public’s view of the criminal justice system, that the
probation service would need a significant shift in its culture. It is
not necessarily an issue of money and resources—although that
might be the case—but it is certainly an issue of culture. I
have felt that there is resistance to things like asking people to go
and put orange jackets on—the sense of moving people out of
charity shops, where they are invisible and they have a pretty easy
ride, on to cleaning the streets. That is what you want if you are
stopping short of locking someone up on a short-term prison sentence.
You need something of equivalent weight. We have struggled to get the
probation service to undergo a step change—I think that is the
modern word. I still feel that to this
day.<a class="bkMark" name="11071270000242">&#160;</a>

there are custodial sentences, what polling or other evidence do you
have from victims about what they think prisoners should be doing in
prison—whether work, rehab or education—and what type of

to fund Victim Support charities and create a savings gain, but what do
you think is an appropriate proportion of prisoner earnings to be
deducted to aid Victim

                  </em> The Department asked me to consult victims
during the Green Paper period, and we carried out a quite thorough
consultation. The wholesale support for the word “work”
and making prisons places of work was relentless. They are clear that
prisons should be places of work. I am of the view—and I would
be, as the victims commissioner—that a significant proportion of
the money should go towards victim services. I hope that that will be
one way to get more money into services for victims, which historically
have enjoyed a tiny amount of money from the criminal justice
bill—less than 1% to 2% of the entire spend in the criminal
justice system goes to victims.<a class="bkMark" name="11071270000245">&#160;</a>

hopeful that the victim surcharge and prisoners’ earnings will
be a significant part of getting better services for victims. That is
the quid pro quo. It is right that we should spend rehabilitation money
on offenders, as long as we also rehabilitate victims. As my report
last week showed, plenty of parents and grandparents must spend their
own resources on counselling, therapy and support for children who have
been bereaved through murder or manslaughter and other homicide. We
need a level playing field, and that is one way we can level it
up.<a class="bkMark" name="11071270000246">&#160;</a>

the Bill for victims or witnesses. It simply talks about the defendant
possibly needing protection and only about the victims or witnesses in

duty on the court to explain the effect of sentence. I do not know
whether you would agree with this proposition, but over the past few
years, because of the amount of changes, judges have had to undertake
some sort of steeplechase to try to explain sentences, which have
become more and more enshrined in jargon. Do you now welcome the
re-emphasis in the proposed new provisions to explain things in
ordinary language? Not only would that assist those in court, but it
could assist in translating that message to victims who, very often,
will not be there to hear
sentence.<a class="bkMark" name="11071270000254">&#160;</a>

that that should be explained in ordinary language, but the Bill does
not mention victims, so we would like to see them, as well as the
defendants, mentioned. Very often, as you say, victims are not in
court, and they might not understand—if they are told at all,
and they might not be. We talked to a victim who was a victim of
assault. She was told that the sentence would be nine months but the
person only served four, and she did not really understand why that had
happened and felt that all that experience she had gone through in
court had been something for nothing and that, in fact, she
had been 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 32<a class="bkMark" name="Column32">&#160;</a>
                  </div>revictimised and not got justice. Then there are victims who never go to
court and who only read about what happens in the local paper. We
really feel that there needs to be clarity on sentencing within court,
but the victims also needs to be told what happens and needs to
understand that, when a sentence is explained, that is exactly what
will
happen.<a class="bkMark" name="11071270000255">&#160;</a>

                  </em> This has been something that I have been
pushing for since 2008. I am really pleased that it is in the Bill. The
fact that judges will have to explain sentences is a step forward. I
entirely agree with Sally on this. Explaining a sentence to a
defendant—actually he is an offender by this stage because he
has been done for it—will entail his lawyer sitting next to him
taking it all down and then explaining it to him later. Our problem is
that there is nobody on our side who can then explain it to the victim.
It would be good if greater care could be given to the victim. However,
I do think that this is a very welcome move. In relation to very
serious cases, such as murder, manslaughter, rape and possibly child
sex offences and violence offences, it would make sense to me, and the
evidence shows that it makes sense to a lot of other people, that some
of that is delivered in writing. At the moment, high court judges and
very senior judges hand out their written sentencing remarks. I can
assure Members that that is a really positive move for victims because
many of them pore over those for years to
come.<a class="bkMark" name="11071270000256">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">May
I say a very quick word about bail? There is a real principle at stake
here. As the law currently stands, it is about “Will you go and
do it again while you are on bail? Are you going to interfere with
victims in the way that Sally talked about? Are you already a
non-appearer and have you got a real address that we can actually bail
you to?” They seem like the right sorts of principles that you
would apply to a bail case as opposed to changing the rules slightly
and saying, “This is going to be about what your sentence might
be were you to be found guilty.” I do not see a case for
changing the principles so significantly, though we are enormously
grateful, as Ministers and colleagues know, to have at least the
safeguard in there on domestic violence, but we would prefer it not to
proceed at
all.<a class="bkMark" name="11071270000257">&#160;</a>

                  </em> What I would say is that the sort of scenario
that possibly could work is that you suspend a sentence and do a
compensation order. If we are so serious about compensation and if that
compensation order is breached, are you then saying that your suspended
sentence days are over and you are looking at custody? That is the type
of thing that would work in terms of being punitive enough to reassure
victims and the wider public about compensation orders and suspended
sentences. I can see ways in which you could make this work. Saying to
judges that they can have two years could be absolutely right, but if
we do not put any punishment element into it and leave it to others to
decide what that punishment element looks like, it could appear as a
consequence-free couple of years, and yet it is further up the tariff
in punishment than fining someone. There is an oddness to it around the
principle of what you are using suspended sentences for when we know
that there are such serious
disposals.<a class="bkMark" name="11071270000267">&#160;</a>

the consultation as part of the Green Paper; there is a crossroads in
the world of probation. Are we saying to people in probation,
“You are there to concentrate on rehabilitation. It is your job
to think about how you rehabilitate”? When it comes to doing
seriously tough community punishment—for example, Westminster
bridge being covered with people in orange jackets, cleaning it
regularly—is it the right organisation to have such a
responsibility? There are ways, with contracting out reform of the
probation service, that it may be possible. I am simply saying that at
this point, my experience over a long period of time is that the
probation service has not reached that far. It would take a brave and
seriously determined reform of the probation service to get it there,
so is it time for us to think about whether it is the right
organisation to deal with the punishment aspect of community
orders?<a class="bkMark" name="11071270000269">&#160;</a>

sit in court, were to take down a note of the salient points of the
sentence and then communicate that directly to the victim. I think that
that would be straightforward and simple, but I was told they were too
busy. I am sorry, because it is a long-standing problem and that seems

                  </em> Mr Slaughter, as a general principle, with the
criminal injuries compensation scheme, victims regularly feed back. In
the review that we published last week, almost 50% of victims’
families—these are murder and manslaughter cases—said
that the complexity, administration and head-banging of the CICA as it
stands just adds insult to injury. It sticks in my gullet slightly that
we have to pay private lawyers to process some of these claims, because
the system is so complicated.<a class="bkMark" name="11071270000275">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I have again
put on record that, if nothing else, the time is right to look at the
CICA as an administrative burden on victims, frankly, which is the only
way I can describe it. Certainly, when I visit Victim Support
colleagues throughout the country, as they kindly allow me to do, a lot
of their work is about doing the bloody—I am sorry. I am not
allowed to swear at scrutiny Committees, and I am on tape. However, I
cannot tell you how frustrating, for victims and their families, the
bureaucracy is with the CICA, and the complications that exist with
something that should be so straightforward. We end up giving 25% to
these people who text you nowadays to ask, “Have you got a
claim?” It is not right, and it needs to be stopped.<a class="bkMark" name="11071270000276">&#160;</a>

right. We are delighted to have been invited to come and give evidence
to the Committee today. I assure you that we will continue to engage in
debates and discussions as the Bill proceeds through the various stages
finally to enactment. Many of the proposals in the Bill resonate with
our views. Those views reflect our response to the Green Paper,
especially on the issues about wider powers to deal with young
offenders—John has expertise in youth courts—and to deal
with those who breach court
orders.<a class="bkMark" name="11071270000285">&#160;</a>

are three specific areas on which we would like to have further debate
and discussion because they raise some concerns for us. As you would
expect, one matter is the restriction on remanding in custody
pre-trial. Secondly, there is the issue of the wider discretion for
out-of-court disposals, given that we have some concerns about their
use and the recent chief inspector’s report. A further matter is
the repeal of section 154 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, which would
have given magistrates the power to impose 12 months for a single
sentence. We know that it was argued that that was introduced in the
context of custody plus, but certainly our information is that it was
very much a separate entity as a clause within that particular Bill and
that it was not tied in with custody plus. We would like to see that
clause taken out. We support many of the principles about victims and
witnesses that we have heard already today. That is our brief

Thornhill:</strong>
                  </em> The issue is very much about allowing
judges and the magistrate to retain discretion where it is appropriate.
The issue of sentencing is about offence 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 36<a class="bkMark" name="Column36">&#160;</a>
                  </div>and offender. The issue of bail is about evaluating the risks that the
offender may not turn up or may commit further offences while on bail
or, importantly, that they may interfere with witnesses or victims. We
believe that we need to retain the right on occasions to impose a
remand in custody. We appreciate that very often many of those
offenders do not receive a custodial sentence in the long run, but we
also have concerns about effectively saying at the very beginning, when
we are only looking at the risks that the offender poses, whether they
will receive a custodial sentence or not. We do not wish in anyway to
give an expectation to the offender that because they have been granted
bail, they can therefore assume that they will not receive a custodial
sentence, if the risks posed by that offender would be risks where we
felt a remand in custody was appropriate.<a class="bkMark" name="11071270000288">&#160;</a>

As I said, we need to separate the sentence, which is down the line,
from the risks posed by the offender. We do not really look at the
sentence, but at whether the offender will turn up, interfere with
witnesses or commit further offences on bail, particularly if there is
a history in their record of so doing, even though the offence itself
may not receive a custodial sentence in the end. For us they are two
separate issues.<a class="bkMark" name="11071270000290">&#160;</a>

people who are out of control and may not be sentenced to custody in
the end. I see many youngsters who are out of control, in dangerous
situations and mixing with an older group that may be involved in drug
pushing or prostitution, and to take them away from dangerous
situations, it is essential for magistrates’ discretion not to
be tied, even though in the end those youngsters may not end up in

                  </strong> Can I ask you about the penalty notices and penalty
notices for disorder? Are they an effective way to deal with problem?
It seems to me that, first, people with money would be able to pay a
quick fine and not be held accountable for the crime or the offence
they have committed, and, secondly, on the opposite side, there will be
people on such low incomes that the level of payment would be set so
low that it would not deter them. Whichever way you look at it, it
seems that the Bill will make it even more difficult for people to see
justice being done.<a class="bkMark" name="11071270000293">&#160;</a>

                  </em> That is the real nub of the issue. You
will all know of course that we are required by the 1361 Act
to impose appropriate and proportionate fines taking account of the
means of the offender to pay. That does not happen with fixed penalty
notices or a penalty notice for disorder. That is not to say that we do

<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 37<a class="bkMark" name="Column37">&#160;</a>
                  </div>not accept that there is a place for the police to use those sorts of
sanctions. We appreciate the work the police have on a busy Friday or
Saturday evening, and they need something very quickly to diffuse the
situation, but we need to look at this. Justice is about public
justice, and fixed penalty notices, penalty notices for disorder,
cautions and conditional cautions are not in the public eye. We believe
that we need a system whereby if we are to use sanctions prior to a
judicial sanction, we have to have them in the public eye, so that
there can be confidence in the system. Very often it turns itself
upside
down.<a class="bkMark" name="11071270000294">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">From
the examples we have seen, we are also concerned that very often the
offenders accept the fixed penalty, penalty notice for disorder or
caution as the quick and sharp resolution to a situation, which may
well be appropriate—we do not want to spend more money than
necessary on serious offences—but the offender is sometimes
unaware of the consequences further down the line when they seek a CRB
check for employment and it suddenly comes up, though they may not have
been found guilty in a court.<a class="bkMark" name="11071270000295">&#160;</a>

                  </em> We have to look at the context. You have
talked about suspended sentences plus. If the principle is about
rehabilitation as well as punishment, I am often left asking the
question what does a suspended sentence do in terms of rehabilitation
without some sort of programme attached to it. If an individual has
committed an offence that merits a custodial sentence, and for a
variety of reasons the bench or the judiciary decide not to impose an
immediate custodial sentence but impose a suspended sentence, and if
that offender has serious underlying reasons for committing those
offences, we are doing nothing about it. It seems to us that we should
still have the right to impose attendant programmes on suspended
sentences.<a class="bkMark" name="11071270000306">&#160;</a>

need to look at the research that has taken place over the last five
years on the number of requirements imposed on suspended sentences, but

let’s do some rehabilitative work with the offender even though
they are on a suspended custodial
sentence.”<a class="bkMark" name="11071270000307">&#160;</a>

towards individualised sentencing. Of course, with every offence and
every offender, there cannot be an individual sentence specific to
their needs, but if we have a wider range of tools available we can
begin to do that more constructively than we can at the

slightly out of kilter with adult court sentences. I believe that one
of the main reasons why youth court custody rates have gone down is
because at the top end, there is an intensive alternative to custody,
which is an intensive supervision and surveillance programme, or ISSP.
Although that intensive alternative to custody has been piloted in a
number of areas in England and Wales, it has not actually been rolled
out in all areas. As John said, we need more weapons in our armoury to
keep adults, in particular, out of custody.<a class="bkMark" name="11071270000311">&#160;</a>

12-month sentence for any single offence. One issue that we are all
concerned about is finance. Many of the offences that go to the Crown
court could be dealt with in magistrates courts. There are a variety of
ways of dealing with that, one of which is to look at mode of trial
guidelines, while another would be to say that the nature of some
offences could be restricted. For instance, at the moment criminal
damage under £5,000 is a summary only matter to be dealt with by
magistrates, while damage of more than £5,000 is an either way
offence. We might look at doing that with something like
theft.<a class="bkMark" name="11071270000320">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">We are not at
all saying that we should do away with jury trial; that is a right held
by the citizens of this country. However, perhaps we need to look at
how we could deal with more trials in the magistrates courts. The cost
of a magistrates court trial is significantly less than the cost of a
Crown court trial. We know the figures: in 80% of all trials for theft
in the Crown court, the value involved is under £200. That means
that those offenders would be given a sentence that a magistrate could
impose. Keeping the 12-month limit would mean that we could deal with
more serious examples of some of the offences that we deal with now,
but we would still be within the powers.<a class="bkMark" name="11071270000321">&#160;</a>

are concerns that such a move might increase the custodial population,
but we have questions about the figures that have been given to us and
we would like to pursue those in detail. We would like to see the
measure remain in the Act for further debate and discussion. Yes, take
out the custody plus elements because we always said that we could not
afford custody plus, yet the concept of custody plus is something that
we ought to look at. Once the offender has served their prison
sentence, they may still need help and support in the community to turn
themselves around. Whatever else we do, unless the offender is ready to
rehabilitate themselves, we may well be working against them. We need
to look at that and provide support.<a class="bkMark" name="11071270000322">&#160;</a>

principle applies to suspended sentences. We can put someone on a
suspended sentence for two years, and if we do not do anything about
it, at the end of two years they may be ready to reoffend, but if we
work with them, they may turn themselves around. It is looking at what
rehabilitation is about and how we do that. If we have that 12 months,
we bring more trials from the Crown courts and deal with more matters
in a summary way. That would cut the costs
significantly.<a class="bkMark" name="11071270000323">&#160;</a>

Victims would not have to wait so long for Crown court trials and,

might be the reason, but when we questioned the figures, we noticed
that the figures then reduced. The figures included those who elect
trial at Crown court, so we have no control over that. They also
included what we know is the fact—when the matter goes to trial,
the charge is changed. Sometimes a charge is changed from an either way
charge to a summary only charge. If we had pursued it further in the
magistrates court, we might have got that charge put to us and
therefore dealt with it without wasting time and money at the Crown
court. It does bear further investigation and I do not think we should
repeal that provision until we have further investigated
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11071270000330">&#160;</a>

seems quite a fundamental change to the way that the criminal justice
system works. Effectively, a large body of defendants are going to come
in front of you and you will, except in exceptional cases, have no
ability, irrespective of whatever risks you think there are, to remand
them in custody. Are magistrates very concerned about this? Do they see
it as a limitation on their authority and

have to look at each case on its own merits and each offender on their
own merits. If we have a history of an offender who has failed to turn
up, and we feel the only way to make sure that offender turns up is to
put a restriction on them, be that a restriction by a remand in custody
or a restriction in a bail hostel, then again we are saving time and
money. If they keep failing to turn up, we keep adjourning with the
hope that they will turn up and there is more and more cost. From a
financial perspective, we need the opportunity, on occasion, to
restrict their movements, either to stop them reoffending or
interfering, or to make sure they turn
up.<a class="bkMark" name="11071270000334">&#160;</a>

addition in the Bill, away from breaking the cycle concerning domestic
violence. I draw to the Committee’s attention the fact that we
deal with many cases of violence against witnesses that are not in a
domestic situation. Under the Bill as currently worded, we would not
have the power to remand that person in custody. I had a case a couple
of weeks ago where the original offence was an assault by an individual
of another individual over money issues. We remanded the individual on
conditional bail not to contact or go near the person he had assaulted.
A week later he went round and assaulted the person again. Under the
new proposed legislation we would not be able to remand in custody, but
clearly, in my view, there is a need to protect that
witness.<a class="bkMark" name="11071270000335">&#160;</a>

Thornhill:</strong>
                  </em> The Coroners and Justice Act 2009 contains
a section that states that the judiciary must follow sentencing
guidelines. We have strong, stringent guidelines. We can go outside
those guidelines, if it is in the interest of justice. The guidelines
are public and everybody knows what they are for any particular
offence, so we are restricted by those guidelines as to how we
sentence. At the moment there are no restrictions, and there are very
few guidelines for the use of out of court disposals, as they are
called. There is a place for out of court disposals, but we would like
them to be within stringent guidelines and that certain offences should
not be dealt with out of court. We strongly believe that any offence of
violence should not be dealt with out of court.<a class="bkMark" name="11071270000337">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The work the
association did two years ago under the Freedom of Information
Act showed that there was wide discrepancy across
police authorities. At the top, in one police authority 66% of all
criminal matters were dealt with outside a court through fixed
penalties, penalty notices for disorder and cautions; and at the
bottom, one authority dealt with 33% of criminal matters out of court.
I am not saying that one or the other is right, but there is
significant inconsistency of delivery. We know that a particular chief
constable, the chief constable of Wiltshire, has gone on record in
front of magistrates as saying that as far as he is concerned, he wants
only 20% of all criminal matters ever to be brought to
court.<a class="bkMark" name="11071270000338">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">There
is inconsistency, and we have grave concerns. A chief inspectors report
said that a third of the out of court disposals that they looked at had
been imposed inappropriately. In our work, we discovered that 37,000
cautions had been imposed for what was listed as an offence occasioning
actual bodily harm. Look that up in our guidelines and you will see
that it is at least a high-level community penalty, if not a custodial
sentence. We are saying that there is inconsistency of delivery. We
need to look at that. There is a place for such sanctions and
disposals, and we need a national framework within which they can
operate.<a class="bkMark" name="11071270000339">&#160;</a>
