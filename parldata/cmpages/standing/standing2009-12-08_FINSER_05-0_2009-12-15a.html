is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship again, Mr.
Benton. It is good to see so many Labour Members of Parliament here
today. My recollection of Thursday&#146;s evidence session was that,
without the support of Opposition Members, the Committee would have
been inquorate, and that would not have aided scrutiny of this
important
Bill.</div><a name="09121556000016"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09121556000300"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mark Todd</b> (South Derbyshire) (Lab): I was
there.</div><a name="09121556000017"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09121556000301"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> The hon. Member for South Derbyshire was present
but, sadly, so many of his colleagues were not. However, it is good to
see a few more of them gathered here today to debate an important part
of the Bill. The order of deliberation has been changed to bring
certain clauses to the front, because they are perhaps less
controversial than the earlier clauses, but there are still some
important issues that arise in the first group of clauses that we will
debate.</div>
<a name="09121556000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps it
would be helpful if I said something about clause 14 to put the
amendment into context. The clause gives the Financial Services
Authority a new power to suspend permission to carry on regulated
activities for up to 12 months. Clause 16 imposes a penalty on
individuals performing a controlled function without authorisation and
clause 17 extends the period for taking action against individuals from
two years from the date on which misconduct took place to four years.
That is quite a beefing up of the disciplinary powers of the
FSA.</div><a name="09121556000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">Conservative
Members have no problem in principle with the FSA being given more
powers. In our white paper, &#147;Plan for Sound Banking&#148;,
which was published in July, we said that the powers of the FSA should
be reviewed to see whether they were adequate or needed 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column116" />Column number: 116</div>reinforcement. What we want to do through the amendments that we have
tabled today is to understand a little more of the Government&#146;s
thinking on why the FSA needs such powers. We want to know more about
the circumstances in which those powers could be used. Perhaps the
Minister can tell us when they could have been used, if they had been
in place under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. Perhaps he
could explain what the FSA has lacked in enforcement measures for
nearly a decade, and could say what changes there might have been if it
had had such
powers.</div><a name="09121556000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
want to understand the proportionality of the new powers given to the
Financial Services Authority, in the context of the misuse that it will
be seeking to prevent, and we want to understand whether the powers
will have the right effect. What will be the consequences for the
financial services market as a whole if the powers are given to the
FSA, and what will their impact be on individuals under clauses 16 and
17, or firms under clause
14?</div><a name="09121556000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
justifying the clause along with other measures, the Government said in
their White Paper, published in the summer, that</div>
<a name="09121556000248"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Government is taking steps to ensure that the FSA&#146;s objectives
and powers are designed in such a way that enables it to perform the
extended role envisaged in the supervisory enhancement programme and
the Turner Review
effectively.&#148;</div><a name="09121556000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
all recognise that there needs to be a much more proactive approach to
supervision. Whether we continue to pursue the status quo that the
Government seem happy to defend or whether, under our proposals, we
reform the regulatory architecture, we are all agreed that a more
proactive approach is required if we are to avoid some of the mistakes
that we have seen emerge over the past decade.</div>
<a name="09121556000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">The question
that has been asked by a number of those who have made submissions to
us is: &#147;Why are additional powers are being used? What is the
rationale behind them?&#148; The Association of British Insurers said
in a written submission that is was not clear why the FSA is considered
to be lacking in enforcement powers. For example, if an offence is
considered to be so serious as to merit suspension using the powers
under clause 14, in practice it is likely to be sufficiently
serious to justify removal of
authorisation.</div><a name="09121556000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
an evidence session last week, Angela Knight from the British Bankers
Association suggested that there were other tools available to the FSA
that would have a similar effect to the measures under clause 14 on the
suspension of powers. For example, she suggested that as well as the
variance of permission, which the ABI mentioned in its submission, the
FSA, using the capital rules&#151;pillar 2 rules, I
think&#151;under Basel could require an authorised firm to hold more
capital, if it felt that the business that it was conducting merited
that. That would be an alternative way of potentially delivering the
same type of outcome as the
suspension.</div><a name="09121556000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
need to understand from the Minister, when he responds to the
amendments, quite what it is that we are seeking to tackle through the
suspension. The powers in clause 14 are quite broad, as proposed new
section 206A gives the FSA various powers. Proposed new
subsection (3)
says:</div><a name="09121556000249"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
period for which a suspension or restriction is to have effect may not
exceed 12 months&#148;,</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column117" />Column number: 117</div><a name="09121556000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">and proposed new
subsection (4)
says:</div><a name="09121556000250"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
suspension may relate only to the carrying on of an activity in
specified
circumstances.&#148;</div><a name="09121556000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
does &#147;specified circumstances&#148; mean? Proposed new
subsection (5)
says:</div><a name="09121556000251"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
restriction may, in particular, be imposed so as to require the person
concerned to take, or refrain from taking, specified
action.&#148;</div><a name="09121556000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
powers are broadly couched. People might think about what happened over
the course of the financial crisis and suggest that perhaps those sorts
of powers could have been used to prevent banks lending high
loan-to-value ratio mortgages, in cases where lenders were offering
mortgages of, say, 125 per cent. of the value of a property. Perhaps
the FSA could have taken that action and said, &#147;Actually, we
will stop this,&#148; or &#147;We will prevent firms from doing
that; we will restrict them to being able to lend up to 100 per cent.
of the value of the mortgage&#148;&#151;or 90, 80 or 60 per cent.
It is not clear whether the powers are designed to tackle that sort of
issue or, perhaps, broader
issues.</div><a name="09121556000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
know that one of the causes of the crisis was the use of particular
financial instruments that sliced and diced mortgages, and created
collateralised debt obligations, CDO squared, CDO cubed and things like
that. Many people say that while that spread risk around the market, it
led to a point where banks lost sight of the sort of risks they had on
their balance sheet. Would the powers be used to stop such activity
from taking place? It would be
feasible.</div><a name="09121556000030"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09121556000302"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Charles Walker</b> (Broxbourne) (Con): When looking at the
conduct of companies&#151;banks or building societies&#151;offering
mortgages, surely one has to look at the overall risk profile of their
mortgage book. It may be perfectly legitimate to lend a few people 110
or 120 per cent. of the value of their home, but we would
not want to have a preponderance of high-risk mortgages on the books;
they need to be balanced. Perhaps the mistake that some of the banks
made was to move into risky lending and not to take into account the
overall risk on their mortgage book. Would the provisions deal with
that?</div><a name="09121556000031"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09121556000303"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> My hon. Friend raises an important point. I am not
sure that I know the answer, because we need to know from the Minister
what the outcome is of the power that we are discussing. That is the
challenge for the Minister in responding to debate on clause 14. He
needs to be very clear about what mischief the clause is trying to
prevent. The comments from Angela Knight in the evidence session will
perhaps bear out what my hon. Friend said. On the breadth of the clause
and what it might be able to do, she
said:</div><a name="09121556000252"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It
has the power to stop a firm doing one of its regulated activities,
which is a pretty broad power. I suppose you are right that it could
say to a bank, &#147;You can no longer lend money on
mortgages,&#148; or, &#147;You can no longer provide trading
facilities for individuals trading their
shares.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report, Financial
Services Public Bill Committee, </i>10 December 2009; c. 88,
Q27.]</div><a name="09121556000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause is pretty broad; it is a broadly framed power that potentially
gives the FSA quite significant powers to intervene in an authorised
person&#146;s business model. I look to the Minister for
clarification on how that power might be used.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column118" />Column number: 118</div><a name="09121556000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">There was some
debate in Committee on whether the power would be used for a major
retail bank, whether it would be used to deal with the activities of a
major national insurer, or whether it would really, in practice, be
used simply to deal with problems with the high street independent
financial adviser or insurance broker. A lot of comment about that
power emerged in last week&#146;s evidence session, such is its
potential scale and impact.</div>
<a name="09121556000034"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09121556000304"></a><b class="B">Rob
Marris</b> (Wolverhampton, South-West) (Lab): The hon.
Gentleman gave the example of offering 110 per cent. mortgages, which
is a pretty stupid way to act, but lots of institutions did it. Is he
saying that the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 does not allow
that, and that companies have been breaching it for years? If it is
allowed under the 2000 Act, then clause 14 would not change
that.</div>
<a name="09121556000035"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09121556000305"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> That is part of the challenge that we need to
understand. Mortgages are a difficult topic to deal with, because the
FSA is currently consulting on changes to the regulatory regime on
mortgages that would enable it to regulate products, rather than
conduct under the business rules to do with those products. The hon.
Gentleman raised the point about what is meant by the requirements of
the 2000 Act, by which I think he referred to proposed new subsection
2(a) and (b) on page 19. What do we mean by the &#147;relevant
requirement&#148;? It</div>
<a name="09121556000253"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;means a
requirement
imposed&#151;</div><a name="09121556000254"></a><div class="hs_brev">(a)
by or under this Act; or</div>
<a name="09121556000255"></a><div class="hs_brev">(b) by any
directly applicable Community regulation made under the markets in
financial instruments
directive.&#148;</div><a name="09121556000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
amendment seeks to tease out a little bit the circumstances in which
those powers could be used.</div>
<a name="09121556000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">To digress a
little, it would be helpful if the Minister could explain why, of all
the many directives that the EU has produced relating to financial
services, the only one referred to explicitly in the provision is the
markets in financial instruments directive. It would be helpful to
understand why that is being singled out for special treatment, when
the EU issues directives on a whole host of consumer and wholesale
activities.</div>
<a name="09121556000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">My amendment
tries to probe the scope of the use of the power. The Bill, if it is
not amended, will give the FSA a new statutory objective of financial
stability and that will be inserted into the Act. It would create a new
section 3A, which will, for the first time, give the FSA an explicit
duty to contribute to the</div>
<a name="09121556000256"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;protection and
enhancement of the stability of the UK financial
system.&#148;</div>
<a name="09121556000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">We will have a longer
debate about that when we return after the Christmas recess, but I want
to tease out from the Minister whether he expects &#147;relevant
requirement&#148; to cover financial stability implicitly, or whether
we need to broaden the provision to include it
explicitly.</div>
<a name="09121556000271"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.45
am</div><a name="09121556000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am pleased to see that the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West is
on the Committee. We missed him on the Finance Bill because he is very
good at picking up both the Government and the Opposition on some of
the finer points of technicality. He raised a very good point about
whether a 110 per cent. mortgage 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column119" />Column number: 119</div>was banned from sale under the existing powers in FSMA. Let us suppose
that it was entirely permissible to sell that sort of mortgage under
that Act. That might not change under the Bill; if it still complies
with the relevant requirements a bank could continue to sell those
products.</div>
<a name="09121556000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">My amendment
seeks to tease out what would happen when a product could be sold and
was consistent with the Bill, but was seen to be contributing in some
way to financial instability. Perhaps it was encouraging banks and
individuals to take on more risk, perhaps it was undermining confidence
in the financial services sector or perhaps it was going so far that
people felt it was not</div>
<a name="09121556000257"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;contributing to
the protection and enhancement of the stability of the UK financial
system.&#148;</div>
<a name="09121556000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">Would the powers under
the proposed new section 206A be sufficient to tackle those
issues and prevent a bank from selling what might be perceived to be a
very risky mortgage, which if sold on a systemic basis would imperil
financial stability? Or is an amendment along the lines of amendment 2
needed to ensure explicitly that when an activity is taking place that
has an adverse impact on financial stability, that institution or that
authorised person is required to suspend the sale of the particular
product or give that type of
advice?</div><a name="09121556000042"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09121556000306"></a>Mr.
Walker:</b> I might be in danger of repeating myself, but the
role of the FSA is to reduce the overall risk to the taxpayer and the
taxpayer now seems to be insuring the financial sector. Surely there
will be some banks with an overall conservative lending profile but
there will be others with a far riskier lending profile. It will be
those banks that the FSA may want to approach and say,
&#147;You&#146;ve got to reduce your overall risk to the taxpayer
and you are going to start doing that by withdrawing certain riskier
products that you have on the market, to reduce the overall level of
risk within your mortgage
book.&#148;</div><a name="09121556000043"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09121556000307"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Indeed, and that touches again on the issue of the
relevant requirement under the Act. The FSA could produce, and is
clearly working towards this in terms of mortgages, a regime that
applies to all firms selling mortgages or advising on them, so it is a
sector-wide policy. But the FSA might decide, as my hon. Friend says,
that a bank or institution&#151;it could be a building
society&#151;within that sector is selling mortgages in a way that it
feels endangers financial stability. The proposed new section 206A may
be sufficient to give the FSA the powers to stop that institution
selling those mortgages in that way because of the risk to financial
stability, but I am not clear whether the clause, as currently worded,
achieves that so I have tabled amendment 2 to broaden it
out.</div><a name="09121556000044"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09121556000308"></a>Rob
Marris:</b> May I gently suggest to the hon. Gentleman that he
is mixing apples and oranges? As I read clause 14, proposed
new section 206A sets out the sentence&#151;to use a criminal
analogy. Amendment 2 creates a new offence, so the two are in a sense
contradictory. He is inserting a new offence&#151;as he is entitled
to do&#151;in a provision that, if implemented, would be purely about
sentencing, not about the offence per se.</div>
<a name="09121556000045"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09121556000309"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> The hon. Gentleman once again demonstrates his
legal expertise as a solicitor and points 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column120" />Column number: 120</div>out a flaw in my reasoning. However, part of the process of tabling
amendments is to probe the Government&#146;s thinking. I could have

of&#151;</div><a name="09121556000046"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09121556000310"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09121556000311"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Well, a stand part debate is entirely within the
gift of the Chairman, of course, and I do not seek to pre-judge his
thoughts on that. But this is an opportunity to raise the issue of what
the offence that we are trying to tease out of the Bill is. The hon.
Member for Wolverhampton, South-West talked about its being a
punishment, and I understand there was some discussion during the
passage of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 about whether
such a power should be included. The punishment was thought to be quite
draconian at the time, given the safeguards that were built into the
Bill when it initially passed through the House. There were later
safeguards&#151;for example, the introduction of the financial
markets tribunal, which some would say was a sufficient safeguard to
enable such a power or punishment to be introduced in this Bill. I am
sure the Minister will address that point in his remarks
later.</div><a name="09121556000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
2 is simply intended to trigger a debate about the circumstances in
which the sanction could be used. What would &#147;relevant
requirement&#148; mean under the Act? Does it include recognition of
the new objective of contributing towards financial stability that
would be imposed on the FSA? That teases out some of the tension that
we have already explored through interventions between what might be a
general FSA regulatory policy that applies to all firms, and the
specific circumstances in which the FSA might apply a particular
sanction to individual firms in individual circumstances.
Amendment 2, which is relatively short, tries to establish
that.</div>
<a name="09121556000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to
tease out other issues in the clause, but I will leave them until we
discuss later amendments and, if I am unable to tease them all out,
perhaps a stand part
debate.</div><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09121556000312"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Colin Breed</b> (South-East Cornwall) (LD): It is a pleasure
to serve under your chairmanship this morning, Mr.
Benton.</div><a name="09121556000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
2 is a useful probing amendment, which can clarify important aspects,
as the hon. Member for Fareham has said. The FSA clearly had powers
that it may not have realised it had. Sometimes, it may not have
realised the extent of its powers, and it certainly did not use all the
powers that it had at the time. The Financial Services and Markets Act
2000 probably needed clarification and the proposal is part of
that.</div><a name="09121556000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
measure certainly provides increased, wider-ranging powers and
potentially greater penalties and disciplinary powers, which may well
be necessary in the circumstances in which we find ourselves today. We
have to ensure there is a distinction between those who decide on a
particular business model, which might include the famous 125 per cent.
mortgages, and those who operate under it, such as mortgage brokers who
are quite properly selling such a mortgage, or advising people that
they may obtain one. If they are reasonably able to do that, I do not
think that they are part of the problem. There ought to be a clear
distinction between those who decide upon certain products and
services&#151;the models&#151;
<div class="Column"><a name="Column121" />Column number: 121</div>and those who operate within that market. There are some checks and
balances anyway, through the warnings and the tribunal, for
example.</div><a name="09121556000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
&#147;relevant requirement&#148;, which the hon. Member for Fareham
referred to in the last part of his contribution, is perhaps more
interesting, and perhaps needs more teasing out. It is an interesting
concept, and is probably as broad a concept as can be had. I understand
that a &#147;relevant requirement&#148; may not necessarily be
wholly and solely in the interests of either the lending
party&#151;the provider of the service&#151;or the consumer. It is
what the Government may consider a relevant requirement for financial
stability, or indeed anything else&#151;a relevant requirement could
be anything. A Government could decide what the relevant requirement
was and ensure that the FSA implemented it, which might seriously
intervene in the normal business relationship between a bank and a
customer, or a financial institution and its client. The implementation
of a relevant requirement and the FSA&#146;s subsequent embracing of
it could suddenly and massively intervene in such long-standing
relationships. It may not be in the interests of the bank, the
financial institution or the consumer, but they would have to comply
with
it.</div><a name="09121556000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
relevant requirement is mentioned on page 19, line 4, just before where
the proposed amendment would be inserted. It would help if the Minister
could explain the thinking behind the words &#147;relevant
requirement&#148;, and what the extent of that requirement is. It
could include almost anything, and the clarification provided by the
amendment would limit the requirement, or perhaps direct it towards the
financial stability
aspect.</div><a name="09121556000054"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09121556000313"></a>The
Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Ian Pearson):</b> It is a
pleasure to serve under your chairmanship again, Mr.
Benton.</div><a name="09121556000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Fareham began his remarks by noting that the measure
was a beefing-up of the FSA&#146;s disciplinary powers, and I agree.
He set out some of the broader context of what the Government are
trying to achieve, and I would like to explain in more detail what
clause 14 does, as I think that would help the discussion about the
amendment. It may influence your decision, Mr. Benton, as to
whether the issues have been fully explored or whether we need a stand
part debate when we have debated all the
amendments.</div><a name="09121556000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
14 amends section 206 in part 14 of the Financial Services and Markets
Act 2000&#151;FSMA. As the Committee knows, over the past couple of
years the FSA has enhanced its supervisory approach and has sought to
increase the deterrent effect of its enforcement action to deter
misconduct. The FSA has reiterated publicly on many occasions its
renewed focus on demonstrating that people and firms guilty of
misconduct will be held to account. The purpose of the clause, and the
following three clauses, is to strengthen the FSA&#146;s enforcement
powers to assist its credible deterrence strategy. The goal, which I am
sure we all support, is to increase compliance and to help to foster a
sounder financial
system.</div><a name="09121556000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
FSA&#146;s disciplinary powers in relation to authorised persons who
are guilty of misconduct are currently limited to imposing either a
financial penalty or public censure. The FSA can suspend a firm only if
it is necessary for the protection of consumers, if the firm 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column122" />Column number: 122</div>does not meet the threshold conditions, or if the firm has not carried
on for 12 months a regulated activity for which it has permission. The
FSA cannot, however, suspend a firm as a disciplinary sanction. The
clause enables the FSA to suspend or restrict a firm&#146;s
permission for up to 12 months, as a punishment for misconduct, and the
power will supplement rather than replace the FSA&#146;s power to
impose a fine or public censure.</div>
<a name="09121556000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">We believe
that in certain circumstances suspension will be a more appropriate
punishment than a fine, and many firms will consider the threat of
suspension as potentially more disruptive than a fine. The threat will
therefore encourage compliance.</div>
<a name="09121556000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">Suspension is
also a different type of deterrent, as it has a more direct effect on
the offending firm by restricting its ability to do business. It is
more visible and creates a direct link between the misconduct and the
disciplinary
measure.</div><a name="09121556000272"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11
am</div><a name="09121556000060"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09121556000314"></a>Mr.
Walker:</b> A business may be indulging in high-risk business
practice but not actual misconduct. Are there any powers in the clauses
to ensure that a business with a high-risk profile is told,
&#147;Your risk profile is too high. It poses a huge risk to the
taxpayer, who is ultimately underwriting the business, and you have to
change your business practices&#148;? That is not technically the
same as committing misconduct.</div>
<a name="09121556000061"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09121556000315"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> The best reply to the hon. Gentleman is to say
that clauses 14 to 17 are about disciplinary powers. If we keep that in
mind for the next couple of hours, it will be helpful. They are not
about preventive measures or taking remedial action. Some of the debate
over the past 30 minutes has been focused on preventive or remedial
measures, rather than the disciplinary powers themselves.</div>
<a name="09121556000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">Suspending
firms for misconduct is not a new concept; it is used in other
jurisdictions. The new powers give the FSA a range of penalties to use
as appropriate according to circumstances. They range from imposing
limitations or other restrictions on a permission to full-scale
suspension, which could mean limiting trades by a certain desk or sales
of a particular product. I will give examples in a moment in response
to the hon. Member for
Fareham.</div><a name="09121556000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
stress that the clause does not create a new offence; it simply
diversifies the range of actions the FSA can take against those who
break the rules. This measure, along with others we will discuss
shortly, is intended to give a clear signal to regulated entities that
the FSA will not tolerate misconduct and that it has a wide range of
disciplinary tools to use against those who breach
requirements.</div><a name="09121556000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
FSA will be required to consult on, and issue, a statement of policy
with respect to its use of the new power, in the same way as it
currently does in relation to the imposition of financial penalties.
The clause will enable the FSA to take more suitable and, where
appropriate, tougher actions against those who breach the
rules.</div>
<a name="09121556000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clauses
are designed to improve the FSA&#146;s disciplinary powers to punish
firms and individuals for misconduct, not to address preventive or
remedial enforcement; for those, the FSA already has the powers it
needs and can already act in a number of the areas that have been 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column123" />Column number: 123</div>discussed. It would not be reasonable to speculate on how the powers
could have been used in the past, although the hon. Member for Fareham
tempts me to do so, but I will give examples of how they could be
applied in the
future.</div><a name="09121556000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
new power to suspend will apply to all regulated activity where the FSA
identifies misconduct. That could cover a wide range of activities,
from trading in credit default swaps to the selling of payment
protection insurance, trading in shares or the selling of endowment
policies, car or house insurance, mortgages or pension policies. It is
right that the FSA has access to a broad range of different enforcement
powers and can decide in each case which is the most appropriate
sanction to use. The power is available for use against all firms
regulated by the FSA, which covers large firms, as the hon. Member for
Fareham mentioned, but also, potentially, small financial advisers. The
emphasis is on disciplinary powers and ensuring that the FSA has a wide
range of tools available, which it will need to use appropriately
according to circumstance.</div>
<a name="09121556000067"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09121556000316"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I am grateful for the Minister&#146;s
explanation. He is in effect arguing that the FSA needs a more granular
range of sanctions to apply to firms found guilty of misconduct. What
evidence has the FSA presented to him of occasions when it had to go
for either a more lenient or a more aggressive sanction, such as
suspending permission to undertake a certain type of
activity?</div>
<a name="09121556000068"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09121556000317"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> It will be up to the FSA to make a decision on
the basis of the misconduct that it has identified and its judgment as
to how serious an offence has been committed. As a public authority, it
will be required under law to act reasonably and
appropriately.</div><a name="09121556000069"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09121556000318"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> My point was not about how the FSA might use its
power in the future and what sort of consultation it might go through,
but what sort of pitch it made to the Minister for these powers to be
included in the Bill? What gaps or failings did it identify in its own
previous enforcement actions that led it to argue it needed these
powers, as an alternative either to a more lenient sanction or a more
punitive one, such as completely preventing a firm from trading in a
particular activity, and not just a temporary
suspension?</div><a name="09121556000070"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09121556000319"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> As I outlined to the Committee a few moments ago,
at present the FSA cannot suspend a firm as a disciplinary sanction.
The FSA believes&#151;we support it&#151;that the ability to
suspend a firm as a disciplinary sanction is a useful way for the FSA
to add to its powers. Many firms will see the threat of
suspension&#151;rather than a fine&#151;as a credible deterrent
from taking inappropriate action. That is why it is sensible and
reasonable to add to the powers.</div>
<a name="09121556000071"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09121556000320"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> The Minister will accept that it is quite 
a tough power and he argues cogently that it will  have a
deterrent effect on firms, but he still has not answered my question
about whether the FSA identified circumstances in which it would have
liked to have such powers&#151;concrete examples of when it had
identified 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column124" />Column number: 124</div>misconduct and felt constrained in the sort of sanction it was able to
give. Or is the power just something the FSA could stick into the Bill
and that would be nice for it to
have?</div><a name="09121556000072"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09121556000321"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> The power is a significant addition to the Bill.
I do not want to go back into past cases when it may or may not have
been more appropriate to suspend a firm rather than fine it. As the
hon. Gentleman will be aware, the FSA has suspended and will suspend
firms. A list of firms that have had their permission suspended is
available on the FSA&#146;s website so it is not as though the FSA
does not take action to suspend firms, as the hon. Gentleman knows. At
the moment there is a gap in the FSA&#146;s powers with regard to
disciplinary action. He is rightly probing the difference between areas
where the FSA will want to take action under its existing disciplinary
powers and where it will want to take action, as it can, under the
OIVOP&#151;own initiative variation of permission&#151;power. I
will say a little more about that in a moment.</div>
<a name="09121556000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
before doing so, let me respond to the point made by the hon. Member
for South-East Cornwall about relevant requirements. Relevant
requirements include those imposed directly on firms by the Financial
Services and Markets Act and those imposed on firms by the FSA in its
rules&#151;for example, to treat customers fairly. FSA rules are
subject to a number of safeguards in FSMA, including public
consultation, as the hon. Gentleman is aware. Relevant requirements are
defined in the same way in the existing disciplinary powers in proposed
new section 206A, as well as other provisions in
FSMA.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09121556000322"></a>Mr.
Breed:</b> If a new relevant requirement suddenly arises that
the Government feel the FSA should enforce, will it be applied
retrospectively?</div><a name="09121556000075"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09121556000323"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> The simple answer is
no.</div><a name="09121556000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Broxbourne asked whether the powers could be used to
prevent firms from offering high loan-to-value mortgages. As I
explained, these are disciplinary powers rather than preventive
measures and he will be aware that the FSA is currently consulting on
its mortgage policy. The consultation period does not end until 30
January, so it would not be appropriate to say any more about
that.</div><a name="09121556000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
2 seeks to enable the FSA to suspend a firm&#146;s permission to
undertake an activity if that activity could undermine financial
stability. I support the sentiment behind the amendment, but it is not
necessary. The FSA has the power, under section 45 of the Financial
Services and Markets Act 2000, to vary or cancel a firm&#146;s
permission. As I explained earlier, that power is known as the
FSA&#146;s OIVOP power, which can be applied to any permission
granted under part 4 of the 2000 Act. Clause 7 enables the FSA to use
the OIVOP power to meet any of its regulatory objectives, including its
new objective for financial stability in clause 5, which we are due to
debate in the new
year.</div><a name="09121556000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the Committee accepts the clauses, the FSA will be able to suspend or
restrict a firm&#146;s permission if it is believed that the
firm&#146;s activities were undermining financial stability. I
support the sentiment behind the amendment&#151;it has usefully
probed the Government&#146;s thinking for those who follow these
matters from the outside&#151;but it is not necessary, because
clauses 5 and 7 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column125" />Column number: 125</div>widen the FSA&#146;s ability to act in the interest of financial
stability and to use the powers in clause 14. I invite members of the
Committee to resist the amendment if the hon. Member for Fareham
decides to push it to  a
vote.</div><a name="09121556000079"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09121556000324"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> We have had a helpful debate that has opened up
clause 14, so that we can understand why the power is included in the
Bill. There is a clear intellectual argument for the power, but I am
yet to be persuaded that there is a practical argument for it. I
pressed the Minister on three occasions for the evidential base for the
need for the power, but he did not provide it. I do not recall the
Treasury&#146;s financial services White Paper in the summer
providing an evidential base for the power either. Moreover, the Turner
report was prayed in aid in the White Paper as a rationale for the
power, but I could not see a reference to the need for such additional
powers in the report. I may well have missed it, but it was not one of
the recommendations at the end of the Turner report. It is therefore
difficult to understand the power&#146;s genesis. I know from talking
to someone outside this place who was involved in the passage of FSMA
that the power was discussed at the time, but it was not included
because there were insufficient safeguards in
place.</div><a name="09121556000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
wonder whether the Minister is undermining his own argument about the
need for the sanction by referring to section 45 of FSMA. He said that
once the powers come into existence and financial stability becomes a
statutory objective of the FSA, they could be used to prevent a firm
from selling high loan-to-value mortgages. That would be a proactive
attempt to prevent a problem rather than imposing a sanction when a
problem had already arisen and a firm had breached FSA rules. I am
still unclear as to whether clause 14 provides any additionality to the
sanctions. The Minister seems to suggest, in the context of other
circumstances, that the FSA could use its powers under section 45 of
FSMA to stop a firm selling particular products or engaging in
particular activities. <i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> The
Minister says that it is not a disciplinary matter, but we seem to have
a power that achieves the same ends, or is it elsewhere in the
Bill?</div>
<a name="09121556000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">We discussed
in the Banking Bill Committee last year the threshold conditions that
act as a trigger for the special resolution regime. It appears that the
powers may well exist, and the FSA, with a bit of nimble thinking,
could perhaps use the powers under section 45 to beef up its
disciplinary powers, rather than insisting on the inclusion of clause
14 in the
Bill.</div><a name="09121556000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
as I said, my main focus in tabling amendment 2 was to tease
out issues about financial stability, which we will come to in the new
year. The Minister did not explain why the markets in financial
instruments directive was singled out for such special treatment in the
Bill, when so many other EU directives could have been
listed&#151;although he may want to return to that matter in a later
debate.</div>
<a name="09121556000273"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.15
am</div><a name="09121556000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
think that we have had a helpful debate, and we now understand better
how the clause fits in with the FSA&#146;s disciplinary armoury.
However, I do not think we are much further forward in knowing why that
power is needed, and the evidential base for its requirement. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column126" />Column number: 126</div>However, further illumination may emerge at a later point, so I beg to
ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09121556000084"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,
by leave, withdrawn.</i></div>
<a name="09121556000085"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09121556000325"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I beg to move amendment 4, in
clause 14, page 19, line 20, leave
out &#145;12&#146; and insert
&#145;6&#146;.</div><a name="09121556000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment is straightforward; it is again of a probing nature. Proposed
new section 206A
states:</div><a name="09121556000258"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
period for which a suspension or restriction is to have effect may not
exceed 12
months.&#148;</div><a name="09121556000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore,
for a period of up to 12 months, a business may be prevented from
carrying out all or part of its trade as a disciplinary sanction.
Clearly, that can have a big impact on a business. The measure is meant
to be a deterrent, but like all deterrents, it increases its value if
used in practice. Removing the right of a business to carry out its
activities for 12 months could have a significant impact on its
financial situation; it could in effect lead to that business being
closed down, which is equivalent to simply withdrawing its permission
to undertake its functions under the 2000
Act.</div><a name="09121556000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
would be helpful to have some understanding or iteration by the
Minister as to why 12 months is the right period. The amendment
suggests reducing the period from 12 to six months, but I could have
instead suggested reducing the period to four months&#151;the
amendment is probing by nature. Given the potential impact of the
sanction on a regulated firm, it is important to understand the
thinking behind the 12-month period, and whether the Minister has
thought through the potential impact on the viability of a firm if it
loses its right to conduct its business for 12
months.</div><a name="09121556000089"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09121556000326"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> As the hon. Gentleman indicates, the amendment
proposes that the maximum period for which a firm&#146;s permission
could be suspended should be six months, rather than the 12 months set
out in the
clause.</div><a name="09121556000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government consider it necessary for the FSA  to have the
ability to impose a suspension of up to 12 months to deter
misconduct. Suspension for only up to six months will not represent
enough of a disincentive. In all such matters, it is a question of
achieving what we think is a right and appropriate balance, and our
judgment is that a 12-month suspension will be a significant
deterrent.</div><a name="09121556000246"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent">If
hon. Members are concerned that a 12-month suspension may be excessive,
I want to reassure them that the checks and balances that are built
into the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 would apply here. If
the FSA wants to suspend a firm&#146;s permission, it must go through
the process of first issuing a warning notice and then a decision
notice. Under normal circumstances, the FSA would probably have
discussions before a warning notice is issued to a company. During this
process the authorised person may make representations to the FSA.
Furthermore, a person has a right to refer the matter to a tribunal. So
there are a number of protections built in for the benefit of
authorised persons. Again, as I mentioned earlier, the FSA has a duty
to act reasonably and proportionately at all
times.</div>
<a name="09121556000091"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09121556000327"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for outlining the
safeguards that will enable an authorised person effectively to appeal
against the FSA&#146;s proposed penalty. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column127" />Column number: 127</div>But during that period of appeal, will the authorised person be able to
continue trading? The FSA has recognised that he is not doing his job
properly and that products may be being mis-sold, but it would appear
during this warning period that he could continue in the same way,
breaching the same rules without hindrance. He could fight his way
through the process and at the same repeat the same breaches. Is that
what will happen during this appeal
process?</div><a name="09121556000092"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09121556000328"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I want to draw a distinction between the powers
that the FSA already has to prevent activity or take remedial action
and the disciplinary powers that are being added by clause 14 and
subsequent clauses. There is a matter of judgment here about the period
that we have sought to impose. We think that 12 months
is&#151;</div>
<a name="09121556000093"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09121556000329"></a>Mr.

<a name="09121556000094"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09121556000330"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I will try to answer the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
point in a moment. We both know that I am not answering it now, but I
am answering a separate point. I will get back to him. I am trying to
explain that there is a process in place that the FSA will have to go
through that is specified within its rules. We will debate issues
relating to disclosure later.</div>
<a name="09121556000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendments seeks to move forward the process
from the final notice to the decision notice. During the process, if
the FSA wishes to suspend a firm&#146;s permission it must talk to
the authorised person who can make representations to it and issue a
warning and a decision notice.</div>
<a name="09121556000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is the
right to refer matters to a tribunal. We have to be careful here that
we do not get into a situation where people are presumed guilty before
final decisions have been taken. We want to give the FSA tools to deter
misconduct. It needs to be able to impose credible sanctions. Accepting
the amendment would imply that there can never be a single instance
warranting a 12-month suspension and that in all circumstances a
six-month suspension will be enough to deter firms from misconduct. I
do not believe that that is the case. The 12-month period is more
appropriate and would indeed be a significant sanction and therefore a
credible deterrent. That is essentially what we are talking about
here.</div>
<a name="09121556000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s specific point, I cannot remember exactly what the
situation is. I shall have to refer to my notes, but I shall come back
to him on
it.</div><a name="09121556000098"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09121556000331"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I am sure that we shall return to the higher point
in the next group of amendments&#151;amendment 5 is more tailored to
that set of
circumstances.</div><a name="09121556000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
was interested in the Minister&#146;s argument about 12 versus six
months and that there might be circumstances in which a 12-month
suspension was preferred to six months, while six months would put a
cap or ceiling on a previous suspension. Clearly, the same argument
applies if the Government had tabled 24 months and I had tabled 12
months&#151;a judgment is attached to how long the suspension should
last, and that judgment has to be made. What the Minister is getting to
is that the 12-month 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column128" />Column number: 128</div>suspension is much more of a deterrent than a six-month suspension:
people might trade their way through six months, or be able to shut up
shop, and still feel that there was light at the end of the tunnel and
they could revive their business after six months. Twelve months is
much more of a deterrent&#151;there is an impact from being out of
the market for 12 months and, particularly given how potentially broad
the measure is, it is tantamount to withdrawing permission anyway. When
the FSA produces guidelines on the use of the power, it needs to
consult about the breadth of circumstances in which the power can be
used and the potential impact on the ability of a business to trade, if
all it wants is a punishment that stops short of simply withdrawing
permission. So, with that comment on what the FSA should think about
before its consultation, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09121556000100"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09121556000334"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> This group of two amendments and a new clause deals
with a linked issue, but there is a tweak around the last point made by
the Minister. The linked issue is how consumers know that a firm has
been penalised. How do they know that the sanction&#151;the power for
a temporary suspension under clause 14, or proposed new section
206A&#151;has been applied to a particular
firm?</div><a name="09121556000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
3 requires a notice or statement to be published saying that the
authority has used its powers under the section, with the name of the
authorised person and the detail of the permission suspended and the
period of suspension, so that people will know, for example, that
independent financial adviser X is not 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column129" />Column number: 129</div>able to sell pensions for the next 12 months. That will help consumers
know what they are dealing with that firm about, and ensure that some
publicity is attached to the
firm.</div><a name="09121556000247"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent">Amendment
5 covers the same issue, but a slightly broader issue as well, going
back to the intervention that I made on the Minister to which he said
that he would give me an answer a bit later. If an authorised person
has been warned that they may be suspended, has been given the
appropriate notices and decides to appeal to the tribunal, what happens
during the appeal process? That is an important issue. One of my hon.
Friends has raised with me the way in which a particular mortgage
provider dealt with repossessions and arrears. They were subject to
disciplinary action by the FSA. It was a private process and was not
known widely. When the institution repossessed other houses, the courts
were not in a position to know about its practices. In fact, there was
concern about the practice of that particular
institution.</div><a name="09121556000274"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.30
am</div><a name="09121556000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">Turning
to amendment 5, I am concerned that an authorised person could appeal
to the financial markets tribunal and, during the appeal process, break
the same rules that they had already broken, and continue to do so
until the appeals process had been exhausted. Let us look at a criminal
case: if someone was arrested for murder, that they might appeal
against their sentence or against being found guilty of a particular
offence, but they would be locked up in the meantime, so they would not
be able recommit the same offence. I am not sure how the Bill would
prevent someone who has been found to have breached an FSA rule from
recommitting the same
offence.</div><a name="09121556000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
might be that the authorised person appeals the punishment and accepts
the offence. That would be fine, because then the offence would have
stopped. If the person continued to argue about whether they were in
breach of the rules, and that was that point on which they wanted to
appeal to the tribunal, what stops them from doing
that?</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09121556000335"></a>Mr.
Walker:</b> The customer would be rightly annoyed. The appeal
process would go on; if the chap was found to have done nothing wrong,
that would be all right, but if a customer was one of a dozen or 100 or
so people who, during the six-month appeal process, had bought a dodgy
mortgage or financial instrument from a person, and was not aware of
the fact that he was under review, that customer would feel furious and
want to know why his rights were treated in such a cavalier
fashion.</div><a name="09121556000109"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09121556000336"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Indeed. That is why amendment 5 includes new
subsection (10), under which the authority must publish a statement
that says that it has taken action, or that action is in
process.</div><a name="09121556000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister said earlier that we were talking about pre-emptive action,
and that section 45 of FSMA could be used to the same effect and could
stop someone from undertaking activity when they were not perhaps in
breach of the rules, but in breach of the objectives of FSMA. The
Minister might respond by saying, &#147;I understand the point
exactly, and the institution could be recommitting the same offence,
but section 45 is your 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column130" />Column number: 130</div>answer; it can be used in the meantime to stop a firm from recommitting
an offence.&#148; I am not sure whether section 45 is subject to the
same appeals mechanism as proposed new section 206A and the other
sections in the disciplinary part of the Bill, so I am not sure what
the interaction is between the point that I am trying to raise through
amendment 5, and the issue of whether section 45 can prevent someone
from undertaking certain activities in an interim
period.</div><a name="09121556000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 1 is a broader measure. It tackles an issue that the Treasury
Committee highlighted in its 15th report of the 2008-09 session, namely
mortgages. Consumer bodies have regularly raised concerns to do with
naming and shaming and a more transparent enforcement process. How do
people know who is going through the process? The Treasury Committee
report on the handling of mortgage arrears pointed out that the FSA had
not published the name of the four miscreant firms &#147;subject to
enforcement action&#148; or
the</div><a name="09121556000259"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;firms
who had performed poorly in its August 2008 review of mortgage arrears
policies&#148;.</div>
<a name="09121556000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">In response to that
point, Jon Pain from the FSA said:</div>
<a name="09121556000260"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;until the full
enforcement process is complete, it would be unjust to say they are
guilty before they are proven
guilty&#148;.</div><a name="09121556000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
has support from the British Bankers Association, which followed up on
that point, but Shelter questioned the applicability of the concept and
said
that</div><a name="09121556000261"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;firms
referred for enforcement have been found categorically in breach of FSA
regulations and we see no reason not to name them while they are
undergoing enforcement
action.&#148;</div><a name="09121556000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
point was reiterated by Which?. It pointed out that until a firm saw
that there was a real penalty in disclosure, it would not mend its
ways. In a way, amendment 3 tackles that with its publication of
notice.</div>
<a name="09121556000115"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09121556000337"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Andrew Love</b> (Edmonton) (Lab/Co-op): Will the hon.
Gentleman give
way?</div><a name="09121556000116"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09121556000338"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I will give way in a second. Amendment 5 tackles
the issue by referring to firms that are entering the tribunal process,
but new clause 1 goes further. I happily give way to the hon. Member
for Edmonton, who is a distinguished member of the Treasury
Committee.</div>
<a name="09121556000117"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09121556000339"></a>Mr.
Love:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the issue is not
just about the importance of informing consumers in the market about
any disciplinary action taken, but about the reputational issue for the
individual and the firm? It is that more than anything else that will
hopefully curb such activity in the
marketplace.</div><a name="09121556000118"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09121556000340"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes a powerful point. I have
talked to a number of financial institutions about the Financial
Ombudsman Service&#146;s publication of league tables and about who
has had the most complaints. Obviously, size determines the number of
complaints, but an institution&#146;s approach to dealing with
complaints has an impact on where it appears in the league table.
Someone told me that their organisation was going to change its
practices as a consequence of publication, because it was a powerful
signal.</div>
<a name="09121556000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">Interestingly,
I spoke to someone who had just taken over the running of a major
financial services business. He said that one of the first things that
he looked at was the proportion of complaints found against it by the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column131" />Column number: 131</div>FOS. He was gratified to see that his organisation was way below the
average for the industry as a whole. The issue has a powerful impact,
because many businesses market themselves on their reputation and
brand. They can do a lot of brand advertising, marketing and everything
else to demonstrate that they are fantastic, trustworthy, credible and
on the consumer&#146;s side, until they start to appear on a list of
firms that have a disproportionately high number of complaints, given
the size of the business.</div>
<a name="09121556000120"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09121556000341"></a>Mr.
Todd:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that that would be an
important cultural message? One of the issues raised by the FSA in
defending its position was that it relies on the trust of the
institutions that it seeks to regulate and the relationships that it
has built up with them. A somewhat more robust approach would
demonstrate more clearly to the public the difference between a
regulator and the businesses that it regulates.
</div><a name="09121556000121"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09121556000342"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> The hon. Gentleman raises a powerful point about
public perception and the relationship between the regulator and the
regulated. It is remarkable to consider and compare the different
approaches to enforcement in different jurisdictions; a more public
style of enforcement sends out a very different message to the more
private style of enforcement that is used in this
country.</div>
<a name="09121556000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the
States, people are arrested in high-profile cases, and there is the
impression of activity and enforcement. I cannot comment on whether
that is the right impression, but the impression of enforcement is
given. The internalised process in the
FSA&#151;<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> I hear someone say
&#147;cosy&#148;, but I am not sure that that is a judgment I would
reach. The process does not give the impression of activity to the
outside world. We know that we should not base public policy decisions
on perception, but for many consumers perception is reality, and that
is the view that they may take of that relationship.</div>
<a name="09121556000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
some benefits to a more public style of enforcement, but also some
downsides. New clause 1 seeks to probe the tension between the two, and
given consumer groups&#146; concerns about enforcement, it is
important to have the discussion. However, it is not something that I
would necessarily put to a vote today. I will give more detail in a
minute.</div><a name="09121556000124"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09121556000343"></a>Mr.
Walker:</b> I am enjoying my hon. Friend&#146;s line of
argument. Clause 6 is on enhancing public understanding of financial
matters, and to do that we must allow the consumer to make an informed
choice. Mortgage deals change and move quickly. If a consumer is
considering a deal that superficially looks attractive, but the company
offering it is under investigation or is facing disciplinary
procedures, at some stage that consumer might get some compensation
through the courts, but the deals that they were comparing that deal
with will have been removed from the table. There could therefore be a
long-term financial disadvantage to that consumer because at the time
of making the choice they were not fully informed of the facts behind
the mortgages on the
table.</div><a name="09121556000125"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09121556000344"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> My hon. Friend makes an important point, and I am
pleased that he referred to the clause that removes from the
FSA&#146;s statutory objectives the objective about the protection of
consumers and about 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column132" />Column number: 132</div>public awareness. There is an issue there, which we will come back to
when we look at that clause. If we say now that the responsibility for
public awareness rests solely with the new consumer financial education
body and not with the FSA, how does the FSA ensure that the public know
about the role that it plays in regulation and enforcement? The FSA has
a public duty to justify or explain itself as a regulator, and that is
different to the consumer financial education bit of its current
activities. There is a helpful debate to be had there, and as my hon.
Friend has picked up on that point, he may want to explore it further
after the Christmas
recess.</div><a name="09121556000126"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09121556000345"></a>Mr.
Walker:</b> What a
joy.</div><a name="09121556000127"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09121556000346"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Well, that is part of the challenge that we have in
scrutinising the Bill at this
time.</div><a name="09121556000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Treasury Committee report concluded that the balance between disclosure
to the public and the need to protect firms before they have been found
guilty of wrongdoing had tilted too far towards the interests of the
industry, but we need to remember what John Pain said, which was that
you are innocent until you are proven guilty. There is therefore a
tension there. There is also a difference between criminal and civil
proceedings. In effect, the FSA has internalised a civil process, but
we are much more used to the public glare of criminal
prosecutions.</div><a name="09121556000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
new clause 1, I want to draw the Committee&#146;s attention to the
clarification of section 348 of FSMA on the duty of confidentiality. I
understand that when Which? submitted a freedom of information request
to find out who had performed badly in the FSA&#146;s 2008 review of
the handling of mortgage arrears, the FSA rebuffed the application and
prayed in aid section 348 of FSMA, which restricts the FSA&#146;s
disclosure of confidential
information.</div><a name="09121556000275"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.45
am</div><a name="09121556000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">Which?
is not an organisation to take things lying down. It went back to the
FSA and argued its view that section 348 contained</div>
<a name="09121556000262"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;important
gateways which allow the FSA to disclose information in certain
circumstances&#148;.</div><a name="09121556000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
FSA argued that those circumstances did not apply, but Which? pointed
out that the FSA could publish
information</div><a name="09121556000263"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in
pursuance to its function of providing guidance, information or
advice...to meet its regulatory objectives such as securing the
appropriate degree of protection for
consumers.&#148;</div><a name="09121556000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is the point my hon. Friend made. How can consumers be protected if
they do not know who has been subject to that action and who has
performed very badly? I thought one of the purposes behind thematic
reviews and mystery shopping was to help inform the regulatory process,
and perhaps give some guidance.</div>
<a name="09121556000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">In new clause
1, I seek to provide that section 348 does not prevent the disclosure
of information by the authority and that an authorised person is
subject to action under part 14 of the Act&#151;of course, I use its
definition of approved person: the institution that is undertaking the
work&#151;or be an approved person subject to separate actions taken
under section 66. I seek to provoke a debate, as I think I have
succeeded in doing to an extent, on how much information about the
enforcement 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column133" />Column number: 133</div>process should be in the public domain before the final conclusion has
been reached.</div>
<a name="09121556000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">The issue is
important for consumer protection; consumers should know which firms
are under investigation. It is also important to help change the
culture of the financial services sector and to have much more public
disclosure of information. I also acknowledge that it is not a
straightforward issue. We need to think very carefully about the impact
legislation might have on a business. We need to think about what is
the right step in a process where it may be possible to publish more
information than is currently the case, but a process that is entirely
private until the conclusions of the financial markets tribunal could
potentially be to the detriment of consumers, which is why I have
tabled new clause 1.</div>
<a name="09121556000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments 3
and 5 relate more narrowly to clause 14. Amendment 3 covers
the publication of a statement that the powers have been exercised.
Amendment 5 deals with the appeal process&#151;the hiatus between
identifying a problem and determining the sanction, and what people
should be aware of during the process.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09121556000347"></a>Rob
Marris:</b> It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship
again, Mr. Benton.</div>
<a name="09121556000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">On amendment
5 and what the hon. Member for Fareham refers to as the hiatus, I have
to say how thin the veneer is on the Opposition Benches. When we debate
the 42 days for terrorists, we hear all the civil liberties arguments,
which the Opposition then want to get around by using the Civil
Contingencies Act 2004, by using intercept evidence during a trial and
by having post-charge questioning. However, when we come to financial
derring-do, we hear, &#147;Oh we want a clampdown on the stage
between charge and trial by suspending&#148;&#151;to use a criminal
analogy&#151;which is what amendment 5 is about. I have to say to the
hon. Gentleman that I profoundly disagree with him.</div>
<a name="09121556000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the hon.
Gentleman were stopped and accused of Christmas-period drink-driving
tomorrow&#151;I am sure he will not be&#151;he could carry on
driving until his case came to court, when he would have a chance to
show his innocence. I am sure he would be proved innocent, because he
is an honourable and sensible man&#151;I am just using a criminal
analogy. However, someone driving around drunk could kill somebody. It
is much more serious than some financial messing around, serious as
that may be. Under our presumption of innocence until found guilty,
that is what we do and should continue to do as a society, difficult as
it is.</div>
<a name="09121556000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman is wrong to talk about people getting locked up pending an
appeal. It depends on the nature of the criminal process, and very
often people are not locked up pending an appeal. The overwhelming
majority of people charged with a criminal offence that could carry a
custodial sentence are not in custody pending the trial at which their
guilt or innocence is determined. However, I have some sympathy with
him on amendment 3 and new clause
1.</div><a name="09121556000140"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09121556000348"></a>Mr.
Todd:</b> I am not sure that I have followed the analogy
entirely. The individual involved is not granted anonymity in the
process. I fully accept that there is no judgment on guilt or innocence
until a judge and jury 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column134" />Column number: 134</div>decide the matter, but the individual is not normally anonymous through
that process, except in very specific
cases.</div>
<a name="09121556000141"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09121556000349"></a>Rob
Marris:</b> I entirely agree, which is why I was saying that I
have some sympathy with amendment 3 and new clause 1. That to me is the
way to balance the &#147;innocent until proven guilty&#148; aspect
of our system&#151;which I support, as I suspect do all hon.
Members&#151;with the need to protect consumers. The way to protect
consumers is along the lines put forward by amendment 3 and new clause
1, because it is to do with consumers making an informed choice.
However, amendment 3 is not currently worded in a way I could support,
because it refers solely to suspension, whereas proposed new section
206A(1)(b), which would be inserted by clause 14&#151;referred to by
the amendment&#151;refers to &#147;limitations or other
restrictions&#148;. It is important for that to be
included&#151;not just suspensions&#151;because I envisage a
situation when a firm offering financial advice has a member of staff
who is restricted in what he or she can do, but other members of staff
are
not.</div><a name="09121556000142"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09121556000350"></a>Mr.
Walker:</b> I appreciate the hon. Gentleman&#146;s argument.
Someone could be prosecuted for committing a crime and not proved
innocent or guilty, but still out in the community and subject to a
restraining order, for example. Are we suggesting, which might be a
good idea, that where there is a huge question mark over the business
practice of an individual or firm, that a specific restraining order be
placed on that firm in the area causing concern, so that it cannot sell
that financial instrument until the appeal has been settled? During the
course of the appeal it would be forbidden to sell that mortgage but,
once the appeal has been heard and if the firm has been found not
guilty of a misdemeanour or crime, it could go back to that business
practice, perhaps with some alterations or amendments to its
conduct.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09121556000351"></a>Rob
Marris:</b> I have some sympathy with what the hon. Gentleman
says, but amendment 5 refers only to suspension not to restriction. I
say to the hon. Member for Fareham, who has ably moved the amendments,
that that is a weakness, as restriction should be encompassed.
Amendment 3 does not say when the authority should publish the
statement, which can be quite important in informing consumers; nor
does it have the wording I think it should. After the word
&#147;powers&#148; in line 1 of the amendment, there should be
inserted something on the lines of &#147;even when an appeal is
pending&#148;, to make sure that consumers are informed. Something
similar should happen with new clause 1. Amendment 3 and new clause 1
refer, quite understandably, to what the authority shall do, or may do
in terms of new clause 1, but neither refers, as far as I can see, to
what the financial institution itself should do.</div>
<a name="09121556000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">There should
be provision that the financial institution itself has to tell
customers who come through the door about the restrictions or
suspensions in place, so that the customer can decide whether to
proceed with a transaction or go straight out of the door. Perhaps
there is such a provision elsewhere in the measure&#151;forgive my
ignorance, Mr.
Benton.</div><a name="09121556000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Fareham referred to the comments of Which? on new
clause 1. What it was told is absolutely ridiculous. If one is up
before the criminal courts, unless 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column135" />Column number: 135</div>one is a minor, it is a matter of public knowledge that a criminal trial
is pending. In my analogy, if the hon. Gentleman were stopped for
drink-driving and was being taken to court in a couple of months, it
would, rightly, be a matter of public record that there was a question
mark over his conduct, although I stress that I am sure he would never
do such a thing. Similarly, in civil matters, excepting those involving
minors&#151;indeed, some that involve minors&#151;and family
matters, the existence of a legal process is a matter of public record.
Why the FSA is hiding behind some kind of privacy or human rights stuff
is beyond me. I am not a human rights lawyer, that is not my
background.</div>
<a name="09121556000146"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09121556000352"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Andrew Tyrie</b> (Chichester) (Con): I always appreciate the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s interventions and I agree with more of them
than I disagree with. He knows that I do not always side with the FSA,
and have not done so over many years on all sorts of issues that have
come before the House, but there must be a prima facie case for saying
that the FSA are right in this instance. If we tell customers about
action as they come through the door, we are pretty much closing down
the business. Customers will say, &#147;Crikey, there&#146;s some
row going on here. I don&#146;t understand it so I&#146;ll go
somewhere else immediately.&#148; We are turning an already quite
significant power into something draconian. That was exactly what we
went to such pains to prevent when we drafted legislation years ago in
this Committee Room and in Committee Room 10, to try to bring some
balance to the process and enable firms that may be wrongly fingered
for an offence to carry on trading and not have their reputations
shredded even when they are subsequently found not
guilty.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09121556000353"></a>Rob
Marris:</b> I welcome being on the Committee with the hon.
Member for Chichester with whom I agree more often than I would wish in
the Chamber, although not on this issue. I take his point about
shredding the reputation of a firm but we have to look at protecting
consumers. We have to look at their level of maturity and at the
details of the information that I think the FSA should
publish.</div><a name="09121556000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">Consumers
are sometimes more mature about such things than one might think at
first glance. I shall give him an analogy from my professional practice
as a solicitor. It goes back many years, as I have not practised in
this area of law for more than 25 years. The Law Society rules then
were that one had to disclose to the client the commissions that one
sometimes got as a solicitor and give them the option of having the
commission for themselves. When I first read that rule as an articled
clerk, I thought that it was absolutely potty. I thought that the rule
might as well be that we should just give the commission to the client.
In practice, when one said, &#147;There is a commission with this
transaction, and you are entitled to all of it if you wish or you may
allow me to keep part of it&#148;, quite a proportion of clients
said, &#147;That&#146;s okay, you keep the commission, I&#146;d
have done the deal anyway.&#148; That was certainly counter-intuitive
to me, as I think it would be to many
people.</div><a name="09121556000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is a question of consumers&#146; maturity in weighing up information
and making choices. If a firm was being investigated, the consumer
might say, &#147;Well I&#146;ve dealt 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column136" />Column number: 136</div>with this firm for years, I understand the two little paragraphs about
what the FSA say they are investigating and why there is a restriction
on somebody working here, but it&#146;s all right with me, I&#146;m
going to carry on.&#148;</div>
<a name="09121556000150"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09121556000354"></a>Mr.
Walker:</b> Of course there will be an intermediate stage in
the process. The FSA would have been working with that business or
individual, we hope, for months and would have persuaded that business
or individual to moderate their behaviour before reaching the
enforcement level. If the FSA is so concerned about the business
practice, there must be an opportunity, even during the appeal process,
to advise potential customers about it and to let them know that the
organisation or individual is in a disciplinary
process.</div><a name="09121556000276"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12
noon</div><a name="09121556000151"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09121556000355"></a>Rob
Marris:</b> I agree with the hon. Gentleman; it is not just a
question of the opportunity for the
FSA.</div><a name="09121556000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
take issue with the fact that there is nothing in new clause 1 about
encouraging the FSA to disclose its information; the proposal is merely
permissive. I urge the hon. Member for Fareham not to press
amendment 5 to a Division, because it goes against our
system. I urge the Minister not to accept amendment 3 and new
clause 1, but he should seriously consider the issue of
disclosure and consumer information. Not only the FSA, but the
financial institution itself, should be encouraged to disclose
information to
consumers.</div><a name="09121556000153"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09121556000356"></a>Mr.
Breed:</b> I was not going to say much about this interesting
topic, but I will offer an analogy. I have been a member of the General
Medical Council for a considerable number of years, and I sit on
fitness to practice panels. This is not a complete analogy, but there
is a well-worn process when complaints are made against doctors that
are then considered by the GMC. Complaints that are insignificant or
vexatious are weeded out, and the remainder are considered in terms of
their potential seriousness. If complaints are potentially serious,
they are passed to an interim orders panel. I am a member of one such
panel. That part of the process happens before the fitness to practice
panel meets to decide upon any disciplinary
action.</div><a name="09121556000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is felt that the general public should be protected against a doctor
who may have been involved in serious misdemeanours, so, while the
doctor has not been found innocent or guilty during the period between
the meeting of the interim orders panel and the meeting of the fitness
to practice panel, it is decided that an order might be necessary to
protect the public. That can mean a letter of warning, conditions on
his or her registration, or even
suspension.</div><a name="09121556000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
such a process takes place, the GMC requires the doctor to advise
certain bodies and personnel, such as the local PCT and the director of
public health, of those conditions. Indeed, if the doctor accepts an
appointment or undertakes any other work, he needs to advise the people
involved of the conditions under which he is working. Those conditions
are published against the doctor&#146;s registration on the GMC
register. Although it is not required for him to put a notice up in his
waiting room&#151;&#147;I am under suspension&#148; or &#147;I
am under conditions&#148;&#151;if somebody interrogated the
register, they would see that, and if they asked their PCT, they 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column137" />Column number: 137</div>would be told that the doctor was under conditions or suspension,
pending the ultimate fitness to practice decision, which may be six,
nine or 12 months
away.</div><a name="09121556000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
offers something of an analogy to the issues under discussion. For
example, while we may not want a mortgage broker to put a notice up in
his waiting room stating, &#147;I am under threat&#148;, we may
require the FSA to hold a register that somebody could interrogate to
see whether there was an action against that broker. It could also be a
requirement to advise the local trading standards department so that,
should someone make an inquiry of it, they would be made aware that
that authorised person was under conditions in respect of a pending
action.</div><a name="09121556000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
process might work that way. It works tolerably well in the GMC,
although not everyone agrees with it, particularly those doctors who
are subjected to it. However, the analogy is not unreasonable in how
the process might operate. It would provide some means to the general
public to interrogate and find out whether a particular individual or
firm was under investigation or
conditions.</div><a name="09121556000158"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09121556000357"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> We have had an interesting debate and I will try
to clarify matters for the Committee. As is nearly always the case, the
hon. Member for Fareham has a point. However, as in many cases, a lot
of my work has been done for me by my hon. Friend the Member for
Wolverhampton, South-West. We have had analogies with criminal cases
and most recently, from the hon. Member for South-East Cornwall, an
analogy with the GMC and fitness to practice.</div>
<a name="09121556000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not
think that there are any perfect analogies, but at the risk of
extending the criminal analogy a little further, I would want to draw a
distinction between the disciplinary measures here and the measures to
protect consumers and prevent action from taking place. So, to pursue a
criminal analogy, we are not talking about a person who has been
arrested and charged and taken into preventive custody for a serious
offence. We are talking about clauses that relate to disciplinary
powers. The FSA&#146;s current preventive powers can be used if there
is a risk to the consumer and they can be used under section 45 of
FSMA&#151;the OIVOP provisions that I have already talked
about.</div><a name="09121556000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
suspension could be imposed by the FSA under section 45 and could have
immediate effect, thereby enabling preventive action to take place if
the FSA considered that necessary because of the detriment to
consumers. We are talking about a different set of
circumstances&#151;not about preventing action, but about the
punishment that might be appropriate as opposed to a fine. There is the
punishment and the deterrent effect of having a sanction that is all
about suspending permission to carry on regulated
activities.</div>
<a name="09121556000161"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09121556000358"></a>Mr.
Walker:</b> Will the Minister confirm that the relationship
between the FSA and financial advisers does not necessarily have to be
built on confrontation? It would be perfectly possible for the FSA to
work in partnership with a financial adviser or company and say,
&#147;Look, we have some concerns around this financial instrument.
We would prefer it if you withdrew it for the next two or three months
while we work with you to clear up those concerns.&#148; Is that a
possible outcome?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column138" />Column number: 138</div><a name="09121556000162"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09121556000359"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I agree that that is likely to happen in a lot of
instances. Generally, the first recourse would be the FSA having a word
with the individual or the companies about areas of concern. In many
cases these issues are sorted out in that way. Then, as I indicated
earlier, if the FSA remains concerned that there is potential
misconduct and consumer detriment, or a threat to financial stability
or any of the other objectives, it can act by issuing a warning
notice.</div><a name="09121556000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is important to recognise that the FSA has other powers to protect the
consumer that we are not discussing here, but which are all relevant.
They are used by the FSA and have been used in the recent past, but
they are distinct from the additional power that we are seeking to take
here today, which will enable the FSA to suspend permission to carry
out regulated activities in the
future.</div><a name="09121556000164"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09121556000360"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for the way he is
explaining this. There is a challenge for the Committee here. I suspect
that none of us took part in consideration in Committee of FSMA, for
which we should perhaps be grateful, with the exception of my hon.
Friend the Member for Chichester, who consequently understands the Act
inside out. One problem is that while we are dealing with disciplinary
powers in isolation as we amend FSMA, we are not looking at preventive
power.</div><a name="09121556000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
put this challenge to the Minister: one assumes that a temporary
suspension of activity would be on the activity where the alleged
breach took place. For example, if the problem was with the sale of
mortgages, the firm would be prevented from selling them. This is not a
penalty that exists in isolation; there is a clear connection between
the breach and the penalty. On the other hand, there is no equally
clear link where, for example, there is a breach and then a
fine.</div><a name="09121556000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is where the issue of prevention comes in. If it is said that that
there is a breach so heinous that a suspension should be the sanction,
people will want to know what is going to happen in the middle period
to ensure that the breach does not reoccur before the sanction is
imposed.</div><a name="09121556000167"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09121556000361"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I think I understand what the hon. Gentleman is
trying to get at. Again, I want to return to the fact that the FSA, as
a public authority, has to act appropriately and proportionately. For
example, if a problem was identified in the mortgage market, the remedy
would not be to refuse the organisation permission to operate in the
shares or credit default swaps markets. The remedy would, in
common-sense terms, have to relate to the area in which the FSA had
concerns and was talking to the individual or
company.</div><a name="09121556000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman is right, and I am not sure that any other member of the
Committee served on the Committee considering FSMA, but I would like to
make a few comments in reference to it, as that will help to explain
the
amendments.</div><a name="09121556000169"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09121556000362"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> The Minister is right. This is about trying to work
out the proportionality. If the breach is in a particular type of
business&#151;with the FSA believing that the authorised person has
broken a set of rules&#151;and the penalty is that they stop
transacting that type of business, what will happen between the breach
and the final penalty so as to protect consumers? That is outside 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column139" />Column number: 139</div>the scope of the part of the Bill that we are discussing, as it is about
the disciplinary sanction, but I want to see where the linkage is,
which will protect consumers in the interim before the final sanction
is
imposed.</div><a name="09121556000170"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09121556000363"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> The point that I was trying to make on preventive
custody will, I hope, address the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point. If the
consumer needs to be protected and the FSA has concerns, the FSA can
use section 45 of FSMA to suspend an individual company from taking a
particular course of action, and the customer will be protected
immediately. The FSA might then want, using the powers we are
discussing, to suspend the company from taking action for a period of
up to 12 months, which it can
determine.</div><a name="09121556000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
two powers are different: one is to do with discipline and punishment,
the other with prevention. The section 45 powers prevent actions from
being taken, while the powers under the clause are for punishment and
deterrence.</div>
<a name="09121556000172"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09121556000364"></a>Mr.
Todd:</b> The amendment is about punishment. Is the Minister
arguing that there is sufficient punishment in the clause and that the
additional sanction of some public information about that punishment
would be unnecessarily draconian? One of my concerns is the slight
haziness over where the threshold will lie when the clause is
implemented. Many informal contacts will take place between the FSA and
a regulated body in which it might ask questions or raise worries about
a particular activity well short of the sanction in the Bill. It is
perfectly reasonable that that should be conducted in private, but
there is an argument for saying that, when we reach the much more
formal process of the use of the law, there should be a wider currency
to that
decision.</div><a name="09121556000277"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.15
pm</div><a name="09121556000173"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09121556000365"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> My hon. Friend asks about the important point at
which disclosure to the public takes place. I shall explain the
Government&#146;s position on that in a few
moments.</div><a name="09121556000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
the record, let me explain why in the Government&#146;s view the
changes under the amendments and new clause 1 are not
necessary. Paragraphs 18 and 19 of schedule 2 amend sections 207 and
208 of FSMA, which require the FSA to issue warning notices and
decision notices when taking disciplinary measures. The specific
changes will require the FSA to issue warning and decision notices in
relation to suspensions or restrictions of permission under the
proposed new section 206A, which is inserted into FSMA under the
clause.</div><a name="09121556000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments under schedule 2 will then lead to section 391 of FSMA being
engaged. Section 391(4) requires the FSA to publish such information as
it considers appropriate about the matter covered by a final notice.
For the information of the Committee, a final notice is the notice
given after the decision notice has been issued and any reference to
the tribunal has been dealt with or the period in which to make a
referral to the tribunal has passed. Therefore, on the assumption that
the consequential amendments schedule is, in due course, accepted as
part of the Bill, the FSA will be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column140" />Column number: 140</div>under an obligation to publish appropriate information about the persons
whose permissions are suspended or restricted under the
clause.</div><a name="09121556000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">While
I agree with the intention of amendment 3, in practice it is not
necessary. However, my hon. Friend the Member for South Derbyshire is
right if he is saying that the time in which the information is made
public will be at or after the decision notice, and that addresses the
point of innocent until proven guilty.</div>
<a name="09121556000177"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09121556000366"></a>Mr.
Todd:</b> Will my hon. Friend clarify one point? He suggests
that there would be an obligation on the FSA to publish such
information, but the wording that he quoted showed a substantial degree
of discretion on the FSA about how it makes such a judgment. Perhaps I
misheard him, but he said broadly that the FSA would judge such
information as appropriate. I am worried about the degree of
obligation.</div><a name="09121556000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
other concern was developed by my hon. Friend the Member for
Wolverhampton, South-West, which was that there is no obligation of
anonymity to someone who is under suspicion and charged in the matter.
I cannot quite understand why anonymity needs to be granted after the
serious threshold that has been exercised of establishing a suspension,
pending a possible future
sanction.</div><a name="09121556000179"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09121556000367"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> On my hon. Friend&#146;s first point, he is
right to refer to my words when I said that the FSA is required to
publish such information as it considers appropriate. I would have
thought that the type of information mentioned under amendment 3 would
generally be appropriate to be published. If, for some reason, the FSA
considers that it would be wrong to publish certain details, it would
not be required to do so. The FSA has a general duty to act in an
appropriate and proportionate manner. The important point to note is
that the publication requirements for all of the FSA&#146;s
enforcement measures, including the new suspension power, will be the
same. I understand that the hon. Member for Fareham has some concerns,
but in practice they are not likely to
eventuate.</div><a name="09121556000180"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09121556000368"></a>Mr.
Love:</b> May I add to the concerns? The evidence that the
Treasury Committee took showed clearly the unwillingness of the FSA to
carry out its obligations to disclose such matters. Therefore, I put it
to the Minister that if we are not to go down the route of giving the
FSA an explicit power to disclose the information, how can the
Committee be reassured that the FSA will do what is necessary&#151;if
I may put it in the crudest terms&#151;to name and shame those guilty
of such
misdemeanours?</div><a name="09121556000181"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09121556000369"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> The key point we are discussing is when the
information comes into the public domain. I recognise that there is
some concern and different views about whether that should be done
after the potential for referral to a tribunal and a final decision has
been taken, or before, when the FSA issues its decision notice. A
legitimate debate can be had in that area. I would like to explain the
Government&#146;s views and why we have come to that position. I am
happy to give way before doing
so.</div><a name="09121556000182"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09121556000370"></a>Mr.
Love:</b> I thank the Minister again for giving way so
liberally on the issue, which is critically important. I am not a
lawyer, therefore I defer to the greater knowledge 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column141" />Column number: 141</div>of my colleagues on the Committee, but I would accept that amendment 5
is not perhaps one that we should wish to pursue. The wording in
amendment 3 and in new clause 1 may well not be entirely appropriate to
achieve what is being attempted, but I think that there is a broad
measure of agreement that something needs to be done about disclosure
and the FSA. I hope that the Minister is willing to take the issue away
and perhaps come back at a later stage in the Bill with something that
will reassure the Committee and the House that action will be taken to
ensure that the FSA lives up to its responsibilities in such
matters.</div><a name="09121556000183"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09121556000371"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> Let me explain the Government&#146;s position
and how it has developed. I can do that helpfully by specifically
referring to the new clause, which seeks to remove the relevant section
of FSMA, preventing the FSA from disclosing whether it has taken action
against a firm or an individual. The Committee should be aware that the
legal restriction contained in section 348, which the new clause
switches off, is a restriction on disclosing information received from
the authorised firm or from the approved person. However, a statement
such as, &#147;The FSA has issued a warning notice to firm
X&#148; or &#147;The FSA has begun disciplinary proceedings against
person X&#148; does not constitute information received from the
firm. That means that section 348 is not engaged, therefore disapplying
it is unnecessary, so the new clause does not
work.</div><a name="09121556000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
fact, section 391 of FSMA would be the relevant provision. It provides
that &#147;Neither the&#148;
FSA</div><a name="09121556000264"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;nor
a person to whom a warning notice or decision notice is
given...may publish the notice or any details concerning
it.&#148;</div><a name="09121556000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
also provides that the
FSA</div><a name="09121556000265"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;must
publish such information about...a final notice...as it

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09121556000372"></a>Rob
Marris:</b> Will my hon. Friend give
way?</div><a name="09121556000188"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09121556000373"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> In a moment&#151;let me make a little progress,
which might help my hon.
Friend.</div><a name="09121556000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
recognise that section 391 does not require the FSA to disclose the
fact that someone is subject to investigation, it simply gives the
option of doing so. However, as can be seen from the section&#151;the
hon. Member for Chichester will no doubt remember
this&#151;Parliament was clear at the time that publication should
happen only at the end of the process, after the firm has had a chance
to make representations and the option of referring the matter to the
tribunal. The Government&#146;s position is that that is reasonable,
given&#151;again&#151;that UK law is based on the principle that
people are assumed to be innocent until found
guilty.</div>
<a name="09121556000190"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09121556000374"></a>Mr.
Tyrie:</b> I hesitate to come to the defence of the Treasury
Bench&#151;indeed, I think this must be a precedent&#151;but there
is another reason why the position that the Government took, after a
lot of persuasion all those years ago, is probably correct. What the
FSA really wants and needs is informal contact from the firm asking
about a product that might have a potential problem. If it thinks that
merely by supplying that piece of information it may find itself
suddenly put at high reputational risk, it will take a more strictly
legal position 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column142" />Column number: 142</div>and disclose only the minimum. It is the informal relationships that are
created through ARROW visits, through the period in between those
investigations, that is the best way to secure the public and protect
the customer. That is quite independent of the separate issue, which is
about what the public has the right to know. Has ex post taken place?
The public must be informed in reasonable time about an investigation
where a referral has been made to a tribunal. As I understand it, those
provisions already exist in the Bill to enable that to take
place.</div>
<a name="09121556000191"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09121556000375"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes some relevant and
pertinent points. The Treasury Committee was concerned about the issue,
as my hon. Friend the Member for Edmonton rightly pointed out. That
Committee felt that the balance between disclosure to the public and
the need to protect firms before they had been found guilty of
wrongdoing was tilted too far towards the needs of industry. In its
response to the Treasury Committee report, the FSA made the point about
fairness to those accused of wrongdoing but who had not yet had the
chance to defend themselves, as I mentioned. In addition, the FSA
helpfully responded that it can and sometimes does publicise whether it
is investigating a particular case. It tends to do that only in
exceptional cases&#151;for example, where it is desirable to do so to
maintain confidence in the financial system or to protect consumers or
investors. On the important issue of consumer protection, I think hon.
Members would expect the FSA to have the ability to publicise whether
it is investigating a particular case. Given the fact that that can
happen, the FSA stated, and I agree, that the current framework allows
a balance to be struck between achieving its objectives&#151;in
particular, consumer protection&#151;and fairness to firms and
individuals. It is a question of striking the appropriate balance and
we believe that that balance has been struck in this case, which is why
we will not support the new clause.</div>
<a name="09121556000192"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09121556000376"></a>Rob
Marris:</b> I talked about the issue, which is pretty core to
our judicial system overall, of innocent until proven guilty, and that
is why I resist amendment 5, as I think my hon. Friend the Minister
knows. But in terms of striking that balance, it seems that the quid
pro quo, or the trade-off, is that the customer and prospective
customer ought to have access to information&#151;perhaps on a
register, to which the hon. Member for South-East Cornwall referred by
medical analogy&#151;about whether a firm with which he or she
proposes to do business is under investigation, under suspension or
whatever. That is the balancing, so the firm can carry on until the end
part of the process, but the trade-off is that the consumer gets to
know that that process is under way.</div>
<a name="09121556000193"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09121556000377"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I can understand the point that my hon. Friend
makes. As I said, that was discussed at great length during the passage
of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. It was not something
that it was decided would be appropriate to do. I pointed out the
flexibility in the system at the moment, and I am happy to reflect
further on the points that he and other hon. Members have made, but at
the moment my firm view is that the balance in giving protection to
consumers is appropriate, while at the same time respecting the fact
that firms should not be prejudged until the outcome of investigations
has been fully settled.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column143" />Column number: 143</div><a name="09121556000278"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.30
pm</div><a name="09121556000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall deal briefly with amendment 5. My hon. Friend the Member for
Wolverhampton, South-West rightly made some valid points about why it
would not work. It would actually be punishment before being found
guilty rather than information being disclosed. It is possible to argue
that, in the case of, say, a monetary fine, sometimes it does not
matter if it is imposed before an appeal because, if an appeal is
successful, a fine can be returned to the defendant, perhaps with
interest. However, if we are talking about suspending the permission of
an individual or a firm to act, that is serious. Customers will not
have waited and would have gone to a competitor. The reputation of the
individual or firm might have been damaged even though they might be
eventually be found innocent. That point not only plays to
amendment 5, but to disclosure. There is a real danger of
unfairness.</div><a name="09121556000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
whole tenor of the Financial Services and Markets Act is that sanctions
do not take effect until after a final notice has been issued, not a
decision notice. In accordance with section 390, a final notice cannot
be issued until after the period for reference to the tribunal has
passed. We believe that that is the appropriate balance that should be
struck, so we will not support amendment 5. I think that I have covered
the key points with regard to the group of
proposals.</div><a name="09121556000196"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09121556000378"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> We have had a helpful debate on the two amendments
and new clause 1. It reminds me of the error message that we
occasionally pick up when looking at a document in Word, when part of a
sentence is underlined and we are told that &#147;fragments need
revising&#148;. The three proposals broaden the scope of the debate
beyond the narrow sanction that is imposed. Two themes run through our
argument, the first of which is how much consumers should know. The
second theme is about the right protection to put in place for a
consumer when there has been a breach of the
rules.</div><a name="09121556000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the first theme, various analogies have floated around about a person
being innocent until proven guilty. That is a fundamental principle of
United Kingdom law and is one that it is right to abide by, but there
is a degree of publicity around a criminal case and, in some
circumstances, people&#146;s rights are protected in such cases.
There is publicity; it does not prejudge the outcome, but people are
aware of cases and know what is going on. Should there be greater
transparency about the enforcement process in the FSA than is currently
the case? That the Treasury Committee errs on the side of greater
openness and greater transparency is reflected in the amendments and
the new clause, while the position of the Government and the FSA is
that the balance is about right
now.</div><a name="09121556000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">While
the debate has been helpful in teasing out some issues, some more
thought needs to go into the right circumstances in which consumers
should have more information than they currently do, and what that
means in compromising the interests of firms. We talked about the
relationship of trust and openness between the FSA and regulated firms,
and I can understand the importance of that. When I talk to businesses
in the City, they say that they want to be able to share information
with the FSA. However, equally, I do not think we want consumers to
feel that there is a cosy relationship&#151;I think the  hon.
Member for Edmonton used that phrase earlier&#151; between
firms and the regulator, as if they are in the same
pocket.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column144" />Column number: 144</div><a name="09121556000199"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09121556000379"></a>Mr.
Love:</b> Earlier the hon. Gentleman touched upon a wider
discussion about the changes that are occurring in the FSA, which, as
it is currently constituted, is funded by the industry. I think
everyone recognises that that will continue in the future&#151;it is
the only practical way to fund the organisation. Almost all of its
personnel come from City institutions. Again, considering the level of
expertise, that is unlikely to change. It is therefore imperative, to
correct its natural bias towards the industry and protect consumers,
for us to write in some prescription to suggest to the FSA that it must
take consumer interests into consideration. I hope that when the
Minister reflects on that matter he will decide that there is a need to
strengthen this part of the
Bill.</div><a name="09121556000200"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09121556000380"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Indeed, and the hon. Gentleman raised some wider
issues in the context of how the FSA is accountable to consumers. We
have the consumer panel, and we said in our White Paper in July that we
would appoint two consumer representatives to the board of the new
Consumer Protection Agency, which has led a successful campaign to get
two consumer representatives on to the FSA&#146;s board. We need to
ensure that a balance is
struck.</div><a name="09121556000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is an issue about information that leads to how we protect consumers,
which is the second theme that has emerged from the debate. The
Minister is right to draw us back to the fact that we are talking about
sanctions where a disciplinary process has been completed.
However&#151;I intervened on him on this point&#151;there should be
a relationship between the breach and the penalty. If one breached the
rules on sales of insurance policies, the penalty should be related to
the sale of those policies. That is right and proportionate.</div>
<a name="09121556000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">The matter
becomes difficult when we ask what happens in the interim where there
has been some sort of consumer detriment through a breach of the rules,
which the sanction is then going to tackle. How do we protect consumers
in the interim before we reach the point when the final notice is
published? One argument is that we must have greater transparency: the
consumer should know that a business or firm that they are about to
engage with is going through a disciplinary process. Information will
provide adequate protection for the consumer, and a better informed
consumer can make their choice. Another argument is that we should go
down the route that the hon. Member for South-East Cornwall talked
about in the context of his being a lay member of the GMC panel, which
is that we should take some preventive action between the
identification of the misconduct and the agreement of the final
sanction. That is part of the thinking behind amendment 5, which would
give the FSA a power to suspend that particular activity until a
conclusion is
reached.</div><a name="09121556000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister assures us that the powers to take preventive action are
already there for the FSA under section 45. The problem that we have in
debating such Bills is that we make incremental
changes&#151;something that the Minister and the hon. Member for
Wolverhampton, South-West are familiar with from debating the Finance
Bill, where each year there are incremental changes on previous
incremental changes. It would be helpful for the FSA, when it produces
its consultation paper on how it is going to implement the powers, to
reflect on how those things interlock. Should there be more information
available to act as a form of protection for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column145" />Column number: 145</div>consumers? Should the powers under section 45 be used as a way of
bridging that gap between the breach and the final section? How does
the jigsaw of consumer protection fit
together?</div><a name="09121556000204"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09121556000381"></a>Mr.
Tyrie:</b> My hon. Friend has tabled a very helpful set of
amendments for the Opposition, not least because it has smoked out
exactly this issue. Is not the key to make sure that the FSA is not
asleep on the job during that interim period? The FSA could say,
&#147;Well, we have someone looking at it,&#148; so we can carry on
as if nothing has happened, but what we need is vigilance from the FSA,
to ensure that it is constantly assessing whether it needs to exercise
its powers under section 45. We and the public need confidence that the
ability to provide that is built into the systems of the FSA. The
suggestion of my hon. Friend the Member for Fareham, that the FSA
produce a consultation document to give us that confidence, would be
welcome.</div><a name="09121556000205"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09121556000382"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his
intervention and his comments. He is right; we all agree in the
aftermath of the financial crisis that we expect the FSA to use a more
proactive approach to supervision. It is referred to as being more
intensive and intrusive, and I suspect that the logical outcome of that
approach would be a greater use of the powers under section 45. I am
looking for reassurance as to how the FSA would use the combination of
section 45 and the new powers that we are giving it under proposed new
section 206A to protect consumers, to ensure that in the interim, where
it has identified that there is a significant breach&#151;a breach so
significant that the FSA believes that suspending a firm from
undertaking that activity is warranted&#151;consumers are protected.
That is either done through use of section 45 powers or, if the belief
is that those powers go too far and impinge potentially on the issue
raised by the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West&#151;about
innocent until proven guilty&#151;the alternative, which is greater
transparency about the enforcement process. Is that the alternative
form of protection to section 45? We need to resolve that tension as
the FSA moves to a different form of intervention. Regardless of
whether it is the FSA or other regulatory bodies that succeed it, one
of the lessons of the crisis has been a much more intrusive approach to
regulation.</div><a name="09121556000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
regret that, as another member of the Committee who is not legally
qualified, like the hon. Member for Edmonton, my amendments 3 and 5 are
defective in the view of the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West.
If I come back to the issue again, I shall beef up my amendments and
make them more inclusive in their wording perhaps. However, we have had
a helpful debate, clarifying the situation for a number of us and
raising some new issues that we may want to return to at a later stage.
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09121556000207"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09121556000383"></a>Mr.

very sorry to disturb proceedings, but I wanted to point out that in
the back row here the air conditioning seems to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column146" />Column number: 146</div>be on as if it were mid-summer. I have noticed that it is 1
outside and, though more in here, it is certainly not very warm. I

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09121556000384"></a>The

<h4 class="hs_8Clause">Clause

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09121556000385"></a>Rob
Marris:</b> I have a simple question.
&#147;Cancelling&#148; is used in relation to authorisation in the
clause heading&#151; page 19, line 36&#151;but
&#147;withdrawing&#148; is used in the body of the clause, on line
39. What is the difference between withdrawing and
cancelling?</div><a name="09121556000215"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09121556000386"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I suggest that my hon. Friend the Member for
Chichester move closer to the Front Bench&#151;oh, he has gone. That
would have brought him closer to the hot air that has been generated by
the
debate.</div><a name="09121556000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
expect that the Minister will deal with this matter during the stand
part debate. The clause removes part of section 206 of FSMA. Therefore,
if the clause passes into law, when someone loses
authorisation&#151;whether it is cancelled or whatever term is
used&#151;and loses the right to earn a living from the business,
they will also face a financial penalty. That was not the case under
FSMA, so what has changed in the Government&#146;s thinking since the
passing of that Act? If someone is deprived of the right to earn a
living, it is much harder for them to pay a fine, unless they have
accrued profits in the interim. Will the Minister clarify the
Government&#146;s
position?</div><a name="09121556000217"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09121556000387"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> The clause removes section 206(2) of part XIV of
FSMA, which prevents the FSA from both imposing a fine on a firm and
withdrawing its authorisation in relation to the same misconduct. I am
sure that hon. Members will agree that if a firm gains a financial
advantage from misconduct, the FSA should be able to fine it. The best
answer I have for the hon. Member for Fareham is that when given a
choice between withdrawing a firm&#146;s authorisation, to remove the
firm from the industry, and fining the firm, the FSA often chooses the
former. That is the right choice because consumers need to be
protected. It means, however, that a firm can retain any financial
gains that it has made as a result of misconduct. It is not right that
a firm should not have to suffer a fine when the misconduct warrants
it, and it is therefore right to give the FSA the option to use both
sanctions when it feels it is appropriate to do
so.</div><a name="09121556000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the difference between cancelling and withdrawing, which my hon. Friend
the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West pointed out, I am advised that
cancelling applies to permissions. Once all permissions were
cancelled  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column147" />Column number: 147</div>&#151;removed&#151;the FSA would have to withdraw the firm&#146;s
authorisation. I hope that that is clear to my hon. Friend, or as clear
to him as it is to
me.</div><a name="09121556000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again,
I want to make the basic point that the FSA will use the powers
proportionately. It will seek to take actions only in cases where they
are justified. It is important, however, that the FSA has that power,
so it can use it when appropriate. It simply is not right that a firm
whose authorisation could be withdrawn because it was guilty of
misconduct could be allowed to keep the proceeds of financial gain that
it had wrongly made. The clause will remove that possibility.
Therefore, I urge that it stand part of the
Bill.</div><a name="09121556000220"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09121556000390"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> The best place to start is a setting out of what
happens by virtue of clause 16. Then I shall move on to my amendments,
which would broadly have the same effect, as they flow through this
section of the Bill. FSMA sets the regulatory perimeter for the FSA to
find lots of activities that firms can carry out, but which have to be
regulated by the FSA. It gives the FSA some statutory objectives and
enforcement powers when people within its perimeter transgress its
rules.</div><a name="09121556000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
fundamental part of the FSA&#146;s role is authorisation, so there is
talk of authorised persons and approved persons able to undertake
functions within businesses that carry out financial services. That
helps to create the regulatory boundary that we want the FSA to
supervise, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column148" />Column number: 148</div>regulate and, where appropriate, enforce. What is interesting about
clause 16 is that it will expand the FSA&#146;s remit beyond people
it has approved, to identify people who are undertaking a function
where perhaps they should have been approved. That is a shift in the
FSA&#146;s regulatory
approach.</div><a name="09121556000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
spoke earlier about opening up clause 14 when we discussed the
Association of British Insurers submission, which questioned whether
the powers in clauses 14 to 17 were needed in a generic sense. In the
evidence session on Thursday afternoon last week, we spent a lot of
time talking about these powers with people from the industry and those
with legal expertise. We asked Guy Sears from the IMA about his
understanding of the additional powers being taken by the FSA. As I
said, the ABI questioned whether these additional powers were needed,
while Mr. Sears, from a different perspective,
said:</div><a name="09121556000266"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It
would seem so to me, if we have a system that seeks in its spirit to
ensure that those who carry on important parts and important roles
within regulated activities should be subject to proper standards on
entry and oversight by the FSA. In a sense, if they do not do that, the
FSA has no ability to deal with them&#151;that seems to me a
lacuna.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report, Financial
Services Public Bill Committee, </i>10 December 2009; c. 93,
Q5.]</div><a name="09121556000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">The word
&#147;lacuna&#148; was used rather a lot on Thursday afternoon. The
BBA, which I cited earlier, has been sceptical about increased powers
and said in relation to this
area:</div><a name="09121556000267"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
support the FSA being given the additional power to
suspend&#148;</div><a name="09121556000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">authorised</div><a name="09121556000268"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;persons,
but... this power should be limited to those persons who carry out
a &#145;controlled
function&#146;.&#148;</div><a name="09121556000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
gets to the heart of the debate. We are seeing a shift in the
FSA&#146;s approach, so it can take action against someone who is not
authorised to perform a controlled function but may in practice be
doing
so.</div><a name="09121556000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
need to be cautious because we must ensure that there are adequate
safeguards for people who suddenly find they have fallen within the
remit of the FSA, when they have not been through the approval process
and might not, therefore, be aware of what is happening to them. I
tabled amendments 14, 15, 1, 16, 17, 18 and 19 to clarify what will
happen to people who get caught by clause 16, and to try to introduce a
safeguard for
them.</div><a name="09121556000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is a risk that people will unwittingly undertake a controlled function
as part of their responsibilities in their job. Such people might not
have been through the FSA&#146;s authorisation process and might not
be regulatory experts, but they might end up, for some reason,
undertaking those functions. That is why I probed the Government on
what defence might be available to people who undertake such
functions.</div><a name="09121556000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
particularly focused on the protection that there might be for someone
who is doing a job at the direction of somebody else in the business.
What will happen if someone has been instructed to undertake that
function? A board member, director or officer, or an unauthorised
person, might say, &#147;We want you to do this. It is part of your
duty; you must do it.&#148; Such a person might assume, because the
other person is on the board as a director or officer of a business,
that they have to do it. They might also assume that someone has gone
through the process to ensure that they are able to do it. That might
be a legitimate defence in their eyes, to prevent some of the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column149" />Column number: 149</div>sanctions being imposed on them. That is why, for example, amendment 1
would insert at the end of line 14 the
words</div><a name="09121556000269"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;did
not know... could not reasonably be expected to have known
that... was at that time performing a controlled
function&#148;.</div><a name="09121556000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
can people plead in their defence to say that they undertook those
functions but assumed it was okay to do
so?</div><a name="09121556000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment would move responsibility from the individual to the firm. It
says that it is the firm&#146;s responsibility to supervise people.
Amendments 14 to 19 would amend the Bill so that the authorised
person&#151;the firm or business undertaking that
activity&#151;would pay the fine, not the individual. My argument is
that the individual is acting at the direction of management.
Therefore, it would be helpful to understand why the Government believe
it should be the person, rather than the authorised person, who pays
the
fine.</div><a name="09121556000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
would also be helpful to understand what defence may be made by that
individual to say, &#147;Actually, I am just doing what I have been
told to do. Is it not reasonable for me to follow the orders of a
director and officer who 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column150" />Column number: 150</div>is the authorised person?&#148; That is the thrust behind the
amendments. I would be grateful for the Minister&#146;s clarification
of how that power will be implemented in
practice.</div><a name="09121556000241"></a>

Pearson:</b> The clause is about credible deterrence. Its
purpose is to strengthen the FSA&#146;s approved persons regime to
ensure that people carrying out key roles in firms are only those who
are fit and proper to do so, and that they perform those roles to the
requisite standard. For that, we need the right balance of
deterrence.</div><a name="09121556000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
believe that for deterrence to be credible, it needs to be directed at
the firm and at the individual. It is important that employees in key
decision-making or customer-facing roles are individually accountable
for their actions.</div>
