<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000467"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I remind the Committee that with this we are
discussing amendment No. 6, in clause 8, page 7, line 28, leave out the
words in column 2 of the table and insert &#145;A fine of
&#163;1000&#146;.</div><a name="08112051000028"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000468"></a>The
Minister of State, Ministry of Justice (Mr. Michael
Wills):</b> I welcome you, Sir Nicholas, and the rest of the
Committee to our final sitting. I think that before the Committee
adjourned I had completed my remarks about clause 8 stating clearly
that a person commits an offence only if they knowingly or recklessly
make a false declaration, but I want to say at the commencement of this
afternoon&#146;s proceedings that I recognise the concerns that have
been expressed that an over-zealous approach to enforcement for minor
technical breaches is in no one&#146;s interest. It may result in
major breaches going unpunished if the Electoral Commission focuses on
minor technical breaches, so I asked the commission to write to the
Committee, setting out its risk-based approach to regulation. I hope
that members of the Committee have received that
letter.</div><a name="08112051000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
part of the letter, the commission has described in a very helpful way
its criteria for investigating breaches. I hope that that goes a
significant way towards reassuring hon. Members. The commission has
said that the criteria that it will apply in order for it to
investigate a breach are, first, that there is evidence or information
substantiating a potential breach of political party or election
finance legislation, not merely an assertion of or a speculation about
a breach, and secondly, that the commission considers that it is in the
public interest for it to investigate, taking into account the
potential impact of the breach on the integrity or transparency of
party or election finance, the cost of investigating such a potential
breach relative to the impact of the breach, and any other
considerations that may be relevant. I hope that those criteria are
helpful in reassuring the Committee that the commission is not
interested in pursuing cases that are essentially groundless. Members
of the Committee are understandably concerned about that.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column384" />Column number: 384</div><a name="08112051000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">Notwithstanding
the considerable reassurance from the Electoral Commission, I am still
willing to consider how that reassurance may be given more force in
appropriate cases. However, in stressing my openness on the issue, I
emphasise that offences that are formulated as false declarations
through the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000, such
as those subject to the amendment, quite properly have a degree of
intent or negligent wrongdoing inherent in them. I do not think that
there is a good case for revisiting that. Clause 8 already provides
that a person is guilty of an offence only if they knowingly or
recklessly make a false declaration. They commit an offence only if
they are either conscious of the fact that it is substantially certain
that they are making a
false&#151;</div><a name="08112051000031"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08112051000469"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Jonathan Djanogly</b> (Huntingdon) (Con): Is the Minister
saying that he will consider whether this should be an indictable or
just a summary
offence?</div><a name="08112051000032"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000470"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> No, I was saying that I was prepared to consider
the circumstances in which the commission might be able to give further
reassurance to the Committee on the basis on which it will investigate
potential breaches or breaches. It has already, in its letter, gone a
long way towards reassuring the Committee, but if concerns remain, we
are open to considering
that.</div><a name="08112051000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under
the clause, someone is committing an offence only if they are conscious
of the fact that it is substantially certain that they are making a
false declaration or if they are being careless to the point of being
heedless of the consequences. If neither of those conditions is
satisfied, an offence is not
committed.</div><a name="08112051000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
must oppose amendment No. 6 for similar reasons. We believe that the
controls on permissible donations that were introduced in the 2000 Act
are vital to uphold public confidence in the transparency and fairness
of our democracy. A breach of those rules is a serious matter, and must
result in a serious penalty. The amendment appears to downgrade the
seriousness of failing to comply with the requirements in clause 8. I
understand the motivation behind it, which is essentially the same as
that discussed in the previous amendment. We are concerned that if the
amendment were accepted, we would be sending a mixed message about the
importance of the controls on donations. We believe that a fine of
&#163;1,000 would not be a sufficient
deterrent.</div><a name="08112051000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the basis of the reassurances that I give the Committee and on our
willingness to continue considering the matter, I hope that hon.
Members will agree to withdraw their
amendments.</div><a name="08112051000036"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000471"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I thank the Minister for going over the matter
in some detail, and for helpfully setting out the commission&#146;s
criteria, which I will go away and consider. I appreciated him saying
that he was open to a further review, but the area that he is prepared
to consider is quite narrow. We will look carefully at the matter
again. We consider it important that an innocent mistake should not be
caught. As to whether the package and the criteria that has been
mentioned by the Minister are adequate, we will review that in due
course. For the moment, however, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="08112051000037"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

Members&#146; Interests shall be sufficient compliance with the
requirement for registration of the same with the Commission and
registration of such receipt with the Commission shall be sufficient to
meet requirement for registration in the Register of Members&#146;
Interests.</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">(13) The Registrar
of Members&#146; Interests and the Commission shall put in place
arrangements for the sharing of such information as enables them to
give effect to subsection
(12).&#146;.</div><a name="08112051000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">May
I say, Sir Nicholas, what a pleasure it has been to witness the smack
of firm leadership that you have given us whenever you have been in the
Chair?</div>
<a name="08112051000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">All hon.
Members have an interest in the amendment, which is about the
registration of donations and benefits received by Members of
Parliament. Before the commission started work in 2001, we all knew
that we had to register such benefits in the Register of
Members&#146; Interests. Since the commission started work, we have
had to register the same benefit twice, under two regimes with two
formats and two different procedures. Since 2001 hon. Members have
become increasingly frustrated about that and demanded
action.</div>
<a name="08112051000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">Eventually,
Parliament amended the law in the Electoral Administration Act 2006 by
inserting section 59, which says that in future, Members can go back to
registering only in the Register of Members&#146; Interests. The
provision was not brought into effect straight away because the
commission and the House authorities said that they need time to align
their procedures so that the commission could be satisfied that it
could get from the registrar all the information that it currently
collects. The registrar wanted to be clear that the law permitted the
handing over of such information.</div>
<a name="08112051000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is two
years since then, and the provision still has not been brought into
effect. That delay is reprehensible. When Mr. Wardle of the
commission was giving evidence, I asked him whether the law was
sufficient for us to get to the result for which we all thought we were
waiting. He said that it was not. He thinks that there should be an
amendment to the Bill, so I have tabled the amendment. My offering to
the Committee is to say that, finally, we will get to the position that
we thought we would get to in 2006.</div>
<a name="08112051000045"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000473"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Good gracious me, how
succinct.</div>
<a name="08112051000046"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08112051000474"></a><b class="B">Mrs.
Eleanor Laing</b> (Epping Forest) (Con): I thank you for
calling me, Sir Nicholas, and I sincerely apologise to you, the
Committee and the hon. Member for Stafford for not being present when
the amendment was moved. I support, in principle, the direction of the
amendment.</div><a name="08112051000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
my right hon. Friend the Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir George
Young) said on Second Reading, it is an important principle that dual
reporting is unnecessarily bureaucratic and leads to misunderstanding
and confusion. Such reporting is therefore wrong. We 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column386" />Column number: 386</div>have all known for some time that confusion can occur. Conservative
Members have so often said during the passage of the Bill that law that
is not clear is not good. This legislation lacks clarity. There is not
just a lack of clarity now, or a possible lack if the Bill were to
become law. There is already confusion between the 2000 Act, the 2006
Act and the matters that we are
discussing.</div><a name="08112051000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
2000 Act introduced two parallel reporting regimes for hon.
Members&#146; interests. First, we have to report&#151;as is quite
proper&#151;our interests as Members of Parliament to the House of
Commons. In addition, those matters have to be reported to the
commission. It almost goes without saying that that creates confusion,
and that that confusion is significant. That situation was recognised
by the Government, and by all parties in the House, as being wrong, and
therefore the Government rightly proposed section 59 of the 2006 Act,
which was supported by both sides of the House. Its aim was to produce
one route for registration, as my right hon. Friend put it on Second
Reading when he referred
to</div><a name="08112051000412"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;streamlining
and simplifying the process without compromising on
transparency.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>, 20 October 2008;
Vol. 481, c.
96.]</div><a name="08112051000411"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent">That
is what we all want to see. However, section 59 requires commencement
by an order laid by the Secretary of State, and that has not been
forthcoming. Why is that taking so long? We understand, of course, that
the Electoral Commission had reservations about the exact rules laid
down by the House and that discussions have been ongoing between all
parties involved, including the Government and senior Members of the
House of Commons who represent us on such matters, but they have had
three years to work it out. The confusion has continued and has caused
embarrassment to some Members on both sides of the House, who have
innocently and inadvertently made mistakes because of the far too
complicated bureaucracy. That should not happen. Why have the
Government not brought into force section 59 of the 2006 Act? They
would have our support in that. In the meantime, we on the Conservative
Benches support amendment No. 106, so eloquently introduced by the hon.
Member for
Stafford.</div><a name="08112051000432"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.15

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000475"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> I understand the frustration of Committee members,
but I point out to the hon. Lady that we cannot commence section 59 of
the 2006 Act until the Electoral Commission has notified the Secretary
of State that it is satisfied that it has received, from the Register
of Members&#146; Interests, all the information that it is required,
under the 2000 Act, to collect in relation to holders of the relevant
elected office. We agree that the need for MPs to provide different
reports to different bodies is undesirable&#151;it is inefficient,
cumbersome and leads to the sorts of consequences that she
mentioned.</div>
<a name="08112051000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">Discussions
continue between the parties concerned. I have held meetings with the
House authorities and the Electoral Commission. All sides are coming
closer together. They are not absolutely agreed on the best way
forward, but I think they will be very soon. The solution might not
have to be a legislative one; it might be&#151;I say no more than
that&#151;an administrative one. However, we are diligently engaged
in the task, and I hope very much that I can return with the outcome of
those discussions, so that, if necessary, the House will have an
opportunity to consider any necessary solutions. I stress, however,
that we might not need a legislative solution.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column387" />Column number: 387</div><a name="08112051000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the basis
of those reassurances, I hope my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford
will withdraw his
amendment.</div><a name="08112051000052"></a>

Kidney:</b> For once, I think I speak on behalf of all Members
in saying that the present situation is not good enough, and one way or
another it must be resolved on Report. The current situation is making
fools of us all. On 3 July 2006, in a debate on the Electoral
Commission, the hon. Member for Buckingham (John Bercow) asked the hon.
Member for Gosport (Sir Peter Viggers), who speaks in the House on
behalf of the Electoral Commission, whether dual registration posed the
danger of duplication. The hon. Gentleman
replied:</div><a name="08112051000413"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It
is not often that an hon. Member can give total reassurance to a

have just completed our scrutiny of clause 8, which is designed to
improve transparency in systems. The amendment would extend that
transparency to unincorporated organisations. We have had much
discussion and debate&#151;some of it seemingly
interminable&#151;about transparency. The amendment addresses an
omission in clause 8. Although we have amended the clause to set new
monetary thresholds, it requires people to provide information about
the source of donations. Amendment No. 149 does the same thing for
unincorporated associations. I recognise that it may not be perfectly
drafted.</div>
<a name="08112051000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Electoral
Commission, in the paper that it circulated to members of the
Committee, states that the commission sees merit in increased
transparency in this area. It goes on to say that it may be helpful to
introduce greater transparency about those who provide substantial
donations to unincorporated associations. However, it recognises that
that imposes an additional administrative burden on those
organisations, which was the debate we had about clause 8.</div>
<a name="08112051000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
cross-party consensus that there should be greater transparency in the
membership and source of funds through these unincorporated
associations. For example, although he is not in his place, the hon.

seems to be general consensus that that is an area where we need to

&#163;1,000 through unincorporated

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000493"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> We are keen to avoid imposing further
administrative burdens on donors or party officials without a pressing
need to do so. I note that a similar amendment, which did not propose
the same threshold, was tabled but not selected. Although the
commission might support additional transparency, which everyone
probably supports, it is against the amendment, and it is worth putting
that on the record. It states
that</div><a name="08112051000418"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
Commission does not support amendments 7 and 149 which seek to
introduce new reporting requirements for donations from unincorporated
associations. The Commission sees merit in increased transparency in
this area, but any change to the regulatory regime should balance that
against the additional administrative burdens on regulated entities and
on donors. We do not think these amendments strike the right balance,
since they impose sweeping new reporting requirements, going beyond
those applying to e.g. registered companies or trade unions where the
identities of those controlling the organisation are already in the
public domain so do not need to be listed in the donation
report.</div><a name="08112051000419"></a><div class="hs_brev">The
amendments also require details about donors to an association for any
purpose . . . not just those whose donations are political in nature.
Much of this information may be irrelevant and potentially misleading,
since it is unlikely that all the members of and donors to the
organisation will have participated to the decision to make any given
donation. It may be helpful to introduce greater transparency about of
those who provide substantial donations to unincorporated associations
which fund political parties, but the workability of any new
requirements in this area, and the administrative burden associated
with them, would need careful
thought.&#148;</div><a name="08112051000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
agree with those
points.</div><a name="08112051000085"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08112051000494"></a><b class="B">Tony
Lloyd</b> (Manchester, Central) (Lab): It is interesting that
the hon. Gentleman praises anything that the Electoral Commission says
on that. Does he believe that it has done a good job so far on the
issue of transparency with regard to unincorporated associations? It is
a simple question, so I wonder whether he will put it on the
record.</div><a name="08112051000086"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000495"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I am not sure whether it is for me to judge, and
as it is not part of the Bill, it is not a topic on which I have done a
huge amount of preparation. However, we believe that proxy donations
and intentionally using an unincorporated association as an agent are
already covered by PPERA. That threatens to create large volumes of red
tape for the voluntary sector, which could be discouraging for
donations to voluntary organisations and, in turn, to political
parties. We also have general concerns about the focus on transparency
issues for only one small donor sector. There are other donor sectors,
not least the trade unions, that should be looked at in the context of
the whole. We do not think that the focus should be on individual
sectors, but we would be prepared to examine the issue in the
round.</div><a name="08112051000087"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08112051000496"></a><b class="B">David
Howarth</b> (Cambridge) (LD): Earlier, the Minister talked
about consensus being a necessary condition of reforming the area. I
think he is wrong because it tends to give a veto to parties with a
particular interest, and I think that that is another area where we
might be suffering from that problem. I would like to put on record,
however, that I support the amendment. Its intention seems to be
extremely important and useful. Everyone knows that the unincorporated
bodies to which we are referring are organisations such as the Midlands
Industrial Council, which are devices to disguise the identities of
donors. That is what they are invented to do and that is what they have
been doing.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column390" />Column number: 390</div><a name="08112051000088"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08112051000497"></a><b class="B">Martin
Linton</b> (Battersea) (Lab): Is the hon. Gentleman aware that
telephone calls to Coleshill manor, the seat of the Midlands Industrial

suggestion that the Constituency Campaigning Services Board, exactly
the kind of organisation to which he is referring, might have closed
down? Perhaps that is a recognition that those organisations really are
merely a
conduit.</div><a name="08112051000089"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000498"></a>David

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000499"></a>Mr.

serious allegation, which has been put to the Electoral Commission,
and, my understanding is that it has been reviewed and shown not to be
the case. I do not know how the hon. Gentleman gets to make that
allegation, but he might like to back it up a bit
more.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000500"></a>David
Howarth:</b> This is an example of the Electoral Commission
being guilty of naivety. Its response to the hon. Member for
Carmarthen, West and South Pembrokeshire&#146;s amendment is an
illustration of why it is important to have political commissioners.
The idea that we are talking about &#147;voluntary sector
associations&#148;, in the words of the hon. Member for Huntingdon,
as if they are ordinary charities, set up for another purpose, which
happen to give money to political parties, is ridiculous. That is not
what is going on at all. These organisations are, for the most part,
set up to donate money to political parties. They must be scrutinised
with great care, and transparency is of immense importance. This is all
about whether they existed before and had a life prior to their
existence as bodies that donate to political parties. Are they real
organisations? For the most part, I fear that they are
not.</div><a name="08112051000092"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000501"></a>Martin
Linton:</b> May I help the hon. Gentleman by pointing out that
the leader of the Conservative party has said that that shadowy
organisation, which is not answering its telephone, the Constituency
Campaigning Services board, based at Coleshill manor, is
&#147;practically a part&#148; of the Conservative
party?</div><a name="08112051000093"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000502"></a>David
Howarth:</b> That is an interesting description, which
illustrates my point.</div>
<a name="08112051000094"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08112051000503"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Andrew Tyrie</b> (Chichester) (Con): I am a bit astonished by
what the hon. Gentleman is suggesting. He seems to be saying that the
Electoral Commission is a waste of time, that it has fallen down on the
job and that it has not arrived at a reasonable level of transparency.
It has looked into this issue in immense detail and has produced a
thorough and comprehensive rebuttal; unfortunately, I do not have it
with me. The hon. Gentleman&#146;s defence for continuing to make the
allegations seems to be that it has no idea how to do its
job.</div>
<a name="08112051000095"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000504"></a>David
Howarth:</b> I would not go that far, but the views that the
Electoral Commission has expressed about the amendment show a deep
naivety about the nature of the problem that we face. We are not merely
dealing 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column391" />Column number: 391</div>with charitable bodies or voluntary associations that have a separate
life and suddenly happen to give money to political parties, which
should not, therefore, face an administrative burden because it would
get in the way of their other functions. These bodies do not have any
other functions&#151;this is their point. Therefore, it is not
disproportionately burdensome to ask them to keep a record of how much
money they are getting from particular individuals so that they know
what has happened when they pass that money on to political parties.
That is perfectly reasonable given how, for the most part, these
organisations come into
existence.</div><a name="08112051000096"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08112051000505"></a><b class="B">Dr.
Alan Whitehead</b> (Southampton, Test) (Lab): If those
organisations, which appear to have no other function, were to keep a
record, would that not automatically be a reason for them to cease to
exist? Therefore, his suggestion is, perhaps, otiose. Would the hon.
Gentleman reflect on that?</div>
<a name="08112051000097"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000506"></a>David
Howarth:</b> The hon. Gentleman has produced an interesting
reason for passing the amendment. Proxy and non-transparent donations
are to be discouraged. If the amendment discouraged that form of
donation, I would not be too
sorry.</div><a name="08112051000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
point was raised about how the amendment applied to trade unions. As
far as I am aware, trade unions are unincorporated associations, so I
am grateful to the hon. Member for Carmarthen, West and South
Pembrokeshire for tabling an amendment that applies to the unions. The
trade unions are in the unusual position of existing anyway; they are,
in fact, voluntary organisations that would have a life without giving
money to a political party. The question whether that would be a great
burden to them is one that Labour Members are in a better position to
answer than me, but I am sure their answer would be that trade unions
would be willing to bear the burden of the amendment. Since that would
be the only objection, I do not understand why it cannot be
accepted.</div><a name="08112051000099"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000507"></a>Tony
Lloyd:</b> What the hon. Member for Huntingdon said was
interesting. When asked whether he considered that the commission had
done a good job in respect of unincorporated associations, he said that
he did not have time to consider it. However, he was forthright in his
response to the hon. Member for Cambridge when he said that its
examination of the Midlands Industrial Council had been full and
proper.</div><a name="08112051000100"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000508"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The answer to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point
is simple. I was briefed at a later date by one of my hon.
Friends.</div>
<a name="08112051000101"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000509"></a>Tony
Lloyd:</b> You would be the first to agree, Sir Nicholas, that
it is a delight to know that, even though the process is slow, the
Conservative Front Bench learns bit by bit&#151;although, in this
case, perhaps not
enough.</div><a name="08112051000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Cambridge was right to point out that trade unions are
unincorporated associations. He might want to reflect on his original
words that unincorporated associations are set up only for the purpose
of funding. It is clear that trade unions are not 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column392" />Column number: 392</div>set up primarily for that purpose. Nevertheless, he is right that the
trade unions would be caught by the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend
the Member for Carmarthen, West and South Pembrokeshire, which I
support as, among other things, chair of the trade union group of
Labour MPs. The trade unions have nothing to hide in that context, nor
would they want to hide relatively high-value donations. That is a
reasonable position, and it puts the spotlight firmly on organisations
such as the Midlands Industrial Council, which most certainly is set up
only for the purpose of funding one particular political
party.</div><a name="08112051000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
asked about the role of the Electoral Commission because it is obvious
to many people that one of the criticisms of it has been its failure
properly to investigate, even with its powers, organisations such as
the Midlands Industrial Council. That is important if we want to
achieve adequate transparency that reassures members of the general
public that they can know who the funders are, particularly the
high-value funders. Even if the amendment were not optimal, I hope that
my right hon. Friend the Minister will take seriously the need for us
to move rapidly in its direction, which would guarantee that all
high-value donors can be known. I say clearly to the Conservative
party, my party and to the Liberal Democrats that there is nothing
wrong with people acting in a public-spirited way and giving money to
political parties, but it is wrong when that is done covertly and is
designed to prevent the public from being reassured that the money
trail is legitimate and is there simply to enhance the benefits of our
party political
system.</div><a name="08112051000104"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000510"></a>Mr.
Tyrie:</b> Perhaps one or two Labour Members will confirm that
I am not completely out of sorts with what the hon. Gentleman is
saying. I just wonder whether he has thought through the full
implications of his argument. Surely, at the heart of matters, is
whether we think that individuals or institutions have a role in
donations. If we are to move to long-term reform, we must reach the
point at which parties are donated to by those who can vote for them,
and that they are individuals, not organisations, trade unions,
companies or intermediaries such as the one that we are
discussing.</div>
<a name="08112051000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">Even though I
recognise that it would be hugely difficult in a short period for the
Labour party to adjust, does the hon. Gentleman agree that there might
be merit in it thinking over the long term of moving in the direction
of removing all intermediary institutions, including trade unions and
businesses, as well as bodies such as the Midlands Industrial Council,
from the role of funding political parties in the 21st
century?</div><a name="08112051000106"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000511"></a>Tony
Lloyd:</b> The hon. Gentleman has consistently put forward
particular views on these matters. I understand but do not share all of
them. For the record, I do not necessarily believe that intermediary
organisations are wrong, whether they be private companies or
unincorporated associations, as long as it is clear what the flows of
moneys are and who has access to what the public will perceive as
financial influence if those transfers of money are not properly
transparent and properly there to be
seen.</div><a name="08112051000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
can differ about the role of the trade unions in funding my party. I do
not agree with the hon. Gentleman that collective giving is of itself a
bad thing, but it 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column393" />Column number: 393</div>would be a bad thing if the members of a trade union could not dissent
from the political fund, which of course they can do under the law as
it stands. What would be equally wrong with something like an
unincorporated association, even if my party gains from the existence
of such structures, is if a clear audit trail cannot be seen&#151;if
there is not transparency about where the money comes from and who is
seeking to give it&#151;to allow us to elicit at least some sense of
the purpose behind the
giving.</div><a name="08112051000108"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000512"></a>Mr.
Tyrie:</b> I am fascinated by that reply, because it seems to
acknowledge the idea that as long as there is transparency, it is all
right for intermediate bodies such as trade unions and such
institutions or, for that matter, companies to donate money with the
purpose of obtaining influence. The hon. Gentleman used the word
&#147;influence&#148; in his reply to my intervention. Does that
not go to the heart of the perception of the problems with such
institutions and the need for reform to remove concern in the public
mind?</div><a name="08112051000109"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000513"></a>Tony
Lloyd:</b> I honestly do not agree with the hon. Gentleman.
What I sought to say&#151;I will need to read the record to ensure
that what I sought to say is what the words actually say&#151;is that
transparency is necessary so that the public are able to see whether
people are seeking to gain unreasonable influence. We need transparency
so that people are not allowed to draw that conclusion about the
political
process.</div><a name="08112051000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have no objection to the existence of an organisation such as the
Midlands Industrial Council. In a society and democracy such as ours,
it is, at present, part of a legitimate process. What is difficult is
the perception that it is a shadowy organisation whose very existence
is designed to obscure the identity of those who
give.</div><a name="08112051000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not mind people giving to the Conservative party. I encourage them
to give to my own party through the means available. I do not think
that an intermediary body of itself is the problem because, as the hon.
Gentleman will know, my party went through a long and, I accept,
sometimes tortuous process whereby the concept of the collectivisation
of the giving process was necessary historically to set some kind of
balance against the unfair power of money in party politics. That goes
back to the origins of the Labour party. I do not think that my party
needs to run away from that background as if it were somehow
illegitimate or immoral, because it is
neither.</div><a name="08112051000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
the Labour party and the trade unions have to do, as should all
political parties and unincorporated associations, is guarantee that
the public at large and the individuals involved are quite clear on the
question of transparency. That is the spirit that my hon. Friend the
Member for Carmarthen, West and South Pembrokeshire seeks to capture
with the
amendment.</div><a name="08112051000113"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000514"></a>Mr.
Tyrie:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way
so generously. This helpful exchange goes to the heart of some of the
problems. Nobody on the Conservative Benches seeks to alter the
constitutional relationship between the Labour party and the trade
unions. It is only the issue of influence that may be bought by money
that is of legitimate concern in my view and, I believe, in the view of
most Opposition Members. Indeed, it is the public&#146;s concern as
well. The hon. Gentleman has just confirmed again that he did 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column394" />Column number: 394</div>not mean to say what he said, but the record will show what he did
say&#151;we will have to wait and see. He said that we need
transparency to know whether organisations seek to gain an unreasonable
influence over the political process, which suggests that there are
donations for which influence at a reasonable level is gained. I
fundamentally disagree with him. That is the division on the issue. We
do not think it is right for people to be able to buy influence over
the political process, full
stop.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000515"></a>Tony
Lloyd:</b> The hon. Gentleman and I are at one on that. For
example, the question must arise about who funds an unincorporated
association, the Churchill luncheon club, which I believe is a donor to
his constituency, and what their role and ambitions are. After I have
sat down, he might seek to catch your eye, Sir Nicholas, to explain the
role of the Churchill luncheon

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000517"></a>Tony
Lloyd:</b> Indeed. I shall give way if the hon. Gentleman can
tell us who the donors to the Churchill luncheon club
are.</div><a name="08112051000117"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000518"></a>Mr.

about&#151;</div><a name="08112051000118"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000519"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I am not much liking this. There is too
much nitty-gritty about the constituencies of individual Members of
Parliament. May we perhaps concentrate on the matter in the same way in
which it was introduced&#151;succinctly and to the
point?</div><a name="08112051000119"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000520"></a>Tony
Lloyd:</b> Alas, Sir Nicholas, I was tempted by others. As
often happens in this big old world, temptation leads us in the wrong
direction. I will try to correct the error of my ways henceforth and
bring my remarks to a conclusion. I apologise, in a sense, to the hon.
Member for Chichester, because your ruling means that I cannot give him
the opportunity to respond. As a matter of courtesy, I would have liked
to give him that
opportunity.</div><a name="08112051000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me simply say this: in our political system, it is right that
unreasonable influence is something we all deplore. Inevitably, the
public have suspicions. They have had suspicions about my party in the
recent past when flows of money arose that we have not been able
properly to account for. As a long-standing member of my party, I
regret and deplore that, and I hope that hon. Members from all
political backgrounds would do the
same.</div><a name="08112051000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
way to get round the matter is not to get rid of the unincorporated
association&#151;whether at constituency or national level&#151;but
to ensure that we have the transparency necessary to reassure the
public that the exchange is legitimate and not one that seeks to
acquire unfair and unreasonable influence. That is what the Bill ought
to be
about.</div><a name="08112051000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman and I disagree about the exact conclusions, but it might
well be that we agree with the sentiments behind what my hon. Friend
the Member for Carmarthen, West and South Pembrokeshire is seeking to
do.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column395" />Column number: 395</div><a name="08112051000123"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000521"></a>Dr.
Whitehead:</b> For the purposes of clarity, can my hon. Friend
explain the point on the &#163;1,000 of donations referred to in the
amendment? A distinction appears to be made between the results of, for
example, a lunch where a number of people have contributed some money
in relation to that lunch, which is collected and donated in a
convenient way, as opposed to an arrangement whereby a number of
people, for the purposes of hiding the origin of their donation, donate
large sums of money, which are gathered
together?</div><a name="08112051000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">Indeed,
if the origins of those donations were recorded, there would be no
point in having intermediary activity at all and the organisation
concerned might well cease to exist. As, I think, my hon. Friend the
Member for Battersea suggested, one organisation that might be in that
category may have recently ceased to exist&#151;perhaps in
anticipation of something that might happen in the
Committee.</div><a name="08112051000125"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000522"></a>Tony
Lloyd:</b> I shall bring my remarks to a conclusion by
exploring the line of argument put forward by my hon. Friend. Of
course, he is
right.</div><a name="08112051000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">At
the heart of the amendment is the issue of collective giving at
relatively modest levels&#151;for example, the kind of thing that
might take place at a luncheon club. Such a club may well be legitimate
and beyond suspicion, and I am happy to state that. That also applies
to a trade union. I know of no trade union where an individual gives at
the level of &#163;1,000, but certainly, if the union is giving
collectively, the question about transparency ought to catch
it.</div>
<a name="08112051000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">The matter
before us is the perception that all political parties have gained from
shadowy organisations whose purpose is to prevent the transparency that
the amendment seeks. That is why I strongly support the spirit behind
the
amendment.</div><a name="08112051000128"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000523"></a>Mr.
Tyrie:</b> On a point of order, Sir Nicholas. I seek your
guidance on how I might be able to respond to the allegation made about
my constituency. I completely agree&#151;even if I quietly
disagree&#151;with the point that you made from the Chair, but I
would be grateful if you told me how I might put the record straight. I
do not want to create undue fuss, but I do not think the matter can be
left
entirely.</div><a name="08112051000129"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000524"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I think that there will be a debate on the
schedule as a whole. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman&#151;briefly and
succinctly&#151;may correct the record
then.</div><a name="08112051000130"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000525"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> The extent and quality our debate on the clause
demonstrate the debt that the Committee owes to my hon. Friend the
Member for Carmarthen, West and South Pembrokeshire for tabling the
amendment. I understand and share the concern expressed on Second
Reading and in today&#146;s debate that we need to do more to promote
greater transparency of donations from unincorporated associations. We
must ensure that such structures are not used to conceal the ultimate
source of donations to
parties.</div><a name="08112051000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">Unincorporated
associations have given money to all the parties represented here
today: the Labour Finance and Industry Group has given money to my
party; the Midlands Industrial Council, as we have heard, is a
long-standing donor to the Conservative party; and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column396" />Column number: 396</div>there are historic Liberal clubs, often registered as unincorporated
associations, that give money to the Liberal party. The hon. Member for
Perth and North Perthshire is not present, but if he were I would
remind him that that the Scottish women&#146;s independence fund
trust has donated money to the Scottish National
party.</div><a name="08112051000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is nothing inherently wrong about such associations contributing. Of
course, it is a matter of consensus that such contributions should not
be used to purchase influence&#151;that is abhorrent. The only people
who should have influence over political parties are the voters,
through exercise of the vote. That is the source of authority and power
in our democracy, nothing else. Everyone is agreed on that.</div>
<a name="08112051000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">The point
that my hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Central made is
important and I am surprised that the hon. Member for Chichester should
take issue with it. Transparency is the best guarantor for everybody
that such influence is not purchased in our society, and above all that
everybody in our democracy can see that it is not being purchased. It
is not the existence of unincorporated associations that matters; what
matters is that they should be transparent. We have to recognise that
there is enough evidence to show that they are not as transparent as we
would wish.</div>
<a name="08112051000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
provisions in clause 8 and schedule 3, which apply to unincorporated
associations as they do to other donors, already address some of the
concerns about transparency, which I share with other hon. Members
here. There is a lot of cross-party agreement on the importance of
transparency.</div><a name="08112051000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
appreciate that there are continuing concerns and I am willing to
consider actively&#151;indeed, we are considering
actively&#151;what more we can do. Again, I would prefer to move
forward on a consensual basis, as on many areas of the Bill. One way we
could promote greater openness about donations from unincorporated
associations would be to require them to declare the names and
addresses of their members and donors. We must be certain that we are
not putting undue burdens on them and bear in mind the need for
flexibility and proportionality, but we are considering options to that
effect.</div><a name="08112051000136"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08112051000526"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Andrew Turner</b> (Isle of Wight) (Con): The Minister has
suggested two groups: those listed as members and those who might be
listed as donors. Is there a reason for suggesting the first
group?</div><a name="08112051000137"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000527"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> Yes, there is, because we need to be quite clear
about the source of the donations. There are issues about how exactly
we would frame any amendment that might be considered necessary. I will
resist the hon. Gentleman&#146;s invitation to go further at this

tabling an amendment of our
own.</div><a name="08112051000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
ask my hon. Friend the Member for Carmarthen, West and South
Pembrokeshire to withdraw the amendment. I know that the Liberal
Democrats are anxious to reach their amendments, which are further down
the amendment paper, and I do not want to detain the Committee. I can
assure the Committee that we are continuing actively to examine these
issues. We recognise the concerns and feel that there probably

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000529"></a>Martin
Linton:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 8, in
schedule 3, page 34, line 4, at
beginning insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(A1) In
paragraph 1 of Schedule 7 to the 2000 Act (prohibition on accepting
donations from impermissible donors), at the end of sub-paragraph
(7)(c) there is inserted &#147;, or a compliance officer appointed by
the holder of a relevant elective office to act on his
behalf.&#148;&#146;.</div><a name="08112051000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not wish to detain the Committee for long, because there are
weightier items in other clauses to discuss. This is a little amendment
about the appointment of compliance officers. Political parties already
have compliance officers. Sir Nicholas has one&#151;to judge from
today&#146;s Question Time. I gather from the hon. Member for
Congleton (Ann Winterton) that there are regular breakfast meetings
with your compliance officer. Candidates have compliance officers
called agents, which has been written into law for more than 100 years,
but nominees for party office do not, and the amendment suggests that
they, too, should be able to have compliance
officers.</div><a name="08112051000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Electoral Commission commentary supports the amendment in principle. It
would add to the list of relevant donees, which we all are, the
words</div><a name="08112051000420"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a
compliance officer appointed by the holder of a relevant elective
office&#148;,</div><a name="08112051000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">as
well as five more
words&#151;</div><a name="08112051000421"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to
act on his
behalf&#148;&#151;</div><a name="08112051000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">but
the Electoral Commission does not agree with those, as it believes they
would pass the legal responsibility to the compliance
officer.</div><a name="08112051000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
can assure the Committee that it is the intention of the amendment not
that the compliance officer should take over all the legal obligations
of a nominee or candidate, but that those should be shared with the
office holder. I do not know whether those words carry that
implication, but if they do they should be left out. The amendment
would allow nominees to elected party office to delegate to a
compliance officer some of the responsibility to make
declarations&#151;which, the Committee has heard constantly, has
become quite onerous&#151;without passing on the legal responsibility
for ensuring that that had
happened.</div><a name="08112051000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">PPERA
also relates to internal party elections. Similar legislation in Canada
provides an elaborate structure of limits and subsidies for nominees as
much as for candidates. Although many elections to party office are
internal, some are wider. We all know circumstances in which an
election to party office could be to choose the Prime Minister, as
happened only last year. That was an uncontested election, so many of
the issues did not arise, but it is not difficult to imagine
circumstances in which they would. The electorate in a party election
can be 5 million or 6 million, making it the largest election in the
country, although that probably does not quite beat the Mayor of
London, who has an electorate of  7 million, but it very nearly
does.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column398" />Column number: 398</div><a name="08112051000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">So, elections
for party office can be major events, and the candidate will have a
huge burden of responsibility&#151;he or she has to take personal
responsibility for ensuring that every donation is declared. To take
final responsibility is one thing, but not to be able to delegate in
any way, to anyone else, creates enormous
difficulties.</div><a name="08112051000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall not go over the factors involved any more, because they are well
understood by everyone in the room&#151;equally, the Electoral
Commission is not raising any opposition in principle&#151;and I
commend them to the Minister. I hope that he can add the words
&#147;or a compliance officer&#148; to the list of regulated
donees.</div><a name="08112051000150"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000530"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I shall be brief as I am interested to hear what
the Minister has to say. I wonder whether the amendment would make it
more complicated to work out who had the burden of responsibility.
Otherwise, we are
open-minded.</div><a name="08112051000435"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2
pm</div><a name="08112051000151"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000531"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> I have sympathy for the intention behind the
amendment. I understand why there is interest in such a measure, but I
ask the Committee to consider a number of points before we move
forward. First, we should consider whether, for those who are not
minded to appoint such an officer, it might be burdensome to require
them to do so. We need to be clear whether the provision could be
permissive.</div>
<a name="08112051000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
nothing in the Act as it stands to prevent a regulated donee from
appointing a compliance officer, but that person would have no
statutory basis. In that sense, if we were to provide in the Bill that
a person may appoint a compliance officer&#151;a permissive
provision&#151;that would serve primarily as a useful clarification
of the existing legal position.</div>
<a name="08112051000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, if
we accepted the provision, we would need to consider whether such an
amendment would extend to Members of this Parliament alone or to other
holders of relevant elective office within schedule 7. A holder of a
relevant elective office would include a member of the European
Parliament elected in the United Kingdom, a member of the devolved
institutions, a member of any local authority apart from a parish or
community council, the Mayor of London or any other mayor elected under
the Local Government Act 2000. Consideration and consultation on this
point would be necessary before the provision became part of the Bill,
although we would not necessarily foresee any problems coming out of
that
consultation.</div><a name="08112051000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thirdly,
the amendment as drafted would not achieve its desired effect. Rather,
it would be add &#147;compliance officer&#148; to the list of
regulated donees set out in  paragraph 1(7)(c) of schedule 7
and would thereby result in regulating donations to compliance
officers. I do not think that that is the intention of the amendment,
but that would be its effect. For that reason alone, I must resist it.
However, following the consultation that I mentioned, I am happy to
consider tabling at a later stage of the Bill a similar provision that
would achieve the principle underlying the amendment, if there is
sufficient agreement from the Committee to do
so.</div><a name="08112051000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
for the purposes of clarity, I should point out to the Committee that
the appointment of a compliance officer would not, as I think the
amendment intends, absolve the donee of responsibility for any breach
of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column399" />Column number: 399</div>the regulations. Ultimate responsibility would depend on the
circumstances of each case and it could rest with both or either the
donee or compliance officer. That reflects the approach taken under the
Representation of the People Act 1983 in relation to candidates and
their agents. Were we to bring forward a Government amendment to make
it clear that these appointments could be made for regulated donees, we
would not depart from that principle.</div>
<a name="08112051000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">So, bringing
all those different points together, if it is clear that there is
agreement to move forward and introduce a measure that achieves the
intention behind the amendment, we will endeavour to do so. We will
consult and consider further the impact of the proposed amendment on
all officers whom it might affect. We would have to consider the
technical and legal matters as well. I am prepared to take the matter
forward and to consider it seriously. Bearing that in mind, I hope that
the amendment will be withdrawn.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000532"></a>Martin

donees, but Cross-Bench Members, who are of no party, are not. I would
like an explanation. We have three types of peers, including some
hereditary ones and life ones&#151;</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000536"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for moving the
amendment, which allowed the hon. Member for Chichester, from a
sedentary position, to make the case admirably and succinctly for
reform of the House of Lords, for which I am grateful. I hope all
members of the Committee agree on that.</div>
<a name="08112051000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">As my hon.
Friend pointed out, the amendment would amend schedule 7 to PPERA, such
that the holder of an elective office would include a Member of the
House of Lords as well as a Member of the House of Commons. Members of
the House of Lords would therefore become subject to controls on
donations contained in the 2000 Act. As my hon. Friend pointed out,
many peers are already subject to the schedule 7 controls by virtue of
the fact that they are party members. Therefore, as he observed, the
effect of the amendment would be felt only by those with no party
affiliation, such as Cross-Benchers and bishops.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column400" />Column number: 400</div><a name="08112051000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand
the intention behind the amendment. As my hon. Friend knows, we are
planning to bring forward shortly radical reform of the House of Lords
and the way it is constituted. That has been about 100 years in the
making. We are on the verge, I believe, of cross-party consensus on
that. I look for nods around the Committee and see assent from all
parts. This is pertinent, Sir Nicholas. I am sticking to the clause. We
will shortly be introduce further proposals for
reform.</div><a name="08112051000166"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000537"></a>Mr.
Tyrie:</b> Will the Minister at least consider and, I hope,
agree that whatever measure is proposed for reform of the House of
Lords, it should require that whoever currently sits in the House of
Lords becomes a new type of peer, one type of peer, which would satisfy
the concern underlying the
clause?</div><a name="08112051000167"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000538"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. That question is outside the scope of the
schedule. If it were something to do with donations, it would have been
in order. The classification of peers is quite another
matter.</div><a name="08112051000168"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000539"></a>Mr.
Tyrie:</b> May I complete my intervention by rephrasing it
slightly? Since we have established that different categories of peers
have different donation requirements, and since we have agreed in
principle that it might be possible to put peers on a similar basis,
might that not be the simplest way of addressing the concerns of the
hon. Member for Carmarthen, West and South Pembrokeshire who tabled the
amendment?</div><a name="08112051000169"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000540"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Very briefly,
Minister.</div><a name="08112051000170"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000541"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> I am grateful for your indulgence, Sir Nicholas. I
shall wrap up my answer to the intervention by addressing the purpose
of the probing nature of the amendment. I am not sure where the problem
exists. Presumably, those peers were excluded from the scope of the
2000 Act precisely because they are not elected and, as such, they
would be unlikely to receive political donations. That is not a problem
of which we have been made aware. But, most importantly, there is no
point legislating for a problem of whose existence we are not aware and
which, as I said, will shortly be resolved. When the House comes to
consider how a reformed House of Lords will be constituted, that will
be the proper time to examine donations, Members and the reporting
requirements, because then that will be pertinent. I hope my hon.
Friend the Member for Carmarthen, West and South Pembrokeshire will
therefore ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="08112051000171"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000543"></a>Mr.
Tyrie:</b> I shall be brief. I am grateful for the opportunity
to answer the allegation about the Churchill luncheon club, which is a
group of people who come together to have lunch, for which they pay
&#163;20 to &#163;30, and &#163;5 profit, if we are lucky, is
made per person per lunch. The money slowly accumulates over two or
three years, and once every few years a relatively small donation is
made to the Bognor association or to the Chichester association. The
last donation to my association was,  I think, a few thousand
pounds&#151;&#163;2,000 or so, although I cannot remember exactly
how much&#151;which was made some time in the early 2000s, perhaps
2001 or 2002.  I wonder whether the hon. Member for Manchester,
Central feels that there is anything untoward or concerning about
that.</div><a name="08112051000187"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000544"></a>Mrs.
Laing:</b> Does my hon. Friend consider that it might have
occurred to the hon. Member for Manchester, Central that, had the
luncheon club to which my hon. Friend refers wished to give the
impression that it had nothing to do with the Conservative party, it
would not have chosen to call itself after Sir Winston
Churchill?</div>
<a name="08112051000188"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000545"></a>Hon.
Members:</b><b class="B"> </b>Missing the
point!</div><a name="08112051000189"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000546"></a>Mr.
Tyrie:</b> I entirely agree with my hon. Friend. Hon. Members
on the Government Benches say that she is missing the point, so let us
find out what point we are
missing.</div><a name="08112051000190"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000547"></a>Tony
Lloyd:</b> For clarity, I was not one of those who said that
the hon. Lady is missing the point. I know that she often does, but it
is not for me to comment on that
now.</div><a name="08112051000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the hon. Gentleman examines what I said a little earlier, he will see
that I said that the low value unincorporated association of the kind
that he describes is without stain on its character. I do not wish to
cast doubt on its purpose or on the probity of those involved. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column402" />Column number: 402</div>It is exactly that sort of thing that benefits from the transparency
that I am arguing for. I was arguing, as I think the hon. Gentleman now
concedes, that such collective mechanisms for giving are legitimate, as
long as we know what they are for, who takes part and what the
mechanisms of the financial transfer are. That is legitimate. I am
happy to say to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s friends and colleagues,
through him, that I cast no doubts whatever on anything other than
their public spiritedness in seeking to enhance the political
process.</div><a name="08112051000436"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.15

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000548"></a>Mr.
Tyrie:</b> I am grateful for that assurance. I am just left
wondering why it was raised in the beginning, and why it has been
raised on the Floor of the House on more than one occasion.</div>
<a name="08112051000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to
make one other point of substance in the debate on the schedule. The
Minister and several hon. Gentlemen, particularly the hon. Member for
Manchester, Central, suggested that transparency was a sufficient
condition for sorting out the problems of public perception in this
area. Transparency is a necessary, but not a sufficient condition. Was
it enough to dispel the impression that honours had been bought in the
1980s when captains of industry appeared to get them because they came
from companies that quite transparently had made large donations? I do
not think that it was enough. Was it enough to dispel the impression
that Bernie Ecclestone&#146;s donation, declared at &#163;1
million, had some influence on whether a ban on tobacco advertising was
enforced on the industry of which he was such a prominent member?
Transparency is not enough. A necessary condition for cleaning up the
area must come in two parts: a cap on donations and the removal of
intermediary institutions, whatever their
type.</div>
<a name="08112051000194"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000549"></a>Mr.

on clause 8 and the consequential changes, so I will not detain the
Committee for long.</div>
<a name="08112051000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that I
was not suggesting that transparency was a sufficient condition. I
agree with the hon. Gentleman that it is a necessary condition, but it
is not the only condition that is needed. I do not necessarily agree
with his entire prescription, but that is for another day. As I have
said, we have largely debated the matter under clause 8, so I hope that
the Committee will agree that schedule 3 should stand part of the
Bill.</div><a name="08112051000196"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

following amendments: No. 183, in
clause 9, page 8, line 21, after
first &#145;the&#146;, insert &#145;party or
its&#146;.</div><a name="08112051000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">No.

<div class="Column"><a name="Column403" />Column number: 403</div><a name="08112051000201"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000552"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The clause proposes to insert a defence into
section 56 of PPERA to excuse the party treasurer from liability for a
criminal offence under section 56(3). Section 56(3) requires the
treasurer of a party to return such a donation or to pay an equivalent
amount back to the donee. The offence arises from a failure to return
donations from donors considered impermissible under section 54(2) and
attaches to both the party and the party treasurer.</div>
<a name="08112051000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
tabled a series of probing amendments. Amendment No. 182 would remove
the need for &#147;all reasonable steps&#148; in proposed new
section 56(3A). By removing the word &#147;all&#148; in subsection
(a), the requirement becomes more practical. Requiring reasonable steps
is one thing, but requiring &#147;all reasonable steps&#148; is
quite another. The exhaustive nature of the &#147;all&#148;
requirement imposes an unduly high burden on parties and treasurers. In
essence, they must second guess all the possible routes of verification
that the commission could come up with.</div>
<a name="08112051000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">Local
treasurers are not professionals. They are often volunteers who help
out of a sense of civic duty. To require them to take &#147;all
reasonable steps&#148; seems unreasonable to us. The requirement of
reasonableness, as set out in the clause and in many other pieces of
legislation on any number of different subjects, applies the so-called
reasonable man test to any given set of circumstances. Called on to
adjudicate on disputed behaviour, the courts should ask what a
reasonable man would have done. That should be
adequate.</div><a name="08112051000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 183 and 184 would amend proposed new section 56(3A) of PPERA as
set out in the clause. The section covers the party&#146;s belief as
well as that of the treasurer and states that such belief must be
reasonable. Amendment No. 184 seeks to rerun the arguments in favour of
the inclusion of a test of reasonableness, where the opinions of
individuals form the crux of the section in question. The need for
objectivity as the yardstick against which to measure that belief where
it has given rise to dispute, is important to ensure fairness and
safeguard individuals from arbitrary penalties.</div>
<a name="08112051000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
183 would insert the word &#147;party&#148; alongside &#147;the
treasurer&#148; in subsection (b). That is included in proposed new
section (3A), and is perhaps a drafting oversight on the part of the
Government. As it stands, only the treasurer must believe the donor to
be a permissible donor. That is odd because the reasonable steps
verification requirement in subsection (a) is imposed on both party and
treasurer.</div>
<a name="08112051000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I
understand it, the party would currently be able to take reasonable
steps to verify whether a donor is permissible, and leave it at that.
Furthermore, it could suggest that in such situations, the treasurer
must believe the donor to be permissible, despite not necessarily
having undertaken the verification. That seems confusing and the
amendment has been tabled in an attempt to clarify what is required by
the people involved, and to ask the Minister to explain the drafting of
the provision.</div>
<a name="08112051000207"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000553"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> I appreciate the intention behind the amendments.
They seek to clarify important points of detail and I am happy to
respond. Amendment No. 182 would downgrade the requirement on regulated
persons to prove that they have taken &#147;all reasonable
steps&#148; and to claim that as a defence. Instead, it would require

<div class="Column"><a name="Column404" />Column number: 404</div>them to take only &#147;reasonable steps&#148;. In our view, that
would undermine the important requirement to take &#147;all
reasonable steps&#148; found in section 56 of PPERA. It would mean
that having taken some&#151;but not all&#151;reasonable steps could
be used as a defence. That would create a mismatch between the
obligation in the 2000 Act and the protection that should properly
result should it be fulfilled.</div>
<a name="08112051000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">Section 56
(1) of the 2000 Act imposes the requirement to take &#147;all
reasonable steps&#148; to verify that a donation can be accepted. If
that obligation is fulfilled, and if the party still feels that it is
entitled to accept the donation, there would be no offence if it turns
out later to have been wrong. To allow some protection if the
obligation is only partially fulfilled does not make sense. Indeed, it
may result in less rigorous efforts to comply with the requirements to
ascertain the identity and permissibility of donors.</div>
<a name="08112051000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
requirement in section 56 means that parties are under an obligation to
ensure that they take all reasonable steps to verify the identity and
permissibility of donors. Amendment No. 182 would devalue that by
establishing an easier defence. &#147;Reasonable&#148; is the key
word. &#147;All reasonable steps&#148; does not mean that all steps
that could possibly be taken, should be. We are concerned about the
amendment, not least because it would send the wrong signal about the
importance of compliance.</div>
<a name="08112051000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
183 would mean that a decision on the permissibility or otherwise of a
donation could be made by the party as a distinct entity, as well as by
the party&#146;s treasurer. It is unclear how it could be proved that
the party as a collection of members believed something, but that is
what the amendment would allow. We believe that the provision is
workable only if it refers to an individual&#146;s belief and the
treasurer is the obvious individual in that respect.</div>
<a name="08112051000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
would not expose the treasurer to any wider liability. It simply makes
it clear that it is his or her belief that is important in a case where
all reasonable steps have been taken, and that there is a subsequent
question about whether it was believed that the donation should
lawfully be accepted. For those reasons, I do not believe that the
amendment would work.</div>
<a name="08112051000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not
fully grasp the purpose behind amendment No. 184. A reasonable belief
may be harder to prove than a simple, subjective one and that makes the
defence more difficult to satisfy. In that situation, requiring a
reasonable belief to be shown would be unduly burdensome, and it is
therefore unnecessary. It is hard to imagine an unreasonable belief
being reached if all reasonable steps have been taken to ascertain the
permissibility or identity of a donor. Therefore, we are not sure that
the amendment adds much. In the absence of clarity as to the rationale
for the amendment&#151;which potentially makes the defence easier
while the other amendments in the group have the opposite
effect&#151;we would resist
it.</div><a name="08112051000213"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000554"></a>Mr.
Tyrie:</b> I would be grateful if the Minister guessed at what
his own test of reasonableness would translate into, in time or cost
per case. That would give us a sense of what we are talking about. If
someone could show that he had put in that amount of time, reasonably
and intelligently, would that constitute a
defence?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column405" />Column number: 405</div><a name="08112051000214"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000555"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> So far, in these lengthy proceedings, I have
resisted all temptation to give specific examples, and I will do so
even at this late stage. The hon. Gentleman knows that every situation
is different, and it would be wrong to give any indication otherwise.
He is well aware of the consequences of my doing so, and so he will
forgive me if I resist. I am happy to give way again, but he will not
tempt
me.</div><a name="08112051000215"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000556"></a>Mr.
Tyrie:</b> Is the Minister aware of the impact
assessment&#146;s own assessment that &#163;5 per case might cover
it?</div><a name="08112051000216"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000557"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> Of course I am aware of that. We have already
discussed it in the Committee. I will not be tempted down that route.
We have made a general statement, and have made a perfectly reasonable
guess about what the amount might be. The hon. Gentleman asks for
specific examples in specific cases and, as I have said, I will not be
tempted down that route. However, I hope that I have given enough
clarification to encourage the hon. Member for Huntingdon to withdraw
the
amendments.</div><a name="08112051000217"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000558"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> That was an interesting debate on
reasonableness. I listened to the Minister talk about
&#147;all&#148; reasonable processes; I would have thought that if
something is reasonable, it is reasonable. I am still not sure why
&#147;all&#148; is needed. I shall go away and think about that
further.</div><a name="08112051000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the individual and the party, I agree that belief can attach only to an
individual. I do not dispute that. My issue is a drafting one. One part
of the clause refers to the individual, and another to the individual
and the party. That might be a consistency issue, and the Minister may
wish to look at it in due course. On that basis, I beg to ask leave to
withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="08112051000219"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000561"></a>David
Howarth:</b> The amendment is to the new defence to which the
hon. Member for Huntingdon referred, and would exclude from the scope
of that defence the effect of new clause 22. The heart of the debate is
therefore the new clause, and it will become obvious why the new
defence should not apply to it.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column406" />Column number: 406</div><a name="08112051000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new clause
simply aims to exclude Members of the House of Lords from giving
donations to political parties. In the future, the House of Lords may
become an elected body, and its Members would become parliamentary
electors again. They are not parliamentary electors now, but they could
be in the future, at which point, my proposal would have to be
reconsidered. Nevertheless, in the interim period, the purpose of the
new clause is to exclude donations from Members of the other

new clause could be interpreted more radically, although that was not
the intention of myself or my hon. Friend the Member for Argyll and
Bute when we tabled it. However, it is a legitimate interpretation that
will interest the hon. Member for Chichester, and would make it the
single most unpopular new clause ever proposed to a Bill dealing with
party funding. Under this more radical interpretation, the new clause
would exclude donations from all companies, trade unions,
unincorporated associations and trusts, which would destroy the
financial base of all three main parties. That is not the intention,
but it might be useful to discuss that
point.</div><a name="08112051000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">During
the stand part debate on schedule 3, the hon. Gentleman said that one
of his criteria for cleaning up politics&#151;another was a donation
cap&#151;was that donations from all intermediate bodies should be
got rid of, which is the case in other jurisdictions in the world, such
as Canada, I believe, and certain parts of the United States. It is
worthwhile thinking why we should not adopt the same policy, at least
as a
goal.</div><a name="08112051000226"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000563"></a>David
Howarth:</b> I am sorry, but the hon. Gentleman misheard me.
Corporate donations of all types are not allowed in those
jurisdictions, and under one interpretation, new clause 22 would have
the same effect. The argument against such a system is that it would
require great dollops of state funding for political parties&#151;the
Minister made the same argument against a donation cap&#151;which
would not be acceptable to the public in present, or any,
circumstances. But is that really the case? Should we not set out a
long-term goal, perhaps with a date or a power for the Secretary of
State to introduce an order with that radical effect, and say to
parties, &#147;You have a certain amount of time to sort yourselves
out, because we are moving to a system of funding radically different
from the one that we have now&#148;? In that interim period, some
state funding might be necessary. My party has always been more in
favour of state funding than I have, but that could be a requirement,
although it would not be necessary to have vast state funding of
political parties forever.</div>
<a name="08112051000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">The campaigns
in the United States that have just been completed used a very
different model of party funding that we could not introduce in this
country now&#151;I agree with that&#151;but if all parties knew
that eventually we would have to move to such a system, we would all do
it. That is similar to what happened in Canada where the four main
parties were dramatically affected by the reforms. The Liberal
party&#151;the equivalent 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column407" />Column number: 407</div>of my party&#151;was dependent on large donations, and the New
Democrats were dependent on trade union funding. The Conservatives and
their predecessors were rather less dependent on big donations than the
Liberals, but there was a similar
problem.</div>
<a name="08112051000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">All three
parties in Canada have now adapted to a radically different, far more
restrictive and individual system. It seems to me that we should be
thinking about doing that here and weaning ourselves off the way we do
things now, because it produces, rather than public confidence,
intermittent scandals and, more than that, long-term, low-level
distrust of the political class, so we have to think about radical
reform.</div><a name="08112051000230"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000564"></a>Martin
Linton:</b> The hon. Gentleman forgets the fourth party in
Canada, the Bloc Qu(c)b(c)cois, which was the origin of that
policy simply because it did not get funding from trade unions or
business but invented what they called le financement populaire to do
away with all business funding.</div>
<a name="08112051000231"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000565"></a>David
Howarth:</b> I am tempted to answer the hon. Gentleman,
&#147;C&#146;est exact.&#148; That is an interpretation of new
clause 22 that I did not intend, but it is a possible interpretation
and I hope that the hon. Gentleman and other members will make clear
their views on what the long-term goal should be and their support for
the idea of moving away from institutional funding
entirely.</div><a name="08112051000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
original intention in tabling new clause 22 was to raise the question
of whether it is proper for Members of the House of Lords to be donors
to political parties. All parties represented here&#151;obviously the
Scottish National party would be in a different
position&#151;regularly receive donations from Members of the House
of Lords, which can be substantial, and in certain cases very
substantial. I do not want to cast any aspersions on Members of their
lordships&#146; House at all.</div>
<a name="08112051000233"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000566"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Is the hon. Gentleman saying that people can
give money before they are made Members of the House of Lords but not
after?</div><a name="08112051000234"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000567"></a>David
Howarth:</b> The hon. Gentleman raises a point that I will get
to later, because that is at the heart of the intention behind the new
clause. That is what will change the nature of donations to political
parties by people who later become
lords.</div><a name="08112051000235"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000568"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I am trying to understand where the hon.
Gentleman is coming from. Presumably he is trying to stop money being
related to peerages, but is he suggesting under his solution that
people would have to give their money up front rather than
afterwards?</div>
<a name="08112051000236"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000569"></a>David
Howarth:</b> I will get to that point later, but I think that
the hon. Gentleman is thinking about that the wrong way round. He needs
to think about the question from the point of view of the political
parties and whether they would want major donors to be nominated to the
House of Lords, were the new clause to be adopted. I will get to that
clause in a moment.</div>
<a name="08112051000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not want
to cast aspersions on those of their lordships who make donations, but
the question is whether an individual, who already has great access and
influence over politics by virtue of their appointment to the
legislature under this extraordinary system that we 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column408" />Column number: 408</div>have, should have the additional opportunity to influence the political
process via donations, and that is a question that we ought to raise.
It is a question of perception.</div>
<a name="08112051000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">I fully
accept that many of their lordships who give donations do so because of
their desire to further the causes that they believe in, and that is
true of their lordships in all three parties. As the hon. Member for
Huntingdon hinted, if we are talking about the problem raised by the
hon. Member for Chichester about captains of industry who gave large
donations to the Conservative party and then miraculously appeared in
the House of Lords, this new clause on the face of it does not have
much to do with that. They had given their donations and then appeared
later, so no further advantage of that sort could be looked for. There
is, however, the subsidiary question of ministerial office. Again, this
is entirely a question of perception but Members of the House of Lords
are eligible for ministerial office in a way in which ordinary members
of the public are not. That might be another reason for restricting
donations from them.</div>
<a name="08112051000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me turn
to the point raised by the hon. Member for Huntingdon. How does this
new clause affect the serious problem of perception&#151;in some
cases perhaps beyond that&#151;that large donations lead to
ennoblement, to becoming a Member of the House of Lords? The answer is
simple. Imagine a political party&#151;not one of those
present&#151;that found itself with a very generous donor who was
giving that party large amounts of money. The rule&#151;new clause 22
having passed&#151;would be that if that person were to be appointed
to the House of Lords they would no longer be able to make these large
donations to that party, so what interest would there be for that party
to suggest that that person should become a Member of Lords? It would
remove any incentive that a party had for making its large donors
peers. It would introduce into the system an interference in the way in
which this has been done and talked about for a long time, going back,
I confess, to the days of David Lloyd George.</div>
<a name="08112051000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">David Lloyd
George&#146;s approach was based on his view that he did not like
aristocrats and if he could do anything to discredit them by selling
peerages that was all right by him. But the problem has carried on
beyond that for a long time. We are still in a position where members
of the public are quite cynical about what happens in politics. People
frequently mention to me the fact that of the people who have recently
given &#163;1 million to the Labour party only two are not
Members of the House of Lords. One of those is J. K. Rowling and I am
sure she does not want to be. Nevertheless, only one of the others is
not. We need to look for ways of getting out of that problem. We have
looked at strengthening legislation, directly saying there should be no
sale of honours. That legislation has serious weaknesses, as anyone who
has tried to raise a possible problem with the police has
found.</div>
<a name="08112051000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
suggesting a different approach aimed at the incentives the parties
have in the first place to raise their donors to the peerage. That is
the central intention of new clause 22. It raises a second point. There
might or might not be an opportunity later to discuss this point
directly under new clause 10, but new clause 22 does refer to new
clause 10, and I am sure it is legitimate to discuss the issues raised
there in this debate. The issue is whether someone who is not a
permissible donor should be allowed to use the corporate form to evade
the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column409" />Column number: 409</div>regulation that makes them a non-permissible donor. New clause 22 says
that, with regard to this particular form of impermissible donor, that
will not be allowed. It refers to new clause 10, which does the same
thing for a different class of impermissible donor, namely foreign
donors.</div><a name="08112051000438"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.45
pm</div><a name="08112051000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
goes back to the debate on unincorporated associations, although here
we are talking about corporated bodies. The question is, should it be
allowed to use the corporate form to make a donation in a way that
would not be allowed were the individuals to do it themselves? We have
seen cases of this being reported in the media recently&#151;that
concerning Lord Ashcroft, and the potential one concerning
Mr. Deripaska and LDV, which raise the issue directly. If
people who are not allowed to make donations are allowed to get through
that by using the corporate form, we must ask whether we should raise
the veil of the corporation to see who the real donor is.</div>
<a name="08112051000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Huntingdon and I spent many days, possibly in this room, or
perhaps it was next door, on the Companies Bill. During the course of
that debate we talked about the issue of the corporate veil and the
extent to which people should be allowed to set up their businesses in
whatever way they want, using the corporate veil to separate their
various businesses and the debts and obligations that those businesses
might create. Never, in the course of those debates, did anyone make
the point that people should be allowed to use the corporate form to
evade the law on donations to political parties. It seems that we
should make an exception to the rule in Salomon <i class="I">v</i><i class="I">.</i>
Salomon that companies should be treated legally as separate
people.</div><a name="08112051000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 22 says that a company that is controlled by an impermissible
donor shall, itself, count as an impermissible donor. That is the way
to do it. The question then is who counts as controlling the company?
Going back to the debates that the hon. Gentleman and I had on the
Companies Bill, now Act, there is an answer to that question in company
law and we should use it. There are three ways in which people control
companies and we should catch all of them in trying to stop the evasion
of the law. The first, which is the most obvious, is where a
shareholder owns 75 per cent. or more, of the shares in a company, that
shareholder can give the company an instruction by resolution; it can
tell the company what to do. If the shareholder has less than 75 per
cent. they cannot do that. They might be able to elect the board, but
they cannot tell the company what to do; the board runs the company.
The first condition, therefore, is that anyone who owns 75 per cent. or
more of the company should, for donation purposes, be counted as
controlling the company.</div>
<a name="08112051000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second
concerns boards of directors. If there is a board of directors,
it&#151;rather than the shareholders&#151;will run the company. If
the board of directors is dominated by impermissible donors, the
company itself should count as an impermissible donor. That seems to be
quite straightforward. The third, and perhaps most important, concerns
shadow directors. A company that is controlled indirectly by someone
should count as well for these purposes. Section 251 of the Companies
Act 2006 says that a shadow director is</div>
<a name="08112051000422"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a person in
accordance with whose directions or instructions the directors of the
company are accustomed to act.&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column410" />Column number: 410</div><a name="08112051000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">The normal circumstance
is where there is a dominant shareholder with enough votes to make
anyone a director or not a director at that person&#146;s will. But
there are other circumstances where this applies. Were we to adopt this
rule, we could remove the possibility of people setting up shell
companies in various ways to make donations that would not otherwise be
lawful.</div>
<a name="08112051000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is the
overall intention of the new clause: to remove the possibility of
making donations to Members of the House of Lords and to make sure that
that intention cannot be evaded or got round by the creation of
companies. I know that many members of the Committee are uncomfortable
discussing this kind of issue. I can see it in their faces as I look
round. <i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> I certainly was not looking
at the Government Whip. He was not one of the people I had in mind. But
this is the central issue in the Bill. It should be about donations,
expenditure and the nature of our political system where it is now,
which is not good and not well respected, and where it should be going.
If we do not discuss it now,
when?</div><a name="08112051000248"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000570"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> We are in favour of transparency, but we do not
want to prevent people from donating. When I read the amendment I was
not entirely sure what the hon. Gentleman was aiming at. Having heard
him I am slightly the wiser. He is basically looking at the laws.
First, I thought of foreigners, but they are already banned. Then I
thought of people under 18: 17-year-olds. Then I thought of mental
health cases. Then I thought of prisoners and thought it had something
to do with Liberals wanting prisoners to get the vote.</div>
<a name="08112051000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">Basically,
the new clause needs a bit more work, even to achieve the objective
that the hon. Gentleman wishes for it. The other point that jumped out
was how to define someone who is not qualified to vote. Does a person
who ought to be on a register, but who is not, count as someone who is
not qualified to vote? Could a non-registered person who is an
anarchist give money to an anarchist party? It was all quite confusing,
but I see where the hon. Gentleman is coming from. However, we do not
agree with it.</div>
<a name="08112051000250"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000571"></a>Mr.
Tyrie:</b> There are three types of amendment or new clause.
There is one that seeks to change the law, there is one that seeks to
probe what the law might mean and there is a third, into which category
this new clause falls, which is to make a point, which may or may not
appear initially relevant to the clause, come what may, whatever the
procedure of the institution one happens to be sitting in. The hon.
Gentleman is a clever lawyer. He has found a wheeze to debate new
clause 10 and get all his points in, just in case we do not reach it. I
take my hat off to him for
that.</div><a name="08112051000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
it happens, having heard the hon. Gentleman&#146;s description of new
clause 22, although I certainly think that it would need a great deal
of work, I agree with what he described as its intention, which is, in
summary, to exclude all institutional donations, including trade unions
and corporate donations from party funding and to force parties to rely
on local activism. That is where we have to go. I strongly agreed with
his description that it should be a long-term goal and that we should
not try to implement something like this overnight, which would have
huge implications for all political parties, but particularly the
Labour party. It would be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column411" />Column number: 411</div>unfair and damaging to any party that tried to introduce it in that way.
We should mark out that territory, recognising that many other
jurisdictions have also tried to go down that road&#151;he made that
point about Canada, and the Canadian point is well
taken.</div><a name="08112051000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
also agreed with the hon. Gentleman that, if there is to be state
funding, it should be considered transitional&#151;in order to help
bring in such a scheme, while parties adjust and find a way of
establishing and broadening their local base. There is a stench in the
nostrils of the electorate about how parties are funded at the moment.
People have heard me say that on numerous occasions. I feel strongly
that we need to deal with that. I regret that the Government have been
unable to take forward the key measures required to enable something
substantive to be done about it, which was a consequence of the
breakdown of the Hayden Phillips
talks.</div><a name="08112051000253"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000573"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000575"></a>Mr.

political exchange of a type that I would like to avoid. None the less,
even though we have had such a stricture in an unusual but powerful
ruling from a sedentary position, I shall give way to the
Minister.</div><a name="08112051000257"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000576"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> I was only seeking illumination from the hon.
Gentleman. Could he remind the Committee of what happened to the Hayden

them?</div><a name="08112051000258"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000577"></a>The
Chairman:</b> The answer to that would be completely out of
order. I am sorry, I do not often disagree with Ministers in Committee,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000579"></a>The

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000580"></a>Mr.
Tyrie:</b> I shall not try to, even by the back
door.</div><a name="08112051000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to make one last point. There is the question of the effect on the
scope of the criteria for ennoblement, which the hon. Member for
Cambridge touched upon near the end of his contributions. It is true
that a significant number of donors has as an incentive the idea that
such preferment might come upon them one day. There are some pretty
good statistics to back up that view. The hon. Gentleman mentioned one
about donations in excess of &#163;1 million to the Labour party over
the past 11 years. He might have tried looking below &#163;1 million,
because the going rate is certainly well below &#163;1 million at the
moment&#151;or it was, until the Lord Levy scandal broke.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column412" />Column number: 412</div><a name="08112051000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to make
only one more point about achieving that part of the objective. I am
not sure that new  clause 22, or even a hyper-improved version
of it, is the way forward. The appointment to a peerage and the sense
in which it is an honour need to be completely separate. A peerage
should be granted entirely on the likelihood of that person making a
contribution to the legislature, whether that is an appointment or,
ultimately, an election&#151;I shall not go into that. The position
is part of the legislature and it should be treated as an appointment
to the legislature, in which we want contributions from that
individual, rather than thinking of the peerage as an honour. It should
certainly not form part of patronage of any type, even of a Prime
Minister.</div><a name="08112051000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
I wrote my proposals for reform of party funding, the Leader of the
Opposition wrote the foreword and launched them at a press conference,
giving warm support. For those interested, although the proposals
obtained little coverage due to other issues, on page 6 the hon.
Gentleman will find the solution to the problem of new clause 22 set
out in detail. My right hon. Friend believes that the link between
patronage and the Prime Minister should be completely broken and that
those appointments should be made by an independent appointments
commission.</div>
<a name="08112051000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">My very last
point is that the issue will not go away, even if we deal with it
before the election, which is extremely unlikely. It will probably come
up after the election, whoever wins. I will do whatever I can to ensure
that it comes up after the election if the Conservative party wins.
This area needs fundamental reform; not along the lines of new clause
22, which would have all sorts of unforeseen and unforeseeable
consequences, as the hon. Gentleman admits. We have to have reform, if
we are to remove what I described earlier as the stench in the nostrils
of the
electorate.</div><a name="08112051000439"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000581"></a>Tony
Lloyd:</b> I commend new clause 22, although not every aspect
is unproblematic. For example, removing Members of the House of Lords,
which would be an unintended consequence of new clause 22, should not
be part of our duties, but the spirit of the clause is right. The hon.
Member for Chichester was a little harsh about the motivation behind
it. The new clause serves a genuine purpose and there is a need to
debate those devices. We can disagree about the mechanisms that ought
to be allowed in our political system and the funding thereof, but we
ought not to disagree about devices designed to get round clear
principles that have already been established
elsewhere.</div><a name="08112051000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
clear principle, which exists for direct donors, is that overseas
residents&#151;those prohibited from taking part in our domestic
political processes&#151;should be disbarred from funding. That is
the essential import of the new clause, and, in that sense, we ought to
seek something that does that. We ought to ensure that the law for
corporate structures is in line with the law affecting individuals. It
may not be the right mechanism, but I hope that my right hon. Friend
the Minister will at least see the logic of moving in the direction
that the hon. Member for Cambridge is
urging.</div>
<a name="08112051000268"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000582"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> Like most members of the Committee, we agree with
the high-minded principles that we discern behind the amendment and new
clause 22. However, as 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column413" />Column number: 413</div>has already been revealed in the discussions, the new clause is,
perhaps, too imperfectly drafted to secure the ends that it
seeks.</div>
<a name="08112051000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">Section 54(8)
of the 2000 Act makes it clear that an individual on any of the
following registers is entitled to donate to a UK political party: the
register of parliamentary electors; the register of local government
electors; the register of relevant citizens of the EU; and the register
of peers made under regulations under section 3 of the Representation
of the People Act 1985. The amendment would change that so that only
those on the parliamentary register would be able to donate, which
would prevent UK citizens living abroad and EU citizens living in the
UK from donating. We do not think that a limitation of that sort is
desirable, given that those categories of person have a right to vote
and otherwise participate in our political system.</div>
<a name="08112051000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">As we have
heard, the new clause would also prevent peers from donating. Of
course, it is right, in our and in most people&#146;s view, that
peers may not vote for representatives in the House of Commons, but it
is not right that they should be barred from participating in the
democratic process in other respects. In any event, as I have
mentioned, the future reform of the House of Lords, to which everyone
is committed, would make such a change inevitably anachronistic if we
introduced democratically elected peers, either in whole or substantial
part.</div>
<a name="08112051000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
would further prevent companies owned by such individuals&#151;that
is, peers and individuals with foreign connections&#151;from being
able to donate. That would be a significant departure from the
2000 Act, under which all companies that are registered and
carry on business in the UK are eligible to donate. We all understand
the concerns that lie behind the amendments. It is equally clear,
however, that they need to be addressed in some other context and not
through the wholesale amendment of the 2000 Act to prevent any company
with significant foreign connections or any company owned or controlled
by a peer from being able to donate. As currently drafted, the
amendments would prevent a significant number of individuals and
companies with genuine connections to the United Kingdom from being
able to donate, and that is not an effect that we want to
achieve.</div>
<a name="08112051000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, as
the hon. Member for Cambridge made clear, and as my hon. Friend the
Member for Manchester, Central and the hon. Member for Chichester said,
these are important issues. The purpose of the amendment is perhaps to
open up discussions on how we can come to some kind of final resolution
of these complex but fundamentally important issues on party funding
and spending. I think we can all agree that the discussion is not
finished, but as I have said over and again in Committee, and as my
right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State said on Second Reading, we
believe that we can move towards such a final resolution only on the
basis of consensus. Such important issues cannot be dealt with in any
other way and certainly should not be turned into a party political
football. That is why I share the regret of the hon. Member for
Chichester that the Conservative party walked away from the
discussions.</div>

Chairman:</b> Order. The Minister is not giving way.</div>
<a name="08112051000277"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000587"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> I hope that one day we will see consensus emerge on
what we all agree are important issues. I think that all members of the
Committee will wish to return to the subject in due course, but I do
not believe that the amendment and the proposed new clause provide the
place to do that. Having heard the debate from both sides, I hope that
the hon. Member for Cambridge will withdraw the
amendment.</div>
<a name="08112051000278"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000588"></a>David
Howarth:</b> The Minister came back to the point about
consensus, but he seems to have a highly restricted view of where we
should be going and how. There are times when politicians have to go
with the consensus of the public, rather than the consensus of the
parties. His final remarks illustrated that there is not even consensus
among the parties on why the previous talks broke down, never mind on
what to do about it. The public expect us to act, and to do so in a way
that they see as fair, not partisan. The Government are in a position
to make proposals that will be perceived as fair by the public as a
whole. It is interesting that amendments have been tabled by Labour
Back Benchers that would have had an adverse effect on the Labour
party, but which they tabled anyway. That is the spirit in which the
debate should continue.</div>
<a name="08112051000279"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000589"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> Of course we must move forward in the way that the
public want&#151;that is what we all are here to do. I hope that the
hon. Gentleman recognises, however, that if we cannot secure consensus
among the parties it will become a partisan issue, axiomatically so. It
will become very difficult to secure an enduring settlement. The public
certainly do not want it to become a party political football or for it
to be batted around between elections. We saw that at the beginning of
the 20th century; it is not helpful to the processes of democracy. That
is not an excuse for kicking the matter into the long grass and I hope
that the hon. Gentleman will accept that. It is a duty of all hon.
Members to try to achieve consensus, so that we can do precisely what
the people of this country want us to do.</div>
<a name="08112051000280"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000590"></a>David
Howarth:</b> I am happy that the Minister has just said that
it is a not a matter of kicking the issue into the long grass, but he
is not right about the conditions under which we can get a permanent
settlement. It is not necessary to have agreement among the parties to
reach a position that will be stable. We need to reach a position that
the public think is fair and when an attempt to move away from it would
be seen as partisan and would lose support for the party that proposed
it. That is what I am asking for on not only the issues raised under
new clause 22, but donations, expenditure caps and relations between
the unions and the Labour party. The possible solution that has been
suggested would enable us to reach the point at which we could propose
a settlement that the public, not the parties, would
want.</div><a name="08112051000281"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000591"></a>Mr.
Tyrie:</b> I agree entirely with the hon. Gentleman. Does he
agree that we cannot arrive at the point at which one party can have a
veto over change if it were clearly what the overwhelming majority of
voters concluded would enable greater public trust to be restored in
such matters?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column415" />Column number: 415</div><a name="08112051000282"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000592"></a>David
Howarth:</b> I agree with that. What matters is whether the
public would perceive as fair a system with which one party did not
agree. If the other parties ganged up on a particular party just to do
it down, the public would not consider that to be fair. It would not be
a stable position. I am not suggesting that. We should all think about
what would be a fair settlement and go for it, regardless of whether
one or two of us might object on partisan grounds to the eventual fair
solution.</div><a name="08112051000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having
heard the debate on new clause 22, I readily confess that it could do
with some more work. As the Minister said, a number of groups are
excluded from parliamentary elections, some of which I certainly would
want to exclude from the right to donate, including peers. I would be a
bit more doubtful about others, such as European Union electors who are
not peers in this country. An interesting question was asked about
whether we should allow United Kingdom citizens abroad, some of whom
are not peers strangely enough, to be
donors.</div><a name="08112051000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to mention prisoners, the issue raised by the hon. Member for
Huntingdon. At the moment, they are not allowed to vote. A European
Court of Human Rights judgment is against the Government on that point.
The problem can be resolved in several ways, but not by granting the
right to vote to all prisoners. Taking away the right to vote should be
considered to be a specific part of a sentence, because the right to
citizenship and the rights of citizenship should be considered
separately from other aspects of what happens to someone. That is the
correct approach, because being a citizen with the right to vote should
be considered an important
matter.</div><a name="08112051000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">Even
though I recognise the problems in how new clause 22 has been drafted,
I am encouraged by the remarks made by the hon. Member for Manchester,
Central about the acceptance of the spirit behind it, especially behind
proposed subsections (2) and (3) on anti-avoidance. It is the constant
task of legislators to look out for ways in which what they intend is
being got round in the world outside. That is why legislation cannot be
for ever. When rules that are laid down are being avoided by devices
that undermine their spirit and intention, we should do something about
it. With that in mind, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="08112051000286"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

Linton</b>: We come now to triggering, which for many of us is
the most important issue in the Bill. I am conscious that we have very
little time left so I shall not take an unfair share of it. It is
important to set out the issues. I have been dedicated for a long time
to the notion that if the Bill achieves nothing else, it should close
the loophole unintentionally created in the 2000
Act&#151;on which Committee I also served&#151;which leaves
completely unrestricted spending by candidates up until the date of
dissolution.</div>
<a name="08112051000291"></a><div class="hs_Para">Triggering&#151;in
other words, control of candidates&#146; spending&#151;was in force
for 17 years before that, since the 1983 Act and, as far as I know,
since the Corrupt and Illegal Practices Prevention Act 1883. For most
of our history we have had control of candidates&#146; spending. It
was dropped only by mistake in the 2000 Act. I have looked up the
historic debate in the House of Lords where that occurred. Amendment
No. 253G was the first time in the discussion of that Bill that it was
proposed to introduce the

it had left the House of Commons and long after the Committee stage.
The phrase had never been mentioned and there had been no intention or

on 24 October that amendment appeared in the House of Lords. It was

Tyrie:</b> I do not mean any disrespect, but I have
<i class="I">Hansard</i>,<i class="I"> </i>column 61, of 20 October 2008, in front of me,
and so far the hon. Gentleman has read out his speech as it appears
there. He made those points on Second Reading. If he carries on like
this, we will end up having to make all the obvious replies&#151;that
he 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column417" />Column number: 417</div>tabled a probing amendment, that he made that clear, and that the
decision was taken without even a Division, which hardly suggests that
there was opposition on our part. There is no merit in his
persisting.</div><a name="08112051000296"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000597"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I know that was an intervention from the
hon. Gentleman and I am sure that what he said has been noted, but the
hon. Member for Battersea is entirely in order in what he is
saying.</div><a name="08112051000297"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000598"></a>Martin
Linton:</b> Thank you, Sir Nicholas. I understand the point
that the hon. Member for Chichester is making, but without the context
we would not get to a meaningful discussion. I shall not dwell on what
has happened since that loophole was opened up. I do not blame Lord
Ashcroft for making use of it in the 2005 election and I cannot blame
him for seeking to make use of it now in his new position in the
Conservative party. After all, I would not deny that my party tries to
match spending by the other party, so both parties are using the
loophole.</div>
<a name="08112051000298"></a><div class="hs_Para">Parenthetically,
I do not accept the argument that parliamentary newsletters invalidate
the issue. Hon. Members are welcome to look at my parliamentary
newsletters. I do not think that they bear on the point of candidate
spending at all. It is perfectly right that Members should be allowed
to communicate with their electors and tell them what they have done in
Parliament. If they have done things that are good for the
constituency, it is right that they should get whatever credit the
electors feel that they deserve, but that does not invalidate the need
for a return to candidate spending
limits.</div><a name="08112051000299"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08112051000599"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Alan Reid</b> (Argyll and Bute) (LD): I agree absolutely that
there is a problem that must be tackled, but I am concerned that the
clause is not the right way to tackle it. The hon. Gentleman referred
to newsletters, but what if an Opposition candidate put out a
newsletter saying what a wonderful job he was doing, how he had got the
roads fixed and so on? It is totally unclear whether that would be
counted as election expenses. That is our concern about the
clause.</div><a name="08112051000300"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000600"></a>Martin
Linton:</b> The hon. Gentleman is right that there are
difficulties with triggering. That is the reason for the amendment. I
do not deny that the difficulty with triggering is that there is a
certain element of uncertainty about it. It is like a sword of Damocles
hanging over a candidate. They never know when they might accidentally
overstep a mark and trigger election
expenses.</div><a name="08112051000301"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am trying to act in a spirit of cross-party consensus. I am not
insisting that there should be a consensus, but I believe we can find a
degree of it. The Bill reinstates the legislation of 1983, which was
Conservative legislation, so the Bill cannot be accused of being
partisan. I would prefer us to stick with what the Bill says because
that is the system that worked for 117 years, and that is the system
that we know has some effect. If a better system can be found, we
should all try to move towards it.</div>
<a name="08112051000302"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the
amendment, my hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Test and I
suggest a different version of triggering that is meant to achieve the
objective in a better way. The idea first came up in evidence from my
hon. Friend to the Constitutional Affairs Committee. Instead of
candidate limits that apply from the point 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column418" />Column number: 418</div>when somebody becomes or declares themselves a candidate or appeals for
votes, they should apply from a specific point in the parliamentary
cycle. The first suggestion was 42 months. Three and a half years into
a Parliament, candidate limits should automatically come into
effect.</div>
<a name="08112051000303"></a><div class="hs_Para">The wording
of the amendment takes into account the fact that we are already well
past the 42nd month of this Parliament. As 42 months is not relevant to
the present situation, the amendment refers to the 50th month, which
means that the candidate limits would come into force in July next
year&#151;that is, 11 months before the last possible date on which
an election can be held. There would essentially be one period from the
beginning of July until dissolution during which candidates could spend
up to their candidate limit&#151;those limits vary from constituency
to constituency, but they fall roughly within the range of
&#163;10,000 to &#163;12,000&#151;and another regulated period
during the campaign itself.</div>
<a name="08112051000304"></a><div class="hs_Para">So there
would be two regulated periods, which would double the amount that
candidates could spend to &#163;20,000 to &#163;25,000. That is a
reasonable proposition. I do not make it out of self-interest&#151;my
self-interest would best be served by what is in the Bill&#151;but
because I recognise that there are many legal difficulties associated
with triggering and that, in the past eight years, parties have got
used to having no restrictions on candidates. It might be a bit
difficult for us to turn the clock back to a situation where triggering
operates all the time.</div>
<a name="08112051000305"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000601"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> Will the hon. Gentleman clarify one point, for my
benefit? If the period is instituted as he described, are the
candidates allowed to spend before
that?</div><a name="08112051000306"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000602"></a>Martin
Linton:</b> Before the first regulated period starts,
candidates, as now, can spend as much as they like. Once a regulated
period has started they can spend only up to the constituency limit in
that regulated period. The reason for two regulated periods is because
if we merely increase the candidate limit over a longer period, some
candidates who were adopted only towards the election would have twice
as much to spend during the election campaign as a candidate who had
been adopted earlier. That would introduce an element of unfairness.
The concept is that there should be two regulated periods. It could be
three regulated periods, so that candidates are not completely
precluded from spending any money before the election, but they are not
allowed to save all that money up and have a spending spree during the
election itself.</div>
<a name="08112051000307"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000603"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> I am grateful for that answer. Could the hon.
Gentleman help me with a second point? What are the conditions as far
as Members of Parliament are
concerned?</div><a name="08112051000308"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000604"></a>Martin
Linton:</b> Members of Parliament who have been adopted as
candidates would be caught by the same provisions. To the extent that
they wanted to promote themselves as candidates, they would have to
work within the limits, as they do during the election period. It would
not stop them putting out parliamentary newsletters, provided that
those conformed not only with Parliament&#146;s definition of a
parliamentary newsletter, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column419" />Column number: 419</div>but with the electoral returning officer&#146;s definition. Those
should, in principle, be the same, but there is no guarantee of
that.</div>
<a name="08112051000309"></a><div class="hs_Para">The simple
principle that I am putting before the Committee as a possible way
forward, if one is needed, is that we can proceed on the basis of a
fixed triggering point, where every candidate is triggered and that
that should be at a fixed point in the parliamentary cycle. In the
normal course of events I would propose 42 months&#151;three and a
half years&#151;which means that in a four-year Parliament, the last
half year would be covered by limits. In the occasional five-year
Parliament&#151;they are still a minority&#151;it would be the last
18 months. That would remove the doubt as to when triggering started.
It would remove the need for all the long titles like parliamentary
spokesperson and prospective parliamentary candidate, which the public
find rather laughable. It would mean that the starting gun was fired at
the same point for everybody and that the rules were the same for
everybody.</div><a name="08112051000310"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
agree with the hon. Member for Cambridge that the test is not whether
there is consensus between the parties, because the history going back
to the 1970s is that one party can see that it has an advantage in
consensus and uses the consensus as a veto. That is why we had the 20
or 30 years of scraping the bottom of the barrel for party funds in
this country, whereas other countries all found consensus around party
spending limits, party donation limits and state spending. We were the
only country that left it until 2000 before we even began to consider
comprehensive party funding legislation. Where there is consensus, that
is desirable, but it is important that we do something that is seen by
the public to be fair. A fixed triggering time for everybody would be
the right
principle.</div><a name="08112051000311"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000605"></a>Mr.
Tyrie:</b> Will the hon. Gentleman indicate, on a scale of one
to 10, to what extent the Electoral Commission&#146;s proposal would
be second best? The commission has come forward with a four-month
proposal.</div><a name="08112051000441"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.30
pm</div><a name="08112051000312"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000606"></a>Martin
Linton:</b> The Electoral Commission agrees in its note that
this proposal could provide greater certainty for parties and
candidates&#151;Members can read it themselves. The commission
basically supports the proposal. It sees one or two possible
disadvantages, but it prefers it to triggering. I have no personal
interest here; as a Member with a majority of 163, anything that
reduces the spending of my potential opponents is welcome. Triggering
might be more effective, but this is probably a fairer system&#151;it
is certainly a clearer one. It is more likely to be the basis of
cross-party agreement, and above all, it is more likely to appear fair
to the
public.</div><a name="08112051000313"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000607"></a>Mrs.
Laing:</b> The proposals made by the hon. Gentleman in
amendments Nos. 201 and 202 are interesting. I am glad that he has now
explained just what they mean and why he has proposed them, and I
sympathise with his attempt to produce a clearer and more certain Bill.
I hope that we will have time to debate the whole of clause 10, because
it is one of the most important in the Bill. To ensure that we have as
much time as possible for that debate, I will be brief in my remarks on
the amendment.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column420" />Column number: 420</div><a name="08112051000314"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman and others have used the phrase &#147;going back
to&#148;&#151;going back to triggering, going back to what happened
before 2000. We should not look to go back to the confusion that we had
then; we should look to go forward.
<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> Of course I will give way. I am
sorry; I thought that the hon. Gentleman wanted to
intervene.</div><a name="08112051000315"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000608"></a>Dr.
Whitehead:</b> I was simply gesturing that that is what the
amendment attempts to do: to go forward to a more satisfactory version
of what might misleadingly be called triggering but which ought to have
a new name&#151;a pre-election period that is clear to everybody and
does not relate to whether somebody has called themselves a
candidate.</div><a name="08112051000316"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000609"></a>Mrs.
Laing:</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for that apparent
clarification. It is difficult to have a pre-election period when it is
not known when the election will take place, but I entirely concede
that the wording of the two amendments is much clearer on that, because
it refers to the previous election. The amendments, therefore, make
sense from that point of view. While I am referring to the initial
remarks of the hon. Member for Battersea, I also pay tribute to the
late Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, who noticed this problem, brought it
up and was sadly ignored. He was a great parliamentarian and a very
clever politician, who is much missed in both Houses and in the
political firmament
generally.</div><a name="08112051000317"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
lack of clarity worries me considerably. In considering triggering,
before 2000, I have had reason to look at the literature of each of the
three main political parties that advises candidates when it is that
they become candidates and when election expenses begin. I sympathise
with the hon. Gentleman&#146;s assertion that it is necessary to be
precise about when election expenses begin. That is why triggering, as
set out in clause 10, is so worrying. Due to lack of time, I will not
quote what I might have quoted, but I will reserve, I hope, the duty of
Her Majesty&#146;s Opposition to bring the matter forward again on
Report.</div>
<a name="08112051000318"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are in
danger this afternoon of not being able to consider important matters.
However, I draw the Committee&#146;s attention to the guidance
produced by the Labour party in a document called, &#147;The Way to
Win&#151;Labour&#146;s Campaign Handbook for the 1990s&#148;,
which is when triggering was in effect. There is a paragraph in the
document called, &#147;The dangers of election law&#148;. I always
thought that we made laws to protect people, not to endanger them, but
the way in which the then Opposition saw electoral law at that time was
as dangerous. In the advice to candidates, the document says:</div>
<a name="08112051000427"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Keeping
on the right side of election law is vital. But it&#146;s not an
excuse to keep out of sight. Use your imagination to avoid the
constraints imposed by election law on the candidate&#146;s
activity.&#148;</div><a name="08112051000319"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is what the Labour party told its candidates in the run-up to the 1997
general election.</div>
<a name="08112051000320"></a><div class="hs_Para">My argument
is that it is essential to have a law that does not leave itself open
to the imagination of Labour candidates or of any other player on the
political field during a general election and that it must be certain.
Sadly, I do not consider that the hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendments
would improve clause 10, and we therefore cannot support
them.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000610"></a>David
Howarth:</b> The Committee has only 24 minutes left, and I
feel not only that will we not have a chance to discuss the matters
later in the list, but that we do not have enough time to discuss this
matter in the depth that it requires. I am sure that the Committee will
agree that this is a matter to which we ought to return, in detail, on
Report.</div>
<a name="08112051000322"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Battersea has moved an amendment that assumes that
triggering is not the right thing to do. I will not to spend the
Committee&#146;s time explaining why I think that he is right to make
that assumption. That leaves only two other solutions to the problem of
when local spending limits should kick in. One is the fixed-month
solution that he suggested; the other is to say that permanent local
spending limits should be there all the time.</div>
<a name="08112051000323"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that
the permanent local spending limit should be the solution. The problem
with the fixed-month solution that the hon. Gentleman has proposed is
that we do not have fixed-term Parliaments. His proposal is certainly
better than the suggestion made by the Electoral Commission, which said
that the limit should apply a certain number of months before the
election. One would have to be a mind reader to work out when that
would
apply.</div><a name="08112051000324"></a><div class="hs_Para">Nevertheless,
there is a different problem with the hon. Gentleman&#146;s solution,
which would apply a certain number of months after the previous one. It
is obviously clearer, but it still gives an advantage to the incumbent
party, because the leaders of the incumbent party&#151;not
necessarily the people who are standing for Parliament for that
party&#151;will have a much better idea about when the election will
happen than the Opposition parties, and they can give signals to their
candidates to spend. <i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> We know what
happened last year. Those were unusual circumstances, where the signals
got confused on all sides.</div>
<a name="08112051000325"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
advantages of incumbency are great, and they include, on the whole,
being in a better position to predict or understand the timing of
elections than the Opposition. Therefore, Government candidates will be
in a position to spend more earlier; they will not have to delay their
spending to get it into the first regulated period. That would not be
the case if the regulated period started so soon after the previous
election that no one would plausibly call an election at that point.
The trouble is that even the hon. Gentleman&#146;s permanent
suggestion&#151;not the one that would apply to the five-year
part&#151;will not really achieve that end. As we have seen, it is
still quite possible for Prime Ministers to think that they should call
an election after two and a half years.</div>
<a name="08112051000326"></a><div class="hs_Para">The only way
to solve the problem properly is to ignore a fixed starting point and
go to a third solution. Admittedly, it is one that the Electoral
Commission says is difficult to administer and everyone says would
raise problems with enforcement, but it is nevertheless clearer. It is
to have a permanent local cap on spending. There are various ways to do
that&#151;some are proposed on today&#146;s amendment
paper&#151;but the principle is
clear.</div><a name="08112051000327"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000611"></a>Tony
Lloyd:</b> The hon. Gentleman might be coming to this. I have
considerable sympathy with his proposal for a permanent cap over the
life of a Parliament, but that is not on offer at the moment. Is he
going to insist on the best at the price of the
good?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column422" />Column number: 422</div><a name="08112051000328"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000612"></a>David
Howarth:</b> The hon. Gentleman says that that proposal is not
on offer, but technically it is, if we get enough time to discuss new
clause 9. However, what we are going to do at this point? Not a lot,
given the state of play on the arguments about consensus and not doing
anything unless we all agree, which means that one party can veto any
proposal.</div><a name="08112051000329"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
other point involves the difference between candidate spending and
party spending. Campaigns now are not just about candidates. Candidate
regulation involves proper 19th-century regulation of the extraordinary
amounts that were spent by candidates in elections in the second half
of that century. However, politics is not like that anymore. Candidate
spending still occurs, and it ought to be regulated. If hon. Members
want to see some candidate spending, they should go down to Richmond
Park and see Mr. Goldsmith&#146;s spending. Nevertheless,
candidate spending is not the leading problem nationally. The leading
problem nationally is party spending, directed at a particular
constituency. That is how parties attempt to buy elections, and it
needs to be regulated as well. It seems that the only way to do that is
by separate, clear regulation of local party spending across the entire
life of a Parliament.</div>
<a name="08112051000330"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000613"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman not understand that this
is far more about national decisions on where money is spent than about
the individual? What did we spend money on before the new system was
introduced? The only difference is that my name is on the literature.
Before, it had pictures of Conservatives, doing nice Conservative
things, as well as lots of other people. Subsequently, my name is on
it. What is the
difference?</div><a name="08112051000331"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000614"></a>David
Howarth:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes an important point.
Triggering or fixed-month solutions that deal with candidate spending
will result only in his name being taken back off the leaflets. Party
spending will continue. I am not saying as a consequence that there
should be no control on candidate spending&#151;we must have that as
well&#151;but the solution to the problem is a local party spending
cap.</div><a name="08112051000332"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to make one final point. One thing that we have not and perhaps
ought to have discussed is how the spending of third-party
people&#151;not Liberal Democrats, but people who are not technically
involved with a party&#151;comes into play. The present problem is
that spending by such people, who support parties&#146; campaigns but
do not partake of official party spending, is regulated only in the
national cap and as part of election
expenses.</div><a name="08112051000442"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.45
pm</div><a name="08112051000333"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
must be careful not to leave a gap there as well. Perhaps that is also
the way that we need to go in order to regulate the spending of
individuals who intend to become candidates later. We need to count
them as regulated third parties and expand the definitions in the
relevant part of PPERA, which would catch instances such as
Mr. Goldsmith&#146;s campaigns in west
London.</div>
<a name="08112051000334"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000615"></a>Dr.
Whitehead:</b> At the moment, we have a platonic form of a
possible all-encompassing solution to party funding, both national
party funding and local party funding, including how national and local
party funding might interact over the course of an entire electoral 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column423" />Column number: 423</div>cycle. Indeed, in that platonic form I would agree with the hon. Member
for Cambridge that a whole-term regulation of local spending is
probably the right way forward.</div>
<a name="08112051000335"></a><div class="hs_Para">Also,
whole-term regulation of local spending incorporates the idea that
national spending may be applied for local purposes and therefore ought
to be regulated as if it were local spending. Indeed, if one had
overall regulation with a choice between a cap on local spending and a
cap on national spending, that idea would automatically be
implemented.</div>
<a name="08112051000336"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000616"></a>Mrs.
Laing:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman not perceive an unfairness
if local spending by a candidate over the whole period that he is
talking about is restricted while spending by the sitting Member of
Parliament is not only unrestricted but backed by the taxpayer to the
amount of &#163;10,000 a year?</div>
<a name="08112051000337"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000617"></a>Dr.
Whitehead:</b> The spending by Members of Parliament is not
unrestricted and it would not be unrestricted in the system that I have
suggested might be encompassed by a whole-term spending restriction.
Indeed, the idea of a whole-term spending restriction was set out in
the Constitutional Affairs Committee report on party funding a little
while ago.</div>
<a name="08112051000338"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I am sure
the hon. Lady is aware, spending on items such as newsletters is
carefully regulated by this House, particularly by the efforts of the
Standards and Privileges Committee to define carefully what is regarded
as promotion of a person and what is regarded as a report of
parliamentary activities. Under those circumstances and under the
circumstances that I am about to describe, if a Member of Parliament
used the resources of the House to go beyond telling the electorate
what they have been doing as an MP, which is quite reasonable, that
expenditure could well come under the heading of local election
expenditure to promote that person&#146;s candidature. A penalty
would then be levied on that person automatically for going beyond what
is reasonable in terms of parliamentary expenditure.</div>
<a name="08112051000339"></a><div class="hs_Para">At the
moment, there are a number of debates about whether that expenditure is
within the right terms. A number of hon. Members have either been
required to repay what they have spent on putting out their newsletters
or, in certain instances, have had to apologise to the House for what
they have put in them.</div>
<a name="08112051000340"></a><div class="hs_Para">An additional
sanction could well be that, in circumstances where there is a clear
date-based trigger point, expenditure after that date will not relate
to whether or not a person is a candidate, or an avowed candidate. As
the hon. Member for Isle of Wight has said, there were practices in
previous years where people were hiding behind metaphorical bushes, as
it were, prior to the point that they declared themselves a candidate.
In a sense, with a clear date-based trigger point, which is what we
potentially have on offer in the real world and not in the platonic
world of a whole-term cap, the real issue would not be whether a person
had declared themselves as a candidate but what they had done to
promote that candidature, in terms of expenditure, within that period.
It would be the same for everybody 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column424" />Column number: 424</div>and it would be the same within each constituency on a rubric that we
already have, in terms of how much money can be
spent.</div>
<a name="08112051000341"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000618"></a>Mrs.
Laing:</b> I want the hon. Gentleman to clarify a point on
which I am genuinely not certain. Does he believe that a candidate
should not be able to spend any money before the trigger point in his
amendment? The Member of Parliament would spend both taxpayers&#146;
money and private money. To use taxpayers&#146; money, they would
have to explain what they have done as a Member of Parliament without
any party political advantage. None the less, it still gets the name of
that person known in the locality as a Member of Parliament while, at
the same time, the candidate would not be able to declare himself or
herself as a candidate and would not be able to spend any
money.</div><a name="08112051000342"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000619"></a>Dr.
Whitehead:</b> I fear that the hon. Lady has misunderstood the
mechanism of the trigger point. There is a difference between a trigger
mechanism and what is proposed in the amendments. The amendments work
back, as it were, from a solid point in the river&#151;or a post in
the river&#151;and that is the point at which one has to have a
general election. After Dissolution, there is a period of restricted
local expenditure, as is the case at present under PPERA. Before that,
there is a pre-election period. Once that point has been reached,
everybody&#151;whether or not they have been a candidate previous to
that&#151;knows what the rules are on local expenditure. If they have
been a candidate before that point, they can spend what they like. That
is not regulated until that point has been reached. A sitting Member of
Parliament is bound by exactly the same regulations except that they
can put out a newsletter or similar, which is regulated by the House
authorities, talking about what they have been doing in Parliament. If,
after the period of pre-election regulation, that person goes beyond
that, their expenditure could conceivably be counted as their candidate
expenditure.</div>
<a name="08112051000343"></a><div class="hs_Para">I suggest
that that method overcomes the problem that was inherent&#151;as the
hon. Member for Cambridge said&#151;in the Electoral
Commission&#146;s suggestion of the four-month period when one had to
guess when the general election might be. In that case, one might get
into problems of retrospection. In the present circumstances, if this
were to become law before the next election, there would also be no
issue of retrospection because a date would not have been reached by
the time this went into law. Therefore, there is no question of
anybody&#146;s expenditure to date being caught within such an
arrangement.</div><a name="08112051000344"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
was encouraged by what the hon. Lady said in her initial comments on
the amendment, but she then did an Indiana Jones-like bound and said,
&#147;Therefore, we cannot accept it.&#148; I thought that, in
substance, her comments were rather supportive of the ideas in the
amendment, and those potentially on offer in the real world of what we
do now to regulate issues&#151;we all know that there are problems,
in our current electoral arrangements. That is the spirit in which the
amendment is offered. Whether the issues work in the round depends, I
hope, on the ability of parties to reach a consensus on how to operate
such matters. The amendments provide a framework that reflects the
consensus of a fair and level playing field for all concerned, clear
points before and after which expenditure is regulated and a method for
ensuring that the maximum that can be spent relates 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column425" />Column number: 425</div>to a route that already exists and by which we can judge what happens
constituency by constituency at local
level.</div>
<a name="08112051000345"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000620"></a>Mr.
Tyrie:</b> I agree with everybody who has said that we have
not had enough time to consider this area of triggering, which is the
most important issue in the Bill. It is extremely important that we do
everything we can to give it salience on Report, and the attention that
it deserves. I fear, with the shutter coming down at 4
o&#146;clock, that the Minister will not get long to respond to my
remarks on the
amendments.</div><a name="08112051000346"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
guess is that the clause&#151;not the amendment&#151;is so
controversial and mistaken that the whole Bill will be delayed. I would
be surprised if the great hurry, which has afflicted every aspect of
the Bill&#146;s consideration, continues&#151;three cheers, or at
least two cheers, for that. I may be wrong, and we may see the Bill on
the Floor of the House before Christmas, but I have my doubts. It is
not unreasonable to describe the main proposal in the clause as
blatantly partisan. That is why I would certainly favour going down the
road of the amendment, which, as a Back Bencher, I can say has
considerable merit&#151;although I am sure that, as I always or
sometimes do, I shall vote slavishly should we find ourselves in a
Division.</div><a name="08112051000347"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
issue seems to be the meat of the Bill and why we have it. We have had
newspaper reports saying that there must be a move against Ashcroftism,
as it is described, and that this is the essential measure to tackle
it. We have had all sorts of reports of that type, which I shall not go
through one by one. This was not a good way to proceed. We should have
had a chance to consult on the sort of idea embodied by the amendment,
but we had no consultation at all on the triggering issue. When I asked
the Secretary of State in the evidence session whether there had been
any consultation, he said that there was and there was not. It would
have been more helpful and, frankly, more accurate to say that there
was
not.</div><a name="08112051000348"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I mentioned, I was involved in the talks. All that happened&#151;not
in, but outside, the talks&#151;was that Sir Hayden asked the parties
individually whether they had any views and wanted to open up the
issue. He spoke to the three parties, and they all said that they did
not particularly like the current arrangements&#151;they had
suggestions for improving them, but they did not want the issue to form
part of the talks. Sir Hayden made that point clear publicly. I do not
see how anyone can reasonably call that
consultation.</div><a name="08112051000349"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment proposed is much better than going back to the old rules,
which would risk retrospection for the forthcoming election. We have
had overwhelming evidence&#151;available for many years, not just in
what we have heard&#151;not just from academics but from others that
the old rules would be a disaster. Lord Bingham made such remarks in a
case, and the Committee on Standards in Public Life has given
unequivocal advice that we should not go down the road of the old
rules. I shall not read it out, because I do not have time, but it is
absolutely
clear.</div><a name="08112051000350"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have just had an interesting debate about whether the solution, from
where we are, is to go to a fixed period, as proposed in the amendment,
or to whole-Parliament limits, which is what the hon. Member for
Southampton, Test was advocating as the alternative. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column426" />Column number: 426</div>He used a different phrase, but that is what he is suggesting at local
level. The problem with whole-Parliament limits is that it is difficult
to disaggregate them administratively at local level. Sir Hayden looked
at that issue in the context of expenditure limits. He came to that
conclusion&#151;it may even have been something he published, but it
is certainly in some of the unpublished papers, which we would very
much like to see in the public domain, but which the Government are
obstructing and blocking the public from
seeing.</div><a name="08112051000351"></a><div class="hs_Para">In

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000638"></a>Mr.
Wills:</b> On a point of order, Sir Nicholas. We are coming to
the end of our proceedings and now might be my last opportunity to
thank you and your co-Chairmen, Mr. Cook, Mr.
Benton and Mr. Atkinson, for what, all 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column429" />Column number: 429</div>members of the Committee will agree, has been a most skilful
chairmanship. We are all extremely grateful for the wit, skill and good
humour with which you have helped steer the debate and guide the
members of the Committee, and bring our proceedings to what has been a
successful
conclusion.</div><a name="08112051000397"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
behalf of the whole Committee, I thank the Badge Messengers, our Clerk,
the <i class="I">Hansard </i>reporters and our colleagues from the police. All
have provided a particularly efficient service to the Committee,
especially in view of the large number of amendments tabled by the
Government and the Opposition. I realise the pressure that that puts on
the Committee. We are extremely grateful to them. I particularly thank
Opposition Front-Bench Members&#151;the hon. Members for Huntingdon,
for Epping Forest, for Cambridge and for Argyll and Bute&#151;for
their valuable and comprehensive contributions to the debate and the
diligence with which they have scrutinised the Government&#146;s
proposals under the
Bill.</div><a name="08112051000398"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am particularly grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Wrexham and
his Opposition counterpart, the hon. Member for Rochford and Southend,
East, for their hard work through the usual channels. I am also
extremely grateful to the other members of the Committee who have
tabled amendments and contributed to our discussions on this important
Bill, including my hon. Friends. The various amendments have made an
extremely useful contribution to our proceedings, particularly those
tabled by my hon. Friends. The Bill has been immeasurably improved, and
we are grateful for
them.</div><a name="08112051000399"></a><div class="hs_Para">All
Opposition Members whose contributions have tested us in debate have
made the Bill stronger and more robust. We have examined in detail most
of the clauses. I can just manage to say that. I hope that members of
the Committee agree that there has been a productive discussion from
both sides. I recognise that we have committed ourselves to coming back
to issues on Report, and I assure my hon. Friend the Member for
Battersea that I mean what I say: we will be coming back to them. I
hope that hon. Members also agree that, while we recognise there is
clearly some way to go on some issues, we have made good progress. The
Bill is in a much better shape now as a result of the amendments and
the hard work that has been put
in.</div><a name="08112051000400"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
I thank the Ministry of Justice officials. I hope that the Committee
agrees that they have done a remarkable job. The Bill has been
difficult and complex in many ways. It has tested them to the limits.
They have worked extremely hard, late into the night and night after
night to make sure that the Bill is in good shape. We all owe them a
great debt of
gratitude.</div><a name="08112051000401"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000639"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Further to that point of order, Sir
Nicholas. I thank you, Mr. Cook and Mr. Atkinson
for chairing our proceedings over the past weeks. I also thank the
Clerks, the <i class="I">Hansard </i>reporters, the Doorkeepers and the police
for providing the mechanics that have facilitated our deliberations.
The Committee has been conducted in generally good humour and a
positive spirit. I thank all hon. Members for their contributions. Yes,
more time would have allowed for the eight unconsidered clauses to be
covered, but we have covered a lot, in what have been pretty good
debates. The Minister generally has been open-minded and recognised the
need for consensus through our deliberations. That will involve him
returning at the next stage with quite a lot of amendments, but we look
forward to that.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column430" />Column number: 430</div><a name="08112051000402"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000640"></a>David
Howarth:</b> Further to that point of order, Sir
Nicholas. I would like to add my thanks, especially to you, Sir
Nicholas, and to the other hon. Members who chaired the Committee. You
have chaired the Committee in your usual exemplary fashion and I always
enjoy serving under your chairmanship. I also thank the Minister for
the open spirit with which he has approached the debate, and the
Opposition for providing many hours of amusement, of one sort or
another.</div>
<a name="08112051000403"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have not
made good progress, I am afraid to say. We have not reached a large
number of clauses. More than that, we have not reached what are the
central issues for many hon. Members and many members of the public. We
have not debated properly the issue of party expenditure at the
national and local level, although we almost got to it at the end of
the previous debate. We have not debated caps on donations. We had a
few moments on that earlier today, but we did not reach the new clause
on it. We did not debate properly how to deal with foreign ownership of
corporations&#151;again, we had a few words on that&#151;and we did
not debate in any detail how to implement the other aspect of the
Hayden Phillips compromise: dealing in a fair way with the relationship
between the unions and the Labour party. I hope that those issues will
be given priority on Report. We must show the public that we understand
that those are the issues that matter for what the Bill must be about,
which is getting big money out of politics and cleaning up
politics.</div>
<a name="08112051000404"></a><div class="hs_Para">To finish on
a happier note, the spirit of the Committee has been very positive, and
I hope that we will take the Bill onwards in that
spirit.</div>
<a name="08112051000405"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08112051000641"></a>The
Chairman:</b> The last word lies with the Chairman. I thank
the members of the Committee for their generous comments, which I will
ensure are brought to the attention of my co-Chairmen. I thank all
those responsible for the orderly conduct of the Committee. That is,
the Clerks&#151;who do a wonderful job; I do not think that the House
fully appreciates their excellent work&#151;the <i class="I">Hansard
</i>reporters, the police and the Doorkeepers, all of whom are
essential to the orderly conduct of a Public Bill Committee.</div>
<a name="08112051000406"></a><div class="hs_Para">May I
congratulate those on the Front Benches, particularly the Minister? I
always admire a Minister who deals with a Bill on his own. It certainly
is not easy; he cannot get away. Like the Chairman, he has to sit there
all the time, but perhaps unlike the Chairman, the Minister must be on
top form and the master of his brief. All those on the Front
Benches&#151;the Official Opposition, the Liberal Democrats and the
Government&#151;have made this, for me, a very enjoyable
Committee.</div>
<a name="08112051000407"></a><div class="hs_Para">To end on a
positive note, I really enjoy my job on the Chairmen&#146;s Panel.
One gets to know colleagues in all parts of the House very much better
and one can establish an understanding and a relationship with them,
which I believe is what makes Parliament a great place to be a Member
of. I thank the Committee for the way in which it has dealt with the
Bill. We did not debate it all, but I am sure that the Government will
try to ensure that those parts to which the hon. Member for Cambridge
drew attention get priority during the remaining stages of the
Bill.</div>
