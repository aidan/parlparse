<P>
<B>Mr. Nigel Waterson </B>(Eastbourne): Thank you, Mrs. Michie, and good afternoon to you.
<P>
I was in the middle of saying-it may have been famous last words- that we did not wish to engage in a seminar on the benefits of proportional representation or alternative voting systems. Let us hope that that keeps the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) on his seat. When a Liberal Democrat dies, the words ``proportional representation'' are engraved on his heart. I cannot help feeling that the hon. Member for Bath will be moved to say something about that at some stage of the debate.
<P>
I was arguing that the business of taking second preferences into account represents a gross distortion of the voting system. To put it mildly, it is unhelpful and impractical of the Government to introduce new constitutional arrangements when the British public have been content and comfortable with the current system for so many years. These wholly unfamiliar systems will lead, as they did in London-[Interruption.] Ministers may find this risible, but it is no laughing matter. The fact remains that many London voters were, in practice, disenfranchised because they were nervous of and did not understand the system. There is scope for confusion and the evidence is there for all to see. It is symptomatic of a Government who are hell-bent on change for change's sake.
<P>
I was reading a day-old and expensive copy of The Times while I was away for a few days during the recess, when I noticed that the great pact between Labour and the Liberal Democrats has reared its ugly head again. Apparently, there is to be a deal for a referendum after the next election. That seems presumptuous and we have heard it all before.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster </B>(Bath): Yes, and nothing happened.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I have a suspicion that it never will. One reason is the strong view, held both on the Government Back Benches and in Labour local government, that it is not a good idea and that the present system is more appropriate. Why should many Labour councillors be sacrificed on the altar of greater palliness at national level between the two parties?
<P>
On this occasion, the Liberal Democrats have produced a system that exacerbates the defects of the system that has already been proposed. They seem to have refrained from their usual preference for a system that involves voters ranking candidates-hence the intervention of the hon. Member for Bath.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman aware that he has misread the amendment, which requires electors to rank their preferences in order?
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> Well, blow me. I am determined, as I said to you earlier, Mrs. Michie, that our debate does not turn into a seminar on proportional representation. The arcane workings, windings and complexities of electoral arrangements may be meat and drink to members of the Liberal Democrat party, but they leave me and the vast majority of electors cold. I shall leave it to the hon. Gentleman to explain his amendment.
<P>
It is good that none of the hon. Gentleman's London colleagues is sitting in Committee-otherwise we would have had an explanation of how, under such a system, they would have differentiated between the candidates of the UK Independence party and of the Pro-Motorists and Small Shops party, given that motorists and the independence of the United Kingdom are what the Liberal Democrats most want to do away with.
<P>
The Liberal Democrats have proposed a half-way house between this and the Government's system, whereby voters will-perhaps mercifully-be restricted to two votes, but with no limit on the number of rounds of votes counting. Most of the time, I suspect that that will make little difference to the end-result, but it would be an expensive and time-consuming indulgence. No doubt the hon. Member for Bath will try to dress this up as a fair electoral system, but in reality, it is nothing of the sort.
<P>
The only purpose that amendment No. 293 could serve-and the only way in which it could make a tangible difference to the result-is to make it possible for candidates who do not receive either the first or second largest number of first preference votes to come through the field and win. Apart from its undesirability, it is pure cynicism from a party that has a long-standing habit of finishing third or fourth.
<P>
In contrast, the Conservative amendments would permit mayors to be elected under the same simple system by which every member of the Committee and every local councillor in the country is currently elected-the British system, which has served us so well for many years and is based on the principle that whoever gets the most votes wins. It is not only profoundly democratic and fair, but simple to operate. There is no appetite for change among the British people or, with the exception of the hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate (Mr. Twigg), on the Government Back Benches.
<P>
Would not the people of London have been baffled-though some in Downing street mightily relieved-if second preference votes had combined to prevent the hon. Member for Brent, East (Mr. Livingstone) winning the mayoral race? The argument for tinkering with the first-past-the-post system rests on the notion that it somehow gives the victor an improved mandate and greater credibility in office. In fact, nothing could be further from the truth. A candidate who comes second or third on first preferences and garners enough second preferences to win the day cannot and will not be held in the same respect as a candidate who has won the most votes on first preferences. Such a candidate would be seen as someone who got lucky as a result of the system and won the election, despite having lost the race. The office of elected mayor would be undermined and damaged. That is why I urge the Committee to support our amendments and to vote against the proposals of the Government and the Liberal Democrats.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> Disingenuously, I could begin by saying that I had not intended to speak in the debate, but that the comments of the hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Waterson) forced me to my feet.
<P>
The Committee has before it three options for electing a mayor in areas where it has been decided by a referendum that that is the way forward. The first option is the Government's supplementary vote. The second is the Conservative first-past-the-post system. My amendment proposes the third alternative vote option.
<P>
The hon. Member for Eastbourne referred to anoraks on the Committee regarding electoral reform. Let me say from the outset that I am not an anorak on that matter; nor do I claim to be an expert. I am clear, however, that none of the three options falls into the category of proportional representation. The hon. Gentleman's remarks about what is written on the heart of dead Liberal Democrats are irrelevant to the debate. However, having a fair voting system matters greatly not just to Liberal Democrats, but to other parties and to the public.
<P>
The question that we should address is which of the three options before us provides the fairest system of voting. It is clear from the deliberations that took place on these issues in another place that the Government are totally opposed to the Conservative proposal of first-past-the-post. I very much welcome that. I am also pleased that Lord Whitty made it clear that he thought that the argument between the supplementary vote and the alternative vote system was a fine one. He went so far as to suggest that the real argument against making a change from AV to the SV was largely because, rightly or wrongly, the Government decided to use SV for the London mayoral election.
<P>
Lord Whitty was fair when he admitted:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>It may be said that one difficulty we brought upon ourselves; namely, that we have already adopted the supplementary vote system for London-[Official Report, House of Lords, 1 February 2000; Vol. 609, c. 174.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He went on to argue that it would perhaps be inappropriate to make a change because it would lead to some confusion in the minds of the electorate about all the different voting systems in different parts of the country. While I welcome his honesty, I believe that he was mistaken. After concluding that the mayoral elections in London did not use the best option, the common-sense solution is to move to the better system, if not the best system.
<P>
The hon. Member for Eastbourne may not have read the amendment carefully, but the proposal for AV is clearly laid out. It makes it clear how the system would work and that the electorate would have the opportunity to rank the candidates. It would, incidentally, allow people to make it clear which candidates they particularly did not want to get elected, a point that the hon. Gentleman mentioned. Indeed, when some people vote in this type of election they start at the top with the one or two people whom they most want to hold the post. They then go to the bottom of the ballot paper to fill in the names of those they want least and finally they fill in the ones in the middle.
<P>
The advantage of the alternative vote system is that it ensures that we elect someone who can be seen to have the support of a majority of those who cast their votes, which is not the case under the supplementary vote system. That was accepted by a number of speakers in another place. Indeed, under the supplementary vote system someone could be elected as mayor with as little as 28 per cent. support of those who turned out to vote. We are particularly keen on AV because it ensures the support from the majority of those who voted. It is not a proportional system as the hon. Member for Eastbourne said. It could be called a majoritarian system. There is no doubt that SV has some element of that within it but is only a partly majoritarian system. The advantages of SV over first past the post are clear. If that were the only choice available to Liberal Democrats we would certainly support it in preference to first-past-the-post, but we are convinced that AV is better than SV.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The interesting thing is that we are not alone in believing that. The Labour party believes that AV is better than SV. For some reason that I have yet to work out it does not want to have AV for mayoral elections, but it uses it for its leadership elections. AV is used in many Labour wards to select candidates. It is clear that the Labour party is on a bit of a knife edge on this issue. Given that there is a real advantage in adopting for mayoral elections the same system that it adopts for the election of its leader and prospective parliamentary candidates in many parts of the country, the Government may be persuaded to accept our amendment.
<P>
The huge advantage of AV over SV is that people can genuinely consider the merits of all candidates. Under the SV system, some people's votes can be totally ignored. If we look at the mayoral election in London and I shall use an example that is against my own party just to illustrate the point. Anyone who wished to vote for Susan Kramer, the Liberal Democrat, with their second preference going to the Green party candidate, would have had no effect on the outcome of the election, as Susan Kramer did not come in the top two. Under the AV system their votes could have had an influence on the outcome.
<P>
AV is a much fairer system. It is easily understood by the electorate-it must be if the Labour party uses it in its internal election-and it therefore has considerable merit. The only argument that the Government have advanced against its introduction is that they got it wrong in London and so they want to continue to get it wrong in the rest of the country. I am therefore sure that they will come to their senses and accept this fine amendment and at the same time support us in rejecting the Conservative proposal of first-past-the-post.

<P>

<B>The Minister of State for Local Government and the Regions (Ms Hilary Armstrong):</B> It will not surprise the Opposition that the Government oppose all the amendments in the group. The Conservative amendments would simply return us to a first-past-the-post system. That would not assist the election of directly elected mayors because we want to ensure that we do not allow the election of a mayor who was opposed by the majority of those voting. That could easily happen under the first-past-the-post system. If five people stood and the highest percentage of the vote that any of them got was 29 per cent., that would be a small mandate. Indeed, it would not be a mandate on which to be elected to the mayoral role that we discussed earlier. The mayor will represent a large number of people and will take important decisions on their behalf. We have all talked about mandates and a simple majority system does not deliver the sort of mandate that the public would expect for a mayor.
<P>
I listened carefully to the arguments made by the hon. Member for Bath. It is interesting that he says that the Labour party uses the alternative vote system. We have never called it that; we call it the exhaustive ballot system. A voter's second choice is involved only when the first choice has been knocked out, which is different from AV.
<P>
The Government considered a system that entailed two election days, which is used in other countries. However, we decided that it would not be right for the British system: it would be expensive and certainly would not encourage more people to vote.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> Will the right hon. Lady explain the differences between the exhaustive vote system-she uses that title for what I would call AV-and AV, other than the fact that the time scale in an exhaustive ballot system is a longer drawn-out affair than under AV? As I understand it, the mechanisms and the ordering of candidates by preference are exactly the same. That is certainly the view of electoral experts with whom I have spoken.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I suspect that none of those people has actually participated in an exhaustive ballot system. There is a level of tactical voting at each stage that simply does not exist if people vote for all their preferences at the same time. Many Labour party members relish getting involved in that tactical rollercoaster. The experience is very different from what the hon. Member for Bath describes as an AV system.
<P>
However, this debate is not about an internal ballot, but about a ballot in which the public will participate directly to elect a mayor. We must ensure that such a system produces someone who commands a majority of those voting. The SV system achieves that. I accept that there are other arguments for the AV system. I do not disagree with my noble Friend, Lord Whitty's view that both systems have merits. However, we have gone for SV, not only in the Greater London elections but in the elections in Scotland and Wales-[Interruption.] No, we did not; we went for something totally different there. As we roll out new systems, we are trying to ensure that there is consistency among them.
<P>
I want to respond to one issue in the speech made by the hon. Member for Eastbourne. Clearly, the Government are interested in all the experiments that took place during the recent elections. There are useful lessons to be learned, but it is a little early to discuss those. A proper evaluation of all those experiments is being carried out, and we would be wise to wait for the results. No one has suggested that the only way to increase turnout is to change the voting method or the opportunity to vote. Of course, that is not the whole picture, and I have never tried to pretend that it is. People should feel that the institution is relevant and will make a difference to their lives, and therefore that voting matters. I recognise the merits of the AV system, but the SV system also has advantages. Although the balance is fine, the Government think that the SV system has the edge. I hope that the hon. Member for Eastbourne will withdraw his amendment, because the Government cannot support it.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Curry </B>(Skipton and Ripon): I do not take the dogmatic view that every situation demands first past the post. By and large, the electoral system should reflect the social and political circumstances in a country and deliver particular objectives. For example, it was important in Northern Ireland to ensure that every aspect of the community-whatever that means-was represented and had a stake in the Government, and a system was chosen to ensure that. I understand that, although I cannot imagine how on earth a Government is run on that basis.
<P>
Before lunch, we discussed directly elected executive members. In a sense, that is what the Northern Ireland system delivered. I cannot imagine how collective responsibility will hold between a Sinn Fein Minister of Education and an Ulster Unionist Minister, so one must be careful, but in some circumstances one might incline towards such a system. There are frequent complaints about the people of the United Kingdom being an unexcitable race, and we get particularly unexcited about politics and local elections. However, those social imperatives are as much present here as elsewhere.
<P>
The right hon. Lady's use of the words ``mandate'' and ``legitimacy'' bothers me. I shall pass over the word ``relevant'', because that is used increasingly in politics when we cannot think of the right word. We use the word ``appropriate'' similarly. Often, the person with the most first preference votes will win the office. That may reinforce the legitimacy of the position. However, one must be cautious before saying, like the right hon. Lady, that someone who does not receive the most first preferences, but becomes mayor by virtue of preferences for other candidates, can claim a degree of legitimacy. I would feel thwarted if the person for whom I had voted and who had received the biggest number of first preference votes did not assume the job because of second preferences. Those votes were probably for the most inoffensive candidate, rather than the boldest candidate with the strongest ideas. One should be careful before adducing legitimacy from such an outcome.
<P>
It is a red herring to say that the system will affect the number of people voting. I do not believe that for a row of beans. People either vote or do not vote, and the electoral system has no influence. People do not say, ``Fred, you've got to come out and vote this time because it's the alternative vote system now.'' The system is not an incentive, and the world is not like that. Either people feel that an election matters or they do not.
<P>
I have a suggestion for the Minister. I do not understand why we should all be the same. The supplementary vote system was adopted in Scotland, Wales and London. So what? Why does uniformity matter? The Minister kept telling us before lunch that the Government wanted to let the electors decide. Why not ask the electors which system they prefer, in a referendum? We should let them decide not only whether they want a mayor, but which system they prefer. What could be more liberal than allowing them to make up their minds? Then they could choose first past the post, or one of the Liberal Democrat formulae whose mechanism one requires a degree in statistics to understand and whose ballot takes 17 days to count.
<P>
If that is what the electorate want, that is fine. Why do we not really trust the people, rather than trust them only to choose between the options that we define for them, which is as far as the Government's liberalism goes? Why not let a thousand flowers bloom? If Leeds, Essex, Harrogate or Newton-le-Willows want to choose by a different system, it does not matter-that is what the people have chosen. Why does it have to be uniform? Why does the Minister not make a wonderful gesture and say ``We really do trust the people this time. They can choose not merely whether they want it, but how they get it.''? That truly would be exciting.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I was slow to rise to my feet in case any more anoraks on the other side of the Committee wanted to show us how clever they are. I notice that the hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate has been excused his duties this afternoon and I cannot imagine why.
<P>
I do not wish to labour the arguments. We heard a great deal about mandates from the hon. Member for Bath in Liberal autopilot mode, telling us how wonderful all the new systems will be. He is tinkering with the British voting system. He spoke at length about the so-called extra mandate that would result from the new systems, but my right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon (Mr. Curry) exploded that argument. The notion that it will make a difference in the real world is bizarre.
<P>
We heard much about the exhaustive ballot system used in the Labour party. How interesting that that system was not good enough to choose the Labour candidate for the London mayoral election! Instead, Labour chose a Heath Robinson electoral college system with a label on it saying, ``Use once and throw away''. I cannot imagine why it will not be used again. All the elephant traps, cogs, wheels and bits of string had only one aim-to stop an individual becoming the candidate. It worked. The only problem was that the candidate who had been stopped went on to become the mayor. The ballot for mayoral candidates was simply rigged.
<P>
There may be a scintilla of common ground between the hon. Member for Bath and me. He was right to say that there is no great enthusiasm on the part of Ministers for the proposed system. I have never heard such a pathetically weak ministerial promotion of a scheme as that made by the Minister for Local Government and the Regions. Her line was, ``It is not a terribly good system, but we have used it in London and it was a great success, apart from getting the wrong person elected. Only 3 per cent. more voters bothered to vote in London than anywhere else. Nevertheless, we have the system in Wales and Scotland, which has also been a roaring success, so we may as well have it in the rest of the country.'' My right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon was absolutely right.
<P>
I do not blame the Minister for holding her head in her hands: it is diabolical; she has a sticky wicket and I feel desperately sorry for her. If Ministers cannot recommend the system with any enthusiasm-let alone argue the toss with our view of first past the post or the Liberal Democrat view, both of which have been argued enthusiastically-what does that say? Tinkering with the system has to be justified, particularly in the light of what happened-or, rather, what did not happen-in London. The London experience showed that many more people did not turn out to vote.
<P>
There are only two good reasons for changing the system. One is to give the winner greater legitimacy or more of a mandate; the other is to achieve greater voter participation or interest and secure a higher turnout. We are not speaking theoretically. An election has taken place in our capital city with millions of people able to participate. Many of them did not bother and stayed at home. For any system to be remotely credible and worthy of inclusion in the Bill, it must promote either or both of those effects. It must be worth the voters while to go and vote, as my right hon. Friend said; and I cannot believe that the hon. Member for Brent, East would suggest that he acquired greater legitimacy from the cock-eyed system under which he was elected on 4 May.
<P>
We feel strongly about this important matter of principle. The Government have not even tried, let alone succeeded, in putting forward a proper case for change. I invite my right hon. and hon. Friends to vote for our amendment.

<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Ms Beverley Hughes):</B> I beg to move amendment No. I80, in page 23, line 37, after `election' insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`for the return'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Clause 39 simply defines the franchise for voting at an election for an elected mayor and provides that the people entitled to vote at such an election are those who would be entitled to vote for the election of a councillor in the area. Amendment No. 180 is a minor drafting change to ensure that the description of mayoral elections is consistent throughout the Bill. The usual description is an election ``for the return'' of someone-in this case, an elected mayor. The amendment will bring the wording of clause 39 into line with the rest of the Bill.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<B>Ms Beverley Hughes:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 181, in page 24, line 14, leave out `the election expenses of candidates' and insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`election expenses'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This minor and technical amendment deals with the power of the Secretary of State to make regulations about the conduct of elections for an elected mayor. The amendment simply changes the reference in subsection (2)(c) to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the limitation of the election expenses of candidates<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
to a more general reference to election expenses. The specific reference to candidates' expenses might suggest that the Secretary of State does not have the power to limit election expenses by another body or person-third-party expenses. That would be a serious omission, and it is an important aspect of our general control of election expenses that we can limit what people or bodies other than candidates spend on election expenses. The amendment will ensure that we can limit third-party expenses as well as those of candidates.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 183 to 186, 188, 189, 195, Clause 43 stand part, Government amendments, Nos, 199, 201 and 203 to 209.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> On a point of order, Mrs. Michie. Could we have an explanation of why clause 43 stand part has been included in this group, when clause 43 itself appears later on the selection list? I do not seek to be difficult, merely to understand.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Clause 43 is grouped with this group of amendments. It should not appear after clause 42 on the selection list and should be ignored. Is that clear?
<P>
<B>Mr. Robert Ainsworth </B>(Coventry, North-East): Further to that point of order, Mrs. Michie. Clause 43 stand part is grouped with these amendments because their effect will be to remove clause 43. Once the argument for doing that has been made, we will vote against clause 43 stand part. It is therefore appropriate for it to be debated at this point.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Yes, but we will still vote on clause 43 stand part.
<P>
<B>Ms Beverley Hughes:</B> Thank you for that clarification, Mrs. Michie.
<P>
This is a large group of amendments and although they are important, they are essentially technical amendments to tidy up the provisions in clauses 42, 43 and 92. They come at this point in our proceedings because they are consequential to clause 40. Clause 42 gives the Secretary of State the power to make such incidental, consequential, transitional or supplementary provisions as he considers necessary or expedient to give effect to part II of the Bill. Clause 43 was intended to allow the Secretary of State, by order, to make modifications to enactments, which are necessary to give full effect to any provision of part II. Similar provision is also included in clause 92 in respect of provisions made in orders or regulations under any provision in the Bill.
<P>
When we looked at that again we concluded that the powers in clauses 42 and 43 need to be straightened out to ensure that they work properly and that two separate clauses are no longer necessary, so clause 43 can be deleted. I know that it is not easy to understand when there is a long string of Government amendments, but, in summary, clause 43 should be deleted from the Bill and the powers in clauses 42 and 92 adjusted to provide the scope to make such incidental, consequential, transitional or supplementary provisions as the Secretary of State considers necessary or expedient. [Interruption.] I need to get that on the record and I beg hon. Members' indulgence.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Hon. Members are experienced enough to know that many Bills require provision for the Secretary of State to be able to make such changes to the Bill itself and to other legislation that the Bill will affect. We intend to table amendments on Report that will provide a full schedule of the major modifications to other primary legislation that are needed properly to implement the policy in part II. We have delayed tabling the amendments until Report to ensure that they fully reflect the Bill as amended in Committee and thus save amending further the amendments that we make now.
<P>
The provisions in clauses 42 and 92, as we propose to amend them, will mirror the standard provisions in other Acts of Parliament. They are needed to enable provisions to be made to ensure that the policy works properly and, importantly, to tidy up and rationalise the legislation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I rise to ask a brief question. I have had some difficulty coming to terms with this. The Under-Secretary generously acknowledged that it is difficult to deal with a string of amendments. I could be churlish and ask her to explain the precise implication of amendment No. 206, but I shall not. The amendments talk about the possibility of making changes to enactments, or an ``enactment'' as it will now be, ``whenever passed or made''. Does that mean that if some future legislation appears to be in conflict with the Bill, it will have its enactments changed because of this legislation? If that is the case it is a rather bizarre notion.
<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> The hon. Gentleman will know that whenever there are two different pieces of legislation, the new legislation is normally the vehicle for making provision for changing existing legislation. I cannot answer him any more fully than that, unless he has some particular example in mind that I shall try to help him with.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I am genuinely not trying to be difficult. The legislation for which the Under-Secretary seeks our support refers to enactments ``whenever passed or made''. That presumably includes enactments that are made at some time in the future. As the Minister rightly said, normally future enactments are designed to change existing legislation. This appears to give primacy to this Bill rather than to future legislation. I am genuinely confused.
<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> I am still not clear whether the hon. Gentleman is talking about any future legislation or whether when he refers to enactments and new enactments he is asking whether any retrospective tidying up will be required if the Secretary of State makes available new forms of executive, which we discussed previously.
<P>
Clauses 42 and 92 as amended are necessary to ensure that full effect can be given to new forms of executive made available under clause 11(6), in the light of a council's experience of operating executive arrangements. If the hon. Gentleman is referring to that, the answer is that the clauses as amended will facilitate full implementation of the policy and give effect to any new arrangements that the Secretary of State may allow.
<P>
I apologise to the hon. Gentleman, because I feel that we may be at cross-purposes. If he wants to speak to me afterwards, I will certainly try to assist him.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> On a point of order, Mrs. Michie. Is it in order for the Minister to suggest private tutorials with individual Committee members on an important and complex point?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> That is not a point of order for the Chair.
<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> I will not respond to that point, which was mischievous. I think that the hon. Member for Bath understands my point. If he is speaking generally about any future enactment, the normal procedures to ensure that legislation is consistent will prevail. If he is talking about new models that may be available in several years' time in a subsequent Act, the provisions will need to be changed to accommodate the current position. I am sorry that I cannot explain my answer more clearly, but the hon. Gentleman's question was not clear enough to allow me to deal with it more effectively.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> I will not. Hon. Members understand that the amendments are necessary to tidy up the Bill and to allow clauses 42 and 92 to provide the power to make minor, incidental or consequential amendments later. Those provisions give the Secretary of State the normal power that many Acts contain.
<P>

<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 187, in page 24, line 43, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) If the result of a referendum held by virtue of regulations or an order made under any provision of this Part is to approve the proposals to which the referendum relates, the local authority concerned must implement those proposals in accordance with any provision made by the regulations or order.
<P>

</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment provides that any referendums required by virtue of regulations or orders under part II are binding. That applies to referendums required by petition or because a council wants to change the form of its executive arrangements. Such a requirement already exists for referendums that an authority instigates for first-time proposals, under clause 26. For all other referendums, the amendment will require that if the referendum supports the proposals, they must be implemented in accordance with the regulations or order, and that if the referendum rejects the proposals, they must not be implemented and the authority must instead comply with the provisions in the regulations or order. The amendment is necessary to avoid confusion for councils or local voters. It must be clear in the Bill that all referendums held under part II are binding on the authority. If local people vote in a referendum, they have the right to expect that the result will be followed through.

<B>Mr. Tim Loughton </B>(East Worthing and Shoreham): We have no objection to the amendment. It seems sensible that, if a referendum takes place, the council should be bound to abide by its findings, whether for or against the question asked. We are perfectly happy to accept the amendment.

<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 86, in page 25, leave out line 12 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(a) for independent scrutiny of the question to be asked in a referendum'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It falls to me to deal with the provisions for referendums, on the basis that I am the only Front-Bench Member here who knows the plural of referendum-we shall probably read that tomorrow. In place of subsection (6)(a), the amendment would insert:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>for independent scrutiny of the question to be asked in a referendum.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Under the catch-all subsection (3), the Secretary of State has enormous powers of discretion over the regulations. However, he should not be the sole arbiter of the wording of the referendum question, given his immense powers to determine the way in which referendums work. It is important to get the referendum question right, given that only one referendum can take place every five years. The notes that accompany clause 41-just nine lines-do not do justice to a lot of the detail in the clause. The issue has arisen only because the Government failed to take on board many of the Neill committee recommendations about setting up a truly independent referendum commission to oversee the conduct of referendums and the inadequacies of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Bill. Of course, a Conservative private Member's Bill would have given extra meat to the independence of such a commission.
<P>
The regulations under the subsection provide that the question be put in one particular form, which is specified in those regulations. It is right that there should be some means of preventing councils from adapting the question to favour or rig a desired result. However, there is a strong argument that the decision should be subject to some form of independent arbitration. Given that the Secretary of State may direct an authority to conduct a referendum in the first place, it is questionable whether it is appropriate for him to be the sole arbiter of the wording. Our amendment would make provision for that independent scrutiny.
<P>
One concern is that the wording of the question does not permit local authorities to put a range of options before voters. The Government intend to compel authorities to adopt fall-back arrangements in the event of a referendum being defeated, but there will be no opportunity for the electors to pass judgment on those arrangements. The regulations stipulate that the fall-back proposals are published, but it is inevitable, as the question does not make the choice clear, that debate about such cases would centre on the idea of having a mayor. People will vote yes or no to that proposition. They will not be entirely in the dark about the fall-back proposals, which may not generate much publicity, but might constitute a significant departure from the status quo.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
By going down the route of independent scrutiny, authorities could put the question in a form that clearly sets out the options on offer, while remaining subject to outside scrutiny to ensure that the dice are not loaded.
<P>
<B>Ms Beverley Hughes:</B> I follow the hon. Gentleman's reasoning. I, too, recognise the importance of ensuring that the wording of referendum questions is fair and unbiased. We certainly share that objective. In pursuing it, however, we adopted a different approach.
<P>
In the consultation paper on the conduct of referendums and elections for directly elected mayors, which went out recently, we suggested further refinements to the wording of the question that will appear on the ballot papers. The original suggestion for the wording was included in the first round of consultation. We worded it in order to ensure that there would be no scope for variation other than inserting the name of the local authority. Our approach to ensuring fairness and lack of bias in the main question is to make it the same in all referendums. The actual wording will be the result of the consultation process that we have embarked on now. The question is intended to be as neutral as possible and I hope that when hon. Members examine the document they will agree that it is. Any strong views expressed in consultation will be taken into account. Through consultation, we hope that the wording will be widely accepted.
<P>
I remind the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Mr. Loughton) that Parliament will have the opportunity to debate the question again when the final draft of the regulations comes back before the House. The final detail of procedures is subject to the affirmative resolution procedure.
<P>
In the light of those assurances, I hope that the hon. Gentleman accepts that we are as concerned as he is about the objective of fairness and lack of bias in the wording of the question, albeit that we have adopted a different mechanism for achieving it. I hope that he will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> That provides some assurance, but the Minister must admit that these problems would not have come about if we had a firmer independent referendum commission. We want the wording of future referendum questions to be unambiguously independent. Much discretion still falls to the Secretary of State to change the terms of the questions in the future. The Minister is right that it will be subject, after consultation, to the affirmative resolution of the House, but we do not know how extensive the responses to consultation will be, or how circumstances might change in the future.
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Eastbourne already mentioned, we are talking not only about an individual question that might be posed in an individual council on one election day, but about a super Thursday in which the question will apply to a raft of councils throughout the country. The question finally approved by the Secretary of State will be highly influential in affecting the policies and format of many councils. The Minister assured us that the Government were mindful of the sensitivities of the wording. On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 339, in page 25, leave out lines 13 to 15 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`limiting the expenditure on publicity in connection with a referendum by both sides of the referendum campaign, including by the Government and/or by any government agencies.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take Government amendment No. 190.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> The amendment relates to the all-encompassing subsection (3), which gives extensive powers to the Secretary of State. This is a probing amendment to determine the extent of control freakery over the execution of referendums that the Secretary of State proposes to institute.
<P>
The amendment would delete subsection (6)(b), under which the Secretary of State has enormous discretion with regard to what publicity can be given to the running of referendums. Worse still, it gives discretion with regard to what publicity can be given to the result. If the referendum were to produce a result that the Government did not want-for instance, if it found that the whole executive process, on which the Government are so keen, had been an unmitigated disaster-the Government would be loath to allow any publicity on the result, as it would be an admission that their proposed system had failed. If that failure pertained to many councils, and the results of referendums were unfavourable to the Executive, that would be a political blow. I am therefore puzzled that the subsection should effectively allow the Secretary to State to hush the results of a referendum for which he has given permission. That also raises issues in relation to the proposed referendum on whether sterling should enter the euro, should such a referendum ever take place. What question will be asked? What publicity will be afforded nationally, to back the Government's stance?
<P>
The Government's regulations were issued recently, as the Minister acknowledged. The Government said that they are minded to change the draft regulations so that local authorities may issue factual information, such as press releases, on their proposals, including factual information to counter or rebut inaccuracies. Can the Minister confirm that that will now apply? Will it be gospel in terms of the conduct of future referendums?
<P>
The regulations include details of the consultation period proposals on what expenses would be allowed by local councils. Will the Government be bound by expenses formula in relation to what they spend on publicity nationally to back their preferred referendum result? Will the Minister comment on that? It is not enough to say that local councils should not be able to load the dice to obtain the result that they want. There must also be limitations on the Government in that regard. That argument took place during discussion of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Bill, which was introduced in the wake of the Neill report.
<P>
That is why we want to remove from the clause the Secretary of State's enormous discretion with regard to giving publicity to the referendum and its result. The Neill report stated that the Government of the day, in future referendums, should remain neutral, and should not distribute at public expense literature, even purportedly factual literature, setting out or otherwise promoting their case. We need further clarification of how the Neill recommendations-of which the Government like to believe that they have adopted more than they have-interact with the restrictions being placed on local councils and the 28-day ruling on publicity and whether the information is factual. It is no good restricting councils' participation in such activity if the Government are doing councils' job for them but concentrating only on one side of the argument. That is important not only because of the implications for local government reorganisation but for all the other referendums that the Government are contemplating, whether on the euro or other questions on the horizon. Removing the provision would restrict the Secretary of State's publicity budget and the resources available to him that would not be available to an alternative side. I should like the Minister to reassure us about how the provisions will interact with the restrictions being placed on local authorities.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Ms Beverley Hughes:</B> Despite the rhetoric, I do not believe that there is much difference between members on both sides of the Committee on this matter. We are starting from the principle that the two sides in a referendum campaign should each have an opportunity to put their case. As always, it is important that no individual organisation should be able to gain disproportionate attention or weight for its views simply because it has access to substantial resources. We accept the principle that in order to prevent referendums from being skewed in that way, from whichever side or party, we need to provide a mechanism to limit expenditure and discourage excessive spending.
<P>
Campaign expenditure may not be much of an issue in many referendums. Campaigns may largely be conducted through the media. However, that in itself is not a reason for not putting in place a suitable system for controlling expenditure. Amendment No. 190 will do just that in a way that will avoid some of the misunderstanding and difficulties that would arise under the Opposition amendment No. 339. Amendment No. 190 amends the Secretary of State's power to make regulations on the conduct of referendums on elected mayors. It ensures that such regulations may include provision for the limitation of referendum expenditure-that is, campaign expenditure incurred during the campaign by political parties, interest groups and others who want to achieve a particular outcome in the referendum.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman mentioned expenses incurred by different groups. The draft regulations, which we first issued in January and circulated again in conjunction with the consultation paper on the conduct of referendums, to which he referred, detail how we intend to deal with referendum expenditure. Briefly, we propose a straightforward cash limit that would apply to any person or organisation that incurs campaign expenditure, and it would be a criminal offence to exceed that limit. We have suggested that the limit should be calculated by reference to a formula, details of which are in the consultation paper. We believe that it is important to strive to reach a consensus on the matter. That is what the consultation paper is designed to do and why we have issued it.
<P>
In moving his amendment, the hon. Gentleman placed great stress on the possibility of the Government or Government agencies campaigning during a referendum for a particular outcome. We need to make it absolutely clear that the Government would not, could not and should not have a role in campaigning in a referendum for a directly elected mayor. Our policy position is that the matter is for local people to decide. That is the point of the referendum. Our position of allowing for the possibility of elected mayors in generality is no secret, but we have never claimed that it would be the right course of action for every authority. The Government will not campaign for one side or another on any specific referendum. It would be wrong for the Government or any Government agency to do anything intended to affect the outcome of such a referendum.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
It is a well-established principle, one endorsed by Neill and others, that public funds are not used for political purposes. That principle is enshrined in the civil service code and the ministerial code, and is backed up periodically by advice to all civil servants during elections. The Government could not be a party to the outcome of any referendum and could not actively incur the expenditure of public funds to secure that outcome. The hon. Members for Eastbourne and for East Worthing and Shoreham raised that issue. I hope that they accept my categorical assurances on the matter, as it is important that it be well understood by all members of the Committee.
<P>
Another aspect of amendment No. 339 causes difficulty. The amendment would replace lines 13 to 15 on page 25, which is clause 41(6)(b)-a provision aimed at controlling publicity produced by the local authority on its proposals and the resulting referendum. That matter was also referred to by the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham. We intend to use the provision to make regulations requiring local authorities to provide a certain amount of publicity about their proposals once they have been sent to the Secretary of State. We propose that those regulations restrict the publication of promotional materials by local authorities in the four weeks immediately preceding a referendum. Both those proposals are being included in the consultation paper and the draft regulations of the conduct of referendums and elections.
<P>
I trust that the hon. Gentleman is broadly in agreement with the objectives of the provisions on which we are consulting. I hope that I have reassured him on the main issues about which he was concerned. We certainly do not disagree and have come to those conclusions ourselves. I hope that he will withdraw the amendment and support the Government amendment, which seeks to achieve the same outcome on such matters.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I am only partially reassured. The Minister slightly scratched credibility when she clearly stated that it is enshrined that public funds are not used for political purposes. Many of us would take issue with the way in which funds are already being allocated to, for example, pro-euro groups. This week, we have had the statistic that the Government spend more on advertising in this country than anyone else, including publicly quoted multi-national companies. It stretches the limits of credibility to say that much of that Government expenditure is not for party political purposes. We shall have that argument on other subjects.
<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> Would the hon. Gentleman like to give an example of that? Perhaps he is talking about the current campaign to increase pensioners' take-up of pensions? Does he regard that as a political objective?
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> We have seen a big example in the past few days, which I am surprised did not occur to the Minister. I refer to the phrasing of the questions in the so-called national health service consultation exercise. It was little more than a propaganda campaign to cover the fact that Labour has had 18 years in opposition and three years in government to come up with proposals for the NHS and has signally failed to do so. If she objectively viewed those questions and the 500,000 that has been expended on publicity material to promote the campaign, she would be hard pressed to say that that was not promoting Government propaganda and policies. However, that is an argument for another day, and we shall agree to differ on the definition of consultation.
<P>
Although the Under-Secretary has stretched credibility on this matter, I do not dispute the need to impose local expense limits. However, my point was not that, but whether the Government have a role in spending money. The Under-Secretary has given an assurance, about which we shall agree to differ for the moment, that the Government have no such role, but I find that hard to believe. It is highly likely that a super Thursday scenario will arise. We shall not find that Little Piddling in the Marsh, Cardiff and other councils hold referendums in different months; referendums will be held at the same time, and authorities throughout the country will be affected.
<P>
The Under-Secretary failed to say whether the 28-day ruling will cover the Government in respect of providing information, be it publicity for a referendum or, as the draft regulations suggest, factual corrections. I should appreciate an answer to that point. She also did not say why the Government feel it necessary to control publicity for the result of a referendum. One can argue that there should be controls-such as the 28-day ruling-on influencing electors before they go to the polls, but why does the Secretary of State need the power to inflict controls on publicity for the result? Surely the whole world should be free to see whether Little Piddling in the Marsh has voted no to the executive structure, just as publicity concerning the conduct of that referendum should also be made available. That perfectly legitimate point explains my surprise at the part of subsection 6(b) that we are discussing.
<P>
We shall not press the matter to a vote, but genuine concerns arise that are not covered by nine lines of explanation in the accompanying notes, and I should appreciate a fuller response to them.
<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> I thought that I had answered the hon. Gentleman's question on the 28-day restriction on local authorities, but it seems that he cannot make a connection between consecutive sentences. I made it clear that the civil service, Ministers and the Government as a whole are already covered by the civil service code and the ministerial code, so there is no need further to regulate Government activity in this regard. The 28-day restriction will apply to local authorities because they are not so covered elsewhere.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> On that specific point, does that include factual corrections, as opposed to publicity on a referendum, which might be regarded as influencing a question? If it is clear that a local authority has factually misled, albeit unintentionally, will the Secretary of State have a role in putting right that factual error, which could constitute publicity, or will he have nothing to do with it, however great the error?
<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> The hon. Gentleman is trying to obfuscate the issue. Such an eventuality would have to be dealt with at the time. Depending on the magnitude of the error in the information published by a local authority, the process to that point might be invalidated. A judgment would have to be made, and it might not be right for the Government simply to publish something that was incorrect. To do so might not serve the main objective of clarification for the electorate's benefit.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman's second point concerned publicity for the result. That bemused me, because the clause has absolutely nothing to do with that; it deals with publicity during the campaign to ensure that councils do not use public money to promote one result or another. The clause refers to ``consequences of the referendum'', which is in order to enable regulations to require the proposals and the fall-back to be publicised. The provisions on publicity and restrictions are concerned with the process of the campaign, not the result.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I shall not push the matter much further. Two points emerge from the Under-Secretary's remarks. First, the more that she is pressed, the more that she has to admit that the meaning is not clear. On her point about publicity, it is a matter of plain bad wording-it can be interpreted in both ways. Many people will read it as being to do with the actual outcome of the result, not the scenario of an outcome.
<P>
Secondly, she stated categorically that under no circumstances whatever-or whatever words are recorded in Hansard-will the Secretary of State have any role in the conduct of the referendums nor seek to influence them at all. Now, because she did not know the answer, she has had to admit that the Secretary of State may play a role-
<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> No.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> The Under-Secretary just said that it would have to depend on the magnitude of the error and that a decision would be made at the time. The natural consequence of that is that the Secretary of State may intervene in referendums.
<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> Hansard will show what I actually said: that the hon. Gentleman needed to give some examples. If the erroneous information to which he referred was of such a magnitude that members of the public were confused, the question of whether the referendum should proceed to a conclusion without being invalidated would have to be considered-especially if members of the public complained.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> The Under-Secretary proves my point. She clearly said that circumstances may arise-however extreme, or however pernickety the error-in which there will be a role for the Secretary of State to impose himself. That was the question that I was asking. I could give examples, but that is not the point. The Under-Secretary has admitted that there is a potential scenario in which the Secretary of State could intervene to correct a factual error. That is not what she told us earlier.
<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> No.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> He does not want to give way now.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I am happy to give way, but the more that the Under-Secretary gets up and opens her mouth, the more she incriminates herself.
<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> What I allowed as a possibility was that if a referendum process was claimed by members of the public to be confusing or invalid due to grossly erroneous information, and an appeal was made to the Secretary of State, clearly he could not ignore that. That is wholly different from the hon. Gentleman's original proposition that the Secretary of State would put out his own publicity to correct information that somebody had said was factual. I specifically did not concede that eventuality; I simply allowed that the Secretary of State may, if asked, intervene if the conduct of the referendum is challenged locally.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> Hansard will not bear the Under-Secretary's words out. She categorically stated that the Secretary of State has no role to play. I specifically referred to the regulations with regard to the 28-day ruling on other than factual inaccuracies, which the Government are minded-to use their word-to allow. Will the same apply to the Secretary of State with regard to factual inaccuracies that the authority is guilty of putting out? The Under-Secretary has now chosen to use a different set of words: ``allowed as a possibility''. There are scenarios in which the Secretary of State could be involved in what could be conceived as publicity. That is the point that I was trying to make. The more the Under-Secretary was forced to think about it, the more she had to concede that there were scenarios in which the Secretary of State could have a role. [Interruption.]

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss amendment No. 66, in page 25, leave out lines 18 and 19.
<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> Government amendment No. 191 and amendment No. 66 address the manner in which a referendum poll will be taken. Clause 41(6)(d) was included in the Bill to allow the Secretary of State to make regulations providing for referendums to be conducted in a manner other than a traditional poll-that is, a manner that does not necessarily involve voters going in person to a polling station and marking their vote on a ballot paper.
<P>
Such alternative polling methods, on which we have touched during the debate, could include all-postal voting or electronic voting. The paragraph reflects the electoral piloting provisions in the Representation of the People Act 2000, under which a number of pilots were conducted at the local government elections last month. As hon. Members have pointed out, those pilots have yet to be evaluated; that will be done shortly.
<P>
It has come to our attention that the drafting of this provision might not achieve what was intended. We have therefore tabled Government amendment No. 191, which replaces the current paragraph (d) with two new paragraphs that more closely mirror the wording used in the relevant part of the Representation of the People Act 2000.
<P>
Amendment No. 66 would delete paragraph (d) altogether. That would remove the ability for referendum polling methods to reflect innovations piloted successfully under the Representation of the People Act in respect of local elections. That would result in an unfortunate loss of flexibility, which would prevent this legislation from keeping in step with any general changes to election practice that might emerge. As I mentioned, we have yet to evaluate the pilots that took place. There may be others. In the spirit of trying to improve levels of voter participation, we must enable this provision relating to the way in which referendum polls are taken to embrace any improvements that we may wish to introduce.
<P>
I hope that the Committee will accept amendment No. 191, and that the hon. Gentleman will not press amendment No. 66.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I speak in fear and trepidation of being accused of being elitist for challenging what the Government are trying to do, or worse, being accused of being a public school boy-which I assure the Committee I am not. It is extraordinary that the Government's obsession with that subject is even spilling over into the Standing Committee on the Local Government Bill. It is a sign that they are rattled and becoming ratty at this late hour. The Minister is now looking up my CV to make sure that I am telling the truth. She may like to look at Baroness Jay's details at the same time. [Interruption.] The Minister and the Under-Secretary are still muttering-they do not like what I am saying.
<P>
It is nice that, for once, the Government have admitted that they were wrong- that does not happen often. Perhaps we should break out the bubbly. The original wording was extraordinary-the proposal was to have a referendum without a poll, but what would that involve? Would it mean that only those electors whose names began with the letters A to K could vote, or that only people whose homes had a blue door could vote? The situation is extraordinary. Are not the Secretary of State's powers already wide enough? As a minimum requirement of the democratic process, there should be a guarantee that referendums will take place in the appropriate scenario. The Under-Secretary changed her words-she used the phrase, ``not traditional polls and alternative polling methods''. My understanding of a referendum it that it does not have to involve the traditional situation, in which a voter goes into a polling station and puts an X in a box. A referendum form of voting-the gerundive, the act of asking-can be conducted over the phone, perhaps by an opinion polling company, or electronic voting could be used. It is extraordinary how the phrase could have crept into the Bill.
<P>
Although the Under-Secretary has introduced a correcting amendment, we still take issue with her approach. The amendment's wording will leave open the possibility that regulations could be issued that would permit a referendum to take place without a poll. The Government have not clarified their intentions in that regard. Amendment No. 66 would remove that provision, pending further information about the proposal's purpose.
<P>
Although we are not 100 per cent. satisfied that the amendment to this appalling wording will do the job that the Under-Secretary thinks it will do, we shall not press the amendment to a vote.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>
Brought up, and read the First time.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
The main purpose of the new clause is to ensure that the Bill allows no one to be the elected mayor and a councillor for an electoral division or ward in the same authority. It would not be acceptable or understandable for someone to hold two offices in the same authority. If one person could be a member of an overview and scrutiny committee as a councillor, and question himself or herself on his or her decisions as am elected mayor, it would be-
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> Daft.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> The hon. Gentleman has got it-it would be daft. The new clause achieves its aims by providing for what is to happen in the various scenarios associated with election to both offices. It is right for a sitting mayor to be permitted to stand for election as a councillor in the same authority if the elections are held at the same time. For example, he or she might want to retire to the back benches or to have a chance, if the mayoral election is lost, of being elected a councillor and thus hold the new mayor to account. However, it would not be right for a sitting elected mayor to be able to stand for election as a councillor in the same authority if the elections were not held at the same time. The elected mayor should then be required to resign before standing for a seat on the council. A by-election for the office of elected mayor would follow. I hope that the Committee will agree that the purpose of the new clause is clear, prudent and sensible.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I have three points to make. First, the Minister may say that the theoretical possibility of the chairman of the scrutiny committee questioning himself on his role as elected mayor is downright daft. Frankly, however, there are one or two Labour councils where that possibility would be embraced with alacrity. Some of our friends in the north would be delighted by the prospect. It would be manna from heaven.
<P>
My second point is the obverse of the earlier debate on our amendment about the mayor not voting in council. It seemed to us that the Government were facing in both directions on the question whether the mayor's role and mandate were separate, so that he or she could not really be a member of the authority.
<P>
My third point is to observe that the measure is really a sort of coward's charter. A sitting councillor need not even gamble his or her entire political career and credibility on having a go at the mayoralty, as it would be possible to stand for both that and the council and end up with a consolation prize if all else failed. That undermines what we thought was the Government's concept of two separate mandates. I shall not suggest that the Committee divide, but the clause raises puzzling issues.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>

<P>

</UL></FONT>
<P>
Brought up, and read the First time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I beg to move, that the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
One of the key concerns that we have learned about from all our soundings across the spectrum of local government is many councillors' fear of a two-tier system of different classes of councillor. The new clause is intended to ensure a proper role for every councillor. Some councils are doing the right thing by trying to secure that. I dealt in detail earlier in our deliberations with the example of Bedfordshire, where there is real determination to secure a role for every councillor, in the cabinet, which is cross-party in that county, on a scrutiny committee or on what are called select committees. The same applies in Kent. Not all councils seem to be following that approach, and there are no prizes for guessing which are not. The new clause would go some way towards healing the breach, by enabling all councillors to participate in the scrutiny process.
<P>
The Bill would allow councils a small number of scrutiny committees named by a small number of councillors, yet some metropolitan authorities have almost 100 members and many county councils have 80 or more. It would be wrong for councillors to feel that they were being shunned and moved to the back benches with no role at all on their council.
<P>
I am delighted that the Minister's officials will consider the role of scrutiny in Wiltshire. We have heard how that is being approached in a different way from that set out in the Bill. That is the purpose behind new clause 4. We shall not press the new clause to a vote, but I want to tease out from the Minister how serious the Government are about ensuring that all councillors are equal and have a proper role.

<P>

<B>Ms Beverley Hughes:</B> I invite the Committee to oppose new clause 4, but that is not because I disagree with the sentiments expressed by the hon. Gentleman. Indeed, I share the sentiment behind his remarks about the extensive involvement of members in scrutiny and the multiplicity of roles outside the executive, and we said as much in our draft guidance.
<P>
There are two arguments against including a rigid requirement in the Bill. The first is an argument of principle about where flexibility in decision making should lie. The other argument concerns practicality. On the argument of principle, the decision of who should sit on which committee is a matter for the party group on the council, bearing in mind its allocation of seats and several other factors, not least who is best at what. Party groups are best placed to decide where their resources can be most effectively deployed, otherwise if members want to sit on a particular committee, the rules might have to go straight out of the window. Where the locus of decision making should rest and the retention of flexibility at local level are important issues, which the hon. Gentleman has supported in other situations. However, there are also some practical issues.
<P>
We must bear in mind that the role of overview and scrutiny is only one role, albeit an extremely important one, for councillors outside the executive. Certain more traditional committees, such as planning and licensing committees, will continue, and members will need to be allocated to them. Overview and scrutiny committees will also have to reflect the overall political balance on the council. All those factors must be married up. It might not be feasible for all members to sit on an overview and scrutiny committee and some members may wish to undertake other roles outside the executive. The amendment would interfere with that and would tie the hands of party groups in allocating seats. It is important to leave those issues to local discretion. Therefore, I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the motion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I do not know whether it is the time of evening or what, but in a moment of rare generosity, the Under-Secretary has basically accepted the principle of the new clause. It would be churlish of us to look a gift horse in the mouth, so, with alacrity, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.

<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
When hon. Members stand up to speak in Committee, we do so having been provided with support from several people. I am fortunate to have a volunteer called Matt Collis in my office and, from time to time, he has provided me with some interesting background briefings to help me with my speeches. It may be convenient for the Committee and to his greater glorification if I read what he suggested I should say about new clause 16:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>This amendment was tabled in the Lords by Baroness Hamwee. It has been tabled again particularly because it was alleged in the press recently that the Government was now toying with the idea-<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the idea of introducing primaries-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>as a further step to revive local democracy. One could suppose that the Government might be more open to the idea after the selection fiasco over the London mayoral candidate but then their ``control freakery'' tendencies may still remain, in which case, this would be the last thing they would want-giving the power to electors to decide on a candidate! This amendment is designed to get a statement from them on their position in relation to this.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I was interested to hear about the work of the volunteer researcher in the office of the hon. Member for Bath. We play an important role for people who want to learn more about the political process-although I am not always sure how much they learn. I judge from the way that the hon. Gentleman spoke to the new clause that he does not intend to press it; he just wants to have a little fun.
<P>
Such a new clause would be impractical. It assumes that the only people who will stand for mayor will be members of established political parties. There may well be people who will want to stand as independents, and who will not need to go through a selection process to become a candidate. A primary is part of a selection process. Some people may be interested in the idea. I have considered it myself, because the public are saying that they want to see people who are not political hacks and who have other things than politics in their life-or even have a life. The primary would enable such people to come through the process, which traditional selection methods often does not allow. However, that must be a matter for political parties. Even in countries such as the United States, which have primaries, those elections are run in different ways for different parties and different states.
<P>
It is an interesting idea, but it is not for the Government to decide on it, and it is not appropriate for the Bill. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the new clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> The Minister hopes correctly. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.
<P>
Motion and clause, by leave, withdrawn.
<H4><center>Clause 88</center></H4>
<H4><center>Allowances and pensions</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 48, in page 61, line 15, leave out `pensions'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss the following: amendment No. 49 in page 61, line 42, leave out `pensions'.
<P>
Amendment No. 50, in page 61, line 45, leave out `pensions'.
<P>
Amendment No. 51, in page 62, line 5, leave out `pensions'.
<P>
Amendment No.52, in page 62, line 21, leave out `pensions'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> The clause raises the prospect of members of the executive of a council qualifying for pension rights. Although it may seem to the casual observer to be a trivial issue, I know from talking to councillors from around the country how much they resent the notion that some councillors should be entitled to pensions and some not. The clause says that local authorities should have a panel to keep allowances and pensions under review.
<P>
The problem in this context is that it creates the impression that we shall end up with two tiers or classes of councillors in local government. The executive or cabinet will be treated, to all intents and purposes, as professional councillors with salaries and benefits to match. That runs contrary to the notion that most, if not all, local councillors run for office and serve out of a sense of public duty and civic responsibility.
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
If members of the executive are treated as full-time employees and non-executive members are expected to work for a living, as it were, there will inevitably be an imbalance in the amount of time that can be devoted to their two roles.
<P>
If pensions are a good idea for members of a cabinet or executive-I do not believe that they are-why should not they apply to all councillors? There was some discussion of that subject in the Local Government Chronicle in January. It reported:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The LGA decided in November that it would press for the pensions measure to be extended in principle to all council members. It has since approached DETR officials, but ministers are unwilling to make the pensions more widely available.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If the Minister seeks to justify having pensions at all, I should be interested to hear what arguments there are against extending the facility to all councillors.
<P>
We and many others share the concern that if the cabinet system is, in effect, imposed on most councils, that would encourage the tendency for self-perpetuating little cliques to run councils and make all the decisions. It has been suggested that that will make things more transparent, but the opposite will happen, especially when the cabinet insists on meeting in secret.
<P>
The Local Government Chronicle of 27 January states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Details of the pensions themselves are so far unclear . . . If they were part of the local government pension scheme, a cabinet member who had served for 10 years with a final ``salary'' of 30,000 could be entitled to an annual pension of about 3,750.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is all very well, but a significant pension entitlement needs to be built up. Will people really have to serve on an executive for 10 years? That would be a strong force that would encourage a cabinet to remain the same, because the same bunch of people will make the same decisions-it may be the same bunch who always made the decisions. I find it difficult to think of anything that would be more discouraging to keen new members who want to make progress in their local authority than the existence of a clique that built up pension entitlements year on year and ran the council.
<P>
That is the purpose that lies behind the amendments. I am fascinated to hear what the Minister will say in reply.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> The first thing that Opposition Members need to understand is that this is an enabling clause. It will enable the Secretary of State to change the regulations to admit members of the executive into the pension scheme. The hon. Gentleman hit on an important point in his opening remarks, when he appeared to support our more general efforts. We are seeking, more generally, to ensure that everyone in our country, whatever his or her earnings, is involved in some form of second pension. The previous Secretary of State for Social Security, the right hon. Member for Hitchin and Harpenden (Mr. Lilley) said that the state pension would eventually become nugatory. Whether or not that is true, we know that those who are entitled only to the state pension are at the bottom end of the income scale in this country. We have made it clear that, in future, we want everyone to be involved in pension schemes that will provide an additional income in retirement.
<P>
Any provisions in the Bill must be taken into account along with proposals on second pensions that are enshrined in law but have yet to be introduced. Those proposals will deal specifically with lower earners who would have been covered by the state earnings-related pension scheme. As we know, the previous Administration abolished SERPS, and there has been no follow up, but the Government will introduce a state second pension for those who earn between 3,000 and 9,000 a year. That will ensure that some of the poorest country have a decent pension when they retire. In addition, there is the stakeholder pension.
<P>
I hope that all councillors will feel that it is their responsibility to save for their old age and take out some form of pension. The provision has been included in the Bill for executive members in particular, but it will be implemented only on the recommendation of an independent panel appointed to oversee allowances and pensions for executive and other members. The power in the clause will enable the Secretary of State to amend pension provisions in the local government pension scheme. Much more discussion needs to take place before we can be sure that that will be possible, but it is clear that the post of a directly-elected mayor involves a significant time commitment, particularly in large metropolitan areas. In time terms, it will be the only job that such a person can do-it will not be possible to have another income to which a pension would be attached.

<P>

<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> My understanding is that the so-called executive member of Hammersmith and Fulham contrives to continue a practice at the Bar, as well as receiving substantial payment for his role on the council. In saying so, I make no personal criticism-he may well work all the hours God sends. I am simply saying that such things are possible.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> First, according to regulations that will pertain once the Bill is enacted, he will not undertake that activity. Secondly, as I understand it, the independent panel suggested that he take half the recommended allowance because he works only half-time, so the situation that the hon. Gentleman describes does not reflect the reality. It is certainly true that most people think that the newly elected mayor of London should work full-time, and the hon. Member for Brent, East (Mr. Livingstone) has recognised as much by saying that he will not stand at the next general election.
<P>
We want to ensure that everyone in this country has the opportunity of a second pension in addition to their basic state pension. If, following the recommendation of the independent commission, it is clear that the time commitment given by an executive member means that that will become their main source of income, they should be able to link pension entitlement to that income.
<P>
The clause is enabling because we recognise that this is a tricky area. There is no guarantee at this stage of how our current discussions will turn out. We are carrying out a review of allowances with the LGA and will issue guidance on the criteria that should be applied in determining the level of allowances that should be set.
<P>
We should examine whether it is possible to enable those whose main income rests on the allowance that they get in the post that they hold in the executive to link that income to their pension entitlement. It is a sad indictment of the current system that many people who would make good councillors will not take positions such as leader of a council because they will lose pension entitlement during that period, even if it is only short. The pensions that the Government are introducing will assist in that.
<P>
I hope that members of the Committee will leave the clause's provisions as they are. It is an enabling clause. We could not proceed without the agreement of the LGA and the consultations that we are undertaking through it with the local government pension scheme. It is right to continue to explore these matters, because the current position is unsustainable in the long term. I hope that all councillors will feel that they can get involved in the stakeholder pension or the state second pension once they are fully introduced. We should also make some accommodation for those who cut out the possibility of other forms of income that would be linked to pension entitlement.
<P>
I hope that my explanation of the clause has made it clear that the amendment would prevent us from further exploring the matter and introducing the provision, and that the hon. Gentleman recognises that we are trying to ensure that members of executives are covered in a way that is not currently possible.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for her tacit acceptance of the enormous success of the Conservative years in building up people's private pension provision, which marks us out from some of our European Union brethren-all of them, in fact. The Minister and I are still not on the same wavelength about pensions for local council executive members. Nevertheless, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<B>Ms Beverley Hughes:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 296, in page 62, line 2, leave out `every' and insert-

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take Government amendments Nos. 297 to 305.
<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> The amendments relate to the detail of the arrangements for independent panels. Councils will, as now, be responsible for deciding their scheme of allowances, with one exception: they will able to make a post pensionable only if that is recommended by an independent panel. The panel's recommendations will have to be published, as will the scheme of allowances decided by the full council.
<P>
The clause already provides for a group of authorities to set up a panel to make recommendations to all of them, but it does not provide for another body to set up a panel to make recommendations to one or more councils. However, that is already happening in London, where the Association for London Government has set up a body that makes recommendations to London councils, and in Wales, where the National Assembly for Wales has set up an all-Wales panel that makes recommendations to Welsh councils. We would not want to prevent that under the new provisions, although the regulations will set out some key principles-in particular, that members of the remuneration panel must be independent people of high standing.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 299 and 300 ensure that the Secretary of State or the National Assembly for Wales can make regulations providing for a body such as a local authority association to set up a panel to make recommendations on allowances and so on for one or more councils, and also that the National Assembly for Wales can, as now, set up an all-Wales panel to make such recommendations for councils across Wales.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 296, 297, 301, 302 and 303 are consequential on those changes, and amendment No. 298 is a drafting amendment.
<P>
Amendment No. 304 provides that a panel making recommendations to more than one council can make different recommendations for different councils, to allow for differences where appropriate. Amendment No. 305 makes it clear that any guidance in relation to allowances schemes will be issued by the Secretary of State for councils in England and by the National Assembly for councils in Wales.

Amendment agreed to.

Clause 88, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 89</center></H4>
<H4><center>Power to make provision about allowances</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> We have not tabled any amendments to the clause, but it raises some concerns. In the real world, the introduction of these new systems and structures is proving an effective smokescreen for some councils to introduce huge increases in councillors' allowances. In particular, members of experimental cabinets have received, in some instances, large special responsibility allowances.
<P>
Only a few days ago, Southwark council's Labour group voted through a 100 per cent. pay rise in basic allowances as part of, to use its word, the ``modernising'' of its authority. That is a lucrative bit of modernising-nice work if you can get it! The group approved a rise up to 10,000 a year, 2,500 above the independent guidance given last year by the Association of London Government. Cabinet members will receive a special 15,000 responsibility allowance and the leader will receive 25,000.
<P>
Interestingly, Stephanie Elsy, the council's Labour leader, said that this was the last chance to increase allowances until 2002. She went on:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>When we get to 2002 we would like to get a cross-section of the community on the council.
<P>
The problem we have is that people have to give up good jobs to take on council work. It is about modernising local government and getting better representation.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That remains to be seen.
<P>
To take another example at random, members of Sedgefield borough council have voted to increase allowances by 200,000 this year, according to The Northern Echo. Finally, and inevitably, we come to the continuing saga of Cardiff council. The eight council members who abstained or voted against the proposals to increase allowances were suspended by their own party in a disciplinary hearing behind closed doors-surprise, surprise-that ended at 2 o'clock in the morning, when they had the Labour whip withdrawn.
<P>
Those council members were disciplined for failing to support big rises in councillors' allowances, according to the Local Government Chronicle, despite calls from the hon. Members for Cardiff, North (Ms Morgan) and for Cardiff, Central (Mr. Jones) for the councillors to resist censure. The councillors were suspended from the Labour group for periods ranging from a week to three months.
<P>
Despite 58,000 a year having been earmarked for the lord mayor, Councillor Goodway, the new allowance was finally set at between 35,000 and 40,000 a year after councillors climbed down in the face of enormous opposition- not least from the local media, and the Western Mail in particular. That new allowance is still not ungenerous. I gather that Councillor Goodway has other ambitions relating to coming to this House; no doubt we shall hear of him again.
<P>
Those examples show how some parts of local government-those controlled by the Labour party-are already using the promise of this legislation as an opportunity to obtain large allowances for the boyos, in the case of Cardiff. Such practices give local government a bad name, and leave an unpleasant aroma. I hope that the Minister will take the opportunity to criticise some of the self-seeking decisions taken by some Labour-controlled councils.

<P>

<B>Ms Beverley Hughes:</B> Before I speak to clause 89, which has nothing to do with special responsibility allowances and basic allowances, I will make some brief comments relating to the hon. Gentleman's points.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman needs to remember that those apparently excessive increases in allowances have not been made under the provisions of this legislation. We would not support such action being taken by councils. The hon. Gentleman's generalised disparaging remarks about councillors and the work that they do-with his implication that it is ``nice work if you can get it''-denigrate all councillors. He fails to acknowledge the significant point that many people who would make good councillors might not be able to afford to do that work without reasonable financial recognition of the costs that would be incurred. It might be all right for the kind of Tory councillor who had his own business or was a member of the bench, like the hon. Member for Eastbourne. However, other people do not have the means to undertake council work without some form of remuneration.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I was elected to Hammersmith and Fulham council at the age of 23, when I was far from well paid. Indeed, I would have described myself as a struggling young lawyer. I received some fairly miserly allowances for showing up at events-indeed, there seemed to be a great many to attend. However, it never crossed my mind that it would be possible, or even desirable, that I should receive the sums being discussed here.
<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> I am not talking about such figures. I am simply making the point that many people in many communities do not have the wherewithal to undertake council work without some offset for the costs that they would incur through taking time off work, arranging child care and so on. To disparage all councils in that manner does a great disservice to the work that people do and will not help to get the best people involved in councils.
<P>
The clause will enable the Secretary of State to make regulations on allowances for members of parish councils, for example, and specific matters such as travel and subsistence, travel by bicycle and attending conferences. The clause has nothing to do with the points that the hon Gentleman raised. Nevertheless, I ask Committee members to approve it, because it deals with important, if residual, matters.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 89 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 90</center></H4>
<H4><center>SOCIAL SERVICES FUNCTIONS</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 306, in page 63, line 27, leave out `which operates executive arrangements' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(within the meaning of that Act) which are operating executive arrangements (within the meaning of Part II of this Act)'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 307 to 317.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> In respect of local authorities that adopt executive arrangements under part II, the clause will disapply the requirement in the Local Authority Social Services Act 1970 that local authorities must discharge their social services functions through social services committees. Because all social services functions will, under executive arrangements, be the responsibility of the executive, there will no longer be a requirement for a social services committee.
<P>
Subsection (1) cannot simply repeal the requirement for a social services committee, because part II will not extend to the City of London and the Council of the Scilly Isles, which are social services authorities. Moreover, there will be a transitional period in which some councils to which part II will apply will have adopted executive arrangements, while others will have yet to do so.
<P>
Subsection (2) deals with the role of the director of social services. Local authorities will be required to appoint such a director, but the requirement that the Secretary of State's approval be obtained before the director discharges non-social services functions will be repealed. That requirement has proved restrictive and burdensome, and we want to get rid of such provisions. Subsection (3) redrafts the definition of social services functions, and replicates an order-making power in the 1970 Act. I hope that such background to the clause has proved helpful.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 306 to 317 are minor and technical drafting amendments that will give full effect to the policy in the clause. Amendment No. 306 makes it clear that the requirement for local authorities to establish social services committees will not apply to authorities that operate executive arrangements under the Bill. In effect, amendment No. 307 will move the content of subsection (3) from a new subsection (6)(a) of the 1970 Act to a new section 1(a) of that Act.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 310, 311, 315 and 316 will amend various enactments that are consequential on provisions in clause 90. Amendment No. 311 will omit subsection 2(2) from the 1970 Act, and amendment No. 317 will add that subsection to the list of repealed provisions in schedule 5. Amendment No. 315 will amend the Registered Homes Act 1984 and paragraph 6 of schedule 6 to the Children Act 1989. Amendment No. 312 is a minor drafting amendment and amendment No. 314 is in part consequential on amendment No. 307.
<P>
As you can see, Mrs. Michie, the amendments are indeed technical and minor, and I trust that there are no anoraks among Committee members who wish to debate them fully.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
