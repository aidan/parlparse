							<b class="B">Mr.
John Hayes</b> (South Holland and The Deepings) (Con): Welcome
and good afternoon. The Bill makes no mention of training provided
directly by employers, or how that could count towards a qualification.
It does not propose ways in which we can involve employers more
closely. In your briefing note, you say that many 16 and 17-year-olds
in employment have become disengaged by classroom-style teaching. My
question is, does the Bill do enough to encourage employer involvement?
Is there a danger that 16 and 17-year-olds in employment who spend one
day a week in the classroom will not necessarily gain competencies that
will be valued by their
employer?</div>
					<a name="080122107000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Susan
Anderson:
							</b>
						</i> That is quite a few questions to answer.
The feedback that we get from our members, particularly on
apprenticeships, is that with these young people, who particularly want
to use practical-type skills and enjoy the hands-on aspects of
apprenticeships, the most difficult thing can be to get them to go back
to the college for that one day a week. Members of ours,
for example in construction, say that that is a
real difficulty because many of the young people have failed 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column38" />Column number: 38</div>to thrive and a high number of those who enter
employment or are in that NEET category have very low levels of
qualifications. Our members tell us that the young people thrive in the
workplace situation but do not like going back to college typically,
because they see that as going back to something that they did not
enjoy and did not relate to. I think that that is an issue. What we do
need to do, in looking at qualifications, apprenticeships and national
vocational qualifications, is ensure that&#151;I recognise that this
is partly an employer issue, not just one for colleges or private
providers&#151;they are relevant to young people and do deliver the
important numeracy and literacy skills that employers are looking for,
in ways that are relevant to young
people.</div>
					<a name="080122107000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
some problems at the moment with apprenticeships which we know need to
be addressed, and we are having conversations with the Government on
that, and indeed with anybody who wants to talk to us. Similarly, we
think that there are problems with vocational qualifications, that too
many of them do not reflect the needs of businesses, the skills and
competency needs of business, so again we are working with the
Qualifications and Curriculum Authority, and indeed the sector skills
council, to try to ensure that qualifications better match
employers&#146; needs, because if they do not, young people do not
see the point and employers do not value them. There are some very
important changes that need to take place before the Bill comes into
effect.</div>

						</b> Sorry, Mr. Bayley. I shall be very
quick. You say that you have developed a 12-point plan to ensure that
more employers are prepared to participate, particularly in
apprenticeships. I share your view about that. What, in your view, are
the main ways in which apprenticeships should be reformed? Would that
include a statutory definition with a minimum level of employer
engagement and
mentoring?</div>

								Richard
Wainer:
							</b>
						</i> There are three particular issues around the
apprenticeship programme that need reform. First, more high-achieving
young people need to be encouraged into the programme, whether through
ensuring that employers have better access to schools to promote the
excellent opportunities that many employers provide or through
improving careers guidance to counter the academic and gender bias that
we often find. The second issue is ensuring that the apprenticeship
programme is much more flexible to business needs and can adapt quickly
to changing skill requirements. Thirdly, it is about ensuring that
there is effective support in place for small employers who want to
engage in the
programme.</div>

there should be an all-age careers service to provide the kind of
advice that you have just mentioned. If I could be allowed a small

matter of priority, we need to get better careers advice to young
people at the key stages&#151;11, 14, 16 and 18. If we had to
prioritise, although we would love to have an all-age service and would
like apprenticeships to be open to people of every age, we would
prioritise young people at school, particularly at 14 and

						</i> We fear that that could be an unintended
consequence, which is why we have said that although we think this is a
necessary step, it is not a sufficient step. There are issues that need
to be tackled, but we are confident that they can be. They really must
be addressed. Our fear is about not only the number of people in
economic inactivity, the NEETs, but the 65,000 or so young people who
are currently in employment that does not lead to a
qualification&#151;there is obviously no problem with the 100,000 who
are doing an apprenticeship scheme or nationally recognised
qualifications. Some good skills enhancement is taking place with young
people who are currently in employment, but it is not leading to a
nationally recognised qualification. If we cannot get qualifications
right and do more on that, we could end up as an unintended consequence
tipping more of those young people either into schools where they may
not have a good range of options or into unemployment. That could be an
unintended consequence if we do not get things
right.</div>

the point of. If they do not add any value for an employer, although it
is going to be rather hard to persuade a young person to go, why would
the employer not choose an 18-year-old or already qualified Polish
worker who has all the right attitudes? That is a
danger.</div>

Laws:
						</b> Given the Bill before us, is the answer to that
problem to try to make the training, education and qualification
requirements more flexible, or are you concerned that some youngsters,
in existing employment that is not certified in the way described in
the Bill, are learning useful skills and disciplines such as being in a
workplace, attending on time and such basic skills that it would be
better to engage in than go through qualification hoops for the sake of
it?</div>

								Susan
Anderson:
							</b>
						</i> That is something that we must be aware of.
Certainly young people&#151;I have already pointed to those who do
not feel that college is for them&#151;are gaining good employability
skills. Some of those employability skills that our members have
identified as so important are: self-management or just turning up on
time, at the right time, day in, day out; team working; and customer
care. You can get all those skills in a work situation. In fact, it is
often the best way to gain those skills, which is why we think that
work experience is so important.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column40" />Column number: 40</div>
					<a name="080122107000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those are skills that you can
get. They are the softer skills. One of the things that we would be
looking to happen between now and when the Bill comes into effect is
some way of accrediting those skills without young people having to go
into college. Let us think about numbers and some of the
things&#151;for example, we could learn what has happened in terms of
successful apprenticeships. It does not have to be people with
clipboards following young people around, but in order to find some way
of accrediting those skills that young people are getting in the
workplace we would be very happy to work with the sector skills
councils and the QCA. That would be one of the necessary steps to take
place. We need to emphasise that young people are getting very valuable
skills from training that is not necessarily off-the-job training. We
must take account of that. We must not get to feel that it is not quite
training if it is not off the
job.</div>

						</i> We know that, from an employer perspective,
employers&#146; biggest concerns are with the low number of young
people&#151;sorry, our concern is literacy and numeracy. We are not
getting enough people coming out of schools with the right literacy and
numeracy skills. That is employers&#146; No. 1 concern. They also
feel that we need to improve those employability skills that I have
already mentioned&#151;those soft, generic skills around team
working, business awareness, customer awareness, as well as literacy
and
numeracy.</div>
					<a name="080122107000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
terms of what employers can contribute, we certainly as employers have
a role to play&#151;whether through work experience or other
means&#151;to ensure that young people recognise the benefits of
those employability skills. I think that that is where we think we can
play a role. Certainly when it comes to apprenticeships and, indeed,
diplomas, delivering numeracy and literacy skills or helping people
appreciate the appliance of those skills is very
important.</div>

things that employers can do. But why do we think that this is the

literacy and numeracy right before the age of 16. I would agree. There
is plenty that we have done, and more to be done. Equally, through work
experience and built into the new diplomas are functional literacy and
numeracy. We can do some of that employability through key stage 4. I
would be interested in what is specific about 16 to 18 where you 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column41" />Column number: 41</div>think that that is helpful&#151;perhaps around certain sections of the
population that you might have concerns about. Then, in respect of what
employers can do, I gather that you have some nervousness about the
burden of checking whether or not a young person is participating
before employing them. Do you think that there is another way of doing
that, which is less burdensome on
employers?</div>

						</i> In terms of what is helpful, as you say, we
would rather hope that young people would have reached good levels of
numeracy and literacy&#151;by good level, I mean equivalent to a C in
English and maths. Too many are not achieving that. If some of them can
carry on studying English and maths&#151;numeracy and
literacy&#151;beyond the age of 16, so that they have a chance to
catch up, I think that will be very successful. If we will deliver that
result through the new diplomas and through apprenticeships that
deliver literacy and numeracy in ways that young people can relate to,
because they can understand why these skills are so important in their
chosen occupations, then I think that will be very helpful. I think
delivering it in that way will engage young
people.</div>

qualifications or training that engages people then, frankly, they will
not be interested in turning up at a college. While they will come
along with a piece of paper, or will tell you that they are going to
the college, the employer is going to be very hesitant about thinking
that they will actually be committed to attending the college. There
are employers who feel that nothing has changed, who think that the
qualifications are no more relevant, who, a year down the road, may
have had some experience with young people who arrive with bits of
paper saying they are going to college and then it does not happen.
Those employers will say, &#147;I have had some experience of this,
it didn&#146;t work, and so I have to question the piece of paper
because clearly neither it nor the oral commitment to attend could be
trusted. I had to go and check that the course and the college existed,
and that they had signed up, because experience tells me that I could
not trust
them&#148;.</div>
					<a name="080122107000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">I know
the Bill says that employers should not have to get involved and that
the onus is on the local authority. However, I think employers&#146;
question will be, &#147;Where can you track down this young
person?&#148; It is an employment. Is the local authority person
checking up on these issues? Where are they likely to find the young
person? They are likely to find that if the young person is not at
home, he or she will be in employment. Does the employer really want to
have the official responsible hanging around the factory gate or
invited in at lunch time? I think our members are a bit sceptical that
they can divorce themselves as easily as is proposed from any policing
that lies with local authorities, but I would certainly be interested
in any reassurances you could give us on that
front.</div>

young people come with the course already chosen; in the other, you
take them on and then say they have to find a course. That might look
simple set down on a piece of paper, but when you have had some
experience as an employer who wants to do the right thing, how are you

accreditation. We have some very good examples of big
industry&#151;factories and so forth&#151;being able to make a very
clear agreement with a college about the skills needed, and the one day
a week release being very successful. The issue for many smaller
businesses is that skills are more difficult to identify, as, perhaps,
are some of the softer skills. How would you see that form of
accreditation developing? Do you see learning-based union reps being
involved or do you envisage a system of mentors? You clearly have
expertise in the workplace, and the idea of having a form of
accreditation that is totally relevant is obviously very attractive.
Would you see that as a way forward? How would you manage to bring a

recognise the high-quality training that goes on in many workplaces.
Our surveys, and surveys from other organisations, show that although
employers spend &#163;33 billion a year on training, only a third of
that training leads to recognised qualifications. So, there is a lot of
training and investment in training that leads to higher skills and
improved productivity that is not counted in the Government&#146;s
statistics and would not be an appropriate route for a young person to
take. You are absolutely right: we need to put in place better
mechanisms to recognise and accredit the very high-quality training
that is going on in workplaces. We are working on pilots with the QCA
and some big household names to ensure that the process is as easy as
possible and identifies the barriers to employers accrediting their
high-quality training so that more firms can follow that path if they
want to.</div>

there is a lot of good training in smaller firms, where what works best

employability skills. A mentor can work alongside you and talk you
through how to handle difficult conversations and deal with awkward
customers. The whole idea of mentoring&#151;union learning reps have
played a good role in terms of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column43" />Column number: 43</div>mentoring&#151;particularly in smaller firms, is that you get an awful
lot of people who really want to give something back and help young

between the just-in-time in-house training, which is designed to meet a

If we talk to companies, many of which are working very successfully
with schools, some of them think it is more appropriate to collaborate
and to work in partnership with universities, some of them choose
colleges, and others encourage their employees to get
involved&#151;whether through being a school governor or hearing
young people learn to read. The employer gets involved in a variety of
ways. I have to say, though, about a duty on employers to collaborate,
that to be frank you would not want some employers to be involved in
schools. There are lots of very good employers out there&#151;I would
be the first to argue that&#151;but we need to be a bit careful.
There are some employers that frankly should not get involved with

The crux of the issue is that many members feel very uncomfortable with
the notion of criminalising young people in some sense. It is that
aspect of compulsion and enforcement that people have concerns about.
To put that in context, we support the overall thrust of the policy and
strongly support the Government&#146;s aims. Our further wish, and
our expectation, is that it is unlikely that it will be a real issue
when it comes down to it. I am not ducking the question, and measures
will need to be put in place. However, we would expect those to be more
like attachment to earnings measures and nothing that would involve

1.5 of your evidence to the Committee, which deals with entitlements to
level 2 and level 3 qualifications, you imply that you would wish to
see a lifetime entitlement to level 2 training. Is that
right?</div>

						</i> Yes, we do. We are talking about some of the
most challenged and disadvantaged people in society, really. Many of
them, of course, are young people, but many of those young people also
grow up into older workers who have equal needs and some of the stories
that we have learned through our unionlearn work are really quite
harrowing. They show the immense potential that has been wasted, the
potential of people who really had a lousy time at school, to put it
bluntly, and who have been given all sorts of opportunities, through
unionlearn and through the union learning rep
network.</div>
					<a name="080122107000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">The types of needs that those
people have are pretty basic, in many cases. They are literally
reading, writing, literacy, numeracy and also the softer skills of
confidence, verbal fluency, personal self-organisation and motivation.
Those are precisely the kind of skills, both the harder skills and the
softer skills, that the skills for life programme and level 2 can give
people.</div>
					<a name="080122107000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
other important point concerns the accreditation of
learning, which is going on in parallel with this exercise, through the
QCA. In the past, many of the skills that both young and older people
might acquire and use have not been recognised and accredited. That
will change. With that kind of portfolio, and with those skills
properly recognised, they can further reinforce and boost their
self-esteem and confidence. It might well mean that employers find that
they move on to better and further employment elsewhere, but in the
interests of employers as a whole, we think that this will be a wholly
good thing that most employers should
welcome.</div>

simplistic. Would you like to expand on that point? If all the caveats
that you have put into paragraph 1.4 were there, would you not accept
that, as was told to us in somebody else&#146;s evidence, the
compulsory element could galvanise all those elements into place? Would
you be more in favour of a compulsory approach if all those caveats
were in place acting as a force to bring in those additional support

						</i> As I have said already, we think that this is
a complex area. There is a spectrum. It is not really: &#147;Are you
in favour of compulsion, or not?&#148; It depends very much on
exactly how that is implemented. Certainly, at Committee stage, we
would expect there to be a whole range of measures, and as I have said
we will look at those very carefully. The test that will apply is
whether it leads to criminalising young people, or young people feeling
that they are being criminalised. If the answer to that is yes, and
people do feel that way, it would be counter-productive.
</div>
					<a name="080122107000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is precisely
what we seek to avoid, as too do the Government I am sure. We strongly
support the notion of a very strong expectation, and the creation of a
culture in which it is the norm, that all young people should continue
until the age of at least 18, if not beyond, whether at work or at
college or on an apprenticeship. Some might continue at school, but
this is not about raising the school leaving age. In that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column50" />Column number: 50</div>sense, we think that entitlement is the right kind of language. This
should really be about ensuring that young people are not forced, in
that criminalised sense, and that young people have such a range of
opportunities available to them that they are happy to take up whatever
is appropriate for them. We think that that range of entitlements needs
to be explored much more. To be frank, we think that employers need to
do far more as well.</div>

						</b> May I ask you about the categories that Stephen was
talking about in paragraph 1.7? Clearly one of the risks was of shaking
people out of jobs that might be a lot better than the alternative.
Thinking about youngsters employed in certain sectors, but who are not
getting certified educational training, and the fact that they might be
in smaller businesses and so forth, do you think it realistic that the
majority could be accredited in the work place, rather than through
formal education? Are you confident that they could be usefully
accredited, so that we do not simply create a paper factory, rather
than provide real skills and
opportunities?</div>

						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Caroline
Smith:

						</i> I shall answer that in two parts. One of the
key issues in the accreditation of, for example, what employers might
provide already in the job, is ensuring that, if measures are taken to
help recognise some of that training, it is of a high quality.
Furthermore, transferable skills must be included. Particularly in a
labour market with increased agency work and casual employment, it is
really important, particularly for young people, that they receive
accredited skills and training that can be taken elsewhere and that are
not just reliant on a particular employer recognising that
accreditation.</div>
					<a name="080122107000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
terms of whether it is realistic in those sectors to ensure that access
takes place, it will not necessarily occur in every workplace with
every employer, and that is why the issue of leavers is very important
if we want to ensure that training takes place across different
workplaces. We suggest looking at sector skills agreements, the
questions of sector levies in particular industries, the questions of
licence to practise&#151;those are the mechanisms that are in place
to ensure that training is made available to
everybody.</div>

of thing that would mesh well with the work that union learning reps
already do in the workplace. Union learning reps are champions 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column51" />Column number: 51</div>for learning in the workplace. They do many things, including
encouraging people to take up learning opportunities and advising their
fellow workers about the kinds of opportunities that may be available.
I do not pretend that they are all qualified and experienced advisers,
far from it, but they are skilled at encouraging people to look on the
web, talk to people who are experts, talk to people in personnel or
other unions&#151;there are many sources of advice. If there were a
good information, advice and guidance service&#151;an expansion of
the currently existing next steps and University for Industry

the work that has been going on in the workplace with ESOL is not

earlier funding changes and the ending of the universal entitlement to
ESOL up to level 2. A recent consultation has been published, and we
have differences about the fact that there are many needy groups of
people. It is difficult to set different needy groups against each

provision. We will examine that in our response to that

<div class="Column"><a name="Column52" />Column number: 52</div>class, to stay on at school or in a college, or take a particular
workplace training opportunity. Is it not right that the strength of
what you have been doing through union learning representatives is the
softer approach, encouraging people, engaging them and making it much

they may feel quite the opposite in some ways. But yes, there can be
that.</div>

is that with the right kind of support, people who have come through
with very poor basic skills can be turned around, if I can use that
phrase, very quickly. It is not about their staying on at
school&#151;if it were, they would be very apprehensive, and we would
not support it either. But that is clearly not what the Government are
talking about; it is not about raising the school leaving age, it is
about creating different sets of opportunities, perhaps through

of such people.</div>

example, one particular need that they might have is for literacy and
numeracy learning that is directly relevant to what they are doing at

about numeracy through pricing and such things, and their understanding
of the need to calculate a  10 per cent. discount on a sale or
something, that may be a far more effective way of teaching them about

should be a far stronger entitlement for young people to have a much
wider range of funded, paid time off. There should be a much greater
duty on employers&#151;to come back to an earlier question about what
would happen in 2010 if employers had not got to the Leitch targets, we
would expect them to be made to do so. We are quite keen on compulsion
on employers, provided that they need it, which we think is quite
likely on current evidence. Within that framework we want to look at

						</b> Obviously, the Bill translates entitlements and
turns it into obligations. Notwithstanding that, you place key
emphasis, and I agree, on apprenticeships. Is your view, as mine is,
that apprenticeships would be assisted by a statutory definition, that
pivoted around employer engagement, a level of workplace training and
mentoring, which would be a proper test of the acquisition of real
vocational competence leading to
employability?</div>

						</i> We absolutely support apprenticeships, but
certainly one of our concerns is around quality. While absolutely
recognising that there are some fantastic 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column54" />Column number: 54</div>apprenticeship programmes out there, unfortunately there are some that
are not offering decent pay or high-quality training, and there are
some real differences across the board in what is meant by an
apprenticeship. We would certainly agree that looking at establishing a
definition of an apprenticeship could potentially be a mechanism for
boosting and levering up quality. Obviously, it would depend upon the
detail of any legislation defining an apprenticeship, because it could
be defined in a restrictive, as well as, expansive way. So, it would be
very much what, at the end of the day, the detail around that
was.</div>

between completion and rigour? I do not have a fixed view about that,

						</i> That is an interesting one. Certainly, the
issue completion is very important. I am not necessarily convinced that
there would be that relationship between completion and rigour. Within
the apprenticeship system, you would be looking to ensure that supports
are in place to help ensure completion, for example, the notion of
ensuring that support and mentoring are in place, and of having checks
and balances around the apprenticeship programme. I think that it is
about those types of measures and about a package of measures, not just
legislating for a definition of apprenticeships. On its own, that would
be one factor, but I think that you need to have wider support
mechanisms around
that.</div>

Peter Soulsby</b> (Leicester, South) (Lab): May I once more
return to the issue of compulsion and clarify that I have understood
what you are saying? Am I right to think you are saying that you are
not opposed to the principle of compulsion, but that what concerns
you is the potential for criminalisation of young
people as a result of compulsion and the potential for
counter-productive, negative results from the imposition of
sanctions?</div>

						</i> All I can do is quote the precise terms of
our policy which, after some discussion, was decided at the congress
last September, which was that we had grave reservations about
compulsion; that it would depend on the precise way in which it was
done; and that we were certainly not in favour of anything that looked
like criminalisation. We did not think that criminalisation or any
criminal-type sanctions were remotely necessary and, indeed, would be
counter-productive, but we very strongly supported the
Government&#146;s overall aim of giving a very powerful message to
all young people that this is something they should do.</div>
					<a name="080122107000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">Whether you
need compulsion to achieve that message is something about which we
have grave concerns and reservations. It depends on exactly how a range
of sanctions are framed in Committee. We are certainly looking to see
precisely what is being proposed. The debate at our congress was very
clear that our members are very worried indeed and have major
reservations about this being compulsory in the sense that, say, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column55" />Column number: 55</div>ASBOs are compulsory. They felt that this would be counter-productive.
It is not the sort of thing that would necessarily
encourage young people. Since we are all starting from that aim of
creating a climate and a culture of expectation that young people
should stay on to 18 in some form of training, we wanted to see
precisely what kind of framework the Government were proposing to
encourage them to do
that.</div>

terms of creating opportunities for young people, such that the number
of NEETs could be reduced to a tiny proportion of what it currently is.
If I may take issue with one or two of the figures from the CBI, it is
our view that employers do not spend anything like  &#163;33
billion on training, and that something like a third of employers in
this country provide almost no training at all. Another third provide
some but, frankly, in our view, it is pretty inadequate.</div>

many of our competitor nations, particularly in Europe and America, we

should bring employers up to speed and make sure that they are
fulfilling their obligations to their communities and to their workers
to make sure that they provide the right kind of training opportunities
for all people&#151;young people and older workers. Only then, when
we have done that, would it be appropriate to look at whether we still
need compulsion to tackle that very small remaining

						</i> Our concern there was that if NEETs or young
people who have not been achieving employment do so and, for the first
time in their lives, are in receipt of a wage and if they have to hand
over a chunk of that wage in the form of a fine, because they have not
been going to college and so on, it might be a disincentive to their
taking up employment. What we are not concerned about&#151;what I
suspect may be behind your question&#151;is whether it will be a
deterrent to employers. Our view is that if we live in a country where
employers are honestly saying that they would not offer 16 and
17-year-olds employment because there is an obligation to provide some
sort of training it would be a pretty shameful admission. We would not
expect most employers to admit that, nor do we expect it to
happen.</div>

for an individual employer it may not be in their interests if their

employers and it is likely that they will agree
that they should all invest. It is rather like the early days of health
and safety legislation when employers 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column57" />Column number: 57</div>collectively agreed that some kind of collective regulation was
necessary because it was not in the interests of an individual employer
to bear the extra, added costs of not killing or injuring their
employees. I am not saying it is quite like that, but the economic
arguments are analogous; this is the sort of thing where all employers
need to move together, it is rationally in the interests of the economy
and the group of employers as a whole, but it may not necessarily be in
the interests of a particular individual.</div>

looking at was more like 16 than 20. You are quite right. Clearly it is
possible for someone to be in full-time education, for example, and be
doing a Saturday job. That would not make that employer responsible for
them in this way. What concerned us about a figure as high as 20 was
that the not-so-good employers that both the CBI and the TUC talked
about might subvert the system by offering a lot of 19.5 hour
contracts. Of course, they might still do that if we set the level at
16, but then, for a young person in effect to be doing full-time work,

Obviously, changes are under way and there are all the things that we
are doing not only through the new vocational courses and the diplomas,
but through wider changes in the methods of teaching and learning that
we are employing now&#151;personalised learning and so on. However,
in my experience, the biggest need that youngsters in this category
have is for pastoral support. For example, in my school, we have a
student support centre, where we identify children who are at risk of
exclusion or of leaving school with no qualifications when they reach
16. We identify them as early as we can&#151;at the very latest, when
they come into key stage 4&#151;and we do not find that they do not
want to access the curriculum. We thought originally we would be giving
them an alternative curriculum. They do not want that. They want to
access the curriculum, but they need individual support and help to
organise themselves and, sometimes, to get through the school day,
because as someone said earlier, some of those people come from
terrible backgrounds where the circumstances are awful. Sometimes they
come into school in the morning and you could not possibly expect them

						</b> When I asked a head teacher in my constituency
whether the Education and Skills Bill and the compulsory leaving age
should go ahead and whether that would address the needs of that bunch
of young people with very high needs, he said that in his experience
some of the young people you have been discussing find it very
difficult, for the reasons you have given, to engage at 16 or even
before, whereas they are quite ready to come back into the system later
and can usually benefit more. Do you lean towards agreeing with him or
do you think that the Government are right and that if we put in much
greater support and a more relevant curriculum, many or all of those
people could stay on at
16?</div>

slightly and give you both answers to that. Yes, there will be people
we will not succeed with. We have to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column60" />Column number: 60</div>be realistic. This is an enormously ambitious agenda and it will take a
long time before we reach the noble aspiration of trying to get
everybody to achieve. However, the sort of steps we are putting in
place will help to achieve that with a lot of people. I have experience
in my own school of doing that, but it is time-consuming. It requires
an enormous amount of effort on the part of many people and it requires
a co-ordinated approach across the whole of children&#146;s services,
but that is certainly not a reason for not doing
it.</div>

						</b> I am interested in exploring with you a little
more what needs to be done pre-16 in order to make the job post-16
easier, largely because of a more engaged cohort of young people. The
children&#146;s plan sets out several changes that would happen
between now and when the current year 6 become the first cohort that it
applies to: qualification and curriculum reform, apprenticeships,
expansion of the foundation learning tier, diplomas, pastoral support,
one-to-one support, which we talked about, and personal tutors. What do
you think are the most important for us to prioritise, and what more
should we do that we have not already set out in order to make the job
post-16 that much
easier?</div>

						</i> The children&#146;s plan contains enough
measures, and the right measures, to improve support and to develop it
further. It is going in absolutely the right direction to develop the
pastoral support and tutorial help we provide. But the key issue is
that that support is not something that can be bolted on. It is not the
latest thing that we add to what we do in schools. If the support is
organised properly, it will be in an absolutely co-ordinated
way.</div>
				
					<a name="080122107000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is why in our brief we were very concerned about the separation of
individual advice and guidance, and careers education and guidance. If
I am talking to a child, I am not going to think which one I am doing,
and it will be the same for a careers adviser who is giving advice. We
have to plan this in an holistic way. Similarly, a head of year is not
separate from the process of taking children through their whole
education. We do not want to move back to an old-fashioned
pastoral-academic divide. Therefore, we have the measures in
place.</div>
					<a name="080122107000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">What we need
to do now is to make sure that we build on the work that has been done
on personalised learning: for example, the Specialist Schools and
Academy Trust is very much leading on deep support work and those types
of model. Lots of schools are developing those sorts of approaches, and
that is the way that we need to go to encourage students from an early
stage to stay
on.</div>

the parents of young people while the children are still at school. It
is relatively easy&#151;difficult, but relatively easy&#151;to
reach the parents during that phase. In some cases&#151;some already
believe it&#151;they need to be persuaded that what we all prefer for
their children will actually be right for them, and that their children
should carry on with education or training beyond the age of

enormous support&#151;antenatal support, post-natal support, health
visitors 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column61" />Column number: 61</div>and so on&#151;but it is much more difficult for parents of teenage
children to access support. Lots of parents say to me, &#147;Help.
What should we be doing? How can we help?&#148; Again, there are
measures in the children&#146;s plan to help with that, but it is
important that we help those parents to understand the complex maze of
qualifications and opportunities for their

people who should be completely exempted. However, we have to accept
that it will be very difficult for some young people to be engaged
constantly during that period. Reference has been made to this. For
example, we have to allow that it will be difficult for young parents
and other young people who are in other senses carers, for young people
who are having terrible crises in their family life of one sort or
another, for young people who are substance abusers and who need to be
weaned away from that before they can be engaged in anything else, and
no doubt for other groups of young people as well, to be engaged all
the time. The sort of support that we might seek for those people will
be expensive, of course, and will become increasingly expensive per
head as we approach the last ones&#151;the Pareto principle, which we
refer to in our briefing paper, applies here. The last ones will be
very expensive, but if we can give them that expensive support then we
should be able to engage everybody in some

Mr. Ward then proceeded to answer what would have been my
follow-up question, but could I persuade him to reflect a little
further on the implications for schools and colleges? The provisions of
this Bill include children with special needs statements, and there are
costs and practicalities in providing for them up to 18.

						</i> Yes, clearly some young people are much more
expensive to educate and train than others. That has always been the
case, and will continue to be so. Colleges and schools are used to
dealing with students who have statements of special educational needs;
they have learning difficulties, or sensory or physical disabilities.
Clearly, they can be and often are more expensive to teach, but
colleges and schools know how to do that. However, as we try to
complete the process, we will indeed have a larger number of young
people for whom it will be difficult to provide the sort of support,
per head, that they will need and deserve.</div>

agree: we should start by persuading or enticing young people, and we
should make sure that a wide range of suitable provision is available
to them all. Until that is the case, it would be quite wrong to compel
them or to penalise them in any way for not going along with our
desires. We need to start at that end. We would argue that that will,
in practice, bring in virtually every young person.</div>

						</i> Well, yes, the intention is clearly that very
few young people should find themselves at the point of criminal
penalty, and that is right. A cynical response would be to say that not
many people find the criminal penalties are applied when their children
do not attend compulsory schooling&#151;we have had that for many
decades in this country. Another cynical response, drawn from my
knowledge of people that age, is that most of them will be able to duck
and weave quite nicely for long enough to get to the age of 18. That
will be only a year and a bit away for some of them, because one slight
oddity of the arrangement is that they enter this phase at the end of
the school year when they turn 16, but they leave it on their 18th
birthday, which may not be that long for some of
them.</div>
					<a name="080122107000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">Going back to
the point we made before, a less cynical response would be that if we
have offered them the things that we think they should have, such as
good opportunities for education, good apprenticeships and employment
with good training attached, and we have closed off their option of
going for employment that does not have good training by gripping
employers and obliging them not to employ young people on that basis,
there will be virtually no young people who have not already entered
the categories that we want them to be

played out across many towns and cities across the country. There are
some extremely damaged and excluded young people out

to reach them? You rightly pointed out that that will take a massive

to soak up reluctant students without damaging the learning experience

people are often resistant to that type of provision and that element

an extra member of staff. You have an extra teaching assistant within a

you put them into smaller environments&#151;in the children&#146;s
plan, for example, there was the idea of studio schools&#151;then
that is obviously going to cost more money because they are smaller

						</i> The careers service is being reformed and
we are very aware that there are some places where there is very
high-quality careers advice and there are other areas where the advice
is less effective. What we need to do is to ensure that that advice
gets up to the right standard everywhere; certainly, that is very
important. However, the key thing about it is that, if you take the new
standards for individual advice and guidance&#151;the quality
standards&#151;they provide a really strong framework for
high-quality guidance within school. We really support what is in the
Bill. If a school or a college were to audit their provision, going
through these quality standards, and a local authority were to use the
standards as an auditing tool, the quality of careers guidance would be
very good indeed. That is very
important.</div>
					<a name="080122107000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">Regarding
the apprentice system, it obviously must develop and improve. We cannot
expect young people to stay in education until they are 18 unless we
make sure that we provide a range of appropriate and high-quality
opportunities that they will want to use. It is this business about
persuasion, which we have spoken about before. We need to be able to
persuade them to do these things, because they can see that there is
high-quality provision in the form of apprenticeships, other courses or
other training opportunities for
them.</div>

are concerned about Ofsted taking over the registration and regulation

schools to be inspected on a similar basis to maintained schools. Can

that Ofsted was being moved in their direction, or that they were being

concern about what was in the Bill, most of which we have been

Ofsted to do the latter job in the independent school sector, because
it operates in a market. It certainly is appropriate that those schools
should be regulated and required to provide a decent standard of
education, good health and safety and so forth, so that children who
are sent there are safe and generally well treated. Such a threshold
inspection is appropriate, and our members are reassured that that is
what is being talked about here, rather than their being handed over to

because of other problems that they have, to which you referred
earlier. We do not really want those people simply to disappear for a
year or a year and a half until they turn 18. Is there a missing

						</i> I think that they are a very small number
of people. We need to remember that. It is a very important duty of
children&#146;s services departments in local authorities to identify
and keep track of those young people, because they are the ones who
disappear off all the records, get into trouble and so on. There are
some very successful schemes. For example, there is one in my area
called the youth gateway scheme, in which intensive work is done with
those groups of young people to try to get them into a position where
they can get into employment or further training. You can identify who
those small groups of people are. It does not come cheap, but it is
worth every penny of the investment because you are hitting the hardest
group to get, to ensure that they stay in training and education and
then become employable within a reasonable amount of
time.</div>

that concerns me is perhaps not quite the same group that you are

course at 16 that they then realise is wrong for them and find
completely unsupportable in fairly short order. By about November
perhaps, they are saying, &#147;I&#146;ve started this, but I just
can&#146;t bear it. I can&#146;t go there. I&#146;m not going
there any more&#148;&#151;whatever &#147;there&#148; is. We
will need to have means of coping with their changes of direction, so
that they do not find themselves in trouble if they have to wait until

Actually that isn&#146;t the right thing for me. I now realise I
should have stayed at school or gone to college and embarked on a
course of full-time education,&#148; they will probably have to wait
until the following September to do that and we will need to be able to

						</i> Hearing the debate this afternoon about
compulsion has been fascinating. Our position in terms of the present
drafting is that we support it, but in the context of the culture shift
and the change in expectations, and we have an important caveat about
custody, which I will come back to. We can start from the position of
the year 6 young people who will be the first to be affected by the
legislation. If we say to them, &#147;You will be compelled to stay
in education or training and if you don&#146;t, we will apply a range
of sanctions&#148; and those sanctions include fines and criminal
sanctions of various sorts, that will clearly be
counter-productive.</div>
					<a name="080122107000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are talking about the notion that, at the extreme margin, there will be
some young people for whom a sanction is appropriate, but it will be
very, very few. We expect that, over quite a short period and by the
time the young people who are now in year 6 get to the age of 16 or 17,
that culture shift will have been implemented, as will the diplomas and
apprenticeships, all the curriculum changes and all the improved
information, advice and guidance, such that the requirement for
coercion will become a very much less important
thing.</div>

Certainly that is true of the work that has gone on in Connexions as
well and, with the migration of Connexions to the local authority, we
feel that the capacity exists within both local authority and
sub-regional or regional level. Obviously, we need to look not just at
local authority level, particularly where you have conurbations of a
number of authorities, but we do not feel that there is, particularly,
an extra burden. However, we obviously need to co-ordinate and

one is the capital cost of the systems, and a lot of the systems
already exist across the 14-to-19 partnerships, between authorities and
across colleges and authorities; but I come back to the fundamental
issues around data capture and how those data are utilised to

To take the case of the city of Bristol, someone from my constituency

into 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column70" />Column number: 70</div>Bristol from as far away as Wiltshire to go to college. How can we be

						</i> The biggest system being
implemented at the moment is ContactPoint, which is best described as
150 interconnected databases, each one at a local authority level. It
will therefore have a record of all young people at the most basic
level. That needs to tie into and be tied into other databases from
Connexions and, indeed, from school and college records in an effective
way, so that we are able to point up where individual young people are
at any given time. I suppose that it needs to be pretty robust, which
is the point that I am making. I accept that the need for that, because
what do you do if you do not have a child or young person on this
system? How do you know where they are? You need to be sufficiently
robust to know that if they are not in Bristol they might be in
Wiltshire, if they are not in Wiltshire they might be in Dorset. We
need to have across-authority systems that are
robust.</div>

						</i> You can underpin that if you take other
systems that have been developed. The common system framework is one
where you agree a set of protocols between all those using the data,
and then you agree what are known as common datasets. It does not
matter about the platform or the networking arrangements in each
authority or partner, if you have a protocol and the common dataset,
the information is accessible and sharable. The underpinning part is
that it must be timely, and those are the elements that you have to get
absolutely right. If you get the protocols and common datasets, you

My second question is about the legal powers that you as local
authorities will be able to exercise if you have to enforce compulsion.
Again, to give an example from Bristol, the legal services department
has difficulty getting yellow lines removed or placed where residents
want them. Are you confident that there are enough solicitors and other
legally trained people in local authorities to cope with the large new
duty being placed on authorities?</div>

returning to our briefing at paragraph 25, the point is that we do not
want to start with solicitors and legal involvement. We will need to
start with individual counselling, mentoring for parents, parenting
support, individual support for young people, information, advice and
guidance. That is where it all starts, not at the point of
compulsion.</div>
					<a name="080122107000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">When the

it

of legal remedy. We see custody being used rarely, if ever. The
starting point is information, advice and guidance, mentoring,
counselling, support for parents and for young people through schools

before you start considering the legal remedy. If you do consider the
legal remedy, you must come to a sensible decision about whether it

						</i> In a sense, you have answered your own
question by using that terminology. There are a number of innovative
arrangements with different authorities throughout the country, whereby
many youngsters, who had become disengaged with learning at 16, have
been drawn back into youth support and outreach. Because of that
different learning environment, they have become mentors of others who
have become disengaged, and equally, those mentors have begun to
re-engage with the educative process and, in many cases, become young
potential youth workers. It is a different route. It brings us back to
one fundamental point about this principle: it is about motivating and
finding out what engages young people not only at this age but earlier
at 11 or 14, because once you have an understanding of the innate
abilities of the young people with whom you are dealing, you can flex a
learning environment and opportunities around that young
person&#146;s interest, which is the way you drive their
participation&#151;not by standing behind them with a whacking great
stick. In my view, that is a sign of failure. Given that we have five
years and seven years for the local authorities to provide the
strategic leadership with their partners in order to put in place the
right frameworks within the secondary sector, I honestly believe that
the need to use the sanction in the Bill will be minimal. It will not
be the golden goose that the legal profession

vexed issue of enforcement. I am pleased to see that, like many others,
both the LGA and the

authorities have good experience of working within systems of
enforcement. I am interested in whether we can learn any lessons from
your experience about how we could run a system of enforcement. I am
even more interested in the difference of tone between the two
organisations in the two papers. From the LGA&#146;s side, I would be
very interested to hear from Councillor Lawrence where the LGA sits.
Does it support the duty, but not enforcement? If it supports
enforcement, as well as the duty, is that just civil enforcement, or
should we go even further to criminal enforcement? Where does the LGA
sit on the spectrum? From paragraph 19 of the ADCS submission, I take
it that in &#147;very exceptional circumstances&#148;&#151;I
think that is the phrase&#151;the ADCS supports enforcement through
the whole spectrum. Will you set out

exception, as I said before, of custody. In our view, without the end
point of the legal duties, and the compulsion through the law, the
remaining changes to culture, the NEETs strategy, and things such as
diplomas and apprenticeships, will have an effect, but there will not
be the expectation that it is genuinely and seriously the norm and that
it is the way to do things. I reiterate my point that we see
enforcement as the last option and, indeed, an indication that we have
failed somewhere. A disengaged young person is not just an indication
that they have failed, but that we have
failed.</div>
					<a name="080122107000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
general point of enforcement, as a director of children&#146;s

not have them, I would have different conversations with a range of
people. For example, I have powers to intervene in schools, under
certain circumstances. I have never used those powers, but without
them, my leverage on the activity would be much reduced. I believe that
the compulsion needs to be there as a last

						</i> The view from the LGA is that the sanction
is the very last resort. We do not disagree with the intent, but that
intent should be seen in the context of the overall direction in which
to go&#151;not as one of the prime elements but as a final sanction
to be applied in
extremis.</div>
					<a name="080122107000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">It should
be a civil sanction. I would argue that if you criminalise around this
area, you then create tension and conflict with a whole series of other
areas of the law which rightly should involve a criminal sanction
because of the nature of the offence being committed. In that sense,
this offence&#151;non-participation&#151;is a civil offence, not a
criminal offence whereby one has brought about distress to another
person or damage to the property of another
person.</div>
					<a name="080122107000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is also
a slight difference in that, yes, parenting orders have been
successfully applied in cases involving children up to the age of 16,
but the legal framework is that the responsibilities of parents to a
young person between 16 and 18 and to one who is 15 years 364 days 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column73" />Column number: 73</div>are different. I do not think that that difference has been fully drawn
out in the nature of the sanctions being applied. I do not think that
the application of a parenting order post-16 would be seen by the
courts in the same context as a parenting order pre-16 in terms of the
responsibility being placed on the parent. That is another reason why
we think that the offence should be contained solely within the civil
arena.</div>

of enforcement used only in exceptional circumstances. Our last witness

						</i> Consistency of high-quality support is
already one of our key priorities. It has to be, because in order to
secure good outcomes for children and young people, it stands to reason
and is obvious that we need to provide them with the appropriate
support, information and guidance&#151;and that applies now, not just
under the new legislation. It is very important that young people,
particularly those who are at risk of not engaging or who are
vulnerable in various ways, are supported to engage. As stated in our
evidence, and as somebody else said earlier this afternoon, up to the
age of 18 they are children within the meaning of the Act. Therefore,
that is part of our existing
priority.</div>
					<a name="080122107000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of the
interesting changes in the present year, 2008-09, is that the
Connexions grant will form part of the area-based grant,
non-ring-fenced and within the overall area. It is having an
interesting effect, in that people in my position are engaging in a
debate with local strategic partnerships and councils on what the money
is being used for, why it is being used in the way it is, how it can be
best used and how partners can come together to get the best possible
outcomes, rather than its being dealt with in isolation as a specific
grant that does something that somehow is outside the purview of the
children&#146;s trust overall. So this is a high priority for us
already. It is becoming a priority across the whole of the
children&#146;s trust and the local strategic partnership through the
mechanism that I just
described.</div>
					<a name="080122107000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">In terms
of central Government, clearly there will be
standards inspection, the comprehensive area assessment, and those
mechanisms which will look both at what we do, in providing
information, advice, guidance and support and the other requirements
that are set out in legislation, and at the outcomes. If the outcomes
are not good, whatever we do, if it is not in the outcomes, is less
effective.</div>

the outcome must be beneficial for the person who has participated in
the arrangements that were deemed  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column74" />Column number: 74</div>appropriate for them. There is an area that perhaps needs to be looked
at with regard to the quality assurance: we have an inspectoral regime
for colleges and local authorities, but how will we be able to provide
that assurance for those opportunities provided by employers? Local
authorities do not have any jurisdiction over those who are providing
the apprenticeship or training schemes that will be part of what we
will be offering young people and engaging them
with.</div>
					<a name="080122107000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">Equally,
I would suggest that, within quality assurance, you must consider the
range of opportunities that are available to young people. There is the
tension between an urban and a rural environment. In a city such as my
own, Birmingham, we will have no problem in conjunction with our
neighbouring authorities being able to provide a range of different
experiences and opportunities to young people. If you go to Cornwall,
or Cumbria, or Northumberland, how you provide young people with the
access, and then the opportunity that meets their needs, skills, and
competencies, becomes a different order of question. The quality
assurance aspect in that situation is different to that which we can
provide in an urban area, where it is based on the range of
opportunities that you can provide. So, there is an extra
dimension.</div>
					<a name="080122107000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">Plus, as I
say, how do we provide that process of inspection without making it
overbearing, prescriptive, and restrictive on employers who, at the end

there is sufficient spare capacity in the system for sixth form and FE

groups which are, by definition, quite high-maintenance. They might be

						</i> I think that the question I was asked
was about the information systems and the capacity in the system.
Inevitably, you are right. The likelihood is that we will be working
with a harder-to-reach group, who will need additional support. That
goes back to the question of the levels of support required and the
minimum entitlement of that support. Certainly, it is a key question
that the 14-to-19 partnerships operating throughout the country are
tackling at the
moment.</div>
					<a name="080122107000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">We may have
an entitlement, we may have a range of pathways for young people, but
how do you pull together support packages for individuals that enable
them to access, and, more importantly, stay on and achieve in those
pathways? That needs to be designed as part of that partnership; for
example, in dialogue with schools, FE colleges, and employers about
their particular needs. Of course, as we have heard, all employers will
have slightly different needs in terms of the level of support they
require, whether mentoring support for young people or logistical
support with families.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column75" />Column number: 75</div>
					<a name="080122107000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">Certainly, if we take an
approach that personalises the package for young people, each of those
individuals will have a different set of needs, whether ADHD at one end
of the spectrum or involvement in criminality at the other. The local
authorities obviously have significant resources to broker into that.
They are delivering many of them already, but some of them will
possibly need to be reconfigured for a slightly different age range. We
still need to work through that. Inevitably, there could be
reprioritisation of those resources in order to enable it to happen.
So, the key issue for local authorities is how we might reprioritise if
there are no additional
resources.</div>

us to consider the financial envelope, not only in the context of the

health service and by the child and adult mental health service.
Equally, we have to consider how we can utilise things like local area

assist local authorities in targeting resources to specific indicator
requirements currently in place for local authorities and, dare I say
it, to link them back for Government to the public service agreements,

The recent report by Professor Watts and Allister McGowan on monitoring
what is happening at the moment suggests that there are already very
wide variations in the way in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column76" />Column number: 76</div>which the new Connexions services are to be delivered to local

that causes you concern, given what was said earlier about the need to

						</i> I think it would not be inappropriate to
say that the provision of Connexions services was variable in the
extreme across the country&#151;from very poor service provision to
exemplary provision. What tends to happen within local authorities at
the moment depends on what service had been provided prior to the
decision to take it into the local authorities&#146; jurisdiction. I
think that inevitably, because you are seeking to devolve the
responsibility to local authorities, it will bring about a variance in
the nature and type of provision, simply because local authorities will
gear the new arrangements to the needs and requirements of their
localities. That means that they may well continue&#151;Warwickshire
is a good example&#151;to use the Connexions service that was there
before. They have been commissioned. Equally, some local authorities,
like my own, because it was provided across Birmingham and Solihull,
disaggregated the original service and were providing it in a much more
localised way throughout the city, whereas in Solihull they have
literally taken it in to their new trust arrangements.</div>
					<a name="080122107000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am confident that local
authorities will look at the new service in the context of their needs
and requirements, and actually make it a more localised provision,
depending upon the nature of the localities and neighbourhoods that
they serve. So what we will see happen somewhere like Northumberland
will be of a very different nature, much more localised, than what you
see in a city like Birmingham, which will be more
area-based.</div>

that it will embed those services as part of an integrated youth

no mechanisms to ensure that that money will be spent in a way that is
coherent with that. There is no ring-fencing and even at this early

framework and, certainly, many of the outcomes that were expected of
the previous Connexions service before it migrated&#151;or even

local authorities and their partners. I think that I speak
categorically for directors and local authorities when I say that we

focus. We see that there is a level of efficiency in integration and
joining up, which is an opportunity for local authorities and their
partners that had not been realised when the services were separate and
worked in parallel with each other. My experience of local authorities

move of the 14 to 19 funding vis- -vis the LSC to local

level local authorities can now begin to plan and commission what they
require to provide for the young people within their jurisdiction. That
is a very different context from the current one, where I would suggest
that much relates to how many bums on seats you can get in any

will be much more coherent with regard to the quality of outcomes, the

There also has to be flexibility for the providers, whether they be the

their needs locally on all the issues from literacy and numeracy to
high-level skills and all the soft skills of employment. It should all

highlight one of the tensions that exists in terms of how we ensure

those in urban environments. Take, for example, two counties in the
west midlands: Herefordshire and Shropshire. Both have single centres
of population, and there is a natural gravity in terms of the way
people see those as the focuses of the two counties. Therefore, one of
the first things you need to have in place is the transport cost. That
is not covered by the Bill, but it is an inherent cost of which I think
the Government need to take account if you are asking a young person to
travel. Often you will find that the economic base of the rural economy
is far lower than in urban areas, even taking into account economic and
social deprivation indices. That is the first factor.</div>

						</b> We heard from people giving evidence earlier that
there will be various tiers to this: there will be a role for primary
schools in identifying youngsters and their attitudes. Obviously, there
will be a role for secondary schools in engaging them in the learning
process and then moving some on to sixth form and some to college. I
want to be absolutely clear: are you, as local authorities, absolutely
convinced that there will be funding mechanisms in place to ensure that
that is
affordable?</div>

						</i> Much of that work has already started,
in terms of our NEETs strategies that are already in place. It starts
even with pre-primary school children in terms of family attitudes to
work, especially  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column80" />Column number: 80</div>where there is intergenerational worklessness. We see this as a natural
extension of the work that is already going on, and feel that there is
capacity within the system to deliver most of this. We need to be
cautious in picking up that point: we have not quite seen the full
impact of migration of services such as Connexions to the local
authority, and we appreciate that children with additional needs are
becoming more prevalent, and often their needs are becoming more
complex. We do need to monitor that over the coming years, towards full
implementation, but we certainly feel that there is capacity in the
system, and that it builds on the work we are already doing. Much of
the windfall comes from a more integrated, more coherent approach
across local authorities, within local authorities, and with other
partners such as the health community and the LSC as it stands at the
moment and in the
future.</div>

coherent, integrated approach, which is a more efficient approach to
delivering this. We would never say no to money, but the reality is
that this is developing and working well within the 14 to 19
arrangements as they are developing, and we see this as a natural
development from

						</i> Pretty well, I think. There are some
exceptions, some of which cause us, as directors, significant concern,
but overall pretty well. The issues that face us from time to time are
on what I would describe as grey exclusions, when young people who are
causing difficulty at a school are advised by the school not to be
there. That is an unprofessional approach, and when we come across it
we take appropriate action. Those young people have an entitlement to
be in school. Sometimes there is collusion between parents, children
and schools in that, and it is entirely regrettable. In my view, it is
driven in part by the fact that the curriculum being offered by the
school is not meeting the young person&#146;s
needs.</div>

question? I would like to be able to come back on that one. I want to
explore what you understand &#147;reasonable excuse&#148; to mean
in relation to not being in education or employment at 16. If somebody
is a 17-year-old parent and has a drug 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column81" />Column number: 81</div>addiction or mental health problem at the same time, and they are
already with the relevant services such as a GP and drugs service,

training?</div>

						</i> Actually, I think that many of those
young people are engaged already. It is about making our offer more
flexible and having a broader range of pathways for them. There will
always be a small group that is left outside that, because of either a
drug addiction or their inability to engage, but we need to ensure that
we are still engaging with them, even though it may not be in an
education, training or skills environment. We must have an interface
with them so that they are still in the system. We cannot afford for
them to be out of the
system.</div>

						</i> There are occasions when young
people&#146;s needs are complex, whether they are suffering serious
emotional or mental trauma, in in-patient facilities or subject to a
high level of psychiatric or psychological support. I also think that
there are some illnesses and medical conditions that make it much more
difficult for them to engage, and there are some family circumstances
that affect their ability to engage for short periods. They may be
subject to abuse from parents, or there could be safeguarding issues
that prevent them from
engaging.</div>

						</i> I have two comments. First, the assessment
of local authorities through the Ofsted framework of annual performance
assessments and joint area reviews shows that school improvement and
services across the country are good on average, which is quite
reassuring. On the detail of the support for the national strategies,
it is rated as good throughout the country, and I have no particular
concerns about that issue. However, there are too many young people
leaving primary and secondary school with too low a level of literacy
and numeracy. That is not an excuse or a ducking; it is accepted
throughout the profession, by  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column82" />Column number: 82</div>children&#146;s services colleagues in local authorities and in
schools. A range of different approaches is being taken to secure
improvement.</div>

						</b> To build on your point about access and transport
in rural and urban areas, have you undertaken any further studies
throughout your authorities, factoring in rurality, by which I
particularly mean sparsity, and the local economic profile? Building on
your point, Councillor Lawrence, I believe that those rural areas with
a narrow economic base and a sparse or scattered population will be
particularly adversely affected.</div>

						</i> We have sought
considerable information from our member authorities, not initially on
that issue, but on the &#147;Youth Matters&#148; issue and the
positive activities for young people programme. Often, such activities
could be provided only during school term times in the evenings, and
you tend to find in shire counties the duality of responsibility for
provision, with transport provided by the county and the location for
activities provided by the districts. We tried to get an idea of the
transport infrastructure in many of those counties, and one finding
that we have already is that, often, bus services stop at about 6 or 7
o&#146;clock, so activities are difficult to provide.</div>
					<a name="080122107000316"></a><div class="hs_Para">If you try to provide a
transport infrastructure for the provision of the opportunities under
discussion, it becomes even more difficult, because something else that
we have discovered is that during the middle of the day, classes do not
tend to operate. The county councils network is coming to present data,
views and costs, so we will have a more substantive body of information
in the next month or two. The National Youth Agency is also examining
transport issues, because of the &#147;Youth Matters&#148;
paper.</div>
