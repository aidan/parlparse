                           <strong> </strong>The original intent behind the health in
pregnancy grant was to give expectant mothers a one-off grant to help
with the costs of a healthy lifestyle, including a better diet in the
later stages of pregnancy. I shall come on to the later stages of
pregnancy and whether that is the best time for the grant later. I
shall also deal with the general issue of whether paying expectant
mothers a grant in pregnancy is a good use of public funds, but I wish
first to outline the purpose of the
amendments.<a class="bkMark" name="10111156000018">&#160;</a>

44 and the equivalent amendment 45 applying to Northern Ireland call
for the health in pregnancy grant not to be axed in January 2011, but
to continue until January 2014. We are pushed for time and will be
debating separately amendment 42 tabled by my hon. Friend the Member
for Stretford and Urmston, which calls for a full review of the impact
of the grant on maternal health before the grant is abolished. Given
that it covers much of the same ground, I do not intend to dwell too
much on the case for postponing the axing of the grant until 2014,
except to make the point that as we are discussing the general benefits
of the health in pregnancy grant, its impact and benefit have not yet
been fully evaluated. In their evidence, witnesses said that it has
more or less been implemented and will be whisked away before anyone
has had a chance to assess it—something that amendment 42 would
deal with in more
detail.<a class="bkMark" name="10111156000019">&#160;</a>

repeat the call for the grant to be reprieved until January 2014, and
would also make it payable to women from the 12th week of pregnancy.
That picks up on a point made during the evidence sessions when it was
said that the 25th week is too late in a woman’s pregnancy for
the grant to be paid and that it would be better if it was paid earlier
when nutrition is more
important.<a class="bkMark" name="10111156000020">&#160;</a>

48, and amendment 49 that would be applicable to Northern Ireland,
reiterate the 12-week point, but are open-ended. They would provide for
the grant to continue indefinitely rather than there being a 2011 or
2014 cut-off date. They would also introduce an element of
means-testing, and link the measure to eligibility for child benefit,
which picks up on the criticisms of those who say that the grant should
be better targeted towards those who are most in need of the extra
money. At the moment, child benefit is a universal benefit, but the
Government have announced that they intend to means-test it, albeit in
a fairly random way—a point that we shall come to later in the
debate. The amendments would build on the notion that despite its
somewhat misleading name, the health in pregnancy grant was envisaged
originally as an advance on child benefit before the child was
born.<a class="bkMark" name="10111156000021">&#160;</a>

There is an issue with the fact that it is paid in the 12th week, when
miscarriages are more likely to occur than in the 25th week. But there
are equally valid arguments about the nutritional benefit to the
mother. We heard evidence about that, and quite a few people also
raised the issue on Second Reading. If the main purpose of the grant is
to improve health in pregnancy, the earlier in pregnancy that the grant
is made payable and people receive the advice that is linked to the

debate seems to be turning up many incredibly important
matters—maternal health and helping the most disadvantaged
families—and all of us, particularly those who have been through
pregnancies, would support the need for extremely early intervention in
maternal health. That has consequences for improved foetal and child
health down the road, which are very important. However, we have moved
beyond being able to throw taxpayers’ money at a wall marked
good intentions. There was no evidence, before the policy was
introduced, that this was the best way to deliver better maternal
health.

work to address poor nutrition during pregnancy and the early years of
the child’s life. There was also a body of work on intervention.
She can read the debates that took place when the policy was
introduced. It is nonsense to say that it is just about good intentions
and that somebody thought it would be nice to give people a bit of

be moved from the 25th week to the 12th week. That is a valid
criticism, which was raised by Government Members on Second Reading and
by witnesses. However, that we think there should be a debate on moving
the payment to the 12th week does not mean that we think it is
completely ineffective at the 25th week. We received evidence from
witnesses that the money could be put to other uses at the 25th week,
and that it was valued by recipients. Unfortunately, because of the
grouping of the amendments and because hon. Members have intervened on
me so early, we are having a debate about the 12th week issue,
means-testing and the efficacy of the grant all in one, which makes

Lady’s point about the evidence when the measure was introduced.
I have read the reports, and a huge body of evidence was given to the
then Government showing that the grant would not achieve its aim, which
was to improve the health of the mother during pregnancy and the health
outcomes of the baby. It was demonstrated clearly that the grant would
be given too late and would not deliver its
purpose.<a class="bkMark" name="10111156000055">&#160;</a>

                              </span>
                           </strong> That leads to the issue of whether it was seen
as an advanced child benefit. The 25th week was seen as
administratively easy because women go for their antenatal appointment
at that time if it is their first child, or a little later if it is
their second. There is a debate to be had about whether the date should
be moved forward. I am happy to put the amendment on moving the payment
to the 12th week to a vote. However, I think that people have used the
argument about whether it would be more effective at that date to
suggest that it is ineffective at the 25th week, and I refuse to
concede that. We have received substantial evidence to suggest that it
is useful. People might use it for things that do not relate directly
to health in pregnancy, for instance lump-sum payments on items such as
buggies, but the fact that they have to get into the system and receive
advice from a specialist before they can access the grant is important.
I am happy, as I have said, to push the 12-week issue to a vote.
However, I think that certain members of the Committee are using it as
a spurious reason to reject the whole of the grant. If Government
Members think that the grant would be a good thing if it was paid
earlier, they ought to vote for it to remain but to be paid in the 12th
week, rather than vote to axe it
altogether.<a class="bkMark" name="10111156000056">&#160;</a>

Second Reading—it also reared its head during the evidence

on anything. The Netmums evidence also referred to the idea that there
is no control over it. On Second Reading, there was an unpleasant
suggestion that women could not be trusted to spend such money in the
best interests of their own health during pregnancy, or in the

squander the money, and there was a reference from the Netmums evidence
that somebody spent the grant on spa treatment.<a class="bkMark" name="10111156000066">&#160;</a>

anecdotal evidence about the behaviour of a few people to negate the

press officer asked for examples of people who were raking in thousands
and thousands of pounds in housing benefit and was told that the
Department did not have
statistics—<em>[</em>

                           <em> </em>The
Chairman is quite capable of telling me if I have gone off the topic,
and I am about to conclude that point. When the DWP was asked for
evidence of people with excessive housing benefits claims, it said that
it did not have statistics, but if people looked at the <em>Daily Mail
</em>or <em>The Sun </em>websites they would find plenty of stories about
that. We are falling into the
trap—<em>[</em>

stage where we are dancing on the head of a pin, but there should have
been a full consultation. The Government should push back the date of
the abolition of the grant to 2014, as in the amendment. We need more
time to see whether the scheme works. To return to the intervention by
the hon. Member for Blackpool North and Cleveleys, the fact that the
provision 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 281<a class="bkMark" name="Column281">&#160;</a>
                           </div>brings people into the system to get maternal advice is important. It
has provided a boost to people’s incomes that they can spend on
a better diet, or on other things that they may need during the later
stages of pregnancy. That is also important. People who work in the
field say that the grant is incredibly valuable and should not be taken
away.<a class="bkMark" name="10111156000086">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There is some
ideological confusion from the Government on the question of
universality and means-testing, especially when it comes to
implementing policies. The Government argue that one of the problems
with the grant is that it goes to everybody, regardless of income, and
therefore it inevitably goes to some people who do not need the money
and who spend it on frivolities, as the Netmums evidence showed. I am
not sure where that leaves the Government on other universal benefits
such as the winter fuel allowance. Some pensioners in receipt of that
are in the same position, but we do not have time to go into that
matter today.<a class="bkMark" name="10111156000087">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Two
approaches can be taken to means-testing. The first is to restrict the
grant to people on benefits who receive Healthy Start or Sure Start
support during pregnancy. The other is to link the grant to child
benefit, as in the amendment. The coalition Government want to
means-test child benefit. They argue that child benefit is not needed
by the better-off and that the money could be put to better use,
primarily in paying off the deficit. That point is arguable, but it is
not something that the Labour party supports. It is a reasonable enough
stance to take, except for the fact that the Government have got
themselves into a mess on the issue of child benefit. The way that they
have introduced means-testing for child benefit means that a household
with one earner on more than £44,000 a year would not be
eligible for child benefit, whereas a household with two people who
earn £40,000 each would be.<a class="bkMark" name="10111156000088">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The amendment
links the means-testing to the reforms to child benefit, but that
should not be seen as an endorsement of what the Government are
planning to do with child benefit. We think that it is a muddle and
that the Government have got themselves in a mess on the issue of
independent taxation and we would not endorse the measure along those
lines. However, because the health in pregnancy grant was originally
intended as an advance form of child benefit, that is the easiest thing
to link it to.<a class="bkMark" name="10111156000089">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Let me also
make it clear that our preferred option is that the grant should not be
means-tested and that it should continue as a universal benefit.
However, because so many Government Members were arguing, during the
evidence session and on Second Reading, that the fact that the grant
was not targeted was a problem, we wanted to use this amendment to
tease out whether they would be happy to accept it if it was a more
targeted form of benefit.<a class="bkMark" name="10111156000090">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Alternatively,
we could have suggested that the grant was simply added to the Sure
Start maternity grant, which is a one-off payment to people on certain
benefits to meet the cost of their new baby. That grant has now been
abolished for second and subsequent children and is only for a first
child. Adding the health in pregnancy grant to the Sure Start maternity
grant would be quite easy to administer and therefore we would not have
the problems of trying to unpick the mess that surrounds what the
Government are trying to do on child benefit. However, it would mean
that the £190 would go only to 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 282<a class="bkMark" name="Column282">&#160;</a>
                           </div>those people in receipt of those particular benefits, which is obviously
a much smaller group of people than those who would be entitled to
means-tested child benefit when it is introduced.<a class="bkMark" name="10111156000091">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In the
evidence session, the representative of the National Childbirth Trust
thought that the health in pregnancy grant should be linked to child
benefit at 12 weeks. She thought that it was quite important
that the grant should not just reach the women on very low levels of
income who suffer from poor nutrition, but that it was also important
that it should reach women on the next level up. Obviously, linking the
grant to child benefit also fits in with the original intention that
the grant would in effect be child benefit in advance, which several
witnesses endorsed as a good concept.<a class="bkMark" name="10111156000092">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We have
already touched on the issue of whether the grant should be paid as a
lump sum or in instalments. We heard evidence that lump sum payments
can be useful, but we also heard evidence that smaller and more
frequent payments might be more likely to be spent on food and
nutrition. It is arguable that if someone receives a lump sum,
particularly later in the pregnancy, it might be more likely to be used
for something such as a buggy, although for people on very low incomes
there are other grants that might be available, for example the Sure
Start maternity grant, for such things. At least one witness said that
if the health in pregnancy grant was paid in instalments, it would be
more likely to be used to meet the weekly food bill and therefore it
might have more of an impact on food and nutrition. The Institute for
Fiscal Studies said that there was a case for either approach. Belinda
Phipps from the NCT said that both approaches were needed and that
parents struggle in both respects. I would be interested to hear what
other people think about this
issue.<a class="bkMark" name="10111156000093">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
have already addressed the issue of whether payments should be brought
forward to 12 weeks. I reiterate the point that because one of the
advantages of the grant is that there is a precondition that women must
seek advice on maternal health matters from a health professional
before they are entitled to receive it, bringing the date forward to 12
weeks obviously means that they would access that advice much earlier,
which could be significant.<a class="bkMark" name="10111156000094">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I really would encourage the hon. Lady just not
to go there with these amendments. So many people lose babies in the
first trimester. I think that the estimates are that one in three
pregnancies end in the first trimester and people will know very many
people who have had miscarriages in the first trimester. Just let us
not go there.<a class="bkMark" name="10111156000095">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> That is a valid point for debate. However, this
issue was consistently raised by people on Second Reading. I think that
the hon. Member for Birmingham, Yardley has raised it at various times.
It also came up during the evidence sessions. It is arguable whether we
should look at the 12th week, the 16th week or whatever, but I think
that it is certainly worth having a debate on this issue because so
many people are saying that this grant is not of value because it is
paid at the 25th week and therefore too late in pregnancy.
Consequently, it is important that we have a debate about whether we
can pay the grant earlier rather than axing it altogether and saying
that it is a bad thing. Nevertheless, I accept that the issue of when
the grant

			Column number: 283<a class="bkMark" name="Column283">&#160;</a>
                           </div>should be paid is a very difficult and sensitive
one, because there will be women who lose babies around that earlier
time. If the hon. Lady wanted to propose an amendment on Report setting
the date of payment at 16 weeks or 20 weeks, that might be
quite a valid thing to do.<a class="bkMark" name="10111156000096">&#160;</a>

recognise that the idea of payment at 12 weeks would no
doubt have been debated when the original legislation was brought in;
that no doubt it was rejected for the reasons that we have found so
easily this morning, and that to pay this grant in the seventh month,
when the baby is viable, is a plausible timing, but means that this is
more a baby bonus rather than a health in pregnancy

separate issue from whether the money is spent on those

sitting in this Room on the Government Benches, it seems to me that it
is now cavalier to simply say, “Well, all these amendments are
ridiculous. We just need to abolish this,” because the
amendments address issues that have been raised—not necessarily
ones with which I fully agree, because there are problems with various
suggestions. I take the issues raised by the hon. Member for West
Worcestershire about the difficulties that could arise before the
12th week of pregnancy; it is a fair point to debate and
consider. There are also issues about means-testing, because, after
all, one of the problems is that for those who are just above
means-tested levels, whatever they are, there can be considerable
resentment and difficulty. Those who are enthusiastic about targeting
benefits on those who need them most have to realise that there are
substantial issues with doing that that disadvantage another group of
people.<a class="bkMark" name="10111156000101">&#160;</a>

heard, both in the evidence sessions and from Government Members, a
number of good suggestions and reasonable criticisms of the payment as
it was originally structured. I am disappointed to hear so many
negatives now being raised to the same points—at least it
appears to me to be so—that the same hon. Members were espousing
previously. That brings us back to the point that I hope we will debate
shortly, which is that to address the matter in such a way right from
the start and simply say, “Here are a few benefits

looking at it in the round, is exactly what is getting us into this
position now where we cannot necessarily weigh all the evidence. We
heard some compelling evidence from the witnesses who attended on the
importance of the payment, and we have heard other evidence
from some who felt that the payment was poorly targeted. It
is, in my view, a case for looking at the matter in greater
depth.<a class="bkMark" name="10111156000102">&#160;</a>

speech made by the hon. Member for Bristol East demonstrates some of
the challenges of the grant. It is described as a health in pregnancy
grant, but it is not linked entirely to health in pregnancy because it
is paid too late. It is a lump-sum payment, and there is no requirement
or stipulation on how it should be spent. Of course, the justification
goes back to health, but there is no evidence about how that works. The
right hon. Member for Delyn asked why there was no full consultation on
scrapping the grant. I gently point out to him that there was no
consultation on its introduction either. If there had been some
consultation or evidence gathered about its effectiveness, perhaps
Opposition Members would have been better placed to defend
it.<a class="bkMark" name="10111156000103">&#160;</a>

the Minister that there were lively debates between Ministers and the
Child Poverty Action Group, which I then led, as well as between
Ministers and many other children’s organisations. Those
discussions were about the best way of supporting women in the course
of pregnancy, with a particular focus on the financial side. While
there may not have been a specific consultation, I can assure him that
there was an extensive discussion

That is not the argument that we are making. We are saying that this
does not work, it is not effective, it is not targeted and therefore we
should simply scrap it, rather than spending money to rebrand it. The
right hon. Member for Delyn has mentioned a number of times in the

out to him that Ian Pearson, my predecessor in this role, never

that the grant would be more effective if it was paid earlier, in which
case the route to go down would be to examine whether it would be
effective if it was paid at 12 weeks or at a different point ahead of
25 weeks. He also said that it was not linked to health and
that other schemes such as the Healthy Start vouchers were more
effective. Those vouchers, however, are available only to those on very
low incomes. Does the Minister think that this £190 should be
additional money for those on low incomes, because they will be losing
out on the £190? Alternatively, does he think that the Healthy
Start scheme should be extended, so that the vouchers are available to
those on higher incomes? He seems to be saying that the Healthy Start
voucher scheme is a good thing, if we are taking away the health in
pregnancy grant because the grant does not work in the right way.

                        <p class="tabbed">Abolishing
the health in pregnancy grant will help to reduce the United
Kingdom’s deficit. It will save £40 million
this year and £150 million per year thereafter. As I said on
Second Reading, there are better ways to spend the money and, having
decided that, we need to abolish the health in pregnancy grant. The
Government believe that that should be done quickly to maximum
Exchequer savings, so delaying abolition to 2014, as
amendments 44, 45, 46 and 47 would do, would mean reducing
those savings. If that were not done, additional money would have to be
found through other spending cuts, borrowing or tax rises. The hon.
Lady did not say how she would provide money for
that.<a class="bkMark" name="10111156000117">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendments
48, 49, 52 and 53 would make eligibility to the health in pregnancy
grant contingent on child benefit. That remains universal until January
2013, so the health in pregnancy grant would not be targeted
effectively on those who need support in pregnancy, as it would remain
universal until that time. In any case, the Government’s most
urgent task is to reduce the UK’s budget deficit, and hard
decisions have to be taken based on what the country can afford to
spend. Exchequer savings from abolishing the grant would be reduced
significantly if some mothers remained eligible or if it were paid
earlier in pregnancy, as amendments 48 to 53 would
do.<a class="bkMark" name="10111156000118">&#160;</a>

44, 45 and 50 to 53 would mean that the health in pregnancy grant
continued to be payable from the 25th week. There is no doubt that
maintaining a healthy diet throughout pregnancy is important. However,

as I said earlier, the Government are committed to supporting the
health of pregnant women in low-income households through the Healthy
Start scheme, which provides support from the 10th week of pregnancy
when diet is particularly important in a baby’s development. The
scheme provides vouchers worth £3.10 a week for fruit,
vegetables and milk, as well as coupons to exchange for healthy start
vitamin supplements containing the recommended daily amounts of
vitamins C, D and folic acid, for pregnant women and new
mothers. It provides a nutritional safety net and encouragement for

other Departments, but I am sure that my hon. Friend will put that
point to the Department of Health. It is important that mothers access
the support that is available. Advice is available for expectant
mothers from health visitors and at hospital appointments. That advice
deals with some of the issues that Opposition Members have raised about
stress and better diet. Opposition Members should remember the schemes

have faced difficult choices on where to cut public expenditure. We
cannot afford to continue spending £150 million a year on a cash

what it is spent on and of the income or financial position of the
recipient. I believe that we should go ahead with the abolition of the
grant. I do not believe that we should maintain it or pay an equivalent
amount in monthly instalments. It is not even clear how long that would
go on for under amendments 50, 52 and 53. I do not believe that we
should make it payable from the 12th week, as under amendments 46, 47,

breastfeeding. Costs in pregnancy include the purchase of items such as
breast pumps, and the NCT provides a wonderful service in ensuring that

the Sure Start maternity grant and Healthy Start vouchers would remain

<em>v.</em> Hart is relevant. The interpretation of statute starts with
the words in statute. Pepper <em>v.</em> Hart was a case involving the
Revenue and it allowed consideration of discussions to be brought into
that. However, the words are quite clear and the word
“split” does not appear in the amendment. I recommend
that the Opposition withdraw that amendment. It is so badly phrased

underlying point is that if one is to implement policy, there should be
evidence—not opinion—to justify the policy. This policy
has been in place for two years, but there is no evidence that it
works. The Government have to focus on things that achieve results.
Good maternal health prior to conception, during pregnancy and
post-birth, is important for the health of the child. However, there is
no evidence that the grant works, and we have to cut some
things.<a class="bkMark" name="10111156000144">&#160;</a>

However, the life of the grant has been fairly short. If we look at
some of the research into child health, we might expect to see the

some of the people who surround the coalition Government about the

for their lives. The whole idea of the big society is that we want to
get away from the nanny state and we want people to be empowered and
nudged, if you like, to make decisions on their own accord. The fact
that it was linked to advice from a health professional—it is
not just about the money—fits entirely with the
Government’s agenda that people sometimes need a little bit of
nudging, but the benefits far outweigh the outlay on the initial

we need to do our homework on the Liberal Democrats slightly better, so

amendments that extend the date from 2011 to 2014 would provide such an

professionals that it would be a good thing to continue. We do not have
quantitative evidence based on the actual outcome of it having been
introduced, because it is in its early stages, but we need breathing
space to be able to do that work. The amendments calling for the date
to be changed from 2011 to 2014, and amendment 42, which we
will come to, allow us that breathing space. That is better than
rushing to axe things in the interests of reducing the deficit. We
could have a separate argument about whether the Government are rushing
too fast and the damage that that would cause, but I am sure

interesting studies have found that changes to the diet of young
offenders, even when they are adults, can have a significant impact on
their behaviour. A lot more work needs to be done on whether poor
nutritional standards early in life have a knock-on effect. As my hon.
Friend says, it is important not to jettison policies that are linked
to the early intervention agenda. Indeed, if we consider pregnancy and
pre-conception, Katherine Rake gave evidence and said  that
some of her colleagues, who are perhaps more middle class than the
people we are thinking of when

advance. They were taking folic acid and vitamin supplements. They were
very aware that they wanted to get themselves in the best nutritional
shape and best health before they tried to conceive. There is a whole
agenda here. It is received wisdom among many people that we should be
considering such things and trying to nudge people towards that sort of

return to the Minister’s specific points. I look forward to
reading through what he and some of his colleagues have said during
today’s sitting. It seems to me that completely conflicting
points are being used on each amendment. At one point, he says that the
health in pregnancy grant is not valuable because it is not
paid  at 12 weeks, but we have also had a debate about the
12th week not being good either. I do not accept what he
says about the open-endedness of it being paid in monthly instalments.
I think that the hon. Member for Birmingham, Yardley got confused in
suggesting that £190 would be paid every month from the 25th
week onwards. The matter was discussed with the Clerks in the Public
Bill Office and I made it clear that there would be no extra spending
commitment—the £190 would be paid monthly rather than as
a lump sum. If the Minister thinks there is something technically wrong
with that amendment, he would be entitled to bring something back on
Report to make it clear that there is no additional spending commitment
and that the grant finishes when the child is born. The fact that it is
called the health in pregnancy grant implies that it is paid during
pregnancy and ceases to be paid when the child is born. I accept that
monthly instalments might create an administrative burden, and there
are issues over
assessment.<a class="bkMark" name="10111156000190">&#160;</a>

have cited my hon. Friend the Member for Stretford and Urmston often
today, but she has made several valid points. She said that pregnancy
can be a factor that pushes women into poverty. For example, if they
have not been in a job long enough to qualify for maternity leave, they
may lose their job after becoming pregnant, so their financial
circumstances would change. If we went down the means-testing route, we
would have to do a fair amount of work on how eligibility would be
assessed and that might get
complicated.<a class="bkMark" name="10111156000191">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Regarding amendment 45 specifically, does my
hon. Friend agree that an extension of the grant might allow the
Treasury to carry out more work to establish how this grant has
impacted on those with the lowest incomes and those who are most likely
to see poor outcomes in child health, and that that is perhaps what we
should be specifically concerned about at this difficult
time?<a class="bkMark" name="10111156000192">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> That is the case. Although the Minister has
praised the Healthy Start vouchers and the Sure Start maternity grant,
I think that the Healthy Start vouchers are available only for
low-income families—that is the starting point. There is one
voucher of £2.80 a week for pregnant women and for
children between the ages of one to four, and there are two vouchers of
£2.80 each a week for children under the age of one, so people
get a little bit more money in the first year of a child’s life.
Those vouchers could be spent on milk, fruit and vegetables.<a class="bkMark" name="10111156000193">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I think that
some women on Netmums were saying that some shops are a bit lax about
the vouchers and there was some suggestion that somebody could spend
them on a bottle of vodka, but again I think that that is a red herring
when it comes to assessing the value of such a scheme.<a class="bkMark" name="10111156000194">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
Minister has said that Healthy Start vouchers are a good thing. In some
respects, by saying that he is conceding that giving people extra money
to support their nutritional needs is a good thing and it works. Those
vouchers are paid to pregnant women too. So we could almost say,
“How can you say that Healthy Start vouchers—giving those
particular vouchers to women in pregnancy—are a good thing when
you are also saying that giving pregnant women extra money isn’t
a good thing?”<a class="bkMark" name="10111156000195">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">If the
Minister’s problem with vouchers goes back to this issue of not
having control over what the vouchers are spent on, can he not concede
that at least for the women who are eligible for the Healthy Start
scheme—those are women who are given their £2.80 a week
in vouchers but who will no longer receive the other
£190—it would be a benefit to have that £190 added
to their vouchers?<a class="bkMark" name="10111156000196">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I want to remind the hon. Lady that it is not just
the Minister who spoke highly about the Healthy Start programme;
everyone whom we received evidence from during the evidence sessions
and who had experience of the programme spoke very highly of it. The
programme is not just about vouchers. There is a range of services,
from social services to maternity services to health visitors, that
will offer support to those families at this difficult time, which is
really important. There is benefits checking, and we have talked a lot
about fears of debt. Families will have access to credit union advice.
There is a range of services that enables a series of professionals to
support a family at the time of pregnancy.<a class="bkMark" name="10111156000197">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I agree with the hon. Lady. We are certainly not
suggesting that there is anything wrong with the Healthy Start voucher
scheme, or that it should

			Column number: 296<a class="bkMark" name="Column296">&#160;</a>
                           </div>be taken away. The point that I am making is that if Government Members
think that the Healthy Start scheme is such a good thing, in the impact
that it has on nutrition during pregnancy and during the early years of
a child’s life, how does that square with taking away an
additional £190 that was also going to the beneficiaries of
those vouchers? Moreover, why is it not being considered that that
£190 should be added to the amount given in the vouchers, just
for the people on low incomes? Progress is being made by the Healthy
Start scheme and the additional help that it offers to women, but if
£190 is then taken away from those women and their families, is
there not a risk of undoing all the good that has been done by
introducing the Healthy Start scheme in the first
place?<a class="bkMark" name="10111156000198">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I will just
run through the amendments that we have tabled. Amendment 44 calls for
the health in pregnancy grant to be extended until January 2014 and I
think that we have heard very powerful arguments today that we should
not rush into axing the grant but rather give it further consideration.
We have not heard anything from the Minister to show that the grant is
not working and it is important that we have further consultation and
really give the policy time to bed down.<a class="bkMark" name="10111156000199">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment 46
deals with the issue of the 12th week of pregnancy, as does amendment
48. I accept that the hon. Member for West Worcestershire makes a
point—an arguable point—about the difficulties associated
with that 12th week and I would not want to press those amendments to a
vote,
