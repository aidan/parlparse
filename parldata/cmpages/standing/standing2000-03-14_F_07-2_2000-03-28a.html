</P>
<P>
On resuming-
<P>
<B>Mr. Harry Cohen </B>(Leyton and Wanstead): I have had my cup of tea and am ready to go-[Interruption.] We shall have to wait a bit longer before going, though.
<P>
Mine is amendment No. 72, in the group of amendments moved by the hon. Member for Hallam. He described them as typical Liberal amendments; the Liberal ones were woolly, mine has more depth.

<P>
I differed from the Minister when I listened to him discuss communications data. Communications data are worthy of a higher safeguard than that proposed. It is disappointing that, according to paragraph 154 of the explanatory memorandum, the key safeguard is that content of telecommunications will not be disclosed because it is excluded from the definition of communications data.

<P>
That is all well and good, but the fact that the content of a communication is not involved is not a full safeguard. That overlooks the fact that, when a communication is made, its contents might often be deduced. When I use a telephone banking service and press particular keys to get a bank statement, I am not ordering a pizza-I am declaring a precise relationship with a financial organisation. The content of the communication could be deduced. As the Minister knows, I am identifying where I am to an accuracy of about 100 yards and who I am contacting if I use a mobile phone. There should be positive measures to afford statutory protection because confidential information can be deduced.

<P>
The data protection commissioner, in her ``Briefing for Parliamentarians'', agreed with that assessment. She said in paragraph 8:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Commissioner questions the distinction made in the Bill between the requirements for gaining access to data contained within an intercepted communication and those for gaining access to other communications data such as traffic and billing information. Both sets of data provide insights into the private lives of individuals and should be subject to equivalent controls and safeguards.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Consequently, my amendment would retain all the main national security and policing elements of clause 21(2), but would introduce a test of prejudice to mirror that found in section 29 of the Data Protection Act 1998. The data protection commissioner agrees that such a test would be useful. In relation to other parts of the Bill that provide access to communications data without a warrant, she said in paragraph 24 of her briefing:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Whether or not access can be required should be subject to a prejudice test similar to that set out in S. 29 of the Data Protection Act 1998.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
I do not say that communications data relating to policing and to national security may not be disclosed for that purpose. I would rather argue that such data could be disclosed if failure to disclose would prejudice a purpose. The person authorising the disclosure might be called to demonstrate that, perhaps to the relevant commissioner, in a dispute.
 
<P>
The clause allows a person authorising the collection of communications data to say, ``Here is a crime. I'm authorising access to the communications database.'' I want that person to say ``Here is a crime: failure to access the data will mean that it is likely to prejudice our efforts to catch the criminal.'' My amendment would introduce a minor but much-needed and important semantic change in emphasis.

<P>
I have a worry about the public health and safety provisions in clause 21(2). My reading of the clause is that on public safety grounds the police and MI5 can obtain communications data that relate to members of Greenpeace or any other non-violent political group. Will the Minister assure the Committee that public safety will not become a euphemism that can, in the hands of some authorising officials, permit the authorities to hinder or even stifle legitimate, peaceful and lawful public protest?

<P>
There is a danger that the clause can be used to interfere with lawful protest. I recollect, after all, that Robespierre had a committee for public safety. The amendment deals with public safety and public health issues differently from the clause, by using a test of
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>serious harm to the  health of any individual<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
or the test of prejudice that I have described. For example, if a violent act is being organised, a serious crime is involved. Public safety can therefore be invoked on the grounds of serious harm to health, as individuals get hurt in violent demonstrations. Public health would come into play in respect of communications data relating to an individual suffering from Lassa fever. Such data could be used under the amendment, because failure to provide it would
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>cause serious harm to the physical or mental health of any individual.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
My proposal would, therefore, still cover the contacts of that particular sufferer.

<P>
I admit that I depart from the provisions on assessment and collection of any tax or duty contained in subsection (2). I can see why the evasion of thousands of pounds' worth of beer and spirits duties is important, but I cannot see how £5 national insurance contributions or even £100 TV licence payments are comparable. I have therefore limited my amendment to mainstream VAT or income tax. However, even in this respect I have been generous enough to give to the Minister an order-making power, as does clause 21. Instead of an unqualified power subject to negative resolution, the amendment stipulates that, subject to the negative resolution procedure under clause 68, the order must be justified
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>for reasons of the substantial public interest.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If the Minister can justify the
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>levy or other imposition  or charge payable<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
in terms of a substantial public interest-a phrase that derives from the Data Protection Act-to legitimise the order, he can have his way.

<P>
The clause is too broad and it permits mass surveillance to an unprecedented degree. I have heard the Minister's answers, but I think that he is a little too casual in letting mass surveillance spread because of the Bill. Amendment No. 72 would introduce the correct and, until now, accepted test of prejudice, thereby reducing the risk posed to privacy.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> We have some sympathy with the point made by the hon. Member for Leyton and Wanstead (Mr. Cohen). He suggested that the powers in the clause seem rather broad. Amendment No. 152 would restrict the purposes for which authorisations can be given to purposes that are required for interception warrants-national security, serious crime and economic well-being. To an extent, it is a probing amendment.
 
<P>
Several issues arise under subsection (2), some of which are quite difficult to grasp. The Minister said on a previous occasion that the provisions of paragraph (f), which is about assessing or collecting taxes, duties, levies or other impositions, would not cover council tax arrears-an example that I and my right hon. Friend the Member for Maidstone and The Weald (Miss Widdecombe) suggested. However, paragraph (h) is a catch-all provision and, if the Minister wanted to do so, he could specify council tax arrears as a suitable purpose for the serving of such a notice; the provision states that it could be necessary ``for any purpose''.

<P>
Is not that too broad an approach? That is particularly so because clause 24(1)(f) defines the ``relevant public authority'' as
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>any such public authority not falling within paragraphs (a) to (e)-<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
which includes most of the obvious authorities-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>as may be specified for the purposes of this subsection by an order made by the Secretary of State.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Minister, if he wanted to, could say that a local authority's collection of council tax data could be obtained for that purpose-in fact, for almost any purpose.

<P>
One of the concerns that has been expressed by others, but not by me, is that clause 21(2)(f) suggests that a proper ground for such an invasion of privacy could be to have the purpose of collecting tax. How does that tie in with article 8 of the European convention on human rights? That states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right-<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
that is the right to privacy and family life-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If the Minister thinks that he can include the collection of taxes within those exemptions from the right to privacy, he could do it under the other paragraphs of subsection (2). However, if it cannot be obtained under article 8, it is difficult to see how it could be included in the Bill. It would be ultra vires. Will the Minister say what parameters he will be able to set under subsection (2), given the constraints of article 8 of the convention?

<P>
We believe that the Bill should be simple and coherent. It should, so far as is possible, introduce one regime that people can understand. The same people should apply the same criteria for invasions of privacy; those criteria should be based on article 8; and the documentation should be understandable, and people should be able to verify and authenticate it. That seems to be quite a popular view among those who have made representations to us. Will the Minister explain why that great long list includes such a catch-all provision?

<P>
<B>Mr Charles Clarke:</B> Some interesting points have been made. First, the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire made a general point about coherence. That is a well-made point and we are considering how to deal with it effectively. Serious problems with the whole approach were raised by the hon. Member for Hallam when he talked about tiered approaches and ways of addressing them. It is a difficult question. It is beyond doubt that what we are talking about in communications data is a lower level of intrusion than interception. I understand the argument of my hon. Friend the Member for Leyton and Wanstead that compared, for example, with directed surveillance it could be more serious. However, I do not entirely agree with him. I accept the fundamental point that difficult questions of judgment are raised when considering these different levels of intrusion in an individual's life. Different operating criteria are necessary, which is why we have not created a simple once-off system that will work throughout the whole process.

<P>
I hope that through instituting a code of practice we will achieve a greater clarity. This lack of clarity came out sharply in the discussions on today's amendments because there are different kinds of test that apply in different kinds of circumstances.
<P>
<H5>8:15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
The effect of the amendments is common in that to a greater or lesser degree they all restrict the purposes for which communications data can be sought under the Bill, but in slightly different ways. The Liberal Democrats want to restrict the purposes to serious crime. The Conservative want to restrict them principally to the IOCA purposes, serious crime, national security and the economic well-being of Britain. This suggests that there is no difference as far as the Conservatives are concerned between the kind of intrusion involved in the collection of communications data and the kind of intrusion involved in high-level interception. I do not accept their argument. My hon. Friend the Member for Leyton and Wanstead wants to restrict them so that they are closer to the provisions of the Data Protection Act. The amendments come from different positions in their detail, but from the same perception that there should be a more restricted approach than that set out in the Bill.

<P>
I accept, as I have said before, that any intrusion into privacy should be tightly controlled. That is the intention of the Bill. It is the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Bill. We should also look closely at whether we want to over-regulate and therefore restrict the ability of the police and others to investigate crime. This is a serious issue, as became apparent from our discussion on clause 20 about the nature of communications data. Raising the threshold from prevention or detection of crime to prevention or detection of serious crime would restrict the ability of the police and others.

<P>
I will give some examples. There are many crimes that would not fit the definition in this Bill of serious crime that are nevertheless serious for the victim. Without the ability to use communications data, the ability of the police to investigate would be considerably reduced. I will give some examples of the crimes that we are talking about-crimes that might not result in a three-year term of imprisonment for a first conviction for a person over 18, burglary, malicious telephone calls, race hate crimes and some paedophile crimes. These crimes would not fit the general description of serious crime but, as the hon. Member for Hallam would accept, they are serious for the individuals concerned. If the police were able to collect communications data that might enable them to find the perpetrators of these crimes, it would be an important tool-I assess it no higher than that-in the armoury of weapons at their disposal. This is not an exhaustive list, but these crimes are significant because any investigation of them necessarily focuses on communications data. That is why I have listed them.

<P>
It is also necessary to consider the practicalities of investigation. Information might come in to the police-perhaps to a freephone number-that a person is involved in a particular crime. How does the investigation proceed? The police would check their records for any information, but before putting expensive resources into what might prove to be a fruitless investigation they could check that the information passed to them was accurate. If the information includes a telephone number-as it often does-they will need to check who is registered to that telephone. At that stage, there is no way that the police can be sure that the crime they are investigating fits the serious criteria. That is why the level must be kept at prevention or detection of crime. That addresses the points raised by the Liberal Democrats in this discussion. I appreciate the fact that the hon. Gentleman stated in his speech that he was looking again at the question of tiers following our conversation.

<P>
It will be worth while going through the other purposes for which communications data may be required under the Bill since the remaining amendments all restrict to some degree the ability of the intercepting agencies to access the data.

<P>
It is self-explanatory why communications data may be needed
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>in the interests of national security.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The agencies will try to identify people with whom a suspected terrorist is communicating.

<P>
As with the way in which we distinguish between crime and serious crime, it would be difficult to justify any form of intrusive surveillance at an early stage of an investigation on the basis of safeguarding the economic well-being of the United Kingdom. Accessing communications data on the basis of an ``in the interests of'' criterion allows an intelligence picture to be built up and operational decisions to be made on the deployment of more intrusive resources.

<P>
My hon. Friend called the criterion
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>in the interests of public safety<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the Robespierre clause. I do not see myself as Robespierre but rather as Marat. Technology has progressed since Robespierre's time, although the guillotine was introduced as an efficient device for killing people.

<P>

<B>Mr. Cohen:</B> It is still being used.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> France is very backward in that respect, despite our shared internationalism.

<P>
It is in the interests of public safety to prevent hoax calls being made to the emergency services. The telephone number of a caller is flashed up on the screen, which acts as an excellent deterrent. Although that is part of communications data collection, I reassure my hon. Friend that the definition does not cover the activities of peaceful demonstrators, such as Greenpeace. The Government would not use it in that way and the law would not permit it.

<P>
Investigations that are carried out by the Medicines Control Agency would fit into the category of protecting public health. Communications data may also be required for the purposes of assessing tax, duty, levy or other imposition, or contribution or charge payable to a Department. Excise fraud is the fashionable example, and we are attempting to tackle that serious problem. The category does not include council tax.

<P>
In the case of an emergency, to prevent death or injury or damage to a person's physical or mental health-or to mitigate any injury or damage to a person's physical or mental health-the system needs to be able to locate where a person lives, especially if a young child phones 999 on behalf of an injured parent.

<P>
In light of the comments made by the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire, any other purpose is specifically limited by article 8 of the European convention on human rights, with which the provision is consistent. We considered that matter carefully. It is important to remember that for whatever purpose the communications data is sought, the authorising officer will need to consider necessity and proportionality. That assessment would be open to oversight by the commissioner's office.

<P>
Finally, my hon. Friend the Member for Leyton and Wanstead proposes to replace the test of necessity with a test in which an application may not be made unless the failure to obtain the data would prejudice.
<P>
That does not add to what is provided in the Bill. It has been argued that prejudice is a lower test. For example, the argument that my work to prevent or detect crime would be prejudiced if I do not receive the communications data on an individual could be used in cases where the data is not strictly necessary. Prejudice is an important word. It comes from other legislation, but it does not meet our requirements.

<P>
This has been an illuminating debate, especially in respect of tiering, and it was interesting to hear my hon. Friend's point. We will consider whether we can find a better, more holistic approach in the code of practice, although I am not sure how to achieve that. I acknowledge that the amendments are meant to be constructive rather than destructive, and that they seek greater clarity. We will consider how to be more coherent.

<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I also found the debate interesting and the Minister's tone reassuring. On the code of practice, people must have confidence in using the system, and that will be achieved if they have a clear understanding of the circumstances in which data are collected. It would be helpful if we could be fairly explicit and give useful examples, such as what sort of communications data we will collect if we suspect a certain type of activity, so that people have a clear understanding of how the alleged mischief relates to the activity.

<P>
The point about directed surveillance was also useful. I simply emphasise that, in the context of communications data, the technology allows us to create the equivalent of the old Romanian regime, according to which two Securitate officers were assigned to every citizen-or was it three?-one who could read, one who could write and one to keep an eye on the other two dangerous intellectuals. That would not be possible with the usual directed surveillance because the British police do not have the resources to do that. However, in light of the Minister's comments, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 108, in page 23, line 43, after ``to'', insert ``take reasonable steps to''.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 20, in page 23, line 46, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(4A) Where it appears to the designated person that a postal or telecommunications operator is not or may not be in possession of, but is or may be capable of obtaining any communications data, the designated person shall not give a notice under subsection (4) unless he has obtained a certificate of technical capability from the Technical Approval Board.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
No. 21, in page 23, line 46, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(4B) In this section ``a certificate of technical capability'' means a certificate in writing given by The Technical Approval Board to the effect that the postal or telecommunications operator-<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) is technically capable of obtaining the communications data, or

<P>
(b) could be technically capable of obtaining the communications data if certain steps were taken, and the certificate-

<P>
(i) specifies or describes such steps; and

<P>
(ii) certifies that the taking of such steps would be proportionate to what is sought to be achieved by so obtaining the data.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
Goverment amendment No. 55.

<P>
No. 113, in page 24, line 7, after ``practicable'', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`after an order under subsection (4) is served on him.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
No. 114, in page 24, line 7, leave out from ``requirements'' to end of line 8 and insert ``imposed by the order.''.

<P>
Government amendment No. 56.

<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> The Committee will be pleased to hear that we can dispose of my amendments quickly. Amendments Nos. 113 and 114 relate to the judicial authorisation process, which we have already debated. I hope that the Minister will say that Government amendments Nos. 55 and 56 have the same intention as amendment No. 108. We simply want to ensure that there is a test of reasonableness in cases where the authorities request the operator to provide data.

<P>
The Bill simply says that the operator can be directed to obtain the data. We suggested that a better wording would be ``take reasonable steps to obtain the data'', which would allow the operator a defence in the case of a dispute about whether the data had been delivered effectively. Government amendment No. 56 seems to do the same thing but in a negative way, because it provides that if an individual is under a duty to provide data, he or she shall not be required to do anything that is not reasonably practicable. I hope that that will give the operator some assurance that a test of reasonableness will apply, should the need arise.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> Amendments Nos. 20 and 21 deal with much the same issue as amendment No. 108 and Government amendments Nos. 55 and 56. There has been some concern that the requirements on internet service providers could be substantial, in terms of the technical steps necessary to obtain communications data. Amendment No. 20 provides that there would be no power to serve a notice to obtain data unless a technical capability certificate had been issued by the technical approval board. Amendment No. 21 defines such a certificate by reference not only to technical capability but to the steps that must be taken, and it requires proportionality.

<P>
The amendments are necessary to protect the industry from steps that are technically incompetent or disproportionate, which we have already discussed. The issue has been raised by ISPA, which suggests that it is important to have some external test for the reasonableness of the requirements. It also makes a point that I hope the Minister will be able to answer directly: that the Bill does not make it sufficiently clear whether ISPs will be requested to provide older data at some point in the future, and therefore whether they need to preserve data for an unlimited time. I should be interested to hear the Minister's remarks on our amendments, especially whether he believes that the Government amendments deal adequately with the situation. Government amendment No. 56 accepts, for the first time, that there should be a test of reasonable practicability, not just in terms of timing; Government amendment No. 55 deletes the provision for only the timing to be reasonably practicable. Government amendment No. 56 helpfully provides that if it can be shown that it is not reasonably practicable to provide or obtain the information, that is then not required.
<P>
 
<P>
<H5>8.30 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
A point that has been made to us is that a request should not be made in circumstances where a disproportionate effort-that was the expression used-is needed, because that would place an unfair and unrealistic burden on business. I hope that the Minister will reply positively and deal with those concerns.

<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> We agree with the intention behind both amendments. They-and the industry-make the reasonable and fundamental point that holders of communications data should not be expected to do things of which they are not capable. I am aware of the significant assistance given to law enforcement by communication service providers on a voluntary basis, most of which goes unrecognised and it would be bad practice, as well as completely counterproductive, to ask them to do things of which they are not capable. We have received representations from industry, asking for clarification. We have listened to the representations and believe they are sensible, which is why I have introduced Government amendments Nos. 55 and 56 to meet the concerns. As the hon. Member for Hallam acknowledged, our amendments satisfy the intention behind amendment No. 108.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 20 and 21 would require all requirements for data that are not already in existence to first be approved by a technical approval board. It is important to explain that the effect of the framework that this chapter of the Bill establishes is to formalise in law the arrangements that have been in place for many years, and which have been developed through the ACPO telecommunications group, which is a well-established joint law enforcement and communication service provider body. There are already in place service level agreements, contact points, designs of forms and so on, including agreements between parties about what data are capable of being provided and levels of sensitivity attached to particular techniques. Another level of technical oversight would not assist; formalising the existing relationship is a good way of proceeding.

<P>
On the hon. Gentleman's reasonable point about older data, which the Internet Service Providers Association raised with him and all members of the Committee, the Bill does not require communication service providers to retain data. They are obliged to supply them only if they keep them and in response to an order. So there is no requirement to keep older data.

<P>

<B>Mr. Heald:</B> There are all sorts of purposes in subsection (2) that do not involve the police or Customs and Excise-protecting public health and safety, for example. Is the Minister saying that that will be addressed in the code of practice and that groups who may ask for communications data will set up similarly sensible arrangements for verification?

<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> The short answer is yes. A good relationship-which is continually evolving and is of benefit to all concerned-has been established between ACPO and the telecommunications providers. As the hon. Gentleman said, the regime is extended to other agencies under subsection (2) and similar regimes should be established. The model offered by the ACPO telecommunications regime is generally good. However, I acknowledge the hon. Gentleman's point, and in answer to his question, we intend to work on that basis. I have tried to explain the motivation behind the clause, and I hope that the clarifications that I have given will help other hon. Members.

<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> Given the Minister's comments, we shall not press the amendment. However, we support the amendment and Government amendments Nos. 55 and 56. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 111, in page 24, line 2, leave out from ``he'' to second ``the'' in line 3 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`is satisfied that-<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) other means of obtaining the information which the communications data would reveal have been attempted without success or are likely to prove unsuccessful if attempted, and

<P>
(b) '.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
This is an important amendment that is designed to allow us to examine the conditions under which communications data will be requested. The Minister said several times that the conduct must be proportionate, and subsection (5) specifies that the authorised conduct must be
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>proportionate to what is sought to be achieved.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The amendment would add the further qualification that the authority must show that it has used other means, by which we mean other lawful means. The circumstances that we have in mind include the police picking up a burglar. We have already established that the clause would apply to such a person. Let us suppose that the person had in his pocket a telephone book or a mobile phone with stored numbers. If the police are looking for the person's accomplices or fence, for example, they should use those means before requesting communications data, because requesting such data and asking for a record of everyone that the person telephones is far more intrusive. The person involved may be a legitimate suspect, and the police may require such data, but if other means such as a telephone book are available and old-fashioned sleuthing methods could be used under existing powers to discover the telephone number of a suspected contact so that the matter could be pursued, such an approach seems more sensible. If, however, the police have used all other means available and have no way of picking up contacts, a provision to require telephone records or similar data should be available.

<P>
The amendment would include that additional test in the Bill to specify that the provision should not be used lightly and that it should be used when other means have proved inadequate, rather than as a first port of call, to avoid the temptation not to use other methods that are already available or would be otherwise permissible under other legislation that allows police officers and other law enforcement officers to collect records in a normal, regulated way.

<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> The amendment would introduce a different test of proportionality. We believe that proportionality is a good test. The amendment relates to our earlier discussion about the relative intrusiveness of examining telephone records, for example, compared with using a surveillance team, and informant and an undercover officer.

<P>
The hon. Member for Hallam used the phrase ``old-fashioned sleuthing'', which is famous among Liberal Democrats in Sheffield as a phrase to describe policing in Sheffield. However, examining someone's telephone records or communications data generally is a less intrusive way of looking for the data required than ``old-fashioned sleuthing'' using surveillance teams, informants and undercover officers. Such techniques are serious intrusions.

<P>
Unless I have misunderstood the amendment, use of communications data could not be authorised unless those other techniques had already been explored or dismissed as a means of obtaining the same information. I would take a different view that in looking for information the police should consider the techniques available to them, which should be reasonable, proportionate and necessary, as we discussed. The amendment would specify that a particular form-in this case, the use of communications data such as telephone records-is necessarily a more intrusive surveillance method than some of the other techniques that might otherwise be used for the same end. I doubt whether that would be a beneficial development for individual privacy or police effectiveness.

<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> The intention of the amendment is that other less intrusive means should have been exhausted. I accept the Minister's point that some other means may be more intrusive and that is perhaps an error in the wording. I gave the example of picking someone up who has other information on him, so one does not need to go after additional information.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> Clearly the drafting is deficient and we should simply dismiss the idea on those grounds without giving it any consideration. Joking aside, I understand what the hon. Gentleman is saying, but one immediately hits the problem of the definition of the hierarchy of intrusiveness. Even if he altered his amendment so that it specified less intrusive methods, it would raise as many questions as it answers. I appreciate the spirit in which he proposed the amendment, but I hope that after consideration he will withdraw it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> This is one of those useful debates that produces more questions than answers. I shall go away and ponder the points that the Minister has raised about degrees of intrusiveness. I beg to seek leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
Question proposed,  That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Cohen:</B> Let me take the opportunity to return to a matter that I raised on Second Reading. It concerns the change from the voluntary arrangement that exists under the Data Protection Act 1985 and the Interception of Communications Act 1985 for telephone and postal operators to a compulsory one. The provisions in this clause are different from those that they replace in schedule 2 to the Interception of Communications Act 1985. The latter provision made it an offence for telecommunications or postal operators to disclose communications data, but not if the disclosure was to the police for crime prevention.

<P>
I note that the Secretary of State justified the change on the grounds that the voluntary arrangement had failed. He said that it
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>has led to unacceptably high demands on the public telecommunications operators.-[Official Report, 6 March 2000; Vol. 345, c. 773.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The voluntary arrangements under the Data Protection Act and the Interception of Communications Act relate only to matters covered by clause 21(2)(a) to (c) and parts of (f). In other words, the Home Secretary claims that the old arrangements led to unacceptable high demands, yet he has introduced new purposes in paragraphs (e) to (h) which increase that unacceptable demand. Some enlightenment as to the Government's logic would be helpful.

<P>
I said on Second Reading that the Government had not presented any evidence of the current voluntary arrangements under the Data Protection Act and the Interception of Communications Act that showed that compulsion is necessary. I ask the Minister the same question that I asked on Second Reading: have some telecommunications operators not co-operated with the police, Customs and Excise, the Inland Revenue and other authorities if asked? Could the Minister provide the evidence that the current voluntary arrangements have failed and that compulsion is needed? Can he name one telecommunications company that has refused to co-operate with these bodies. Is it BT, Vodaphone, or Orange? I await the Minister's reply.

<P>
<H5>8.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> There is one profound point here. The change from the voluntary arrangement introduces tests of necessity and proportionality that we have talked about in the context of the Bill. They reflect the fact that the Bill, unlike the previous arrangements, seeks to place the activities that have been taking place on a basis that is compatible with the ECHR and the Human Rights Act 1998. It is the same motivation that lead the extension of the activities that he has just cited under clause 21(2). There is doubt about what has really been happening. I described it as a murky area at one press conference.

<P>
A great virtue of the Government's decision to incorporate the European convention of human rights in British law is that such matters will be clarified, especially as the tests of necessity and proportionality did not exist previously. Those tests are part of all the work that has been done in a wide variety of ways. There are other advantages: the liability for such matters will be removed from the telecommunications operators and placed on the agencies and the coherent regime will include an oversight from the commissioner that has not existed previously.

<P>
I understand why my hon. Friend thinks that the current regime should be supported. I assure him that the proposals are not the result of any particular telecommunications operator, either those that he mentioned or any other, having a theatrical moment and saying that it could not work in that regime. We have introduced the proposals not because the voluntary arrangements might not work but because it is necessary to create a basis that reflects the fact that the European convention is now part of the British legal system, so the tests must be included. Therefore, I urge the committee to support the clause.

<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<P>
No. 76, in page 24, line 32, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(ca) must include a statement that the disclosure of communications data to the relevant public authority is considered to be proportionate to the matter specified in paragraph (c);'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Cohen:</B> I shall be brief. Under amendments Nos. 73 and 74, the authorising officer would have to specify the particular matter or matters when authorising requests for communications data and not make general statements that only loosely describe the matters involved. That is not a major issue, but the amendment represents a better test.

<P>
Under amendment No. 76, the authorising officer would have to describe why the disclosure of communications data to the relevant public authority would be proportionate. The scope of clause 21(2) is wide, so it is essential that the authorising officer commits to a formal document the reasons why the request is proportionate to the investigation. That is important, especially given the emphasis that the Minister has placed on the proportionality criterion. For example, does the collection of tax provision relate to £5 or £5 millin? Similarly, a crime could be anything from minor theft to mass murder.

<P>
Given that the authorising officer must have regard to the European convention on human rights, especially article 8 on proportionality, under clauses 21(5) and 22(8), it would be a useful discipline for that officer to document and fully describe why the interference in the private life of a citizen is justified. That information would also be useful to the commissioner in investigating complaints, as it would show that privacy matters had been considered. The amendment would reassure the public.

<P>
Under amendment No. 75, the telecommunications or postal operator would be reassured that the proportionality tests had been applied. I recognise that an initiative could be jeopardised if the complete description provided by the authorising officer were given to the operator, hence my suggestion that the authorising officer should be required to provide a statement of proportionality.

<P>
I should like the Minister's assurance that officials will not use the clause for fishing expeditions. In the previous Parliament, I served on the Committee that considered the Social Security Administration (Fraud) Act 1997. I think that the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire led for the then Government on that Committee. I tabled many amendments that would have ensured that the admirable attempts to minimise benefit fraud would not mean open season to trample on the privacy of thousands of innocent people. Within a year of that Act coming into operation, the Data Protection Registrar issued a press release that stated that several local authorities demanded the wholesale disclosure of staff payroll information from local employers in the mistaken belief that the Social Security Administration (Fraud) Act 1997 gave them an automatic right to that information. The registrar's interpretation of the law is that, on a case-by-case basis, it allows for local authority inspectors to conduct investigations when they believe that someone has been attempting to commit benefit fraud.

<P>
However, in the registrar's words, the law does not give anyone the right to undertake fishing expeditions. I do not want such expeditions to be allowed under the guise of the clause, so I shall be interested to hear the Minister's response.

<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> I am delighted that the hon. Member for Mid-Worcestershire has returned to cast his benevolent eye over his flock in Committee and ensure that they all sing with one voice on the key issues that we shall address.

<P>
I am delighted to give my hon. Friend the Member for Leyton and Wanstead the assurance that he seeks. Under the Bill, there is no possibility of the fishing expeditions that he described taking place. As he said, his amendments are relatively minor. For technical reasons, amendment No. 73 would have no effect. The Bill requires that authorisations and notices specify matters falling with clause 21(2), which deals with grounds for application. The amendments would clarify that to include a particular matter or matters. Under clause 22, matters must be specified: a general approach will not suffice.

<P>
Section 6 of the Interpretation Act 1978 states that, unless the contrary intention appears, the singular includes the plural and the plural includes the singular. There is no contrary intention in the Bill, so the amendment would have no effect. My hon. Friend's parliamentary experience is much greater than mine, so I am sure that he will understand what I have just said better than I do.

<P>
The amendments would also require that the authorising officer should describe why the disclosure of the communications data is considered appropriate. The Bill does not specifically require the authorising officer to put on paper why he considers the requirement proportionate, but it does require him to consider it. His consideration may be overseen by the commissioner, so he will have to justify his decision at a later stage.

<P>
The code of practice established in clause 62 will describe the practical arrangements that must be made when serving notices and the records that should be kept for later inspection. That will include a justification of proportionality. I hope that that assurance satisfies my hon. Friend that the code of practice and the Bill meet the objectives of his amendments and that, on that basis, he will consider withdrawing the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Cohen:</B> I am grateful for the Minister's constructive reply, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 158, in page 24, line 23, leave out from ``(a),'' to end of line 24 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`shall take such form and be granted in such manner as the Secretary of State shall by regulations prescribe'.<P>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 159, in page 24, line 36, leave out from ``(a),'' to end of line 37 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`shall take such form and be granted in such manner as the Secretary of State shall by regulations prescribe'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> These amendments deal with the form of notices and authorisations under clause 22. At the moment, the provision states that, provided they are in writing or in a manner that can produce a record of grant, they may take such form and be granted in such manner as the person making the grant thinks fit. In other words, any form is acceptable. Under the Bill, different authorities could have different forms, making verification and security matters difficult for those in the industry.

<P>
That is a familiar theme and one that I have developed throughout our deliberations.

<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> Powerfully developed.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> I am pleased to hear that. We need documents that are easily recognisable and verifiable, perhaps containing a little security information, so that they can be checked. The Minister has partly answered the point already, but I should be interested to hear what he says.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I am entirely with the spirit of the hon. Gentleman's amendments. I think that his point is right. My only slight cavil is about the process. We intend the code of practice to address that, so we believe that the best way to develop the appropriate form is through consultation with the industry, which we have discussed. We believe that the form would be more operable if it were properly defined in consultation with the industry.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> Can the Minister give us an idea when a reasonable form of the draft code will be available for inspection?

<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> We intend to start consultation early in the summer, so a draft code will be available for inspection relatively soon.

<P>
As I have said, we intend to carry into the code of practice the work that the ACPO telecommunications group has already done, in consultation with the industry, and I am keen to build on that rather than to invent a new scheme. I place it on the record that I accept the intent of the hon. Gentleman's amendments.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 123, in page 24, line 35, after ``made;'', insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) must be served on the postal or telecommunications operator in question by (or through arrangements made by) the designated person as soon as practicable after it has been made;'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The amendment is intended to be helpful in two respects, in relation to a warrant that has been issued requiring a company to disclose the data: in other words, the work is being done under clause 21(4) by the telecoms provider.

<P>
First, when a notice has been sought, clearly it is helpful for the business to get it immediately, so that it has time to obtain the data and the notice is not delivered at the last minute. It is helpful to have that information in the Bill. Secondly, it would be helpful if the authorities were given the clear instruction that they must operate the notices under those terms. The Minister has said that the telecoms providers and others will not be required to keep historical data. Clearly the more quickly the notice is served, the greater the chance that businesses will obtain the data that they are seeking. If time has elapsed, the telecoms provider may, quite properly, have deleted that section of data.

<P>
Through the amendment we seek an assurance that no last-minute measures will be taken and that the notices will be described in detail and executed swiftly and effectively for the business side and the public authority side.

<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> I can give the hon. Gentleman the assurance that he seeks for the reason that he seeks it. It is in nobody's interests to have delays in the system. My answer is similar to the one that I gave the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire in regard to amendments Nos. 158 and 159. We believe that the precise specification of the notice is best left to discussion with the industry about the code of practice, and that was our intention. I am happy to look at the precise form within the code of practice and to consult the industry fully. With that assurance, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> It would be churlish of me not to do so, having had that response from the Minister. Therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<H5>9 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> Clause 23 requires the Minister to make arrangements to give appropriate funds to those asked to deal with notices under clause 21(4). We shall be interested to learn what criteria the Minister intends to use and how much money is available. Is there any good news in the Budget for those who have to comply with these notices? Is there anything else that he can tell us about the arrangements for payment?

<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I am interested in exploring the curious discrepancy between the wording of clause 23 and that of clause 13. Clause 23 seems to be much more in tune with what the Liberal Democrats were trying to achieve with earlier amendments to clause 13. It sets out the arrangmenets in two separate parts. The first part establishes a mandatory duty on the Secretary of State to establish the scheme; the second part gives him some discretion over the payments, stating that he
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>may make arrangements for payments to be made out of money provided by Parliament.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Clause 13 seemed to roll those two provisions together. It is interesting that the two clauses are designed to do the same thing: one will reimburse telecomes operators for implementing interception warrants, the other will reimburse them for work undertaken in responding to requests for communications data.

<P>
The Minister suggested in an earlier debate that he wanted to give assurances to industry. Is he prepared to take the wording of clause 23 as a model for the common understanding, in which business can have confidence, that the Secretary of State is committed to establishing a scheme for payment? For reasons that the Minister gave earlier, we still use the word ``may'' in the second part of the clause, which will be kept separate. However, there will be a mandatory duty on the Secretary of State to make the arrangements in the first place. Will the Minister comment on the good wording in clause 23? I am not encouraging him to change it so that it would be worded like the earlier clause-quite the opposite.-[
Interruption.]

<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> My hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellors' Department, suggested that the hon. Gentleman was pushing it a bit, having already won so many fantastic concessions in Committee.

<P>
The hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire raised questions about the criteria to be applied, and the amount of money available. We have addressed those questions fully in the previous debate. We said that the issues relating to criteria and money were matters that we wanted to discuss through the consultancy report. The whole panoply of the consultation mechanism will be involved in that. We are not proposing to incorporate a set of clear criteria in the Bill; we are proposing the consultation process that we have already described. That process will also extend to arrangements for payment. The agencies already pay for communications data on a scale agreed with the public telecommunications operators. The clause will allow that to continue.

<P>
The reason for the differences between clauses 13 and 23 is that the balance of costs is different for the internet intercept capability; the costs are of a different order. However, I have already agreed to look at clause 13 following the debate, and I confirm that I shall do so. On that basis, I hope that the Committee will agree that clause 23 should stand part of the Bill.

Question put and agreed to.
