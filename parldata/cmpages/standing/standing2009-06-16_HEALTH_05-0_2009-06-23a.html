<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062386000395"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> Good morning, Mr. Key. Somewhat to our
surprise, but great pleasure, we find ourselves serving under your
chairmanship. Thank you for stepping into the breach to ensure that we
have a continuing, uninterrupted consideration of the Bill. We look
forward to making good progress.</div>
<a name="09062386000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 16
aims to protect individuals from the unwarranted removal of money from
them by the Secretary of State. We have seen how the Government are not
beneath top-slicing PCTs to bring them into line, both financially and
politically, to generate a central war chest. I am concerned that this
provision could be used to do the same to those with direct payments,
and I hope that the Minister will reassure us on that.</div>
<a name="09062386000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 190
comes in the light of the Government&#146;s tax credit and other
fiascos. Will the Minister confirm that if overpayments are
accidentally made, the Government  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column152" />Column number: 152</div>will bear responsibility and not the individual, and, above all, that
the individual will not be at risk of the cost for such error,
inadvertency, incompetence or plain
negligence?</div><a name="09062386000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
191 questions what plans the Government have for surpluses in the
direct payment. Will the patient be able to transfer some of it for
personal use? That might reward and incentivise the efficient use of
resources. Would it roll over to the next year, or would it be clawed
back by the PCT or the Department? If so, how would efficiency be
incentivised? The Minister half covered that, somewhat affirmatively,
in the reply he gave last week. So I look forward to his confirming and
amplifying that.</div>
<a name="09062386000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
concerned by paragraph 136 in the explanatory notes, which states that
new section 12B(2)(h) means that the Secretary of State</div>
<a name="09062386000343"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;may or must
require all or part of direct payments to be repaid, for example, when
a significant surplus has
accumulated.&#148;</div><a name="09062386000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">No
cause is given for that, just the fact of accumulation. What does the
Minister classify as significant? Surely the circumstances in which the
surplus accumulated should be taken into account. The reverse is, of
course, when there is not enough money in the tin; in the other place,
Baroness Masham pointed out that it had happened to her in social care.
I hope the Minister bears that in mind when he
responds.</div>
<a name="09062386000037"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062386000396"></a>The
Minister of State, Department of Health (Mr. Mike
O'Brien):</b> May I welcome you to your post, Mr.
Key? It is a great pleasure to serve under your chairmanship and I hope
that we make speedy progress under your tutelage.</div>
<a name="09062386000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 16
provides for creating an appeals process where money given in direct
payment needs to be reclaimed by the NHS, such as in the event of fraud
or abuse. I support the principle that if money given through a direct
payment is to be reclaimed, then the process for doing so should be
fair and transparent, and the individual should&#151;and
does&#151;have the right to redress. That right is clearly set out in
the NHS constitution. Any complaint about NHS services should be dealt
with efficiently and investigated properly. The NHS complaints
procedure has recently been reformed to make it more efficient and
robust.</div>
<a name="09062386000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">A complaints
procedure would apply to any decision to reclaim a direct payment.
Moreover, if not satisfied by that procedure, a patient may ask the
health service ombudsman to look into the case. Clause 12 expands the
role of the ombudsman to cover services delivered through direct
payments precisely to ensure that people are suitably protected. It is
worth reiterating that PCTs providing direct payments are still
providing NHS services, and patients are still covered by all
safeguards protecting them and their dealings with PCTs.</div>
<a name="09062386000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 190
would exclude repayment of a direct payment where the Secretary of
State has made an overpayment. We think that if a certain amount of
money has been applied, it is for achievement of a particular purpose.
If that purpose is achieved, a review will need to be taken into the
surplus. This case is different from care cases in that an amount of
money has been agreed for a person with a prolonged illness or
condition and they would be expected to use that money to manage their
condition. If they are able to do that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column153" />Column number: 153</div>more efficiently, effectively and cheaply than the PCT, that is
fine&#151;the money should be deployed in maintaining and improving
that condition. Provided it is for that purpose, it should be possible
to negotiate and agree to it. However, it may be that the amount of
funding initially agreed is in excess of that required and a mistake
has been made, and it is right that a review should take place at that
stage and that a determination should be made about whether the
appropriate figure was or was not calculated at the beginning. We want
to ensure that those who use their funding efficiently are able to
retain it for a similar purpose within the context of their care and
budget. We do not want a situation where, should there be a
miscalculation or an issue arises that should not have arisen, somebody
ends up not deploying money for their
care.</div><a name="09062386000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is broad agreement that that is the outcome that we want. With regard
to the Secretary of State recovering money to build up a war chest, we
are not talking about amounts that would make a big difference to the
national health budget one way or the other. Initially we are looking
at 70 or so projects, which would assess whether the process of direct
payments can be refined and expanded or whether we want to change it in
some other way. Building up a war chest is unlikely and I assure the
hon. Gentleman that the Government would not contemplate that. Frankly,
it would be pointless given the sums
involved.</div><a name="09062386000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">Regular
monitoring will ensure that any surpluses or shortfalls in budget are
identified quickly. It is important that we not only deal with
surpluses but also budgets that are underfunded, where the money is
insufficient to remedy that; it needs to work both ways. That
is the objective and I hope with those assurances that
amendments 16 can be withdrawn by the
Opposition.</div><a name="09062386000043"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062386000397"></a>Mr.
Stephen O'Brien:</b> I have listened to the assurances and I
am glad to say that my concerns are somewhat assuaged. I still have a
concern about the building up of a war chest, which the Minister sought
to dismiss. Clearly, while we are in the pilot stage, what he says in
terms of the sums of money must be right, but if the pilot is to mean
anything&#151;we are about to come on to this&#151;when it is
rolled out throughout the country, the cumulative amounts of money will
be potentially significant. We need to get the principle and the ideas
right now; that is the purpose of this
scrutiny.</div><a name="09062386000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
there is a surplus that can be applied effectively in support of the
purpose for which it is given, it is in effect one of the
motivators to efficient procurement and the necessary contestability
for getting higher quality services. I think that we are at one on
that. My remaining concern, which might need to explore on Report, is
how one defines purpose, given that at the moment the word
&#147;significant&#148; is used. As part of his answer, the
Minister sought to distinguish &#147;purpose&#148; from
&#147;miscalculation&#148;. In practice this could be important
because there will be residual worry for people in receipt of payments
that they could suddenly be clawed back. People make their dispositions
on the understanding that they have the amounts that they have been
granted.</div><a name="09062386000045"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062386000398"></a>Mr.
Mike O'Brien:</b> Just to reassure the hon. Gentleman, it is
not our intention to claw back funding where people have made
dispositions and, as a result, created a surplus through efficiency.
This is provided that the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column154" />Column number: 154</div>surplus is to be deployed for the purpose of the health budget. If, for
example, the person&#146;s condition had ceased, that might be a
factor that would need to be reviewed. The aim is not to claw back
moneys that, because of efficiency, had arisen as a
surplus.</div>
<a name="09062386000046"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062386000399"></a>Mr.
Stephen O'Brien:</b> That added assurance is helpful, and I
beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div>

<a name="09062386000048"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062386000400"></a>Mr.
Stephen O'Brien:</b> I beg to move amendment 192, in
clause 11, page 8, line 29, at
end insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(4A) The
maximum period permissible in regulations made under subsection (3) is
three
years.&#146;.</div><a name="09062386000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
deals with limiting pilot length. New section 12C subsection
(3)
reads:</div><a name="09062386000344"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
pilot scheme must, in accordance with the regulations, specify the
period for which it has effect, subject to the extension of that period
by the Secretary of State in accordance with the
regulations.&#148;</div>
<a name="09062386000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is a far-reaching
power that would enable the Secretary of State to prolong the pilot,
even indefinitely, if he wanted to. The noble Lord Darzi in the other
place said:</div>
<a name="09062386000345"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
intend the personal health budgets pilot programme to run for at least
three years, with direct payments being used for at least two
years.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of Lords, </i>2 March
2009; Vol. 708, c.
GC251.]</div><a name="09062386000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
was in response to a reverse point by Baroness Barker about the
individual budget pilots. In some places the Government organised
those&#151;we would argue&#151;so badly that people had been using
them for only a few weeks or months before they came to be assessed.
This was admitted by researchers in the IBSEN report. If Lord Darzi is
content that three years is the time taken to run a pilot, it seems
sensible that it should be on the face of the Bill at least as a
benchmark expectation, if nothing else.</div>
<a name="09062386000052"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062386000401"></a>Mr.
Mike O'Brien:</b> The hon. Gentleman is right, but my noble
Friend Lord Darzi had suggested in the other place that it is our
intention to pilot health care payments. The maximum limit will be a
period of three years. Most projects with direct payments will take
around two. The system will take some time to set up, so we will have a
set-up time, the running time and then an evaluation period. The aim is
that we should be able to have a three-year block area where about 70
projects can be properly evaluated. They will have slightly different
start-up and finish times.</div>
<a name="09062386000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">The drafted
provisions require the period for which a pilot would run to be defined
and we expect most sites to be authorised within two or three years.
However, it may be the case that a site takes longer to report than
anticipated, either due to local circumstances or an unforeseen
complication. We would therefore need flexibility to extend the period
of the pilot to more than three years if necessary, in order properly
to evaluate that site. The Bill allows for this but the amendment would
prevent that from happening, so I hope the hon. Gentleman will feel
able to withdraw it.</div>
<a name="09062386000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">Essentially,
in terms of getting this done, we need to have a block of time where we
can set it up, ask for the various bids to be examined and allocate the
funding. Then, we can start to run the projects, provide the level 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column155" />Column number: 155</div>of support that they need, get to the end, evaluate it and have an
outturn date which is within approximately three years of the start of
the pilot schemes. That is why there is a difference in terms of two to
three years.</div>

Stephen O'Brien:</b> I will not press this to a Division. This
exchange is on record, so those who are concerned about understanding
the way forward have a clear idea that the maximum limit is expected to
be three years, with most taking two. The Minister will be aware that
our concern arises because of the Government&#146;s track record in
relation to pilots. We have often had pilots without the
follow-through, so we now want to ensure that there is a clear
programme that is expected not only to evaluate them well, perhaps with
this reserve power that if one or two stray over the time they can have
their evidence captured for the general application, but above all to
make sure that there is an expectation of roll-out. On that basis, I

Mr. Key. Amendments 171 and 172 aim to ensure that any
pilots of direct payments are completed and would be reviewed, not only
by an independent person, but also by patients, staff and voluntary and
representative bodies. The number of amendments that have been tabled
around review reflects a concern that, very often, pilots are not
properly evaluated before they are implemented in the NHS. With
regard to amendment 132, about which I shall talk briefly,
it is right to consider the impact on health inequality, but all the
evidence shows that most public health projects are poorly evaluated
and there is little evidence about what works and what does not,
although there are lots of well meaning projects out there. This is an
attempt to focus attention on the review methodologies
beforehand&#151;we need to have in place, at the outset, some idea of
what impacts we are looking for from direct

recipients, should really not be rushed. A number of concerns have
previously been raised about that. Direct payments for social care have
been in place for some time, but there are many differences between
health and social care, which were highlighted in a previous
sitting.</div>
<a name="09062386000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would be
useful to hear from the Government that there will be proper evaluation
before a final recommendation is made to Parliament. The reason for
including voluntary organisations and staff organisations is that there
may be significant unforeseen impacts on NHS staff. It is always useful
to consult with user groups&#151;I hate the term &#147;service
user&#148;, but it seems to be the current jargon&#151;because they
will be aware of the real-life implications that affect people on the
ground, which are not always picked up using formal methodologies.
These amendments are an attempt to seek the Minister&#146;s
reassurance that all these factors will be taken into
account.</div><a name="09062386000065"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062386000406"></a>Mr.
Stephen O'Brien:</b> I am happy to support
amendment 172, which relates to points that we have made
before on LINks, and the hon. Lady includes staff groups and so forth.
On amendment 171, we clearly have to get the balance right between
making sure that the evidence base is there and that we are not unduly
complicating things. I hope the Minister will give us an assurance that
the pilot schemes will have a significant period to run before they are
reviewed, because of the example we have had. To some degree, it is the
mirror image of what we discussed on the last
point.</div><a name="09062386000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
amendment 132 concerns the Government&#146;s figures on health
inequalities. The reason I am very anxious to include the effect that
direct payments have on health inequalities is partly because I think
it is common sense that they will have a major effect and it would be
something of a dereliction of duty if that were not properly taken into
account and measured. We are conscious, as we consider the Bill, that
the inequality gap in infant mortality rates has not reduced
sufficiently to meet the Government&#146;s target. The inequality
gaps in male and female life expectancy at birth have both increased
since the baseline, by 2 per cent. for men and 5 per cent. for
women. If trends continue, the Government&#146;s targets will also
not be met. The relative gap between the routine and manual groups in
the population has widened over recent years since the target baseline,
and the number of sexually transmitted infections has doubled over
recent years. Because of this inability to address the inequality and
poverty that have affected areas even beyond health
policy&#151;health is a key weather vane in respect of
inequalities&#151;a proper measure of effectiveness of direct
payments will be the impact that they make on this poor
record.</div>
<a name="09062386000067"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09062386000407"></a><b class="B">Mr.
John Horam</b> (Orpington) (Con): Further to the point made by
my hon. Friend the Member for Eddisbury on health inequalities, the
Minister will be aware that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column157" />Column number: 157</div>there are considerable differences. Even in an affluent borough such as
Bromley, there are areas where health is much worse than the average
for the country, never mind for Bromley. This may reflect my ignorance,
but what is the size of this pilot project? Does it cover the whole
Primary Care Trust or is it a much smaller area? Is it a group of
patients attached to one general practitioner? What size is it? This is
important. Will the number of pilots reflect the health inequalities
throughout the country. Clearly, we need to take bad areas and good
areas and average areas in order to get some sort of feel about how
direct payments will work.</div>
<a name="09062386000068"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062386000408"></a>Mr.
Mike O'Brien:</b> It is our intention that we should properly
evaluate all these trials. These pilots are enormously important for
assessing the impact of direct payments and it is right that we should
have a full and comprehensive evaluation of them. The Liberal
Democrats&#146; amendment would mean that we could not move forward
with direct payments until all of the pilots had been completed. Some
of the pilots may be delayed for all sorts of reasons. They may go
beyond three years. They may have to carry on because of the health
condition of individuals. Therefore we want some flexibility in the way
in which we deliver the evaluation. We also need to make sure, however,
that this evaluation is comprehensive. This is why we have a spread of
70 projects across a range of types of income, area and condition, so
that we can have a proper assessment of where these projects would
bring benefits from direct payments and where they would not. The hon.
Member for Romsey is right to say that we need fully to evaluate this
and that therefore we cannot try to rush through the evaluation. The
evaluation, however, will be going on alongside the pilot. We do not
necessarily always have to wait until the end before much of the work
on evaluation takes place. One of the things we have to evaluate is how
we get applications in. How well is it done? Who gets them? This can be
done early on therefore and it can be evaluated well within the initial
year. Therefore, we have a process of evaluation that evaluates the
different stages of the pilot and identifies what works and what does
not work. The main evaluation, however, will have to wait until the end
so that we can look at the impact it has had on individuals.</div>
<a name="09062386000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">We want to
ensure that we involve all the key stakeholders&#151;the patients,
the staff, the voluntary organisations, the representative
bodies&#151;in looking at how direct payments work. It will be
important in evaluating the impact of direct payments on particular
conditions how not only individuals react to the handling of funding
for direct payments but also how the various patient groups see the
implications of direct payments on that condition. We may end up with
an outcome that says that for particular conditions direct payments are
beneficial, while for other conditions they are not. That is probably
where we will end up, but let us see where it goes. We need to have a
broad spread of the various types of direct payment pilots. We then
need to have a full and proper evaluation of them. We need to involve
the various patient groups, and that is our intention&#151;it is not
necessary to spell it out in the Bill. This would not be an effective
evaluation of an important step for the NHS unless we involved the
patient groups. In our policy statement &#147;Personal Health
Budgets: First Steps&#148; we have specified that one of the
principles of personal health budgets is to tackle inequalities and
protect 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column158" />Column number: 158</div>equality. Our advertisement for the evaluation, which was published in
April, specifically asked research teams, who are now being recruited
to conduct those evaluations, to consider how the impact of personal
health budgets differs between patient groups, looking not only at
health conditions but also socio-economic groups and patient
characteristics such as ethnicity. The advertisement also asked teams
bidding for the evaluation to consider how easily individuals from
different groups can access personal health budgets and the support
that they would need to do so. We are in the process of selecting the
evaluation teams to do that. They will be responsible for ensuring that
the views of all relevant stakeholders are considered in the evaluation
process and that the impact of direct payments on health inequalities
is comprehensively
reviewed.</div><a name="09062386000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
summary, we want a broad spread in the size and nature of the different
pilots. We want to ensure that we are looking at the different
characteristics of both income and condition and that we have a spread,
where we are able to get that, of particular
conditions.</div><a name="09062386000071"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062386000409"></a>Mr.
Horam:</b> How many people will be involved in one particular
pilot? What is the normal number that you would
expect?</div><a name="09062386000072"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062386000410"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> The broad concern would be to target direct
payments at individuals who have a particular medical condition to see
if they can manage the budget in a way that best delivers for them. We
are also looking at small groups of people who want to work together to
evaluate their budgets to see how that would operate. We want to look
at a spread of different types of project to see what works. I suspect
that we will find that certain things work and others do not. Unless we
have a wide enough spread, geographically and otherwise, we will not be
able to carry out that evaluation at the end of the three-year
period.</div><a name="09062386000073"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09062386000411"></a><b class="B">Dr.
John Pugh</b> (Southport) (LD): What would constitute a good
result of a review of a pilot? A valid point could be made that the
socio-economic groups exploit private payments in different ways, some
to greater benefit and others lesser, and, as has been suggested, that
may accentuate health inequities. If there is an improvement in how NHS
resources are used, if there is a wholesale uplift in health care and
the efficiency in which provision by the state affects health outcomes,
the Government could reconcile themselves to that&#151;presumably in
the same way that people sometimes argue for tax arrangements that may
not produce more equity but produce greater productivity and benefits
for the state as a whole. What is a bad outcome for a review? A degree
of inequity could be introduced by the wholesale introduction of direct
payments alongside a wholesale improvement in the efficient use of
resources and perhaps wholesale improvements in health
outcomes.</div><a name="09062386000074"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062386000412"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> That is a perceptive and important question. If
direct payments accentuate inequalities, then they have failed. It is
likely that some individuals will be better able to manage budgets than
others. That may well be attributable to their level of education and
various attributes of their medical condition. We will have to evaluate
this with care. Our aim is to ensure that we do not accentuate
inequalities, particularly social 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column159" />Column number: 159</div>inequalities, and also that we have an efficient use of resources, but
the primary reason we are introducing this is to see whether we can
better ensure that the treatment of individuals is carried out so that
they will get the highest benefit. It is not either to save money or to
spend more. The amount of money is not the key issue; the key issue is,
what is the real benefit? If we can, as a result of this, ensure that
health service provision for groups of people or individuals, because
of the nature of a particular long-term condition that they have, is
improved, then we are looking at a
success.</div><a name="09062386000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
evaluation will be quite tricky; I do not hide that from the hon.
Gentleman at all. We will need to balance a number of factors, and at
the end of the process we will have to make some judgments as to how
and in what circumstances to proceed. That will be the result of the
evaluation, which will be open and published and engage the various
groups, and then Parliament will have to make a decision about whether
it wishes to extend beyond the pilots, and if so, in what form. I hope
that with those explanations, the amendments can be withdrawn and we
can proceed with direct
payments.</div><a name="09062386000363"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062386000413"></a>Mr.
Stephen O'Brien:</b> I was particularly interested in the
intervention by my hon. Friend the Member for Orpington, who was
asking, in effect, what the scale of the pilots will be. I understand
from the Minister that there are about 70 projects currently in mind,
of which some will be individuals, some will be groups and some could
even be quite large groups. The issue, which I think the Minister was
hinting at, is not only that there is an effort to ensure that these
pilots have a proper, realistic and tough research-based
evaluation&#151;which will be difficult, as the Minister made
clear&#151;but that it will be difficult, scientifically, to get a
proper statistical distribution that will look across all the various
types, conditions, circumstances, socio-economic backgrounds, and
levels of educational attainment, and that will make a big difference.
The big issue as I see it, which is why our amendment 132 is
germane&#151;I shall not press it to a vote, but we may want to come
back to it on Report; it may even be something that the Government want
to consider in order to improve the Bill on Report&#151;relates to
the answer the Minister gave. He confirmed my motive, which was that
this is not intended to exacerbate, but to help to address health
inequalities, although the primary purpose is on an individual basis,
where the ultimate test will be whether this helps to improve patient
health outcomes, rather than detract or be high-differential in terms
of cost. That is the important area, and a secondary benefit would be
to help to address health
inequalities.</div><a name="09062386000077"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062386000414"></a>Mr.
Mike O'Brien:</b> I agree with most of what the hon. Gentleman
said, but he said that the pilots can apply to a group of people, even
a large group; that is not the intention. They are primarily for
personal budgets, but they might extend, say, to a couple of people
with a particular medical condition living together, or a group of
people with a particular medical condition, who would be able to manage
personal budgets and are, perhaps, living in the same accommodation. We
are not talking about large groups here; we are talking primarily 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column160" />Column number: 160</div>about personal budgets for individuals and those who might want to work
together as part of a personal budget project. I do not envisage that a
large group of people would decide to have the money and run their own
health system; that is not where we are at
all.</div><a name="09062386000078"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062386000415"></a>Mr.
Stephen O'Brien:</b> I am grateful for that answer to my
question. It was the question I was asked on Friday when I visited an
excellent care and nursing home in my constituency&#151;Prospect
House in Malpas. As there is a large collection of people there
suffering from the same age-related conditions, there was a question
mark as to whether there would be a pooled set of direct budgets, which
would slightly defeat the aim of basing help on a personal needs-based
assessment.</div>
<a name="09062386000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am grateful
for that intervention because it is clear the Minister has in mind that
help is effectively to be directed at the patients on a personal basis.
I hope that will clarify the matter for my hon. Friend the Member for
Orpington. I will not press the amendment at this point, but I hope the
Government will listen carefully and think about how to address this
better in the final shape of the Bill.</div>

Gidley:</b> The Minister seems to be saying all the right
things and there clearly is an intention to evaluate. Lessons could be
learnt from social care because some of those early direct-payment
trials were not terribly successful. It was only by continuing and
modifying that we eventually ended up with a model that is acceptable
to more people.</div>
<a name="09062386000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some key
questions have been asked today. My hon. Friend the Member for
Southport hit the nail on the head&#151;if you are improving health
generally that must be a good thing, but if you are further improving
the health of people with a longer life expectancy, is that quite such
a good thing? It is an argument we can bat around all day. What I am
not clear about is the criteria for these pilots. Although I am happy
to withdraw the amendment, it would be helpful if the Minister wrote to
us outlining the methodology that will be used for evaluation. It seems
that many of the pilots could have been set up in different ways. I am
not quite sure how one would compare 70 different pilots, all of which
apparently have small numbers of people&#151;something I had not
realised. That is difficult. It would be helpful for the Committee to
have more information about that before Report. It would also be useful
to know how many patients are involved in these pilots. Fundamentally,
if&#151;as the Minister indicated&#151;the numbers are small, we
could be making some quite significant changes to the NHS in the future
with a small evidence base. If the Minister can provide us with that
information it will be helpful. However, at this stage I beg to ask
leave to withdraw the amendment.</div>
<a name="09062386000082"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062386000417"></a>Sandra
Gidley:</b> I beg to move amendment 173, in

34.</div><a name="09062386000084"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062386000418"></a>The

<div class="Column"><a name="Column161" />Column number: 161</div><a name="09062386000085"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062386000419"></a>Sandra
Gidley:</b> The amendment would delete the entirety of
paragraph (8)(b) from new section 12C, which allows any other
provisions of the National Health Service Act 2006 to be amended,
modified or repealed&#151;for example, where it has become apparent
that this is necessary for a general roll-out of direct payments. The
reason for tabling the amendment was that new section 12C(8) contains a
wide-ranging power to amend or modify the NHS Act. The Delegated Powers
and Regulatory Reform Committee commented on that during its
examination of the Bill. They described this as a &#147;Henry VIII
power&#148; and concluded that it was</div>
<a name="09062386000348"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;limited to
facilitating the exercise of the powers to make direct
payments.&#148;</div>
<a name="09062386000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">Other organisations
have raised concerns that in fact this may not be the case and there is
no sunset clause here. Given that the Government would like to start
pilot projects this year, it is somewhat surprising; the inclusion of a
sunset clause would reassure people that the power was only limited to
the direct payments. This is to seek clarification on the
Government&#146;s intentions, because it is a wide-ranging power and
could have been restricted if that was the sole purpose of its
inclusion in the Bill.</div>
<a name="09062386000087"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062386000420"></a>Mr.
Stephen O'Brien:</b> Both amendments seek to limit the
apparently wide-ranging powers introduced for the Secretary of State
over the 2006 Act. Subsection (9) clearly limits those powers, but the
power is still vast, as the Secretary of State needs only to be able to
state that the action is in regard to direct payments to wield it. It
is, though, subject to the affirmative resolution. In terms of the
amendment, this is a Henry VIII power, although Lord Justice Laws
suggested&#151;I think in the 2002 metric martyrs case&#151;that it
was unfair to attribute such powers to His late Majesty, who reigned
100 years before the civil war, and longer yet before the establishment
of parliamentary legislative supremacy. I hope the Minister can confirm
whether the power could be used to remove the measures that restrict
this to pilots as much as to remove the pilots from the 2006 Act
altogether.</div><a name="09062386000088"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062386000421"></a>Mr.
Mike O'Brien:</b> Allowing the Secretary of State to make an
order repealing the limitation that direct payments may be made in
pilot schemes only is the aim of new section 12C of the 2006 Act. It
provides a power, effectively, to extend direct payments nationally
should the pilots be successful. That is the objective of the exercise.
Amendment 173 would remove that provision and amendment 142 would
significantly restrict its scope. So the amendments would be made to
part 2, and not the other 13 parts of the 2006
Act.</div><a name="09062386000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
can assure members of the Committee that the provision is not intended
to, and does not, give the Government free rein to rewrite NHS
legislation by order&#151;and I am conscious that the words I use can
be prayed in aid in any subsequent interpretation. It is intended that
the provision would simply allow us to make any consequential
amendments to the NHS Act that might be necessary to facilitate the
wider roll-out of direct payments following the pilots that are being
undertaken. It is not intended to go beyond that, or to create a
general power to make any substantial changes beyond making a national
provision of direct payments, should that be possible, in a limited
number of cases where those limits are constrained by the nature of the

<div class="Column"><a name="Column162" />Column number: 162</div>condition and the outcome of the evaluations that will take place at the
end of the pilots. The provision is reasonably clear and is aimed at
enabling us to do what works as a result of the pilots and spread it
throughout the country. We do not intend to give the powers wider
application.</div>
<a name="09062386000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the hon.
Member for Eddisbury said, the affirmative resolution procedure would
be used in relation to this. That provides a significant safeguard and
ensures appropriate accountability to Parliament. That said, I hope
that the hon. Lady will withdraw the amendment.</div>

years to the day since I last learned statutory interpretation
rules&#151;and given that I believe the Minister is right that what
he has said is on the record and can be prayed in aid&#151;I am
confident that the limitation now rests as written. I am happy not to

&#145;patient&#146;.</div><a name="09062386000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
we canter to a close on clause 11, in this amendment to proposed new
section 12D we return to where we started at the top of the clause,
putting the patient at the heart of the legislation and indeed the
care. I can see that the Secretary of State might want to commission
information and support services, but will the Minister explain why
legislation is necessary to support that? Surely it comes under the
normal general duty and remit of the Secretary of State. The question
the amendment poses is whether the individual will be able to
commission support and information services as part of his or her care
plan.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062386000425"></a>Mr.
Mike O'Brien:</b> The aim of the power, which would be
delegated from the Secretary of State to PCTs, is to allow the NHS to
work with other organisations to develop direct payments. A PCT may
choose, for example, to commission a voluntary organisation to
undertake an assessment and agree a care plan for patients, or it may
arrange for a social enterprise to offer support or brokerage services.
For example, if a budget is provided to an individual, that person may
want to use another organisation either to manage the budget itself or
to provide access to particular kinds of care. An example is agency
nursing, for which a brokerage may well broker on behalf of a
patient.</div>
<a name="09062386000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
different ways therefore in which we need to have provision for
organisations beyond the NHS itself to be able to deal with some of
these issues around the budget, but also to make sure the NHS&#146;s
finances are safeguarded during that process. It enables us therefore
to have some degree of budgetary control overall but also to ensure
that the way in which these personal budgets are used gives a degree of
flexibility to individuals to handle the budgets in the way that they
feel best suits their needs and their element of health
care.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062386000428"></a>Mr.
Stephen O'Brien:</b> I have a few questions concerning the
health service commissioner. What assessment have the Government made
of any increase in work load and how have they resourced that? I
discovered during proceedings on the Health and Social Care Act 2008
that although the Government are able to adjust the responsibilities of
the ombudsman through legislation such as this, the resource of the
ombudsman is not delivered through the money motion of the Bill but
must be voted directly by Parliament.</div>
<a name="09062386000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">Can the
Minister confirm that the ombudsman will not be limited to
maladministration in this area? When one talks to the ombudsman, one
finds that they do not believe that they are. It is important, however,
given that most MPs who deploy the ombudsman on behalf of their
constituents tend to think that the ombudsman&#146;s remit is limited
to maladministration. We must be clear about the expectation here,
given that there is no alternative appeals process.</div>
<a name="09062386000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Under-Secretary of State for Health, the hon. Member for Brentford and
Isleworth (Ann Keen), told me earlier this month, in response to a
written parliamentary
question:</div><a name="09062386000350"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
scope and remit of the parliamentary and health service ombudsman to
consider complaints has not been changed by the abolition of the
Healthcare Commission.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official
Report</i>, 9 June 2009; Vol. 493, c.
839W.]</div><a name="09062386000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will
the patient in receipt of a direct payment be able to complain about
anything in the care package&#151;the commissioning and providing, or
overpayment and underpayment, for example&#151;rather than simply the
administration of that
package?</div><a name="09062386000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thirdly,
what is the hierarchy of complaints? Last year saw the removal of the
complaints function from the Healthcare Commission, now the Care
Quality Commission, which removed people&#146;s ability to push
complaints about things other than maladministration 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column164" />Column number: 164</div>beyond their own trust. In the case of direct payments, if the patient
is the commissioner, do they lose the right to complain through the
PCT? Is their only recourse to complain to themselves, and to the
ombudsman? I hope the Minister can give us more clarity about how this
will
work.</div><a name="09062386000110"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062386000429"></a>Mr.
Mike O'Brien:</b> The clause expands the jurisdiction of the
Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman as set out in the Health
Service Commissioners Act 1993. It allows the ombudsman to investigate
people providing services funded by direct payments for health care,
but who are not health service bodies. In particular, it allows the
ombudsman to investigate matters relating to commercial or other
contractual transactions arising from arrangements for the provision of
direct payment services. So this will not just be about
maladministration; it will be somewhat wider than that, so that we can
have a proper investigation of problems that arise, which may well
result from legitimate disputes that come out of the provision of
direct budgets to
individuals.</div><a name="09062386000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">By
expanding the ombudsman&#146;s scope in this way, we can ensure that
people who receive these services have a similar degree of protection
to other NHS patients. It is not identical&#151;for example, the NHS
complaints system will not apply&#151;but this is consistent with the
principle that services procured by direct payments remain NHS
services. So where a third party has provided various levels of
service, the NHS ombudsman would be able to look at how that third
party provided those services. The ombudsman will have discretion about
which complaints she wishes to investigate and we expect that she will
continue to operate in a sensible and proportionate manner. Neither we
nor the ombudsman expect these changes to add significantly to her work
load and the ombudsman is supportive of our
approach.</div><a name="09062386000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are not aware of any significant resource implications, to deal with
the point raised by the hon. Member for Eddisbury, but should that
resource implication arise, we will listen to representations from the
ombudsman to ensure that these things can be properly looked into in a
proportionate and appropriate way. The resource issue is not a major
one and we will look at how this develops in the future. As I have
indicated, it is not just maladministration and we want to ensure that
the health service ombudsman, in particular, will be able to look at
matters more broadly than merely disputes between a PCT and someone who
has a budget&#151;for example, to look at how the budget was deployed
by the individual. Reports from the ombudsman can help us in the longer
term to evaluate how these budgets are being dealt
with.</div><a name="09062386000113"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062386000430"></a>Mr.
Stephen O'Brien:</b> The last point is important, because it
might establish patterns of behaviour as a result of the way things are
being done, which, without LINks or, indeed the former community health
councils being specifically involved, could be a very valuable way of
assessing the collective experience. It will be very important to those
who have a concern about the use of the direct payments&#151;people
in vulnerable situations may be worried about taking a complaint to the
very body from which they need continuing support. There is always an
anxiety about using a complaints process which is effectively like a
parked arbitration process without affecting their relationship with
the continuing support that they need. This is a very important area in
terms of trust and confidence and why the independence is
valued.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column165" />Column number: 165</div><a name="09062386000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
has helpfully identified the expectations, particularly as regards
resources, and that confirms what I have heard myself from the
ombudsman, but the issue will be whether there is an ability to access
the ombudsman, given that ombudsmen have a full panoply of
recommendations open to them, but, as we all know, no teeth. The best
they can do is issue another letter suggesting that the recommendation
has not been carried out, as we know from the Equitable Life debacle.
If this is to work properly, in the interests of patients, it is
important that the ombudsman be given the full remit. I am satisfied
with the reply so
far.</div><a name="09062386000115"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062386000431"></a>Mr.
Stephen O'Brien:</b> I beg to move amendment 140, in
schedule 1, page 38, line 32, at

regulations under section
12B&#146;.</div><a name="09062386000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
140 would bring all regulations in new section 12B under the
affirmative resolution process. These are the regulations we discussed
at length concerning the nature of the direct payment pilots. Unless
this amendment is made, neither this House nor the upper House will
have the chance to debate the substance of the pilots. It is unlikely
that we would want to vote down the regulations supporting the pilots
by praying against them. It is likely that we would want to see them
amended, depending on how the Government act in the debates we are
about to
have.</div><a name="09062386000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
Tuesday the Minister suggested I was presumptuous in moving an
amendment directly referring to the NHS board, something the country is
crying out for. Here I offer him the chance to make the life of Health
Ministers in the next administration, whoever they may be, more
difficult in the interests of Parliamentary scrutiny. I will not repeat
the debate we had about new section 12B, but I think there are
significant concerns about these issues and we should consider
asserting an affirmative power regarding
them.</div><a name="09062386000121"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062386000432"></a>Mr.
Mike O'Brien:</b> We do need to develop regulations to set up
the pilots. It is likely that these would have to be amended in light
of the review of the pilots if a decision is made to roll out direct
payments nationally. We would expect to hold a public consultation on
draft regulations for the normal 12-week period. It is our intention to
control direct payments with the regulation-making power and that these
should be subject to the negative resolution process. I reassure the
Committee that it is our intention to use the affirmative resolution
procedure for any order either extending direct payments nationally or
abolishing the power to grant them. The big issue would come back to
the House through the affirmative resolution procedure. If any decision
is made to abolish direct payments or to extend them nationally, that
would be via the affirmative resolution. As that would be a significant
decision for the NHS, we think it is vital that before an order is made
it should be approved after a proper discussion in both Houses. We
think that many of the rules would be very detailed and although we
want to give discretion in the way direct payments 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column166" />Column number: 166</div>are piloted, we do not want to have a level of unnecessary pedantry
involved in looking at the detail of what could be mundane rules.
Applying the affirmative resolution procedure to all of that would be
quite likely to clog up this place for a significant period of
time.</div><a name="09062386000341"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent">With
the assurance that any large-scale decision about national roll-out or
not proceeding with direct payments would come back under the
affirmative resolution procedure, but the detailed regulations would be
subjected to a negative resolution procedure after a 12-week
consultation with the relevant stakeholders, I hope the hon. Gentleman
feels that amendment 140 can be
withdrawn.</div><a name="09062386000365"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.30

making sure that Parliament has the opportunity to look at these
regulations, particularly as we will want the opportunity, not just in
terms of regulations, but to hold the Government&#146;s feet to the
fire in converting pilots into action. This is an opportunity to state

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062386000449"></a>Mr.
Stephen O'Brien:</b> After the excitement of that vote, I
would like to make the point that, in looking at the 20 May memorandum
from the Department of Health on health budget pilot programmes and
provisional pilot sites, I am pleased to see that the first one on the
alphabetical list is the Secretary of State&#146;s constituency. That
will be piloting NHS continuing health care on life care, learning
disabilities, mental health and physical disabilities. That will be
helpful to give him an insight. I am also pleased to see that Western
Cheshire, which covers part of my Eddisbury constituency, is also
looking at continuing health care on motor neurone disease, multiple
sclerosis, neuro-degenerative conditions and Parkinson&#146;s disease
as well as end-of-life care. I shall do my best to follow that
closely.</div>
<a name="09062386000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">I urge the
Minister to see whether he can get something in North Warwickshire
included, because the more of an insight we have from our own
constituents&#146; point of view on the way this is working, the more
helpful it will be as we try to move pilots into a
roll-out.</div>

seek to land these in my constituency, but I will certainly bear in

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062386000453"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> We now move away from direct payments into
innovation, and in particular this one-clause provision in chapter 4 on
innovation prizes. I welcome attempts to aid the spread of innovation
in the NHS and recognise that this is not only an area in need of
improvement but an area with a large amount of potential. Innovation in
the NHS, if given the chance to flourish, can motivate and incentivise
staff to drive forward improvements to services and it can also furnish
British business and industry with opportunities to develop NHS
innovations, many of which may have been inspired by the ideas of NHS
staff. In that respect, I declare an interest as the parliamentary
adviser to the Manufacturing Technologies Association, who manufacture
some extraordinarily precise, very small instruments which are used as
part of NHS innovations. Through amendments 18, 136 and 137, I want to
address gaps in the legislation concerning the scope of the prizes. I
will address my queries on the prizes themselves later on.</div>
<a name="09062386000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments seek to ensure that the innovation prizes are open to all
NHS employees and to any groups or organisations affiliated to that
service. They broaden the scope of prizes to include the promotion of
innovation, and enable them to be paid in instalments so that staff can
develop a long-term strategy for the uptake of their ideas.</div>
<a name="09062386000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 18
addresses Lord Darzi&#146;s clarification on the fourth day of the
Lords Grand Committee, that the prizes could be awarded to</div>

324.]</div><a name="09062386000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">I can
confirm that in a non-remunerative position. I am the vice-chairman at
the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine. I also sit on the board of
the Innovative Vector Control Consortium, a research organisation
trying to find an alternative molecular structure to DDT. The research
going on there will have a direct impact if there is success. The
Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine is already having an impact on
many things in the health service and there is a fantastic
collaboration between it and the university hospitals in
Liverpool.</div>
<a name="09062386000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">Lord Darzi
was right to cite these people as a potential source of innovations,
but there is a danger that they could be discriminated against if it is
not overtly stated in the Bill that prizes are open not only to NHS
employees. The British Medical Association expressed its support when
it said that amendment 18 would clarify that medical academics are
eligible for the prizes.</div>
<a name="09062386000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am also
concerned that the challenge of an innovation prize decided on by the
committee might limit the pool of applicants to a particular field of
specialism, and in so doing, discriminate against other NHS staff. By
emphasising the breadth of the prize in primary legislation through the
amendment, I hope to guard against its application to a specific group
of NHS employees or a particular field of expertise. The prize&#146;s
potential would, therefore, be maximised to inspire everyone in the NHS
to innovate. Will the Minister give an assurance that the Committee
will not limit the scope of applicants to the prizes by defining too
stringently the discipline from which the innovation must
originate?</div><a name="09062386000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">By
extending the remit of the prizes to award the promotion of innovation
through amendment 137, NHS staff who play a significant role in
generating uptake of innovative ideas, and encouraging others to
innovate, may be rewarded through the prize. While promotional work
will be harder to define, its inclusion in the prize will encourage not
only potential innovators, but those with the potential to facilitate
the spread of innovation across the organisation. In the next group of
amendments, I hope to have the opportunity to discuss the idea that the
problem facing the NHS is not so much the dearth of innovative ideas,
but their uptake across the service. Promotional activities can greatly
aid the spread of innovation, which is why I propose to include them in
the scope of innovation prizes. In parenthesis, from my own experience
in the manufacturing industry, there is a great concentration on the
word &#147;innovation&#148;, but people readily forget that a lot
of that comes through developments of existing technology and building
on prior innovations. There is often a great problem in giving the
developments the same weight as blue-sky thinking innovations. We need
to recognise that often 90 per cent.&#151;in most fields&#151;of
what is regarded as innovation is in fact a development of an existing
practice or
idea.</div><a name="09062386000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is a good example of how promotional activities can be fundamental to
the spread of innovation in my own constituency at Leighton hospital
near Crewe&#151;the Leighton exposition. Since 2004, Mid Cheshire
Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust has used its research and development
office to set up an effective information dissemination forum to
provide opportunities for local clinicians and researchers to network
with one another 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column169" />Column number: 169</div>and discuss their practices, ideas and collaborations. The event also
showcases the work of local health care research and audit. I attended
the last evaluation and am grateful to David Cade and Sasi Willmott,
who always produce a brochure with everything set out and documented.
There is a prize for the winning entry that is judged by three
external, high-powered academic adjudicators. The 60 innovations that
were exhibited at the 2008 event bear witness to the fact that
innovative ideas are alive and kicking in the NHS. Events such as the
Leighton exposition help innovators to promote those ideas among
colleagues and, therefore, generate
uptake.</div><a name="09062386000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Leighton exposition also demonstrates that it is the clinicians and
researchers who are best placed to identify the challenges across the
NHS. Innovations at the exposition included identifying reasons for
delays in in-patient ultrasound scans, improving access to community
services for elderly people after discharge from hospital and an
analysis of whether proposals from the National Institute for Health
and Clinical Excellence are useful in clinical practice. All these
topics originated from staff who identified independently an area of
research or a problem in need of a solution. If innovative events such
as these are going ahead in trusts such as Mid Cheshire, and if
innovators are succeeding in identifying areas of the NHS that are in
need of innovation, it questions why the Government are investing in
costly prizes that might inadvertently rob innovators of their role. By
identifying a challenge for innovators to tackle, the innovation prize
committee may be meddling unnecessarily in the innovation process. I
hope to seek an assurance from the Minister that the creation of a
national prize for innovation will not detract from home-grown,
grass-roots initiatives such as the example I have outlined from my
constituency&#151;at Leighton hospital, near Crewe.</div>
<a name="09062386000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 136
would enable the organisers of events such as the Leighton exposition
to apply for innovation prizes as the promoters of innovation. I hope
the Minister will acknowledge that the promotion of innovation at a
local level can be as effective in aiding the spread of innovation as
rewarding the innovators themselves. The example of Leighton raises
questions over whether innovation prizes will really overcome the
obstacles that inhibit innovation in the NHS. The Secretary of State
identified the problem with NHS innovation on Second Reading. He said
that</div><a name="09062386000353"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
NHS is good at invention, but it can be slow to adopt new technologies
and treatments, and the spread of new ideas is
variable.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>, 8 June 2009; Vol.
493, c.
542.]</div><a name="09062386000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
wholeheartedly agree with the diagnosis of the problem but I question
the remedy. Prizes may reward innovation that has already taken
place&#151;which, if I understand it correctly, is the main
legislative purpose of the Bill&#151;but I fail to see how this
change in the rules will encourage the spread of innovation. The
problem is surely one of morale. The uptake of innovation is negligent
because morale among staff is low. Too often staff have seen their
ideas go nowhere, which is disheartening and dispiriting. A recent
report by the NHS Confederation called &#147;Future of leadership:
Leading innovation&#148; highlighted the lack of uptake of ideas as a
source of low morale among staff. It pointed to the preponderance of
risk-averse middle managers in the NHS whose work loads are orientated
towards short-term targets, rather than encouraging and championing
innovative ideas 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column170" />Column number: 170</div>among their staff. It also emphasised the overly bureaucratic mechanisms
through which innovators must pass before they can generate uptake for
their innovation. The requirement for the clinician to write a business
case was seen as a significant obstacle: it is perceived by staff as a
way of saying no to innovation rather than as a vehicle to secure funds
and uptake.</div>
<a name="09062386000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 137
aims to aid staff in generating uptake of ideas by allowing prizes for
innovative ideas to be paid in instalments. Each instalment could be
dependent on a new stage of implementation, thereby encouraging staff
to support an innovative idea and see it through to completion. The
problem facing the NHS with regard to innovation runs much deeper than
generating ideas. A prize is a great way of rewarding the few
innovators who have made it through the gauntlet of securing the
support of their colleagues and managers. Only a small number of people
can successfully negotiate a heavy target-driven work load to find the
time and resources to innovate. However, for the majority of NHS staff,
an innovation prize in and of itself will not enable them to overcome
these barriers.</div>
<a name="09062386000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope the
Minister will mention in his response the newly established innovation
funds held by the SHAs. He may well say that the prizes are designed to
work in conjunction with these funds to spread innovation. I welcome
that funding and I hope it will provide much-needed capital for those
seeking to develop their innovations. I hope he will also take the
opportunity to give an indication of how he intends to change the
culture of resistance amongst managers and other NHS staff&#151;a
culture that, we would argue, is hampered through a somewhat
target-centric NHS. This is an issue that runs much deeper than simply
the cash that comes with the prize.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062386000454"></a>Sandra
Gidley:</b> I welcome these amendments because they give us a
chance to probe where some of this money may be going. Before I
progress with my arguments I was a little concerned by the closing
remark of the hon. Member for Eddisbury, who talked about a culture of
resistance in the health service. My experience of a lot of workers in
the health service
is&#151;</div><a name="09062386000167"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062386000455"></a>Mr.
Stephen O'Brien:</b> It was
managers.</div>
<a name="09062386000168"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062386000456"></a>Sandra
Gidley:</b> And managers. My experience is that they are not
averse to change, although the hon. Gentleman may have spoken to
different people from me. There is a lot of innovation out there, but
sadly it is not recognised by many people, including politicians, it
would seem.</div>
<a name="09062386000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of my
concerns about the Bill relates to clause 14(1), which
states:</div>
<a name="09062386000354"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Secretary of State may make payments as prizes to promote innovation in
the provision of health services in
England&#148;,</div><a name="09062386000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">but
says nothing whatever about the NHS. I therefore welcome amendment 18,
which makes it clear that the prize may relate to</div>
<a name="09062386000355"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;work in any
field relevant to the
NHS&#148;.</div><a name="09062386000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
it occurred to me that a team employed in the private sector could do
work relevant to the NHS and apply for a prize. It would be a concern
to many of us if public money could, as a result of the way in which
the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column171" />Column number: 171</div>Bill is drafted, be diverted to the private sector. I hope the Minister
can reassure us on that. Where do independent sector treatment centres
come into this? What would happen if a team was doing something in such
a centre?</div>
<a name="09062386000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
another concern. When we talk about the NHS, innovation and prizes, we
focus almost exclusively on secondary care. If we are serious about
moving care towards the primary sector, we need a mechanism to ensure
that that happens. For example, optometrists or dentists could have
good ideas for prizes or innovation. My concern is that worthy
committees full of specialists in secondary care will be set up and
will focus automatically on secondary care, biasing what is done.
Innovation is not just about the flashy new procedures, and it is not
necessarily about the research; sometimes, it is just about thinking
outside the box and coming up with a new way of delivering services
that is more convenient for patients and the public and which could
probably reduce some of the strain on the secondary sector.</div>
<a name="09062386000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">When the fine
detail is worked out, I very much hope that the prizes will not just be
a means of congratulating those who already have quite a number of
areas in which to show off their expertise. I hope that they will truly
embrace all the NHS.</div>
<a name="09062386000174"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062386000457"></a>Mr.
Mike O'Brien:</b> This has been a helpful debate, and the hon.
Member for Romsey has made some thoughtful points, to which I will
return in a moment.</div>
<a name="09062386000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">The aim of
the prizes is to reward breakthroughs in the provision of health
services in England, so the provisions relate to the NHS. The
challenges will be designed to tackle some of our major health issues
and bring about not only radical breakthroughs in the prevention and
treatment of lifestyle diseases, but changes in the way in which things
are managed and delivered. That includes secondary and primary
care.</div>
<a name="09062386000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">I strongly
take the point from the hon. Member for Eddisbury that innovation could
mean the development to a new level of existing ideas&#151;he is
absolutely right about that. The nature of the process makes it
difficult to assess the quality of what is being done and to draw
attention to it.</div>
<a name="09062386000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">We will have
to handle the prizes properly, and to some extent the hon. Member for
Romsey is right that there will be a committee of the great and the
good&#151;there always is in such things. We will have to make sure
that we have the right distribution of responsibilities on that
committee, so that it not only focuses on the obvious issue of
developments in secondary care, but includes management and
delivery.</div>
<a name="09062386000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">I agree with
the hon. Member for Eddisbury, although I would not quite put it in the
way that he did, that there is a lack of reward and recognition in the
NHS system. The prizes are a way to incentivise people and focus minds.
They are a way to reward people and to recognise that some people are
anxious to make changes.</div>
<a name="09062386000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">Unlike the
hon. Member for Romsey, I agree with the hon. Gentleman that sometimes
in management there is a culture of resistance, inertia or lack of
innovation about the way things are done. If we can provide incentives
such as this to organisations to be more innovative, to show that we
are prepared to put resources behind new ideas that can improve patient
care, then we 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column172" />Column number: 172</div>will truly feed into that emphasis on quality that came out of the
review by my noble Friend Lord Darzi. That review focuses on ways that
we can improve the quality of the NHS and the quality of delivery and
recognise that we have passed the stage where we just need to focus on
raising minimum standards. This is not just about minimum standards; we
have to have a continued focus on that, but we now need to move to a
higher level and look at how we improve the quality of what the NHS
delivers at the top&#151;make the best better, make the mediocre the
best and ensure that we improve quality throughout the NHS.</div>
<a name="09062386000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">The scheme is
primarily focused at ensuring that people working in the NHS are able
to see the benefits and recognition for their work in making a
breakthrough. This is not restricted to the NHS; it is available to
those working in academia. We want to ensure that there is a regional
focus. The &#163;220 million regional innovation fund has been
launched and we will target resources at helping front-line staff to
develop, grow and spread new ideas, delivering real improvements in the
quality of the care people receive. Academic health science centre
status has been awarded to five partnerships following the process of
peer review by an international panel of experts. Academic health
science centres will bring together world-class research, teaching and
health care delivery, so that developments in research can be more
rapidly translated into improvements in patient care in the NHS and
around the
world.</div><a name="09062386000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are not restricting the award of prizes to those in the NHS, but we are
ensuring that there is a focus on NHS workers knowing that they are
available to them, that a challenge is being set and that if the
challenge is met internationally or in another sector, a prize may be
awarded. That will happen only if the idea is demonstrated to be
replicable in the NHS. On amendment 136 we would not expect to award a
prize simply for the promotion of innovation in itself. There needs to
be an actual breakthrough and it needs to be replicable in the NHS;
promotion of a project is one element of that. We need to be able to
show that this idea, wonderful breakthrough that it is, can produce a
wider benefit, not only in the NHS but, we hope, in some cases beyond
that and possibly around the
world.</div><a name="09062386000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
amendment 137 we are not intending to make payments in instalments. The
challenge prizes are not about giving money in the form of grants for
work to be undertaken, which the amendment seems to suggest. This is
about rewarding work that has been done&#151;we have got an
innovation, we award the prize and then that money can be used to
replicate or extend the innovation or move it to the next stage. We are
going to award prizes for what has been
done.</div><a name="09062386000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Eddisbury asked whether this is meddling in innovation.
Innovation often happens anyway; this is an encouragement of
innovation. In that encouraging innovation and the development of new
ideas is meddling, yes it is. It is trying to provide a prize for those
who excel and to reward excellence. That is something that we should be
doing. We do not want to detract from those in the NHS pursuing
innovation; on the contrary, we want to encourage
it.</div><a name="09062386000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Romsey in her thoughtful speech asked whether this
money would go to the independent sector were it to provide an
innovation or breakthrough that helps patients. It will, if it helps 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column173" />Column number: 173</div>patients and if it is replicable throughout the NHS. If we can take the
innovation from a private sector organisation and transfer it to the
NHS, or if we can find ways in which it will benefit patients in the
NHS, it will go to a private sector organisation. It is to reward
something from which the NHS will benefit.</div>
<a name="09062386000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that I
have dealt with most of the points that were raised by both the hon.
Members and that the amendment will be
withdrawn.</div><a name="09062386000186"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062386000458"></a>Mr.
Stephen O'Brien:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for
addressing the matter carefully. As he recognises, we are concerned
about this area. There will be significant benefits from getting this
right. It has been helpful that he has clarified that the intent that
lies behind this, which flows from the Darzi report, is that it is
intended to reward breakthrough and reputable innovations or
innovations upon developments. It is a post facto reward, so the
question will be whether that is a sufficient pull-through incentive
and motivator to influence people to shoot for the prize and to make
sure that this inculcates more of a culture of innovative
activity.</div>
<a name="09062386000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister&#146;s last answer was helpful because it is the equivalent
of reaching a commercialisable stage in the private sector but
absolutely focused on the public sector ethos of the NHS. With that
clarity, I can see that the amendments may not wholly fit with that
intent. The debate has been helpful, however, and I dare say the
Committee of the great and the good, as the Minister described it, may
find our exchanges useful in setting their own terms of reference and
the expectations that are going to be laid upon them. I beg to ask
leave to withdraw the amendment.</div>
<a name="09062386000188"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,
by leave,
withdrawn.</i></div><a name="09062386000189"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062386000459"></a>The
Chairman:</b> It may be helpful to the Committee in the
interests of progress if we do not to have a separate debate on clause
stand-part because the amendments seem to cover fully the substance of
the important clause 14. Although the clause is important, it is very
short.</div><a name="09062386000190"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062386000460"></a>Mr.
Stephen O'Brien:</b> I beg to move amendment 19, in
clause 14, page 11, line 3, at
end insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(4) The
committee shall advise
on&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">(a) the selection of
candidates for innovation
prizes;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">(b) the payment awarded
to each prize
winner.&#146;.</div><a name="09062386000191"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062386000461"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to take
amendment 20 in
clause 14, page 11, line 3, at
end insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(4) The
Secretary of State and his appointed committee may not determine the
field, discipline or sector in which candidates for innovation prizes
must develop their
innovations.&#146;.</div><a name="09062386000192"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062386000462"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> Thank you, Mr. Key. These amendments
cover the rest of the subject, so the absence of a stand part debate is
not an issue.</div>
<a name="09062386000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments 19
and 20 lead on from the issues that we have just discussed in the last
group. There is a concern that, by allowing the Committee to identify
challenges&#151;a word that the Minister picked up in his last
response&#151;for innovators to tackle, the Government will be
undermining the entire concept of innovation. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column174" />Column number: 174</div>Amendments 19 and 20 aim to define more precisely the role of the
Committee and to ensure that they do not determine the field,
discipline or sector from which the innovation must come.</div>
<a name="09062386000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">One example
is the case raised by Lord Darzi himself as an example of NHS
innovation&#151;the introduction of drug eluting stents in
angioplasty. This innovation came about directly as a result of the
experiences of interventional cardiologists who were involved in
angioplasty procedures on a daily basis and familiar with the use of
stents and catheters in heart surgery. These clinicians identified a
need for the innovation after witnessing first hand the cases of
patients who would have benefited from a drug eluting stent in their
artery. It was the clinicians as opposed to the authorities who
identified the need for an innovation or the challenge that needed
solving. If innovation is about finding solutions to the problems we
encounter in our everyday experience, why should we have these problems
defined for us by the powers that be? Surely the prerogative to
innovate and decide where to innovate should lie with the NHS
professionals and staff themselves, not with a small committee that
will inevitably have a more limited capacity to understand the scope
for innovation in every specialism in the NHS.</div>
<a name="09062386000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope the
Minister will take this opportunity to assure the Committee that the
committee that is set up will be wide-ranging enough in its areas of
expertise to identify sectors where innovation is required. On the
subject of the committee&#146;s composition, in its brief to me the
BMA raised the interesting proposition of placing patients and members
of the public on the panel. Not only would this create public interest
in NHS innovation, it would also give an incentive to applicants to
ensure that their innovations directly impact upon patient care. When I
asked the Minister prior to the Bill for an evidence base for the use
of innovation prizes, he gave the example of the X Prize&#151;a $10
million award for innovation across the globe. The X Prize website
states:</div>
<a name="09062386000356"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Rather
than awarding money to honor past achievements or directly funding
research, an X Prize incites innovation by tapping into our competitive
and entrepreneurial
spirits.&#148;</div><a name="09062386000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the Minister is using this prize as his model for NHS innovation, I
have to ask why he is proposing to award prizes retrospectively for
research and other innovations. I hope that he has some evidence base
for awarding prizes retrospectively, a point which was confirmed in the
previous group of
amendments.</div><a name="09062386000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
also question the need for legislation when the impact assessment
states that the Secretary of State&#146;s existing powers already
allow him to backfill the costs of research. It also states that the
first round of prizes will be launched in 2009, while the legislation
itself will not come into play until 2010. I assume, therefore, that
the Bill is not actually the source of the power that the Secretary of
State needs in order to get this
going.</div><a name="09062386000367"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12
noon</div><a name="09062386000198"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062386000463"></a>Sandra
Gidley:</b> I note your desire not to have a clause stand part
debate, Mr Key, so I shall try to incorporate my extra comments into
the points I am about to make. Amendment 19 mentions what the Committee
shall advise on. We have some very vague criteria. It would be helpful
if those criteria were pinned down a little more. One thing that
concerned me was the setting up of yet another
committee.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column175" />Column number: 175</div><a name="09062386000199"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062386000464"></a>Mr.
Mike O'Brien:</b> I am sorry, I didn&#146;t catch the point
that the hon. Lady was making. Someone coughed and I did not hear
it.</div><a name="09062386000200"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062386000465"></a>Sandra
Gidley:</b> We are setting up yet another committee, but
presumably an existing committee could advise on these prizes. Clause
14(3)
says:</div><a name="09062386000357"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Secretary of State may establish a committee...and may pay
remuneration&#148;.</div><a name="09062386000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
also worried me slightly. It is fair enough to remunerate someone from
an outside body, but I suspect that most people on this committee
already work for the NHS in some capacity. I seek some reassurance that
they will not receive extra payments for their work on this committee
when, presumably, their time on the committee will be at the expense of
their other
work.</div><a name="09062386000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
would also be helpful if the Minister could clarify whether these
payments are going to go to individuals, heading teams or other teams,
or whether they will go to the trust that will be implementing the
work. I am not entirely clear who will benefit from these prizes. I am
comfortable with the concept of prizes, because it is always nice for
the work of staff to be recognised, it gives people an impetus and a
feel-good factor and NHS workers need some of that, but I am not
entirely clear who will benefit from these
payments.</div><a name="09062386000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
20 seems to want to ensure that the Secretary of State or the committee
do
not</div><a name="09062386000358"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;determine
the field, discipline or sector in which candidates for innovation
prizes must develop their
innovations&#148;.</div><a name="09062386000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand the thought behind this, but bearing in mind my earlier
comments, there is another way to look at this problem. I raised
concerns earlier that primary care may not receive its share of the
prizes. Concerns were raised on Second Reading , including by the hon.
Member for Eddisbury, that the right sort of research may not
necessarily feature highly. Is there a case for ensuring that at least
some of the money is allocated to each of these sectors? One would not
wish to be too prescriptive, but this would help the committee to
concentrate its thinking on ensuring a breadth of awards across primary
and secondary care and embracing what is regarded as the more pure
research arena. It would be helpful to know whether there is any
thinking on that.</div>
<a name="09062386000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">My final
comment is, again, about money. Things will get very tight, so will
this be a new pot of money, or will resources be diverted from an
existing awards scheme?</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062386000466"></a>Mr.
Mike O'Brien:</b> I am grateful to hon. Members for the way in
which they have dealt with the issue. Let me deal with some of the
questions that have been raised.</div>
<a name="09062386000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">The idea is
that the prize should be paid retrospectively. However, it could be
paid after a successful outcome in a challenge that was set upfront.
The committee of experts could receive applications from individuals or
organisations that wished to pursue a particular idea. Those
individuals or organisations would then, in effect, be approved for
that challenge, but they would get the funding only if their work
successfully delivered.</div>
<a name="09062386000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">Research
conducted as part of the NHS next stage review demonstrated that
challenge prizes in other sectors have led to investments of up to 10
to 16 times the cash value of a prize in relevant research to meet the
objectives. In a sense, therefore, there is a kudos to the
prize&#151;there is a recognition that organisations, groups, teams
and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column176" />Column number: 176</div>individuals strive for. The prize gets excellence out of those who might
otherwise feel that they would not be recognised if they work really
hard. We want the team of experts to stimulate innovation and
excellence and to ensure that we have the best delivery.</div>
<a name="09062386000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">We want a
broadly based expert panel that includes leading medical scientists,
hospital staff, managers, academics and others and which will look
broadly at the way in which the NHS operates. As the hon. Member for
Romsey said, a number of committees already exist. Indeed, there are
several important awards recognising innovation and outstanding
performance by health care practitioners and organisations, such as the
health and social care awards awarded by the NHS Institute for
Innovation and Improvement. However, we want to go beyond the
performance achievement recognised by current prizes and to award cash
prizes that are linked to predefined challenges and which will have a
significant impact on the population&#146;s future health.</div>
<a name="09062386000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">Professor Sir
John Bell, the president of the Academy of Medical Sciences, has been
appointed as the expert panel&#146;s interim chairman, and there will
be a call via the NHS Appointments Commission, for expressions of
interest in membership of the panel. That is the way in which we intend
to go about this.</div>
<a name="09062386000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">Whether
payments will be made to individuals or teams depends on the nature of
the challenge that has been set. A challenge may be set for an
individual or a team. The challenge may for a PCT to develop a new way
of delivering health care. There will therefore be a degree of
flexibility in terms of the response to the challenge. The committee of
experts will be given the flexibility to determine that.</div>
<a name="09062386000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will
particular sectors be identified? Yes, groups or individuals will be
able to write in to say, &#147;We wish our research to be considered
for a challenge prize.&#148; The committee of experts will then
examine the application together with others and take a view, on the
basis of the resources available to it, as to which could really
benefit the NHS and be replicated throughout it.</div>
<a name="09062386000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Romsey hinted that there are all sorts of innovations and
new ideas, but it will not be possible easily to replicate some of
them. They might be good for the private sector, but not the public
sector, and they might have just a limited, narrow objective that will
not have large-scale applicability. The committee will therefore need
to examine whether something will benefit the NHS as a
whole&#151;that is the objective. It will have the criteria, and it
may say, &#147;This is such an important area that we need to award a
challenge prize, even though only a very small number of patients will
benefit from a breakthrough in this narrow area. However, the aim is
that the NHS would be able to benefit more broadly from an
innovation.</div>
<a name="09062386000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">The panel of
experts has a fair degree of flexibility in its response. We hope that
it will be able to frame a challenge and incentivise a solution in such
a way that efforts and funds are multiplied by teams striving to
compete and win a prize. The innovation challenge prizes&#146;
purpose is to focus minds by putting significant challenges into the
system. They are a first for the NHS and we continue to work with a
range of stakeholders to make sure we get this right. Once the panel
has been appointed, these conversations would really have a starting
point. Challenges could be laid down to innovators from across the
country to tackle issues such as childhood 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column177" />Column number: 177</div>obesity, Alzheimer&#146;s, dementia, addiction, or chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease. The prizes would reward only those ideas that could
be replicated and diffused quickly across the NHS, accelerating the
time it takes for ideas to move from, in effect, the bench to the
bedside. We want to move excellence forward as quickly as possible. I
hope with those reassurances the amendment will be
withdrawn.</div>
<a name="09062386000215"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062386000467"></a>Mr.
Stephen O'Brien:</b> I think that the Minister has done
extraordinarily well to get as far as this point in our proceedings
before coming out with the first big soundbite: &#147;from the bench
to the bedside.&#148;</div>
<a name="09062386000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have had a
helpful debate. Lying behind this innovation and prize process is
clearly a model of being focused against an identified challenge. This
is an inelegant analogy but, within the NHS, we have an equivalent to
the Manhattan Project<i class="I">. </i>On the prize, I can see that the Minister
hopes that the leverage through the kudos will excite people to apply
the research capacity to come up with a successful solution. It will be
important that we retain the idea of this committee or panel of
experts&#151;although in recent days, the news coming out of Iran
about the Council of Experts has been very unhelpful, not least as it
involves the only thing that can put any constraints on the Supreme
Leader. That said, the nub of this will be how the panel calls for
ideas for challenges, from which it will, after a sifting process, come
up with what will be put out there.</div>
<a name="09062386000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">For what it
is worth, arising from my work on malaria, I draw the Minister&#146;s
attention to the fact that there is already a model that might be
effective for the new committee: the Medicines for Malaria Venture,
which is based in Geneva and partly funded by Bill and Melinda Gates.
It works well by taking ideas from various sources that might be able
to come up with innovative solutions to combat malaria. It has done a
tremendous job and, through the sift, has identified where the effort
needs to be made. That model is probably worth looking at.</div>
<a name="09062386000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">Following a
discussion that is useful to have on record, especially as the
committee sets about its work, I am happy to beg to ask leave to

Report.</div><a name="09062386000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
177 is important because at the moment the Bill says that the Secretary

consider
it</div><a name="09062386000359"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;appropriate
in the interests of the health

amendment would insert the word &#147;necessary&#148; so that it
would be not only appropriate for the whole NHS for the Secretary of
State to approve such a measure, but
necessary.</div><a name="09062386000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
of us with experience of local trusts bringing in turnaround teams and
so on have concerns about who these administrators will be. It seems
that there is an assumption under the Bill that the administrators will
mainly cover fiscal problems within foundation trusts, but that might
not be the case. Will the Minister not only address whether he is happy
for the word &#147;necessary&#148; to be inserted, which I think
would improve the Bill, but give an indication as to who these
administrators might be, where they might come from, and the cost
implications of their
appointment?</div><a name="09062386000229"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062386000469"></a>Sandra
Gidley:</b> I wonder whether the amendment would restrict
inspectors too much. If we think of recent examples, it took quite a
time in some cases for a body of evidence to become available
indicating that there were problems. By inserting the word
&#147;necessary&#148;, presumably there would have to be some sort
of test, but I wonder whether that would restrict the possibility of
proper investigations taking place. I am also keen to hear what the
Minister
says.</div><a name="09062386000230"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062386000470"></a>Mr.
Mike O'Brien:</b> By using the word &#147;necessary&#148;
as well as &#147;appropriate&#148;, as the amendment proposes, a
higher standard would be imposed on the Secretary of State when
appointing a trust special administrator. I agree with the hon. Lady
that that would restrict the ability of the Secretary of State to deal
with problems that could arise. These problems could relate to
finances, but they could be much broader than that, as we have seen in
recent cases. Perhaps this is not the place to discuss those, but I
think that we are all aware that there needs to be an appropriate
ability to deal with problems that arise in not only finance, but the
provision of health
care.</div><a name="09062386000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
we inserted the word &#147;necessary&#148; and it were argued that
other options should be canvassed, the Secretary of State would not be
able to take the appropriate action that was needed. The appointment of
a special administrator could not be said to be necessary if there was
any other option. This would apply even if appointing a trust special
administrator might be the best outcome. We do not want to be prevented
from using a regime when it is most needed and could be the best
possible outcome. For that reason, I cannot accept the
amendment.</div><a name="09062386000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
envisage that the Secretary of State would use the power rarely.
Interventions will be made through the new NHS performance framework or
Monitor&#146;s compliance framework. In the very rare cases when
these interventions are unsuccessful, or the strategic health authority
is not able to get plans agreed on how to address the situation, it
would be appropriate to appoint a trust special administrator. The
trust special administrator would need to be an individual or a body
with the skills and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column179" />Column number: 179</div>knowledge to work collaboratively with staff, patients and local and
national bodies. They would require significant experience of the NHS
and would not be in any way described as not appropriate to carry out
the role assigned to
them.</div><a name="09062386000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
degree of flexibility would be necessary when establishing exactly who
a special administrator would be. It would depend on whether the key
issue was primarily finance, in which case a special administrator
would need to have considerable experience in that area, or the
management of health care, in which case the expertise would need to be
in management. Those are primarily the key issues. However, the
requirement that the special administrator should have a clear
understanding of the way that the NHS works is enormously
important.</div>
<a name="09062386000234"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062386000471"></a>Dr.
Pugh:</b> I have some sympathy with the amendment. While the
Minister was speaking, I was thinking of scenarios in which, for
example, the Secretary of State might judge that decisions are not
being made for the best configuration of health services. For instance,
there might be a need to close down a maternity wing because it is not
sufficiently subscribed to by local mums. The hospital might decide to
preserve the maternity wing in response to local opinion, but the
Secretary of State could take a harder line, and he would obviously be
free politically to do so. While the Secretary of State might deem it
appropriate to intervene in such a scenario, I get the sense that the
general intention of the measure is to deal only with conditions of
chronic failure, not to override local autonomy. It might be helpful if
the Minister put that on record.</div>
<a name="09062386000235"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062386000472"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> I can certainly confirm that the measure is
intended to be used only where there is a chronic failure&#151;a
serious collapse in administration, health care or the finances of an
organisation. It is not intended to deal with the types of
disagreements that happen on a not irregular basis because we have
local autonomy. There will be disagreements within organisations,
between different groups and between the view of the Government and the
view of a local PCT, but it is not intended that the measure will be
used in such cases. It is designed to deal with very serious
situations. I hesitate to use the word &#147;crisis&#148;, but it
would certainly be used in a situation that was bordering on a crisis
when there was a serious or even chronic failure that required
intervention that was proportionate but
substantial.</div>
<a name="09062386000236"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062386000473"></a>Mr.
Horam:</b> To what extent do the arrangements give the
Minister powers that he does not already have? For example, he might be
aware that, in my constituency, the Bromley Hospitals NHS Trust had
accumulated debt of &#163;100 million as well as an operating debt.
As a consequence, there was a turnaround directive and an independent
accountant examined the figures from the previous four or five years to
find out how the trust had got into that position. The non-executives
were sacked and the whole situation was turned around. Frankly, the
process was not wholly satisfactory, but we reached a new situation as
a result of Ministers&#146; existing powers. That purely financial
situation is being dealt with satisfactorily, so why does the Minister
need these further powers, given that he already has substantial powers
in his existing remit?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column180" />Column number: 180</div><a name="09062386000237"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09062386000474"></a><b class="B">Mr.
</b><b class="B">O'Brien:</b> As far as the areas of intervention are
concerned, to some extent this depends on whether a foundation trust is
involved. If that is not the case, it is possible for the PCT to carry
out the sort of intervention that has been described to ensure that
appropriate people are in place to deliver a local health service in an
organisation. If the PCT itself is at fault, the SHA might well have
the ability to intervene. However, when we get to foundation trusts,
the situation is somewhat different. In that situation, Monitor and its
compliance framework are the key criteria, because foundation trusts
are much more independent and they have a greater degree of autonomy.
An intervention in that situation would be much more restricted, so
Monitor would be required to intervene and would have responsibility
for taking the appropriate action.</div>
<a name="09062386000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">A question
then arises of whether, if that action fails, foundation trust status
should be withdrawn. Monitor would have to take a view on that. If
foundation trust status was withdrawn, the foundation trust would move
into the category of being a trust, which could be intervened on by the
Secretary of State or the person appointed by the Secretary of State as
a special trust administrator. That is the straightforward process.
Yes, there are existing powers, but the clause gives the Secretary of
State additional ability to intervene and to appoint special trust
administrators.</div><a name="09062386000239"></a>

cost burden was taken up by the trust, although the contract for the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062386000478"></a>Mike
Penning:</b> This group of amendments addresses the fact that
there is no requirement in the Bill for staff to be consulted before
special administrators are appointed. The Government&#146;s impact
assessment says that it should be a priority to ensure that staff are
engaged in the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column181" />Column number: 181</div>process. Retaining staff and maintaining morale within an organisation
is crucial, but nothing in the Bill indicates that such consultation
would be required before a trust special administrator was appointed.
That is the reason behind these four amendments, and I hope that the
Minister will explain why such a requirement is missing from the
Bill.</div><a name="09062386000246"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062386000479"></a>Mr.
Mike O'Brien:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes a good point. I
entirely agree that staff engagement is a central principle of such a
regime. When such intervention is triggered, it will understandably be
unsettling for staff, so we designed the process to produce a swift
resolution while ensuring that staff are engaged throughout. In Grand
Committee in the other place, my noble Friend Lord Darzi of Denham said
that staff should be engaged throughout the process, and that staff
engagement would be further strengthened by statutory guidance, which
we will produce. With that assurance, I hope that the hon. Gentleman
will withdraw his
amendment.</div><a name="09062386000247"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062386000480"></a>Mike

joking.</div><a name="09062386000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
important group of amendments addresses the fact that the Secretary of
State is ultimately responsible to Parliament, and would require the
Secretary of State to place before Parliament the report on the failing

Parliament or to a scrutiny Committee, such as the Health
Committee.</div><a name="09062386000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
there are problems in the NHS, transparency is vital. I am sure that
you agree, Mr. Key, that it would not be right and proper
for the Secretary of State to have on his desk a trust special
administrator&#146;s report on how bad a situation was when Members
of Parliament for the constituencies involved and, more importantly,
the public and local involvement networks did not have a copy of the
report. The amendments would require the Secretary of State to place

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062386000484"></a>Mr.
Mike O'Brien:</b> In practice, we anticipate that the draft
report will be published and sent to the Secretary of State by the
trust special administrator simultaneously. The Secretary of State will
then lay it in Parliament as 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column182" />Column number: 182</div>soon as is reasonably practicable. The amendment would therefore be
problematic if, for example, the House was not sitting. There are
procedures, but they take some time. However, there would be no reason
in such circumstances for the Secretary of State to delay laying the
report before Parliament, because it will have been
published.</div><a name="09062386000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
TSA would need a good reason to send a draft report prior to
publication to the Secretary of State. For example, they might have to
intervene in a particular way if the Secretary of State needs to be
informed about something that need to be dealt with that could involve
confidential patient information. It might be possible to produce a
draft report, but the aim is for the trust administrator to publish a
broad report and for the Secretary of State to make it available to
Parliament at the earliest appropriate
opportunity.</div><a name="09062386000258"></a>

I still have concerns about why a draft report will not be available
and under what circumstances the Secretary of State would hold it back
from public and parliamentary scrutiny. I said at the outset, however,
that because I would not move some amendments and I was going to listen
to the Secretary of State, I might return to some of my remaining
concerns at a later stage of the Bill. I emphasise again that there is
an absolute necessity for as much transparency as possible, and that
there is also a need for a regime. As yet, we still do not know how

suspension</div><a name="09062386000269"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062386000488"></a>Mr.
Stephen O'Brien:</b> I beg to move amendment 21, in
clause 19, page 23, line 15, at
end insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(1) The
Secretary of State may issue guidance on the suspension of NHS and
other health appointments. These may
include&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">(a) details of
appeals processes for suspended appointees;
and</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">(b) details of
parliamentary
accountability.&#146;.</div><a name="09062386000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me rein in the horse a little. We turn to suspension, but not the
suspension of one&#146;s breath. The clause gives effect to schedule
3, which amends various enactments to provide for the suspension of
non-executive board members. To make it absolutely clear what we are
discussing, the Government already have the power to suspend NHS trust
and PCT non-executives. The clause will extend the power to strategic
health authority non-executives and those of other NHS bodies.
Paragraph 1 of the evidence base mentions social care, and I hope that
the Minister can tell me to which non-executive position that
applies.</div><a name="09062386000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
seems right that the power to suspend should be available as a halfway
house between keeping someone in post and firing them too hastily.
Equally, it must not be abused as a way of threatening a good person
whom the Department does not like or preserving unduly someone who
ought to be sacked. Given the almost pre-Runnymede powers the Bill
looks to bestow on the Secretary of State, amendment 19 would hold the
right hon. Gentleman more accountable for such decisions than the
current legislation
allows.</div><a name="09062386000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
first safeguard is that the suspended person be given details of
appeal, while the second safeguard would be that the Government bring
some parliamentary scrutiny into the process. Obviously, I worry about
their motives in that particular regard. As the explanatory notes make
clear, such action arises from events at the Maidstone and Tunbridge
Wells NHS Trust. In its summary, the regulatory impact assessment said
that the first key non-monetised benefit is maintaining public
confidence. The table at paragraph 12 states that the public perception
that nothing was being done could be damaging to the organisation and
that the first considered monetised cost is public
perception&#151;somewhat tellingly, media handling. I put it to the
Committee that the Government are not legislating to save the blushes
of hospitals, but to help manage the process of public perception and
image for
themselves.</div><a name="09062386000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the explanatory notes state at paragraph 35, the power to suspend will
rightly be devolved to the Appointments Commission. Will the Minister
clarify how the suspension process will, as a matter of practice, work?
Will suspension be on full pay? We must remember that the Appointments
Commission does not yet seem to have succeeded in getting appointments
without political bias. Last year, 8 per cent. of applicants were
affiliated to the Labour party, as were 10 per cent. of appointees,
whereas 4 per cent. of applicants affiliated to the Conservative party
resulted in only 2 per cent. of appointments. We had the whole rather
damning issue about the resignation of the former Minister of Health
from her post at the Department of Health over the appointment of Sir
David Henshaw. It would be somewhat 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column184" />Column number: 184</div>pejorative of me to read into the record the full quote of what she
said, as I dare say all members of the Committee remember it
well.</div><a name="09062386000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">According
to the submission to the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform
Committee, the powers fulfil&#151;although that might be too strong a
word&#151;a commitment in developing the NHS performance regime. The
document was a result of something of a struggle between David
Nicholson and Anna Walker. Baroness Young has now taken on the
responsibility as chairman of the Care Quality Commission, whether it
is the Department or, as it should be, the independent regulator who
has the responsibility for performance management. I hope that the
Minister will explain what role the CQC will have in the suspension
process.</div>
<a name="09062386000275"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062386000489"></a>Mr.
Mike O'Brien:</b> As for suspension, we would have to be in a
position when there was an issue of considerable importance. The
Secretary of State would then delegate his powers of public appointment
to the Appointments Commission, an independent organisation accountable
to the Secretary of State. To ensure that the relevant bodies are ready
for implementation of the powers, the Appointments Commission&#146;s
draft guidance was included in the consultation exercise when
introducing new powers of suspension, which ran from July to October
last year. An updated version was published with the
Government&#146;s response in January this
year.</div><a name="09062386000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
guidance set out how the Appointments Commission will manage
resignations, termination of appointments and suspensions of
non-executives lawfully and in the best interests of the public, and
respecting the rights of the office holders. I was asked whether
suspension would be on full remuneration, and the answer is yes. I was
also asked about the process for suspending senior appointments. The
Secretary of State will delegate his power to the Appointments
Commission. Cases would usually be referred to the commission by the
person to whom the appointee is accountable for their duty in bringing
evidence to its attention. In the referrer&#146;s opinion when it
does not lead to the suspension of the appointee from office, the
commission&#146;s role will be to work with the referrer as necessary
to establish whether there is a case for suspension. In the case of a
vice-chair or other member, the referrer would usually be the chair of
the organisation. In the case of the chairperson, the commission would
have to take a view. We would expect any body with which the commission
is not involved to follow good
practice.</div><a name="09062386000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">Essentially,
the process of dealing with such suspensions has been published. We
want to ensure that the Appointments Commission is operating within the
procedures it has set down publicly. When difficulty arises, a key
requirement is that public confidence in the NHS must be maintained.
That confidence must always remain one of the key priorities for those
who run the NHS in ensuring that such issues are dealt with. In the
end, it is the taxpayer who funds the NHS and to whom the NHS is
ultimately responsible as taxpayers and
patients.</div><a name="09062386000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
CQC&#146;s role will depend on whether there is a need for a quality
examination of the way in which the organisation involved operates. If
the issue is financial, the CQC&#146;s involvement will be limited.
If it relates to patient care, as in a recent case, the role of the CQC
or its equivalent will be important.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062386000491"></a>Mr.
Stephen O'Brien:</b> I beg to move amendment 22, in
schedule 3, page 42, line 13, after
Ministers&#146;, insert &#145;after
consultation&#146;.</div><a name="09062386000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
galloping through can be quite catching, Mr. Key. However, I
am afraid that a number of amendments have been tabled to schedule 3.
We will try to rattle through them, but from page 42 of the Bill, there
is a lot of detail that must be looked at
carefully.</div><a name="09062386000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments on this schedule relate to the terms of office of members.
We want to explore aspects of the new suspension powers and how they
will bite on various bodies. What consultation does the Minister plan
to undertake before making these regulations? Why will this power be
created through regulations in relation to this Bill and not the other
Acts that are listed in the schedule? Will the Minister confirm which
bodies the power applies to, other than the Commission on Human
Medicines?</div><a name="09062386000286"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062386000492"></a>Mr.
Mike O'Brien:</b> The amendment would place a duty on the
Minister to undertake consultation prior to any ancillary provisions
being made by regulations relating to the Commission on Human
Medicines, committees or expert advisory groups. The provision extends
beyond the commission to various committees and expert advisory groups.
The Secretary of State will work jointly with the Minister for Health,
Social Services and Public Safety in the Northern Ireland Executive to
enact any regulations. It is important that they have the flexibility
to react swiftly to changing circumstances. Consultation on the
technical detail of this essentially administrative process would take
time and could delay essential
appointments.</div><a name="09062386000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">Formal
consultation on the proposed suspension powers and processes has
already been undertaken. The devolved Administrations and the
non-executive communities support the proposals. I hope that the hon.
Gentleman will withdraw the amendment because the consultation on the
processes has already taken place and has secured
support.</div><a name="09062386000288"></a>

amendment 24, in
schedule 3, page 44, line 42, at

Secretary of State may by regulations make provision for compensation
if the suspension is revoked under sub-paragraph

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062386000496"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> Amendment 23 would make provision for
compensation if a suspension from the Alcohol Education and Research
Council is revoked by the Secretary of State, and amendment 24 would
make a similar provision in relation to the Human Fertilisation and
Embryology Authority.</div>
<a name="09062386000293"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments would prevent the Secretary of State from wielding his power
lightly. An improper suspension could not only bring unnecessary
heartache to a hard-working non-executives and those around them, but
it could be detrimental to the boards that they serve. I reserve a
particular concern about the HFEA. Given the failure of the Government
to give a free vote on that legislation last year, I am concerned that
the Secretary of State is able to hang the threat of suspension over
non-executive members of the authority with whom he might disagree.
Obviously, in the rare case that the suspension is justified but
revoked, no compensation would be a suitable option, hence leaving the
Secretary of State free to make
regulations.</div>
<a name="09062386000294"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062386000497"></a>Mr.
Mike O'Brien:</b> A decision to suspend an individual is
intended to be a neutral act taken to further an investigation and does
not indicate grounds for permanently removing an appointee from office.
That would be determined through a formal termination process, so
evidence would have to be sought, an investigation undertaken and a
decision
made.</div><a name="09062386000295"></a><div class="hs_Para">Allowing
compensation payments to be made in such circumstances would be
inconsistent with the sentiment of the proposed suspension policy. The
policy is already accepted within the NHS and indeed, such a provision
would probably have implications for wider employment law. When someone
has been suspended on full remuneration, it does not indicate guilt or
produce a requirement for compensation to be paid.</div>
<a name="09062386000296"></a><div class="hs_Para">Suspended
appointees of the HFEA would continue to receive any remuneration to
which they are entitled throughout the period of suspension, but
members of the AERC are not currently remunerated. The Secretary of
State would have to take action in an appropriate, formal investigatory
way and reach an appropriate determination in any investigation. There
are protections within the process that enable any abuse by a Secretary
of State or anyone else to be dealt with
appropriately.</div>
<a name="09062386000297"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062386000498"></a>Mr.
Stephen O'Brien:</b> The Minister is of course completely
right that a suspension is intended, and must be seen, to be a neutral
act, and it must always be presumed that someone will be retained and
confirmed in their position as much as it is presumed that they might
lose their position as a result of a period of suspension in which they
have had an opportunity to answer questions that might be put to them.
Indeed, they might find that there is no question to answer. Therefore,
with those assurances, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09062386000298"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062386000501"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> Amendment 183 would introduce further safeguards
against the Secretary of State&#146;s power and bring the matter
within the ambit of parliamentary scrutiny. The Bill gives the
Secretary of State the power to suspend a non-executive using the same
grounds on which the power to terminate employment rests. Those
grounds, which are outlined in paragraph 5 of schedule 1 to
the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990, are that a
person</div>
<a name="09062386000360"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;(a)
has been absent from meetings of the Authority for six consecutive
months or longer without the permission of the Authority, or...(b)
has become bankrupt or made an arrangement with his creditors, or, in
Scotland, has had his estate sequestrated or has granted a trust deed
for or entered into an arrangement with his creditors, or...(c) is
unable or unfit to discharge the functions of a
member&#148;.</div><a name="09062386000302"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraphs
(a) and (b) are obviously discrete categories, but paragraph (c) is
more subjective. It therefore seems fitting that suspension on the
ground of paragraph (c) should be put before Parliament.</div>
<a name="09062386000303"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 30
refers to the suspension of monitors and non-executives in the same
terms. Under paragraph 2(2)(b) of schedule 8 to the NHS Act
2006, the Secretary of State can fire a person on the grounds of
incapacity or misbehaviour. If an individual is fired, the Secretary of
State would have to consider whether those grounds would stand up in
court. Suspension is much less likely to end up in the courts, so the
amendment seeks to mitigate the breadth of the power by giving
Parliament a role. The question is how it would have such a role. That
could be a matter under the ambit of a form such as the Select
Committee.</div>
<a name="09062386000304"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062386000502"></a>Mr.
Mike O'Brien:</b> I have some concerns about the amendment.
There may be personal circumstances, perhaps ill health or other
issues, that we should have cognisance of when making decisions about
whether statements should be made to Parliament. Details would be in
the public domain under all circumstances where a public employee of a
body accountable to the Secretary of State is suspended; the awareness
of that suspension would become public. It is not necessary for a
separate statement to be made to Parliament when a public employee is
suspended from monitor or the HFEA. However, we need to consider
matters case by case to identify the most appropriate way of passing on
information that ought to be communicated to Parliament. It is not
usual for statements to be made under these circumstances. It is
difficult to know, if personal issues were involved, whether the
Minister would be able to detail those. In some cases it might be
appropriate to do that, in others it may not. Given the variability of
cases and the circumstances that apply, we should not be too
prescriptive about the way in which matters should be dealt with. To 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column188" />Column number: 188</div>some extent&#151;and much as it may go against the grain&#151;this
is an area where there must be an element of trust that the Ministers
and Secretary of State will make appropriate decisions about how much a
particular individual&#146;s circumstances can be put into the public
domain. With those reassurances that we intend Parliament to be as
informed as it should appropriately be, I hope the hon. Gentleman will
withdraw his amendment.</div>
<a name="09062386000305"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062386000503"></a>Mr.
Stephen O'Brien:</b> I am grateful. I acknowledge that the
Minister recognises that this is tricky territory that carries with it
the potential sensitivities of human circumstances. He talked about
that in terms of illness, but it also interrelates&#151;if there is a
parliamentary opportunity&#151;with operation of the sub judice rule.
That may or may not be invoked at that point, depending on whether
there is something before the courts, or indicated to be.</div>
<a name="09062386000306"></a><div class="hs_Para">To some
degree, the thinking that lay behind the amendment came from
frustration about the accountability and timing that arose as a result
of wanting to discuss what happened at Maidstone and Tunbridge
Wells&#151;particularly in relation to the former chief executive
Rose Gibb. That became a subject that was impossible to question, given
there were such deep anxieties, not least for the patients and their
families who were in the catchment area for that hospitals trust. The
thinking was to try to find a way of making sure there was an
opportunity to air some of the issues, despite suspension and the
operation of the sub judice rule under &#147;Erskine May&#148;, and
such things. It has been useful to air the amendment, but I do not wish
to press it. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09062386000307"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062386000506"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:</b> Briefly, amendment 27 breaks the convention that
the legislation carries the Secretary of State as the actor, but, as
has been confirmed, action is devolved to the appointments commission.
This part of the schedule addresses the Appointments Commission itself.
Given the power the appointment has, and the Government&#146;s
tendency to meddle in appointments&#151;as we have argued&#151;it
is even more essential that the Secretary of State is kept on a tight
leash. I hope the Minister can tell the Committee how the Appointments
Commission appoints its own non-executives and the Secretary of
State&#146;s role in that.</div>
<a name="09062386000311"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 26
is merely a probing amendment to find out what happens in the,
admittedly, unlikely but not implausible event that all the
non-executives are suspended.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column189" />Column number: 189</div><a name="09062386000312"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062386000507"></a>Mr.
Mike O'Brien:</b> Suspending the chairman of a board or the
entire non-executive team is a drastic action. In such circumstances,
it is essential that the Secretary of State can provide for someone to
lead the commission during such a challenging period.
Schedule 4 to the Health Act 2006 already allows the
Secretary of State to appoint non-executives to the commission, so
amendment 26 is not necessary.</div>
<a name="09062386000313"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the chair
alone were suspended, the full expectation is that the vice-chair
appointed by the commission&#146;s board would, in most cases, be
well placed to remain as vice-chair. Where that is not the case, it
would not be appropriate for the commission to elect its own
vice-chair, even with the benefit of the Secretary of State&#146;s
advice.</div>
<a name="09062386000314"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although the
commission is an impartial organisation, it must remain accountable to
the Secretary of State, who is accountable to Parliament. That requires
that the Secretary of State has the power to make provision for
appointing the leadership of commission&#146;s board.</div>
<a name="09062386000315"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is the
way in which we would seek to proceed. With those reassurances, I hope
that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the

member&#148;.</div><a name="09062386000324"></a><div class="hs_Para">Similarly,
amendment 29 refers to the provision in schedule 3, paragraph 11, to
replace paragraph 5(d) of schedule 6 to the Act, which makes provision
for regulations regarding similar points.</div>
<a name="09062386000325"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
the Minister can explain why those changes have been made. Given that
the Act is from 2006, it is strange that the Government did not get it
right the first time.</div>

<a name="09062386000327"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill
replaces paragraphs 9(d) of schedule 2 and 5(d) of schedule
6 to the 2006 Act, both of which refer only

authorities. The replacement paragraphs include chairs, vice-chairs and
other members.</div>

amendments would serve only to duplicate the regulation-making

Stephen O'Brien:</b> On the basis that the Minister has said
that the Government are not infallible and that he has tried to put a
human face on them, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062386000514"></a>Mr.
Stephen O'Brien:</b> I beg to move amendment 143, in
schedule 3, page 47, line 35, at
end insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">&#145;(d) In
assessing whether there are or may be grounds to remove him from office
under paragraph (b) the Secretary of State may
consult&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel3">(i) the Care
Quality Commission;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel3">(ii)
Strategic Health Authorities;
and</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel3">(iii) the Audit
Commission&#146;.</div><a name="09062386000332"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment would balance the Secretary of State&#146;s powers
regarding Monitor&#146;s non-executives. Given the
Government&#146;s swings on foundation trusts, we need to ensure that
we understand the issues carefully, as my hon. Friend the Member for
Hemel Hempstead has highlighted elsewhere.</div>
<a name="09062386000333"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
would allow the Secretary of State to consult the other players in the
regulation of the NHS&#151;the Care Quality Commission, strategic
health authorities and the Audit Commission&#151;before taking action
against Monitor&#146;s non-executive
directors.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09062386000515"></a>Mr.
Mike O'Brien:</b> Suspension would be used only on rare
occasions, when serious concerns raised about performance or conduct
required further investigation. The Secretary of State intends to
delegate his power to suspend members of Monitor to the Appointments
Commission. The commission is independent and expert, and it has
established a clear policy for determining whether there is a case for
suspension.</div>
<a name="09062386000335"></a><div class="hs_Para">Where there
are allegations of incapacity or misbehaviour, the commission will
undertake a swift initial investigation to assess whether are there
sufficient grounds to bring suspension proceedings. The commission will
therefore take the action. Its chair could use emergency powers to
suspend someone following consultation with her executive or, in her
absence, the deputy chief executive, and with at least two of the
commission&#146;s appointed commissioners.</div>
