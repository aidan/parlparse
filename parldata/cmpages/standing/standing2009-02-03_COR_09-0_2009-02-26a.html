<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022646000219"></a>David
Howarth:</b> The Committee now turns to the data-sharing
provisions of the Bill. Later we shall discuss the highly controversial
clause 152, which grants extraordinarily broad powers to Ministers to
allow data sharing. Before that, however, there is an issue of great
importance to the Information Commissioner that has not received as
much publicity: the extent of the powers of the Information
Commissioner to regulate the holders of data. It is often said that
information is power. That starts with data; data are, to some extent,
potential power. The regulation and proper use of data and upholding
the safeguards in the Data Protection Act 1998 and the eight principles
of data protection are important functions of the Information
Commissioner.</div><a name="09022646000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
151 helps the Information Commissioner by introducing assessment
notices. An assessment notice is a method whereby the commissioner can
require information from holders of data to ensure that they are
complying with the principles of data protection. There are, however,
two problems with the clause&#151;problems that the Information
Commissioner has pointed out. First, the power to issue an assessment
notice covers only the public sector. Secondly, there appears to be a
gap in the clause, in that it does not provide for any enforcement
power.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column337" />Column number: 337</div><a name="09022646000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 105
would remove the restriction whereby assessment notices apply only to
Government Departments and public authorities. It should be removed
because the power that holding vast amounts of data gives is not
restricted to the public sector. We have only to think about Google,
Tesco or the banks to realise that private organisations hold vast
amounts of data, which could be misused, either deliberately or, as is
more likely, accidentally. People who are locked out of their own bank
accounts and unable to purchase utilities from privatised utility
companies are in as bad a position as people whose data are interfered
with in a way that removes them from, say, benefits
lists.</div><a name="09022646000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
powers granted to the commissioner should apply to those vast private
sector organisations as well. Over the past generation, we have seen a
lot of privatisation of public services or at least contracting out of
public services to either the private or voluntary sector. Under the
clause, those organisations would not be covered because they are not
public authorities or Government
Departments.</div><a name="09022646000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Information Commissioner points out that the majority of complaints
about violations of the principles of data protection are not directly
against Departments or public authorities, but the rest of the economy
in the private or voluntary sector. Amendments 105 and 106 would deal
with that
problem.</div><a name="09022646000028"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09022646000220"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Kidney</b> (Stafford) (Lab): I am acting in the spirit
of finding out information rather than putting across a point of view.
I usually expect the Opposition to be against interferences with
private businesses, except on a warrant&#151;as under existing
law&#151;and against imposing new burdens on businesses, yet the
provision would put a new burden on them. Given that we have all
received an e-mail from the CBI saying that it is strongly opposed to
the amendment, why do the Opposition want to go down that
road?</div><a name="09022646000029"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022646000221"></a>David
Howarth:</b> I thought that I explained precisely why we
should go down that road. In fact, I have always supported extending
the scope of the Human Rights Act 1998 to organisations that run
contracted-out public services. They should count as public
authorities. I do not understand why the Government have constantly
opposed attempts to extend the scope of the Human Rights Act, as put
forward by the hon. Member for Hendon (Mr.
Dismore).</div><a name="09022646000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
for the other part of the question of the hon. Member for Stafford,
that is probably better directed at the Conservative party rather than
the Liberal
Democrats.</div><a name="09022646000031"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09022646000222"></a><b class="B">Mr.
George Howarth</b> (Knowsley, North and Sefton, East) (Lab):
It is not the party of
Gladstone.</div><a name="09022646000032"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022646000223"></a>David
Howarth:</b> In reference to the painting that hangs on the
wall behind the Chair, the right hon. Gentleman points out from a
sedentary position that perhaps the Liberal Democrats are not the party
of Gladstone, but they are certainly the party of Lloyd George and
Asquith.</div><a name="09022646000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second issue is the power of the Information Commissioner to enforce
his or her will on assessment notices. There is a gap in the clause in
respect of enforcement. Oddly, there is a power to appeal, but why 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column338" />Column number: 338</div>should anyone appeal when nothing will happen to them if they do not
bother to comply with an assessment notice? The commissioner does not
intend heavy-handed interference with organisations under the
provisions. Therefore, the best approach to inserting a sanction for
non-compliance would be to go down the freedom of information route and
that proposed by the Government with regard to the powers of the
Electoral Commission under the Political Parties and Elections
Bill.</div><a name="09022646000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
an assessment notice is made and its subject does not comply, there is
no immediate sanction. The commissioner goes to the court. We believe
that it should be the county court, but are open to other suggestions
on the type of court. The court then decides whether the assessment
notice was properly issued and whether there was a reasonable excuse
for not complying with the assessment notice. If the court decides for
the commissioner on both issues, it orders the subject of the
assessment notice to comply with it. If there is no compliance, it will
become contempt of court. That is a fair and balanced way in which to
enforce the assessment notices. I am open to other suggestions on how
to introduce sanctions, but it is pointless to introduce assessment
notices with no sanctions for
non-compliance.</div><a name="09022646000035"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09022646000224"></a><b class="B">Alun
Michael</b> (Cardiff, South and Penarth) (Lab/Co-op): I am a
member of the Justice Committee, which has recently considered data
protection in some detail, although I have taken an interest in data
protection over many years. One problem is that we end up with
complexity upon complexity when we try to achieve what we need&#151;a
balanced arrangement, in which people make a judgment. The problem is
that when something goes wrong with data sharing, people either say,
&#147;We shouldn&#146;t share anything. We should have greater
restrictions,&#148; or, as was the case in Soham, that everything
should be shared without delay. In that case, there was a technical
problem of systems talking to systems, rather than a problem of data
sharing, but the issue is the way in which things were
perceived.</div>
<a name="09022646000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">Such swings
in general public debate are a real problem in dealing with the issues
before us. We should try to avoid over-complicating the legislation. At
the end of the day, a judgment must be made about sharing data: what is
in the public interest, what is against the individual interest and how
do we balance the two? We will run into great problems if we lurch from
saying that not sharing is the safer option to saying that sharing is
the safer
option.</div><a name="09022646000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
my amendments, I want to tease out a number of points about
Ministers&#146; intentions. I hope that we will get some clarity
about those intentions and perhaps get an undertaking to clear up some
of the drafting and remove one or two of the anomalies.</div>
<a name="09022646000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
106, which has a number of signatures to it, is intended to tease out
why the assessment notice process should apply only to public bodies.
The hon. Member for Cambridge has expressed concerns about that, and I
share them primarily for one reason. The line between public and
private bodies&#151;and, indeed, charities&#151;is no longer as
clear as it was. Many private companies do an enormous amount of work,
control an enormous amount of data and serve the public sector. I would
require a bit of convincing that the burden of compliance, which is set
out in the present clauses, should apply only to the public
sector.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column339" />Column number: 339</div><a name="09022646000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">My response to
the intervention by my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford is that we
should try to avoid adding to the burdens on both public and private
bodies, as well as charities and non-governmental organisations.
However, where a burden is needed in the public interest&#151;to
protect the public or individuals&#151;it should apply fairly across
the sectors. We should not imply that we can return to the old
situation, in which it was clear that the public sector could be
regulated and that there was no overlap with other
sectors.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022646000225"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> Does my right hon. Friend foresee there being a
label saying &#147;public interest contract&#148; and, therefore,
that the assessment notice process would apply, or does he expect there
to be a blanket imposition on all public and private
bodies?</div>
<a name="09022646000041"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022646000226"></a>Alun
Michael:</b> There are two points there. First, I am sure that
the Minister will tell us what mechanism will ensure that there is no
way in which information can go outside the ambit of the legislation if
a private body or charity is handling it on behalf of a public body. I
would want some reassurance that that will be dealt with
equitably.</div>
<a name="09022646000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other
point is that a vast amount of information that affects the public and
individuals is now handled and owned by the private sector, including
financial information and information about the way in which people
take personal, commercial and purchasing decisions. At one time, an
enormous amount of information would have been only in the public
sector because it was gathered by or on behalf of authorities, or
because the public sector undertook surveys and research, but that
information is now very much part of the private sector&#146;s
day-to-day activities.</div>
<a name="09022646000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">To put the
other side of the argument back to my hon. Friend, if we feel that
there is a burden on businesses&#151;that we are imposing a
bureaucratic burden that is not productive or proportionate&#151;we
should ask whether it is right to put such a burden on the public
sector, too. There is question of
proportionality.</div>
<a name="09022646000191"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.15
am</div><a name="09022646000044"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09022646000227"></a><b class="B">Jenny
Willott</b> (Cardiff, Central) (LD): Does the right hon.
Gentleman agree that the main burden is compliance with the Data
Protection Act 1998? Nobody is querying whether private sector
organisations should comply with the Act when they hold the data to
which he referred. A company or voluntary sector body that complies
will not have to deal with the bureaucracy about which the hon. Member
for Stafford is concerned&#151;it would not be an issue if they were
complying with enforcement
notices.</div><a name="09022646000045"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022646000228"></a>Alun
Michael:</b> The hon. Lady makes a good point. That is why I
am increasingly concerned about the complexity of the requirement. I
dealt with data protection and criminal justice when local authorities
and the police were not sharing information about, for instance,
disruptive and difficult tenants and people who needed to be relocated,
and their housing requirements. The law was that it was acceptable to
share the information to prevent or reduce crime, but data protection
officers, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column340" />Column number: 340</div>and local authority and police lawyers, would say, &#147;If in doubt,
don&#146;t share.&#148; That is not acceptable. It is a simple
principle. People have to make a judgment and balance the requirements.
The problem with increasing the complexity of the requirements is that
it gets people away from the necessity of making such judgments. If
there is a need to have specific requirements, it ought to be equitable
and as simple as possible, and to apply in all circumstances. We should
not pretend that there is a clear line between public and private
bodies.</div><a name="09022646000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government commissioned work that the Justice Committee looked at with
interest. I want to examine specifically the work by Sir Mark Walport
and Richard Thomas&#151;the hon. Member for Cambridge has already
talked about the views of the Information Commissioner. In his
submission to the Committee, Sir Mark made some telling points. He
said:</div><a name="09022646000178"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;There
is no doubt the Information Commissioner&#146;s powers need
strengthening&#151;as we concluded in the Report, &#145;there is
strong evidence that his bite needs sharpening&#146;...but I am
concerned that this is not yet achieved in the draft
legislation.&#148;</div><a name="09022646000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that the Minister can reassure us about the intentions of the
measure. Of course, there is still time to improve the drafting of the
Bill as it continues its passage. The debate was going on right up to
the publication of the legislation, so I would be grateful if the
Minister could reassure me that the drafting can still be
improved.</div><a name="09022646000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
of Sir Mark Walport&#146;s points is in relation to the draft
provisions on assessments. He
said:</div><a name="09022646000179"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;As
we stated in the report, distinguishing between public, private and
voluntary sectors makes little sense, especially as more information is
shared across sectors whose boundary lines are forever
shifting.&#148;</div><a name="09022646000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
other words, delineating the lines is not only more difficult now, but
it will become more difficult in future. He also said:</div>
<a name="09022646000180"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I
would argue that the provisions relating to the Assessment Notice
should be extended to include organisations outside the public
sector...There are also no meaningful sanctions for failure to
comply with the requirements of an Assessment Notice: this needs
strengthening in order for it to be taken
seriously.&#148;</div><a name="09022646000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">His
final point is particularly telling&#151;it relates to the dangers
and the simple principle of balancing the public interest and the
interests of private individuals when it comes to data protection. He
said:</div><a name="09022646000181"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Data
sharing is shrouded in confusion, and public confidence is evaporating.
I hope that, as a Committee, you will be able to ensure that there is a
legislative mechanism that ensures greater scrutiny and allows
beneficial data sharing with appropriate safeguards in a transparent,
consistent and proportionate manner. In particular, I encourage you to
ensure that the Information Commissioner&#146;s powers are fully
strengthened.&#148;</div><a name="09022646000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
work of the Information Commissioner has improved immeasurably during
Richard Thomas&#146;s time in office, which still has a few months to
run. He has introduced a degree of balance and clarity. Much of the
lack of confidence in the public domain is due to the confusion in
media coverage rather than being a genuine concern. There have been
improvements in data handling. It is clear that improvement is still
needed in the culture within many Departments, as well as an
understanding from the top to the bottom of how things apply. I suspect
that it is not a high priority for permanent secretaries and director
generals within Departments to understand that their leadership is
important in setting the culture for the whole Department.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column341" />Column number: 341</div><a name="09022646000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">My new
clauses, in a way similar to the amendments tabled by the right hon.
Member for Knowsley, North and Sefton, East, aim to probe the question
of how the provision should be enforced; I am sure that the Minister
would agree that it should. I have suggested that an application could
be made to the county court or, alternatively, to the Information
Tribunal, which would mean that non-compliance would become contempt of
court, a suggestion that appears in one of the other Opposition
amendments.</div>
<a name="09022646000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">I believe
that the Minister should be in a position to deal with such genuine and
reasonable concerns during the Bill&#146;s passage, and that we
should be able to get back to the principles of keeping it simple and
making clear the necessity for a balanced judgment. The Information
Commissioner, Mr. Richard Thomas, said in his comments on
the Bill:</div>
<a name="09022646000182"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
would prefer it...if the legislation made it clear that
organisations benefiting from an information-sharing order must take
the code of practice into account. As it stands, there is no direct
link between the order and the code of
practice.&#148;</div><a name="09022646000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is my final point of great concern. It should not be the situation that
an information-sharing order can lead an organisation to disregard the
terms and requirements of the code of practice. The code of practice
might be deeply embedded in some organisations&#146; work, and they
might observe it in pursuing the information-sharing order, but I
suspect that that might not always be the case. It would be of great
benefit to everybody if information-sharing orders also included a
requirement to observe the good practice with which the guidance will
concern itself. Making that link in legislation would greatly
strengthen the
Bill.</div><a name="09022646000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
discussing the question of applying the measures beyond the public
sector, I quote the Information
Commissioner:</div><a name="09022646000183"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
need to be able to serve notices on anyone who may hold relevant
information, sometimes to identify who the responsible data controller
is and sometimes to collect evidence of
breaches.&#148;</div><a name="09022646000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
other words, there is a need for greater transparency across the
boundaries between the public, private and voluntary sectors. In his
comments, the Information Commissioner also referred to the danger of
too clear a delineation:</div>
<a name="09022646000184"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Private
and third sector bodies frequently carry out work for public sector
ones. It is common for charities, for example, to carry out functions
on behalf of local government. As it stands, we could inspect the local
authority, but not the
charity.&#148;</div><a name="09022646000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am more concerned that he should be able to inspect the private
companies that often hold major contracts. Those are of as much concern
as the data held by public departments. Therefore, I hope that that
power of the Information Commissioner will be
extended.</div><a name="09022646000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not believe that we can ever turn back the clock and avoid the
complex issues of data retention and data sharing. They are with us for
the future, and they will get ever more complex. We need to keep clear
the principle that the balance must always be between the public
interest and the interest of those individuals whose data might be
shared. It is important that that clear principle is not hidden in a
lot of complexity. People holding data have the responsibility to make
those judgments, and they cannot escape
it.</div>
<a name="09022646000059"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09022646000229"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Henry Bellingham</b> (North-West Norfolk) (Con): As the hon.
Member for Cambridge has pointed out, the key to the clause is to give
the commissioner more 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column342" />Column number: 342</div>power over data controllers to enter premises, to view data and to talk
to key people, all of which will be brought about by assessment
notices.</div><a name="09022646000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Bill relates only to public bodies, and private, charitable or
voluntary bodies are excluded, which  is an omission because
private and voluntary bodies collect a great deal of data. In fact,
looking forward to the next clause, which we shall discuss later today,
designated authorities will have the power to share data with other
private bodies and the public sector, and vice versa.</div>
<a name="09022646000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">I take on
board the point made by the right hon. Member for Cardiff, South and
Penarth about the ever-greater involvement of the private sector with
Departments, public agencies and Government bodies. I shall give two
examples of Departments that use the private sector on a significant
scale. First, the Crown Prosecution Service and the Solicitor-General
have a large contract with what was LogicaCMG, covering the provision,
support and maintenance of hardware and software applications used by
the CPS, including management of a number of large databases&#151;for
example, the witness management system and the graduated fee scheme for
counsel. However, Logica is a private sector company, which obviously
handles a great deal of data in that Department&#151;I have mentioned
that example because it is relevant to the Ministry of Justice.
Secondly, the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform
owned 165 databases on 1 June last year, 75 of which were maintained by
departmental staff and 90 of which were maintained by external
companies.</div><a name="09022646000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
examples give us some idea of Her Majesty&#146;s Government&#146;s
view on the private sector, which means that more and more private
sector organisations and businesses are storing our data. The data
belong to taxpayers&#151;our constituents&#151;which is why the
commissioners should have the power to issue assessment notices on
private organisations. In fact, the right hon. Gentleman might have
pointed out that the recent House of Lords Constitutional Affairs
Committee report made that recommendation in paragraph 238. He has put
forward a strong argument for amendments 105 and 107&#151;amendment
106 is consequential. Our amendments achieve almost exactly the same
outcome as those tabled by the Liberal
Democrats.</div><a name="09022646000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
know what the CBI note says, and I have read the letter by Matthew Fell
and the head of knowledge economy at the CBI, Sarah Draper. They say
that they are concerned about giving extra powers to the commissioner
to search the private sector without a warrant&#151;to enter premises
where there is no suspicion or evidence of wrongdoing without any need
to justify such intrusive measures. That is going a bit too far, and I
think that they are unnecessarily concerned. They have to trust the
commissioner and his team to use common
sense.</div><a name="09022646000064"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022646000230"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> Will the hon. Gentleman explain why he, as a
Conservative, is not concerned that the notice would permit entry of
premises without a warrant? I have been on many Bills when Conservative
Members have argued that it is important that there should not be entry
without a warrant. In fact, I even saw a Conservative amendment to part
1 of the Bill about senior coroners having to get a warrant before
entering premises.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column343" />Column number: 343</div><a name="09022646000065"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022646000231"></a>Mr.
Bellingham:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes a perfectly good
point. I am an arch-deregulator, and I could name a number of Bills on
which I have championed the cause of the CBI. However, when one is
close to an organisation, such as the CBI, which I have been in the
past, that gives one the right from time to time to disagree with
it.</div><a name="09022646000177"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent"><b class="B"><a name="09022646000232"></a>David
Howarth:</b> It is worth pointing out that there is no such
suggestion of entry being forced in any way. The assessment notice
process does not allow entry to be made by the commissioner&#146;s
agents; all it does is ask for that entry. We suggest that, if entry is
refused, the commissioner should be able to get a court order, which is
the precise procedure that the Government suggested for the electoral
commissioner when dealing with similar notices under the Political
Parties and Elections Bill. The Government and I think that that system
is more protective of the rights of the individual than the warrant
procedure.</div><a name="09022646000192"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.30
am</div><a name="09022646000066"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022646000233"></a>Mr.
Bellingham:</b> In theory, entry could be made without a
warrant, but in practice it would be on a voluntary basis, if the firm
agrees. However, if it did not agree, and insisted on the
commissioner&#146;s personnel not entering, the chances are that the
matter would go to court, as the hon. Gentleman pointed out. I think,
therefore, that safeguards are in place. On this occasion, I must
disagree with the
CBI.</div><a name="09022646000067"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022646000234"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> We have talked a lot about voluntary entry, but
proposed new section 41A(3)
reads:</div><a name="09022646000185"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;An
assessment notice is a notice which requires the data controller
to...permit the Commissioner to enter any specified
premises&#148;.</div><a name="09022646000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is not voluntary. I understand the argument that there is no sanction,
but the provision is not
voluntary.</div><a name="09022646000069"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022646000235"></a>Mr.
Bellingham:</b> In practice, the Information Commissioner will
not send his personnel into firms in the hon. Gentleman&#146;s, my or
any other constituency, having not held lengthy discussions and gone
through the correct protocol. We must trust the organisation to behave
in a way that is proportional, sensitive and appropriate in the
circumstances, bearing in mind the Government&#146;s commitment to
lessen the burdens on
business.</div><a name="09022646000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall move on to the next part of the amendment group. The clause needs
proper teeth and sanctions. Amendment 107, tabled by the hon. Member
for Cambridge, which is very similar to our amendment 355,
would establish in the Bill that deliberate non-compliance with any
assessment notice, and refusal to co-operate under any circumstances,
will be treated as &#147;contempt of court&#148;. The Bill needs
teeth, and although his amendment goes slightly further than ours,
amendment 355 would do roughly the same. Will the Minister comment on
that? What is the point of the clause handing the commissioner extra
powers if no sanctions are in place? Under our amendment 373, when, or
if, a data controller knowingly, or recklessly, makes a false
statement, it would be deemed a failure to comply. That is fair enough.
At the moment, the Bill is not clear on that point. We would put that
clarity in the Bill.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column344" />Column number: 344</div><a name="09022646000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">Surprisingly,
our amendments 364 and 365, relating to schedule 18 and the power to
require information, are in this group, so I shall quickly deal with
them. Obviously, that relates to section 43 of the Data Protection Act
1998. Amendment 364 would leave out paragraph 6(2) of
schedule 18 and
insert</div><a name="09022646000186"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
subsection (1)...he may serve the data controller, or a data
processor, with a notice...requiring the data controller, or data
processor, to furnish the Commissioner with specified information
relating to the request or to compliance with the
principles.&#148;</div>
<a name="09022646000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 365
reads:</div>
<a name="09022646000187"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;&#145;data
processor&#146; refers to a third party handling data on behalf
of...government...or...a public authority designated for
the purpose of this
section&#148;.</div><a name="09022646000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
would make it crystal clear that information notices can be served on
anyone storing relevant data, and obviously it would cover third
parties handling data on behalf of Government Departments and public
authorities. I hope that the Minister agrees that those two modest
amendments are sensible. Perhaps she will consider accepting
them.</div><a name="09022646000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 32, which we tabled, is important, because it would remove the
immunity from prosecution enjoyed by Government Departments. The Bill
is not sending the right message. The Government do not have a good
record on handling, storing and dealing with confidential data. I will
not go into a huge amount of detail because I do not want to embarrass
the Government, but there is a long list of examples of different
Government Departments that have lost relevant data. We have had
appalling losses of data from the Home Office, the Ministry of Defence,
and not so much from the Ministry of Justice but certainly from the
Department for Communities and Local Government and the Department for
Culture, Media and Sport. Subsequent inquiries often reveal lax
security procedures and a lack of proper chains of command. Those
matters are often dealt with by quite junior civil servants. There is a
lack of any proper sanction in place. The protection of our data should
be taken a lot more seriously. There is a need for proper
accountability. We need to include in the Bill a very strong signal
that cavalier attitudes towards personal privacy will not be
tolerated.</div><a name="09022646000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is a recent precedent in the Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate
Homicide Act 2007, which states that Crown bodies can be prosecuted for
offences of corporate manslaughter. I will not make too direct a
parallel, but that removed Government immunity in one particular area.
There is a need for immunity to be removed in the data protection area
as well. It will send a strong signal.</div>
<a name="09022646000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am aware
that I might be making a rod for the back of some of my colleagues as
we prepare for government, but I do not mind because we must send a
strong signal. I hope that the Minister agrees that the
Government&#146;s record needs to improve. She can go among her
ministerial colleagues and be a champion of constituents who want their
privacy and data properly looked after. She can say to her colleagues
that if there is a lax situation and cavalier attitudes leading to loss
of data in their Departments, those Departments will have to be
properly
accountable.</div><a name="09022646000077"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09022646000236"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Edward Garnier</b> (Harborough) (Con): My hon. Friend will
remember that during the deliberations on the Criminal Justice and
Immigration Bill&#151;the last 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column345" />Column number: 345</div>Criminal Justice Bill that the Government brought forward out of a total
of about 64 or 65 that we have had to deal with over the past 10
years&#151;a new clause or amendment was tabled that attempted to
provide a similar sanction for the reckless loss of private data by
Government agents. Unfortunately the Government did not think that that
was an attractive idea. I suspect that my hon. Friend will disagree
with
that.</div><a name="09022646000078"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022646000237"></a>Mr.
Bellingham:</b> I am grateful to my hon. and learned
Friend&#151;he is absolutely right. At the eleventh hour, in the
House of Lords, the Government agreed with some changes to that Bill.
My hon. and learned Friend pushed it very hard in Committee. Their
lordships introduced amendments to the Data Protection Act 1998 that
gave the Information Commissioner the power to issue monetary penalties
for deliberate and reckless loss of data. That is an important tool in
data security, but the provisions have not yet come into force. Before
they come into force, the Information Commissioner needs to issue
guidance on how to use the power. There also needs to be secondary
legislation detailing the maximum fines and the issues about
procedure.</div><a name="09022646000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will
the Minister tell us when those orders will be laid before Parliament?
The House of Lords changed the Data Protection Act 1998 in response to
widespread public concern and yet little has happened. Will the
Minister update us on what is happening? It may be that the combination
of our new clause, plus the implementation of those changes, will lead
to the culture change that we are keen to bring about. Will the
Minister also tell us what discussions she has had with the Information
Commissioner to amend section 60(3) by order to increase the penalties
for section 55, which refers to the unlawful obtaining of data. In the
past, she has pledged that she would make those changes. Will she give
an update on exactly what is happening?</div>
<a name="09022646000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I pointed
out&#151;I do not want to delay the Committee any longer&#151;we
feel that the Government have a serious, cultural problem. In the new
technological age, much more data are being stored by Departments and
the private sector, and much more technology is being used to translate
data into different types, and to store, pass around and share data.
Bearing in mind the huge powers contained in clause 152, which we will
discuss later, we need proper sanctions in place. We also need proper
procedures to ensure that clause 151 is tightened up, so that the
commissioner will get the powers that he has asked for. If we combined
the powers in the clause with the extra powers that we suggest in new
clause 32, the Bill would be improved. I hope that the Minister will
indicate that the Government have listened to
us.</div><a name="09022646000081"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022646000238"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Justice (Bridget
Prentice):</b> The Government are strongly committed to
improving public trust and confidence in the handling of personal
information by public sector data controllers. The hon. Member for
North-West Norfolk highlighted a number of previous examples, but the
assessment notices are an important step towards regaining that
confidence, and they represent a fair balance between the need for the
Information Commissioner to have more effective powers and the burden
on data controllers; I will come to the private sector in a
moment.</div><a name="09022646000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
assessment notices will create a formal system based on the current
arrangement of spot checks undertaken on central Government Departments
by 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column346" />Column number: 346</div>the commissioner. Additionally, the scope of the assessments will be
expanded to cover other public bodies. We are already expanding the
powers in a way that previously had not been available.</div>
<a name="09022646000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
105 and 106 would represent an unwarranted extension of the scheme,
which is designated for public sector data controllers only. Those
controllers handle personal information that is necessary to fulfil
their responsibilities, such as providing health and social services,
fighting crime, and detecting fraud. Those who provide information to a
data controller normally cannot refuse to do so, if they want to access
a public service or have entitlement to a benefit. The public generally
have no choice in that relationship, which is not exactly the same as
that with the private sector. If people are unhappy with how their bank
or supermarket is handling their personal information&#151;I suspect
that Sainsbury&#146;s knows more about me than anybody else
does&#151;they have the choice of switching, although they do not
have a choice of switching to another Department for Work and
Pensions.</div><a name="09022646000084"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022646000239"></a>David
Howarth:</b> If that is the Minister&#146;s defence, there
are two points that she must deal with. First, how does that defence
apply to the private sector or voluntary organisations that fulfil
public authority functions that have been contracted out? That seems to
be exactly the same situation as that of a public authority. Secondly,
with regard to what might be called fully private organisations, how do
we know that our data are being used properly? If there is no proper
enforcement mechanism in the Information Commissioner&#146;s
Office&#151;the assessment notice is a crucial part of
that&#151;how will we know, in the first place, that what is being
done is proper? If we do not know, and have no information, the market
cannot work.</div>
<a name="09022646000085"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022646000240"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> On the hon. Gentleman&#146;s first point, in
the examples that I have given, it is important to recognise that there
is a qualitative difference regarding the level of scrutiny that public
sector bodies should have for matters of data protection. The fact that
citizens must provide personal information to access essential services
is a defining feature in the relationship between the citizen and the
public authority. In the private sector, the ability for someone to
choose to go elsewhere should be a powerful driver that encourages
businesses to look after personal
information.</div>
<a name="09022646000193"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022646000241"></a>Alun
Michael:</b> I understand the distinction that my hon. Friend
makes in cases where people can exercise choice. In the commercial
sector, however, it is difficult to exercise choice if someone does not
know how things are undertaken. That is where the role of the
Information Commissioner, acting on behalf of the public, is crucial.
That should be a balanced role, not one that is important only on one
side. I am not sure that I accept my hon. Friend&#146;s argument that
everybody can make the sort of choices that she suggests. I understand
her point in relation to large organisations or specific services, but
not in general terms. That brings us back to the point about private
companies and others which act on behalf of public bodies and which
are, in a sense, within the ambit of public service, even though they
are not public bodies per se.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column347" />Column number: 347</div><a name="09022646000087"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022646000242"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> One of the reasons why we are resistant to
extending the measure further into the private sector is because we
believe that the additional burdens would be in conflict with the
Hampton principles, which play a central role in ensuring that risks
are adequately assessed and redressed. I will not go into the details
of what the CBI has said, as that has been expressed in the Committee
already. It feels&#151;there is some merit in this
argument&#151;that extending assessment notices would distract
companies from taking the right approach to data handling. It feels
that a co-operative approach between businesses and the Information
Commissioner is more desirable. That is the CBI&#146;s view. It is
not one that would necessarily run the full length in Committee, but it
is a generally held view.</div>
<a name="09022646000088"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022646000243"></a>Alun
Michael:</b> I am sorry to disagree with my hon. Friend, but
if a co-operative approach would work with those organisations, why
would it not work with public bodies? Private sector organisations are
often as large or larger, and as bureaucratic, as public sector bodies.
Some are lean and efficient, but not all.</div>
<a name="09022646000089"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022646000244"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> My right hon. Friend makes a good point. I
reiterate that the Government feel that the public sector has a higher
level of responsibility, because there is no choice as far as this is
concerned. We can discuss the matter further and discussions are
continuing.</div><a name="09022646000090"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022646000245"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> The right hon. Member for Cardiff, South and
Penarth made a point about the distinction between the private and the
public sector. That distinction is being blurred by the public
sector&#146;s use of the private sector to carry out public
functions. Should we not concentrate on the function rather than on the
description of the body carrying out that
function?</div><a name="09022646000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under
the Identity Cards Act 2006&#151;another terrible piece of
legislation introduced by this Government&#151;and the Government
business case that was published alongside the legislation, 40,000
private companies or agents were said to be part of the process of data
recovery through the national identity register. The public had no
access to that; it was not possible for a member of the public to audit
the trail of information in the national identity register, which is a
large Government bucket of private information. Some of that
information would be in the hands of public bodies, and some in the
hands of private companies. It is essential that we understand the
principle and similarity of function, rather than getting tied up with
whether something is a private or public sector
body.</div><a name="09022646000092"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022646000246"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> The hon. and learned Gentleman makes a very good
point. It is appropriate, therefore, for me to consider in detail at
this point who could be given an assessment notice. Obviously, that
includes Government Departments, publicly owned companies under the
Freedom of Information Act 2000 and so on. Any person exercising a
function of a public nature could be included in an order under section
5 of the Act. I think that that covers the examples from DBERR given by
the hon. Member for North-West
Norfolk.</div><a name="09022646000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
person providing, under a contract with a public authority, a service
whose provision is a function of the public authority&#151;that would
include the private sector 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column348" />Column number: 348</div>and the voluntary and third sector&#151;could also be included under
section 5. The powers can cover bodies that the definition of public
authority covers where a person is providing, under a contract with a
public authority a service whose provision is a function of the public
authority. That covers any contracting out of public services, because
proposed new section 41A(12) of the Data Protection Act 1998 provides
that a body can be designated under new section 41A(2)(b), if it
could  be included in an order under section 5 of the Freedom
of Information Act or its equivalent in Scotland. I hope that that
provides some reassurance with regard to those valid concerns about
cases in which the private sector is working within the public sector,
which can be covered under assessment
notices.</div><a name="09022646000094"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022646000247"></a>David
Howarth:</b> I cannot remember the details of those sections
offhand, but I seem to remember that they are about powers to include,
not obligations to include, and they would not necessarily lead to the
Information Commissioner being able to issue an assessment notice, if
the organisation had not been designated as included in the
Act.</div><a name="09022646000095"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022646000248"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> My understanding is that the hon. Gentleman is
right: they are powers to include; they are not obligatory. However, I
will come back to him on whether there will be further discussions on
that.</div><a name="09022646000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
105 and 106 would strike out the exemptions in proposed new section
41A(12), but included in those exemptions are such people as the
security services and special forces, who handle sensitive security
information. The provision also covers Ofsted, because of the sensitive
personal data that it holds on children and young people. I am
resisting the amendments, given the sensitive nature of that
information, and striking out the provision entirely would be
inappropriate. We must balance the need to enhance the Information
Commissioner&#146;s powers with the potential impact of the changes
in the wider context of the regulatory framework. If I may, I shall now
deal with the amendments on
non-compliance.</div><a name="09022646000097"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022646000249"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> The Hampton principles were about proportionate
burdens that are assessed according to the level of risk involved. As
my right hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth has
said, why should the public sector not have the same benefit of the
Hampton approach as the private sector when we come to imposing new
burdens? In his memorandum to us, the Information Commissioner
states:</div><a name="09022646000188"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
have no desire to undertake heavy handed or widespread
inspections.&#148;</div><a name="09022646000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">So
is it not possible to mirror the Hampton principles more closely in
this power? Then the code of practice could amplify that when it is
produced
later.</div><a name="09022646000099"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022646000250"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> That is a very good point, and I certainly want
to carry it forward. My hon. Friend has made a constructive
contribution, because the Hampton principles provide an important
structure for us to work to. Perhaps we can consider that in more
detail and ensure that that aspect of the Bill complies with the
principles, as he has outlined.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column349" />Column number: 349</div><a name="09022646000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">We propose to
introduce assessment notices to raise the awareness and compliance of
public bodies in respect of data protection principles. They are a
complementary measure to support the existing investigatory and
enforcement powers of the Information Commissioner. It is difficult to
envisage a public sector body refusing to comply with an assessment
notice, given the bad publicity that would ensue. That said, the
Information Commissioner has told the Committee that he would like some
kind of penalty or sanction for refusal to
comply.</div><a name="09022646000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me outline the extensive enforcement powers that are already available
to the commissioner, if a public sector body fails to comply with the
Data Protection Act. Where there is a refusal to comply with an
assessment notice, the Information Commissioner would, where
appropriate, still be able to use his existing investigatory powers,
including powers of entry and inspection under schedule 9 to the Act.
If the commissioner then discovers a breach of the data protection
principles during an assessment, he can issue an enforcement notice to
compel the controller to comply with their data protection
obligations.</div><a name="09022646000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
364 and 365 relate to information notices. Section 43 of the Data
Protection Act provides the information commissioner with the power to
issue a data controller with an information notice. That notice can
require the controller to provide the commissioner with specified
information in a specified form to assess compliance with data
protection principles. The commissioner can also issue a notice to any
data controller, as long as he reasonably requires information to
determine their compliance. Failure to comply with an information
notice is a criminal offence, so the commissioner already has a pretty
powerful tool.</div>
<a name="09022646000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments would extend the commissioner&#146;s power to issue a
notice served under section 43 to data processors as well as
controllers. I am resistant to the amendments because the structure of
the Data Protection Act places the responsibility for personal
information on the data controller, not the data processor. Introducing
a power to serve an information notice on a processor shifts the
regulatory balance in the
Act.</div><a name="09022646000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">All
data being processed by, or on behalf of, an organisation must be
covered by the data controller&#146;s registration. It is the data
controller&#146;s responsibility to obtain the information that the
commissioner requires. It is the data controller who controls the
personal data that would be the subject of an information notice, so it
should be the controller who has to comply with a notice. A data
processor does not control the personal data, so it would be
inappropriate to make them responsible for it&#151;it is for the data
controller to take that responsibility.</div>
<a name="09022646000105"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022646000251"></a>Mr.
Bellingham:</b> Will the Minister clarify that? Is she saying
that third parties that handle the data on behalf of the data
controller do not really need to be covered by the information notice?
Is the nub of what she is saying that there is no need for amendment
365 to extend the powers in the Bill to such third
parties?</div>
<a name="09022646000106"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022646000252"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> That is the nub of what I am saying. It is the
responsibility of the data controller, not the processor, to ensure
compliance. For example, following the Hannigan data handling review,
the Government introduced new standard contract clauses on information 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column350" />Column number: 350</div>assurance. Those clauses mean that any contractors working with the
Government will have processes in place to ensure acceptable standards
for the protection and handling of personal data. The onus is on the
data controller&#151;in this case the Government&#151;to ensure
that such standards are in place. Amendments 364 and 365 represent a
significant change to that regime, and the hon. Gentleman might
consider it more appropriate for the issue to be considered by the
review of the European directive, which is currently under
way.</div><a name="09022646000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
new clause 32 seeks to limit existing Crown immunity under the Data
Protection Act so that Government Departments would be open to
prosecution. Crown immunity means that emanations of the Crown are not
ordinarily liable to prosecution for offences created by statute or the
common law&#151;the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk mentioned the
Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Act 2007, which is a
notable exception. That immunity includes Departments. For that reason,
the limitation on the prosecution of Departments is included in
relation to the offences in the Data Protection
Act.</div><a name="09022646000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
that does not mean that Departments are not subject to adequate
sanctions for breaches of data protection principles. They may still be
subject to enforcement notices, claims for damages in the civil courts
and civil monetary penalties. That final point is particularly
important, because it means that financial penalties can still be
imposed on Departments. It is also important to note that the immunity
does not extend to those who work for
Departments.</div><a name="09022646000194"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10
am</div><a name="09022646000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for North-West Norfolk asked when the penalties will come
into force. A number of steps need to be taken before they can be
introduced. The commissioner needs to prepare guidance on how he
proposes to exercise his functions with regard to the penalties, and a
number of pieces of secondary legislation will be needed, for example,
to set out the levels of penalty. We will also have to build in a
12-week lead-in period before imposing such burdens on business, but we
are working closely with the commissioner on that. My right hon. Friend
the Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth asked for reassurance that
further discussions are taking place. I can give him that reassurance.
Discussions are ongoing. In light of that, I invite the hon. Member for
Cambridge to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09022646000110"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022646000253"></a>David
Howarth:</b> If I may sum up the situation, I raised two
issues&#151;scope and enforcement. The issue of scope breaks down
into two separate matters. One is whether assessment notices should
apply to purely private organisations such as Tesco, and the other is
whether they should apply to private organisations that are carrying
out public functions. As I understand it, the Government&#146;s
position is that they are not willing to move on the former but are
considering moving on the latter. At the moment, there appears to be a
power to include private organisations carrying out public authority
functions, but no obligation to do so, and the Government are thinking
about the
situation.</div><a name="09022646000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
situation is therefore more encouraging than it might be, but it is not
fully there yet. Purely private organisations have immense power. We
should treat them as organisations with that much power when 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column351" />Column number: 351</div>thinking about how they ought to be regulated. The Government&#146;s
argument about the market sorting it out is precisely the sort of
argument that we ought to be sceptical about, given the economic
situation that we are
in.</div><a name="09022646000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">Even
as a matter of economic theory, markets cannot work where people do not
have the information to make choices. It seems to me that the
Government have gone too far into a naive view of regulation and the
market. In fact, in some cases&#151;this is an
example&#151;regulation makes the market work better, because it
produces more information for consumers, rather than closing the market
down.</div><a name="09022646000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the second issue, the Government&#146;s position seems to be that the
Information Commissioner has enough powers already and that, as they
want to stick to a public sector view of assessment notices, there is
no need for extra enforcement powers. I find that disappointing, but I
ask the Government to consider the obvious point that if they extend
the assessment notice process to private sector organisations carrying
out a public function, their argument about enforcement no longer
applies, because they will no longer be dealing purely with
governmental organisations that they would expect to comply
automatically. At that point, they should consider again the question
of enforcement.</div>
<a name="09022646000114"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022646000254"></a>Mr.
George Howarth:</b> Is the hon. Gentleman not in danger of
confusing data protection with the regulation of business? At times,
they may be similar but, actually, they are distinct
things.</div><a name="09022646000115"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022646000255"></a>David
Howarth:</b> I do not think so. I am trying to ensure that
there is proper regulation of data protection, which sometimes involves
the regulation of some businesses, because businesses hold data. That
goes back to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff,
Central: we are talking about the enforcement of existing
obligations&#151;they already apply&#151;on the private sector, not
about changing
obligations.</div><a name="09022646000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will
the Government reconsider their position on enforcement as a
consequence of reconsidering their position on scope? The two things
are connected. I do not wish to detain the Committee further. I am
sufficiently encouraged by the Government&#146;s movement on private
sector bodies carrying out public functions that I beg to ask leave to
withdraw the amendment.</div>
<a name="09022646000117"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022646000256"></a>Mr.
Bellingham:</b> I always listen carefully to the Minister.
Obviously, there is a developing agreement between us on how the
private sector should be controlled when it comes to assessment
notices. She made a good point about section 41 of the Data Protection
Act
1998.</div><a name="09022646000118"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022646000257"></a>Alun
Michael:</b> On a point of order, Mr. Cook. I may
have lost track, but I thought that the hon. Member for Cambridge had
withdrawn his amendment. Did that not close the
debate?</div><a name="09022646000119"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022646000258"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Let me clarify the situation for the Committee.
I am yet to put the withdrawal to the Committee. At the moment, I am
allowing the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk to make his points,
which I hope he will do briefly.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column352" />Column number: 352</div><a name="09022646000120"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022646000259"></a>Mr.
Bellingham:</b> I will be brief, Mr. Cook, because
the Minister has given us some encouragement. I hope that she will
reply to me on the powers that will be included. Obviously, private
sector organisations that are in contracts with various Departments and
agencies are not necessarily included, but the powers to include them
exist. I would be grateful if in due course we could have a discussion
about that, perhaps in
writing.</div><a name="09022646000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
take on board what the Minister said about new clause 32, but I urge
her to push on with as much speed as possible to introduce the changes
made by the other place to the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act
2008.</div><a name="09022646000122"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022646000260"></a>David

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022646000261"></a>Mr.
Bellingham:</b> I beg to move amendment 372, in
clause 151, page 99, line 30, leave

insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(4) The code must

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022646000263"></a>Mr.
Bellingham:</b> The amendments ensure that a resolution of
both Houses of Parliament is in place before the Information
Commissioner issues the code of practice on enforcement notices. Clause
151 states that it is up to the Secretary of State to approve the code
of practice, but why should there not be an affirmative resolution of
both Houses? Why is Parliament being downgraded? Surely the affirmative
resolution procedure should be in
place.</div><a name="09022646000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are talking about the code of practice on assessment notices, the
importance of which we have already discussed. The code of practice is
an important tool in the commissioner&#146;s armoury in ensuring that
we have better data protection in this country. Before the commissioner
issues the code of practice, it should be subject to affirmative
resolution. Why can that not happen? We are increasingly using the
affirmative resolution procedure, which is good for Parliament, so I
humbly suggest to the Minister that the amendments are positive. Why
should the Secretary of State have the power, and why should Parliament
not have more
power?</div><a name="09022646000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are discussing a very important part of what will be the interface
between our constituents, their private data and lives and Her
Majesty&#146;s Government&#151;a Government who are taking upon
themselves more 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column353" />Column number: 353</div>powers, and want to interfere more in, and look at more aspects of, our
lives and to have more control over our data. Surely, Parliament, not
the Secretary of State, should be the ultimate
sanction.</div><a name="09022646000133"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022646000264"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> Much as I would like to be positive towards the
hon. Gentleman on this matter, given the relative narrow scope of the
code, I am not persuaded that it needs to be subject to the
parliamentary procedure that he has outlined. Obviously, the other
amendments would also make the data-sharing code of practice subject to
the affirmative
procedure.</div><a name="09022646000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Bill states that a draft data-sharing code must be laid before
Parliament within 40 days, unless either House resolves not to approve
the draft. Of course, we recognise that the code is important, given
the need to provide clear, authoritative guidance to practitioners,
which is why we have provided for the equivalent of the negative
resolution procedure. That is probably the appropriate level of
parliamentary scrutiny for what is, after all, a code of practice,
rather than a statutory order, regulations or rules. If we have
misjudged the level of scrutiny for the two codes of practice, I shall
look with interest and pay close attention to what the Delegated Powers
and Regulatory Reform Committee says when it considers the matter. We
will, of course, consider its recommendations very
carefully.</div><a name="09022646000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
371 would oblige the information commissioner to keep the code of
practice under &#147;annual&#148; review. Proposed new section 52C
to the Data Protection Act, inserted by clause 153, obliges the
commissioner to keep the code under review, and he is also required to
update the code if he becomes aware that its content could result in
the UK breaching any of its Community or international obligations. It
is possible to read amendment 371 as preventing the code
from being amended quickly, once a breach has been identified, whereas
proposed new section 52C gives the information commissioner the scope
to reconsider and review the code as and when he sees fit. Given his
role as the independent data protection regulator, we think that that
is right and that tying them to an annual review would be unnecessarily
restrictive.</div><a name="09022646000136"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022646000265"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> I am sorry to slow my hon. Friend&#146;s
progress through amendment 371, but I want to return to amendment 372.
She has answered the point about parliamentary approval of the code,
but the other part of the amendment raised the question why the
Secretary of State should have to give permission for the code to be
issued in the first place. The Information Commissioner warned us that
that is a dangerous imposition and fetter on his independence from
Government. What is the justification for the Secretary of State
approving the issue of the code in the first
place?</div><a name="09022646000137"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022646000266"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> My hon. Friend makes a fair point. The reason is
that it gives the opportunity to ensure consistency across Whitehall
Departments in relation to data protection matters. It also ensures
that the burden on public bodies is both proportionate and fair. That
is why it is in the hands of the Secretary of
State.</div><a name="09022646000138"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022646000267"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> That is not an answer to the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s question. Consistency can be policed or applied by
the commissioner, who has a wider remit than the Secretary of State
across Whitehall. The Secretary 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column354" />Column number: 354</div>of State will be concerned primarily with his own Department. If he
starts interfering with other people&#146;s Departments, I dare say
that jealous Ministers will complain. Surely the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s point needs to be considered rather more carefully
than the Minister&#146;s argument
demonstrated.</div><a name="09022646000195"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.15

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022646000268"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> I am terribly sorry if the hon. and learned
Gentleman thinks that I did not consider my hon. Friend&#146;s
question seriously enough. It is the answer to the question, but
whether it is the answer that either the hon. and learned Member for
Harborough or my hon. Friend wanted to hear is another matter. However,
if it is something about which members of the Committee feel strongly,
I am happy to reflect on it and see whether the responsibility should
be handed over to the Information Commissioner rather than the
Secretary of State. It is not something on which I intend to go to the
wall about, but I will certainly have another look. The Delegated
Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee in the other place still has to
scrutinise that part of the Bill, and I shall pay close attention to
what it says on the
subject.</div><a name="09022646000140"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022646000269"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022646000270"></a>Bridget

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022646000271"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022646000274"></a>David
Howarth:</b> We now come to the far more controversial clause
about information-sharing orders. We must discuss it in the context of
Sir David Omand&#146;s paper for the Institute for Public Policy
Research, which, at the least, revealed the breadth, scope and depth of
central Government&#146;s ambitions in the matters of data
collection, data mining and invasions of the privacy of
individuals.</div>
<a name="09022646000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 152,
either intentionally or unintentionally, is part of a bigger picture in
which the state allows itself more and more powers to collect and
process personal data about individuals for purposes that are not
revealed to those individuals. In fact, the crucial issue in the debate
will be that of purpose. What happens when data are collected by the
Government for one purpose, but they want to use the information for
another purpose? That is when all the violations of the principle of
privacy will occur, and why it is relevant to mention Sir David
Omand&#146;s
paper.</div><a name="09022646000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">No
one doubts that there are examples when data or information sharing
that is technically not allowed under primary legislation would be
helpful to the general public. The question facing is us is not whether
there are annoying and inconvenient times for the Government, and
occasionally for Parliament, when they have to pass secondary or
primary legislation to allow something that is clearly advantageous to
happen. We do not doubt that sometimes secondary legislation is not
well scrutinised, but we are concerned about the extraordinary scope
and breadth of the powers that the clause grants to the Government. It
is either lazy drafting or the consequence of a habit of mind that the
danger of such powers no longer occurs to officials or Ministers as the
sort of thing that they should worry
about.</div><a name="09022646000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
really ought to be worried about the breadth of these powers. They
threaten to undermine, for example, the privacy of medical records, the
scope of the use of the identity card database and any restrictions on
the use of the DNA database.</div>
<a name="09022646000167"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022646000275"></a>Mr.
Bellingham:</b> Has the hon. Gentleman seen that Dr. Meldrum
of the BMA says that the clause could seriously undermine the
confidence that patients have in doctors and that it might even lead to
patients being reluctant to disclose personal
information?</div><a name="09022646000168"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022646000276"></a>David
Howarth:</b> I saw the announcement. As lawyers, we often do
not take what doctors say as seriously as doctors do. On this occasion,
however, we have to take the point seriously, because it relates to the
point about purpose. Let us say that a patient has gone to a different
doctor because of the nature of their condition&#151;perhaps it is a
sexually transmitted disease, which has a certain amount of stigma.
Unfortunately and quite wrongly, stigma applies to a whole range of
conditions, including mental health conditions. That patient is now
confident that confidentiality is covered by medical ethics, medical
law and the Data Protection Act.</div>
<a name="09022646000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
information-sharing orders allowed under the clause could sweep all
that away. They allow sharing with any person, despite what any
enactment might say. A patient in that position might well be worried
that this information would subsequently&#151;not under conditions of
law at the time&#151;become available to people other than that
particular doctor. That is not a fanciful worry&#151;it is a real one
that the medical profession has identified.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column357" />Column number: 357</div><a name="09022646000170"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022646000277"></a>Mr.
George Howarth:</b> I was going to say something slightly
unpleasant about lawyers and the hierarchy of the medical profession,
but the moment has passed, so I shall make another
intervention.</div>
<a name="09022646000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">It strikes me
that the hon. Gentleman does not believe that the clause has been
designed for the purposes that he has described but fears that it could
be used for such purposes. Does he not accept that, by any reasonable
standard, it would be wholly disproportionate for anyone to use these
provisions for the purpose that he has just described, which would not
therefore stand up to any kind of legal
scrutiny?</div>
<a name="09022646000172"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022646000278"></a>David
Howarth:</b> The right hon. Gentleman made that point on
Second Reading. The danger is that, first, a court might not feel
itself able to judge the proportionality of a particular measure to
some sort of vague, relevant policy goal. I shall get on to the whole
section of the clause that talks about relevant policy goals, but that
is far too vague to be subject to any sort of specific and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column358" />Column number: 358</div>accurate legal review. That undermines the point that the right hon.
Gentleman is making, which is otherwise a good point, that if there
were misuse, there is the backstop of judicial review. However, the
clause is drafted so vaguely and grants such power to Ministers that
the court would be deterred from the ordinary rules of judicial
review.</div>
