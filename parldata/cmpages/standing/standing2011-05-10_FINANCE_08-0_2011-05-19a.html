a horse and cart, he told the horse to pull up and then continued
dictating his article to his

phrase in the draft legislation that I was particularly concerned about
was, ‘It is reasonable to suppose that in essence this is a tax

colleague made is why not start from somewhere else and say,
‘These arrangements are fine, everything else is not’? I
am sure that could be done in a lot less than 59

                        <p class="hs_brev">“simplified
the taxes for this country enormously by saying all employee
remuneration would be subject to PAYE. It was a fantastic move. It
worked in a very clear move to clamp down on these things. This should
have been covered except for specific carve-outs. I cannot understand
why we have not carried on with that principle now. She was right. We
need to go that way
again.”<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000504">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
key point is that the schedule is simply too complex for people dealing
with it outside the House. The Minister may believe that he has
simplified it. It consisted of 59 pages before the amendments. The
number of pages may be more or less now; I have not had time to count
them. However, he needs to recognise that there is real concern outside
the House about the schedule and the
clause.<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000034">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> That is another of my key concerns. I am grateful
to my hon. Friend for giving up his lunchtime to read the 88 amendments
that the Minister has tabled. My purpose today is simply to say to the
Minister—and I hope this answers my hon. Friend’s
point—that he has some clear objectives in the clause and in the
schedule to tighten up anti-avoidance legislation. However, the way in
which the schedule is drafted, and the way in which, even now, because
he has realised it is very difficult, he has tabled amendments to try
to clarify some of the exemptions, still means that it is a very
complex piece of legislation. All he really seeks to do is to ensure
that he tightens up on loans that are never likely to be repaid,
tightens up on assets available to an employer by putting them into a
trust without the employee paying tax on them, and make sure that the
£50,000 pension cap is effective. Those are the three objectives
he has set himself, yet he has taken 59 pages, a schedule and a clause
with 88 amendments to get to a stage where he cannot yet even give me a
guarantee that he will not amend the measure still
further.<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000036">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I do, and I am grateful to my hon. Friend for
looking through the amendments this morning. Let me try to be fair to
the Minister. The Treasury has, in response to the consultation, tabled
88 amendments. I want to hear from the Minister when he makes his
winding-up speech whether he is satisfied that those 88
amendments answer the concerns that have been expressed about clarity,
complexity and objectivity, so that businesses will understand the
final version of the schedule in a workable and practicable
way.<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000040">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In response to
the concerns expressed by the Chartered Institute of Taxation, to which
my hon. Friend has just referred, the Treasury said in a press
statement to the <em>Financial Times</em> on
FT.com:<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000041">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Again,
let us take that at face value. The Bill was published on 29 March. The
consultation took place in December last year. Consultation finished,
comments were made and the Bill was published. Then, four days before
consideration in Committee, 88 amendments were tabled with no real
explanatory notes, trying to support the changes that the Government
believed they should make. We have received submissions from a number
of bodies, which I quoted this morning and will not repeat, saying that
they do not believe that those amendments have made a difference,
clarified the situation or eased the complexity of the legislation. I
simply say to the Minister that this is an extremely complex matter and
the legislation needs to be very tight and understandable so that it
can be taken on board and implemented
downstream.<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000043">&#160;</a>

I will happily give way to him if he believes that his changes do not
make the scheme incomprehensible as the Quoted Companies Alliance
suggests before, during and after his amendments. We will happily slow
down our discussions and make progress on the Bill, but I do not

provisions.<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000510">&#160;</a>

day the Government published an extensive list of amendments that have
been tabled in respect of these provisions…we had not had the
opportunity to review the latest set of amendments. In view of the
general concern about these provisions and the requests that we have
received about whether we have some more detailed comments, we have
prepared this more detailed
briefing”.<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000511">&#160;</a>

                           </div>know what they are talking about, and they have a point to make.
Although the briefing says that it has not received full details of the
amendments, its assessment after an initial cursory glance is that they
will not change anything.<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000056">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I return to
the Minister’s speech on 27 January this year, in which he
said:<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000057">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“We
need a simpler, more stable tax
system”.<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000516">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>That
is what I should like to focus on today. Here is his opportunity to
have a simpler, more stable tax system; withdraw the clause; withdraw
the schedule; go back and talk to officials; look at the objectives he
is trying to achieve and bring the measure back in a simplified and
more understandable form on Report. He will have our support for that.
He will then undoubtedly have the opportunity to consult the ICAEW, the
Quoted Companies Alliance, Grant Thornton and a range of tax experts
who are saying to me— and I am reflecting this to him in
Committee—that the rules are overtly complex, do not achieve
what they are intended to achieve, and will not be workable on the
ground.<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000058">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The ICAEW
said:<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000059">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“These
are our views. In view of the short timescale for comments, we may
return to this matter with a further a parliamentary briefing at report
stage.”<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000517">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>It
that the way to legislate? Under the Minister’s own terms, we
have had consultation, amendments, a brief that people cannot comment
on, and we hear that the matter might have to be looked at further on
Report. If that is the case, does he intend to table more amendments on
Report if the ICAEW or any other body make further
comments?<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000060">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                        </h4>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
mention that because, as the Minister and the Committee know, the
Finance Bill is one of the few that does not travel to another place.
One hundred years ago, the House of Commons fought hard to ensure that
the unelected peers in another place did not influence and interfere
with financial matters, and I am proud to say that Labour MPs, although
few and far between at the time, were at the forefront of arguing for
reform of the Lords and for the Finance Bill to be dealt with in the
Commons.<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000061">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">If
the Minister tables amendments on Report, or if proposals are agreed in
Committee, there is no revising Chamber. We are making legislation. If
the ICAEW or the Minister raise concerns, the Government could table
amendments on Report that might not even be discussed as a result of
time constraints. I remind the Committee that the Report stage might
last one or two days—I do not know, as the usual channels have
not discussed it. Amendments will be tabled on a range of matters, and
we may raise topics that have been considered in Committee if we want
to reflect on them again. We can debate these matters all day and all
night, as he
knows.<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000062">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
may have taken a long time to make it, but my simple point is that it
is important that we get this right. The fact that the Minister has
consulted on the Bill, has had to amend it and is still receiving
representations saying, “We’re not happy. It’s not
going to work. We support the objectives but may need to bring forward
further parliamentary briefings at report stage”, as the

                           </div>ICAEW has said, suggests that this is not a very tight ship for the
objectives and that he should look at it
again.<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000063">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I have
received representations from Handelsbanken through McDermott Will
&amp; Emery LLP. Handelsbanken is one of Sweden’s largest banks,
headquartered in Stockholm with a market capitalisation of about
£13.2 billion. It is established under Swedish law,
but its key consideration regarding the proposals is about shares given
to its employees collectively in recognition of the integral role that
they play in generating bank profits. The brief raising
Handelsbanken’s concerns runs to about 11 pages, which I do not
intend to read in full. [<span class="smallcaps">Hon. Members:</span>

Handelsbanken makes a serious point that the Minister should consider
in point 5.6 of its submission:<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000064">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“For
the bank, the new part 7a presents an unpalatable dilemma. Either gross
up UK employees for their tax liabilities or subject UK employees to a
less favourable position than their counterparts in other

greater costs through demotivated
staff.”<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000518">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am grateful to my right hon. Friend for being so
generous. However, there is not only a European dimension to this;
there is an international one. There is a Chinese company called Huawei
that employs about 3,500 people in this country, and is owned by its
employees. Although the company is not listed on the stock exchange,
each employee is offered a certain degree of shareholding, based on
longevity of service and their level in the company. Companies such as
Huawei that are based in this country may find this legislation very
difficult in terms of who owns the company and how shareholding is
constructed. So it is not just about Europe; there is an international
dimension as
well.<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000065">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I hope that my hon. Friend will be able to develop
that point further during our discussions today. There are key issues
which we need to consider. There are three objectives in the
legislation, as I see them. First, that loans should not be made that
are never likely to be repaid; we agree that that should be tightened
up. Secondly, that making assets available to an employee by putting
them into a trust without the employee paying tax on them is an
important issue we need to tackle. Finally, we need to look at the
pension cap.<a class="bkMark" name="11052037000001">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
cannot see why, with the great power of the Treasury, the Minister
cannot look at legislation that deals with those three issues without
the list of exemptions that he has put down in the 59 to 60, 61 or 62
pages of the schedule that he has at the moment. I return to the fact
that the rules proposed are too complex. The chairman of the Chartered
Institute of Taxation employment taxes sub-committee, Colin Ben-Nathan,
has said:<a class="bkMark" name="">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“We think that employers
will face real difficulties in trying to assess how they stand with
this new legislation and that they are likely to need to take advice to
arrive at a considered
view.<a class="bkMark" name="">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="hs_brev">Even
then that does not necessarily mean that HMRC will agree with the view

whether or not tax charges arise and at what point. We suspect many

                        <p class="tabbed">Before we
sanction this legislation today, we need a clear indication from the
Minister of the assessment he has from officials of the likely workload
for HMRC staff, given the complexity of the clause and schedule 2. I am
only reflecting views from outside the House, in a way that I hope is
constructive for the Minister. If the chairman of the Institute of
Taxation is saying that this will lead to a greater workload for HMRC,
what assessment has the Minister made of that workload? What assessment
has he made of the impact on HMRC staff? What assessment has he made of
the level of resources he will raise from these measures versus the
cost of enforcing
them?<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000067">&#160;</a>

Friend’s unstinting generosity in giving way. There is a bigger
issue for HMRC. I am sure that every member of the Committee has had a
significant increase in constituency casework, due to HMRC cases in
which the administration is either breaking down or not operating at
all. A key issue is that the number of employees and staff resources at
HMRC seem inadequate for what they are doing. While I appreciate the
points made about an increase in resources, the HMRC offices in
Edinburgh are hugely stretched. Indeed, the number of cases relating to
HMRC that I get through my surgeries is rocketing. That is a concern
for the public, and certainly for small businesses in my constituency,
who will have to deal with the regulations and might find it very
difficult to establish a conduit with
HMRC.<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000069">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> My hon. Friend makes a very important point.
Looking at the impact of the potential reductions on HMRC, one thing
that has been identified by tax professionals outside the House is that
they expect that
efficiencies<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000070">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“will
be achieved largely through efficiency savings, for example by
automating a number of manual processes and reducing ‘face to
face’ contact between the department and
taxpayers”.<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000521">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>I
do not know whether that is accurate; I am putting it on the record so
that the Minister can respond. If, however, we introduce complex
schedules—I do not think anybody denies that they are
complex—and new arrangements that impact on businesses, in order
to tighten up two or three key issues that schedule 2 is 
<div class="columnNumber">

that they need to contact HMRC. More advice will be required, more
exemptions will be sought, and more clarification will be needed. That
will involve face-to-face contact. Has the Minister undertaken an
assessment of the HMRC workload created by the clause and other parts
of the Bill? We are concerned that it will have an
impact.<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000071">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his
contribution, because there will be implications. There are
implications in relation to HMRC staff understanding the clause and the
schedule, and businesses, predominantly, understanding the clause and
the schedule. The clarity in the clause and the schedule will not
assist businesses. They will have to take further tax advice. Tax
advisers, whose concerns over this clause have swamped my inbox with
e-mails, say that it is too complicated and should be
simplified.<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000073">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I will go back
to basics. In his response, the Minister should give a clear indication
of his objectives for clause 26 and schedule 2. If his
objectives are as I understand them, they are relatively
straightforward and simple; he aims to tie up three loopholes. Why,
then, do we have 59, possibly 60, pages to the schedule? Why do we have
a clause in the Bill that brings the schedule into effect? Why do we
have 88 or 90 amendments to the schedule, remembering that the Minister
might table further amendments on Report, as might others? Why are we
exempting a lot of business aspects while not focusing on the real
issue? Why are we doing all of that when, with Opposition support, the
Minister could simply bring back a revised clause that deals with the
two or three issues that form the basis of the anti-avoidance measures
that he is trying to
introduce?<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000074">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
want to make two final points before the Minister responds—or my
hon. Friends make some comments. We have discussed complexity,
simplicity and understanding. Aside from that, how does the Minister
intend to enforce this legislation? Accountants and others have told me
that it is difficult to understand, so what is the mechanism for
enforcing the clause in the country at large? How will HMRC undertake
its enforcement
role?<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000076">&#160;</a>

far ahead, I have another point to make about HMRC staff. A recent
survey found that only 25% of HMRC staff felt proud to be working
there. The effect of the cuts and job uncertainty places a lot of
stress on people who already have a stressful role in dealing with the
public. As we know, most people are perhaps not in the best frame of
mind when they speak to tax officers. A tax officer then has to deal
with a complicated issue while keeping good customer relations. I fear
that those relations may be damaged further if a more complicated
scheme is implemented.<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000077">&#160;</a>

                           <strong> </strong>My hon. Friend backs up my point. The
Minister established the Office of Tax Simplification, but, if members
of the Committee look carefully at the 80-odd amendments before us, he
is now introducing extremely complex legislation. I am not saying
that—I am not a tax lawyer, and I have not spent my life looking
at tax legislation—but tax lawyers and people who have spent
their entire life looking at tax legislation are saying it. They have
told me that this is the most complicated piece of tax legislation they
have seen in the past 10 years. The legislation comes from a Minister
who established the Office of Tax Simplification and who is trying to
ease burdens on businesses. He has introduced a provision that will
further complicate what should be simple
measures.<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000078">&#160;</a>

My right hon. Friend makes an excellent case. I read the ICAEW
representation to the Committee, and it refers to proposed new section
554A(1)(c) of the Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003, which
will introduce tax on rewards or recognition. That could potentially
drag in people such as waiters and other service sector workers, who
would have to pay tax on tips. Earlier we heard how the Government are
trying to take more people out of tax, but, potentially, there could be
a ridiculous situation in which waiters would have to fill out
self-assessment forms on the tips they
receive.<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000079">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> My hon. Friend raises a key concern, which others
have also raised with me. It is a question of definition, as well as a
question of enforcement. He leads me to my second and final point,
which is on the problem of definition. If something is defined as
employee remuneration, it should be subject to PAYE, either because it
is caught now or under the retrospective legislation that was promised
earlier. The new rules are trying to target something that feels like
employee remuneration, but technically is not. Will a season ticket
loan that is repaid monthly to cover a train ticket, for example, fall
within his proposed
legislation?<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000080">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> My hon. Friend makes a point, but I will address
remuneration and other issues related to MPs when we get to, I think,
clause 34. I would like to know whether IPSA has a view on the issues

Mr Gale.<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000082">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">My
understanding is that HMRC is not seeking a definitive subjective test
as to what “employee remuneration” is. Therefore it is
trying, in the clause and the schedule, to catch everything and by the
exemptions it is making a very big hash of this issue—hence the
80-odd amendments. Does the Minister believe that the matter before us
today is clearly defined?<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000083">&#160;</a>

                           </div>Friend the Member for Edinburgh South said earlier. Loans have huge
consequences for short-time working agreements. During the previous
recession, I was a trade union official and I negotiated short-time
working agreements to keep people in work and keep factories going, so
that people were in work for temporary periods. But we also negotiated
loans for those workers, from their employer or through a third party,
to tide themselves over until production went back up again. Under the
changes that the Government are introducing, the ICAEW says that such
loans might now be
taxable.<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000084">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">There
is another point in relation to voluntary organisations. If an entity
or an establishment is a trust, it might make loans to someone, for
example so they can go to university. Are such loans

Gentleman has said at many points that he wants to be helpful. Back in
2000, the Government he was a part of introduced IR35. It took a full
seven years before that was changed, with the managed service company
regulations that were introduced exactly seven years later; I think
that they were introduced on 6 April 2007. Obviously, those regulations
were very complex, but many people in business wanted to see them
introduced. It took the previous Labour Government seven years to make
that
change.<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000088">&#160;</a>

put my finger on the information about IR35 to respond to that
question. In some representations that I and other members of the
Committee have received from outside the House, we were asked exactly
how the legislation that is being proposed today relates to IR35. One
of the reasons why there is a lack of clarity is that we do not know
how the legislation proposed today and IR35 will match
together.<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000089">&#160;</a>

revisit the past. We are here today to scrutinise clause 26, schedule 2

hon. Member for Lincoln and to other members of the Committee that we
are not speaking for ourselves; we are speaking for people outside the
House and acting for them as a voice in the Committee. Those people
outside the House are saying to the Minister, through members of the
Committee, that these regulations are complex and unworkable, and they
will create additional burdens for businesses. Moreover, they will not
catch the targets that they are intended to catch and we will end up
with businesses flouting the objectives and therefore crossing into
enforcement issues. There will be greater pressure on HMRC staff to
provide advice on this matter, simply because the legislation is so

are absolutely committed to tackling tax avoidance. We will take the
necessary steps to protect the Exchequer and to maintain fairness, but
we have to accept that tackling such issues is not easy. We know that
an industry is dedicated to finding any weaknesses that exist in our
defences, so we have committed ourselves to more effective
consultation, to ensure that legislation is well targeted and minimises
the impact on commercial activities. I believe that we are taking a big

makes provision to address particularly troublesome and prolific
efforts at avoidance by employers who disguise remuneration through a
third-party relationship in a bid to avoid, defer or reduce tax
relating to employment income. The scale of the attempted avoidance is
extensive, complex and opaque, and perhaps that point has not been
brought out fully in the debate until now. The Office for Budget
Responsibility has certified that HMRC’s estimate of the
revenues generated by this measure—about £750 million a
year—is correct. HMRC estimates that about 5,000 employers have
implemented such schemes; the actual number of schemes is likely to be
much higher as there has been extensive marketing. It is a problem that
is growing, and without action we would expect significant further
losses. To use a phrase that is familiar from today’s debates,
as far as the losses are concerned, “Whoa, this is getting too
much.”<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000097">&#160;</a>

how we make tax policy. I am pleased to hear the right hon.
Gentleman’s welcome for that general approach. If we can achieve
consensus on how we make tax policy, that is all the better. There are
particular issues with avoidance, and it has always been clear that
avoidance creates difficulty in how we make tax law.<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000098">&#160;</a>

that a measure such as this should focus on abusive arrangements and
should not, as far as is practicable, affect those arrangements that do
not seek to avoid tax. Let me first explain why we took the approach
that we did, and specifically why we did not develop an anti-avoidance
purpose test, as some have suggested we should have done. Our response
to the problem of disguised remuneration aims to build on the lessons
that have been learned from tackling avoidance on employment income
over almost two decades by Ministers in Labour and Conservative
Governments, because this is not a new problem. HMRC has learned that
narrowly focused legislation is no obstacle to the ingenuity of the tax
avoidance industry, no matter how sharp-eyed the official or draftsman.
Where that approach has been taken in the past, avoidance in the
employment income arena has simply
adapted.<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000099">&#160;</a>

institutions. I am not informed of individual companies’ tax
affairs, as is right and proper. The hon. Gentleman is right to
highlight the concern. Disguised remuneration is likely to apply where
it is greater. There is no doubt that some of the schemes have applied
in the financial services industry. I do not want to pick on one
sector—and it is not possible for me to give a sector breakdown,
if I might anticipate a future intervention. There is no doubt that
disguised remuneration schemes have been used as a form of tax
avoidance by some financial services institutions and others.<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000101">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">As I say, tax
avoidance in this area is a long-standing concern. For example, from
1991 to 1998, various financial instruments were used for tax
avoidance. After that, we saw gold bullion being used, platinum sponge,
tradable assets, fine wine, gemstones, exotic tangible assets, slightly
less exotic intangible assets and so on. Each time, the schemes got
more complex with more steps to achieve the desired outcome, and so did
the legislation. Yes, legislation in this area is already complex, but
it has been driven by the complexity of tax avoidance
behaviour.<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000102">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> As the Minister was speaking, I was thinking of
the sort of places where people might want to hide the value of
earnings. For instance, in sports clubs, there might be a wage ceiling
in a sport. Because of the public image of sport, people might want to
try to hide their true earnings. Is there not a simpler way to do this,
by introducing some general tax avoidance rules and
regulations?<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000103">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The hon. Gentleman touches on one of the arguments
made for an alternative approach, and I will come on to that in a
moment. A lot of the debate is about whether this is the right way to
do it. I want to set out the argument to show that we have a problem;
tax avoidance is extensive in this area. The estimate of
£750 million is something about which all Members of
the Committee will be concerned and which they would seek to address.
Until now, it has not been adequately

                           </div>addressed; there has been a piecemeal approach that has not got to the
heart of the matter. We have had a lot of targeted measures that have
themselves been quite complex, as has the legislation. Each time
Government have done that, the avoidance has moved to a different area,
and disguised remuneration through third parties is the next chapter.
We want it to be the last chapter, which is what we are trying to

                           </strong> I intend to turn to HMRC’s work force and
its capacity, after explaining what we are trying to do a little more.
The right hon. Member for Delyn and others also put that fair question.
First, I will set out how we are addressing the situation in the
legislation.<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000106">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
have had to adopt a broad approach that captures the essence and range
of avoidance activity. We have used carefully targeted carve-outs to
ensure that arrangements that do not involve tax avoidance are not
affected. The hon. Member for Gateshead asked why we should not have a
purpose test or smaller targeted measures, as suggested by the
Chartered Institute of Taxation and the Institute of Chartered
Accountants in England and Wales. Our proposal is an alternative way of
articulating that broad approach. However, having looked at that
suggestion closely over some time, we are not convinced that it would
be effective against the widespread, diverse and, in particular,
informal avoidance that occurs. While any rule would no doubt be more
succinct, it would have to apply to all instances where a third party
provided a loan or other asset to an employee, where that provision
related to the employment. It is our view that such a rule would be
insufficient on its own to provide clarity and certainty to businesses
about how the legislation would operate in any given situation.
Instead, taxpayers would have to rely on detailed but non-statutory
guidance. There is a role for non-statutory guidance, and there is a
role under the approach that we are taking here. I will say a little
more about that in a moment, but we do not believe that that solution
would be simpler or more certain, and it would certainly be less
transparent.<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000107">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The Exchequer Secretary is carefully spelling out
his approach, which is helpful to the Committee. Will he reassure us
that this measure is simple for businesses to understand and simple for
HMRC to

                           </strong> As I acknowledged in my opening remarks, the
simplicity in this context is all relative. I will not claim that the
proposal is hugely simple. It is not. It is complicated and complex,
but we believe that complexity is necessary and justified in these
specific circumstances, because the measure is trying to address
avoidance that is in itself very complex. If there was an approach
available that was simpler and more effective, we would it, but that
option is not available to us. That is why we have not taken the
approach advocated by some of the

that it would work, and we would find ourselves coming back in a year
or so and still facing similar problems as the debate and the focus of
avoidance move on. Targeted anti-avoidance rules in this area, partly
because of the informal nature of some of the arrangements, would not
be as effective as the measures that we have set
out.<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000109">&#160;</a>

have sought to ensure that there are sufficient carve-outs in the right
places, so that people are not inadvertently brought in. It is also
right to say that the vast majority of remuneration arrangements that
do not involve payments through third parties will be excluded from the
arrangements. They will not be swept up, and that should not be a
problem. It will be an issue only in a minority of
cases.<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000111">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The type of arrangement that we are talking about
is where a third party makes what looks like a loan to an
individual—it does not immediately look like employment
income—but it is not intended that the loan will be repaid, and
the money ends up in the hands of the individual. No tax is paid, so
economically, it is the same as income being paid, but without the tax.

long-term liability not show whether there was any intention of the
loan being repaid?<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000114">&#160;</a>

anti-avoidance rule would not work, nor would trying to extend the
existing system. The solution needs to get to the heart of the problem.
The legislation is complex; I do not deny that in any way, and I think
that all hon. Members would agree. I get the impression that every
member of the Committee spent their lunchtime reading through the
amendments, and I think that there is unanimity on the point that the
proposals are complex. We would argue, however, that they are
necessary.<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000117">&#160;</a>

small, targeted measure introduced, but that would really only be
dancing round the issue; it would leave us pretty well in the position

passing by unaddressed. The approach taken in the legislation before us
may not be preferred by many, but we believe that it will

have followed and why I believe that we are on the right track. We have
consulted very widely. This is the first anti-avoidance measure that
has been subject to consultation; that has never happened before. We
published a draft schedule on 9 December 2010, which generated
considerable interest, and we rightly made amendments as a consequence.
There has been a very constructive dialogue, which I welcome, and I
want to take this opportunity to thank all who contributed to it. The
legislation is undoubtedly in much better shape than it was on 9
December.<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000120">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In response to
that dialogue, HMRC made significant changes to the legislation, which
was published on 31 March 2011, to ensure that various
commercial arrangements were not brought into the charge. The
consequent amendments built on the feedback provided to ensure that the
scope and detail of the exclusions are appropriate. Yes, we have come
forward with various additional amendments in Committee; as the hon.
Member for Gateshead pointed out, this is the stage at which that
should be done. It is not unprecedented. My hon. Friend the Member for
Watford, with his extraordinary recall of detail, pointed out that
while the Government have tabled 90 amendments on disguised
remuneration, in 2008, the previous Government tabled 226 amendments on
residence and domicile. I did an informal check on the response of the
official Opposition, and my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary to the
Treasury, who was the shadow Minister leading then, said that we
welcomed the amendments and indeed had called for a number of
them.<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000121">&#160;</a>

world we would not need to do that. We would publish legislation with
which no one found fault. However, it is important that we continue to
listen and engage. Indeed, a number of sensible and constructive
comments came in after 31 March, and we have tried to reflect
them.<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000122">&#160;</a>

is important to look behind the headline numbers and focus on what
these amendments really involve. As I set out in my letter advising the
Committee of the amendments, they fall into eight themes or strands and
certainly do not represent 90 substantive new ideas or free-standing
changes. A significant number of the amendments are consequential, and
all of them result from the consultation carried out by HMRC. It is
right to say that most of the amendments relate to relieving
provisions. They describe the types of transactions that will not be
caught by the schedule. This will give taxpayers clarity about what is
not included. We recognise the risks of people trying to find and
exploit loopholes, so they are underpinned by anti-avoidance
measures.<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000123">&#160;</a>

worth pointing out that the provision disapplies much of the chapter.
It is a simplifying measure—it is not simply written, I
agree—that makes the practical operation of the legislation much
simpler, because it makes it clear that the other provisions can be

useful for me to say a word or two about some of the areas that we have
specifically carved out, including deferred remuneration arrangements
using third parties, group company transactions, employee car ownership

in unregistered arrangements retain their existing tax treatment,
rather than being covered by this legislation.

everybody’s shoulders dropped. Loans are made for rental
deposits, for example, and IPSA is a third party—he was astute
in identifying it as the type of third party that could be
covered—but there is a carve-out for that, simply because of the
peculiar arrangements that are involved for MPs and because
remuneration is paid through a third-party statutory body. I do not

Friend the Member for Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland mentioned
said about what might constitute a third party. The document lists a
whole plethora of potential third parties that are all, in fact, very
much in line with normal, day-to-day business, particularly for small
businesses that do not have the capacity to run their own payroll. The
document mentions bodies such as an employee benefit trust, a vendor or
purchaser, a payroll agent, a liquidator, a relocation agent, a
conference organiser, and even travel agents or lawyers and
accountants, all of which small businesses may look towards. How can we
ensure that small businesses that use those third parties, which might
make a transfer such as a loan to an employee, are indemnified against
being accountable for that in such third-party
relationships?<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000131">&#160;</a>

have tried to include the necessary carve-outs to reflect proper
commercial arrangements. We have responded to some of the constructive

                           </div>especially where the use of loans is an issue. Loans are used in some of
the most common forms of avoidance, so there cannot be a blanket
exclusion. I should add that the legislation contains a power to make
regulations for further exclusions. That is needed to take account of
future changes to the way in which employers choose to reward their
work force. Although businesses might need to adjust their behaviour to
satisfy themselves of the impact of the legislation, we do not believe
that any innocent arrangements will be
caught.<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000136">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
mischief that we are talking about involves diverting the rewards of
employment through intermediaries, most commonly an employee benefit
trust. Many of those are based in foreign tax havens. The purpose of
those arrangements is to avoid tax by providing what is actually
employment income in a disguised form via a third party, rather than it
going from an employer to an employee directly.<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000137">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
arrangement can appear to mean that the employee has no absolute
entitlement to reward. Some of the more egregious instances have
involved the trustees acting as little more than a corps de ballet
following carefully choreographed and predetermined steps mapped out by
tax advisers. The purpose of that is to disguise the true nature of the
employment income they help provide. That avoidance can also occur in
employment-related share schemes. Clauses 66 and 67 limit how much
tax-privileged deferral of remuneration is available through registered
pension schemes. That will raise £4 billion a year.
Without the action we are taking here, unregistered occupational
pension arrangements would have greater tax advantages than their
registered counterparts for savings above the new annual and lifetime
allowances.<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000138">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Schedule 2
will ensure that third-party arrangements used by employers to provide
reward to employees cannot be used for tax avoidance. It creates an
income tax charge where a third party provides an employee with reward,
recognition or a loan in connection with the employment. The tax charge
will be based on the full amount of the sum, the money used to deliver
value to the employee, or cost or market value—whichever is
higher—where an asset is used. The legislation will mean that
employees benefiting from such schemes will have to pay more tax, but
no more than employees who receive their reward directly from their
employer. In addition, regulations will be brought forward to apply a
class 1 national insurance contribution charge to amounts taxable under
the
measure.<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000139">&#160;</a>

the loan would be from a third party. Under schedule 2, that is caught

It is when they try to avoid paying the tax that schedule 2 will apply.
The legislation does not prevent people paying remuneration in a
particular way. It just ensures that the tax is paid. I will think
further about the example that he gave, but if an individual receives
remuneration through the form of a loan, they need to fall within one
of the carve-outs. Those carve-outs are designed to pick up genuine
commercial arrangements, and during the process we have refined,
improved and expanded the list of carve-outs, so that we catch those

provision in schedule 2 that allows further regulations to be made to
provide further relieving measures and additional carve-outs. We think
that we have got there, but the reason for the provision is that
remuneration packages can evolve and develop, and it is right that we
have the opportunity to examine those new developments and refine the
carve-outs to pick up genuine commercial

I take the Minister back to my previous intervention? I am concerned by
the loan example that he gave. He said that if the loan was not
repayable on a commercial basis then HMRC, through these clauses, would
have an opportunity to look at it. Two questions fall from that. First,
who determines what a commercial basis is? Employees often get a
preferential or even interest free rate for loan repayments. Secondly,
if such a loan repayment plan was put in place, and HMRC thought that
it was inappropriate, could it be changed? What if there was a
condition on that loan that it was repayable in full from the
borrower’s estate at
death?<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000151">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> We are trying to pick up those loans that are paid
out but never paid back. In schedule 2 we have a series of carve-outs
designed to pick out arrangements that are clearly made for genuine,
non tax-driven commercial reasons. That is the structure of schedule 2.
We believe that a broad treatment that will pick up most loans coming
from third parties, and then carve-outs, is the best way to address the
issue.<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000152">&#160;</a>

I put the clause in context, and remind the Committee that we think
that around 5,000 employers use these arrangements, but most employment
income will not be affected. Normal remuneration structures involving
another company in the same group will not affected. We have made that
clear in the Bill, and will do so in the HMRC guidance as
well.<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000153">&#160;</a>

further on this issue, I would also like to make a point about taxi
drivers. It will depend on whether the taxi driver is employed or
self-employed. If the car is already a benefit of the employee then it
will not be affected. It is not remuneration if the owner is using the
car to be a taxi driver. If, however, the car is taken home at the end
of the day then it is taxed as a benefit, but schedule 2 should not be
relevant, as it relates to third parties.<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000154">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I wanted to
make a point about the make-up of organisations and companies. What
happens if a director of a company puts money into it as loan stock,
and then the company, during the course of the repayments of that loan
stock, is sold, which would mean that the company was sold without that
directorship? The director would become a third party of that business,
and the business would start to repay the loans, perhaps. How would
that be looked on in terms of the HMRC regulations? The loan would, at
first sight, seem as if it were going to an individual from an
unconnected third party, but essentially, a commercial transaction
would be taking place between the third party company and the original
director from the first business.<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000163">&#160;</a>

detailed advice, almost, on specific circumstances. What the hon.
Gentleman has described does not sound like
something that the legislation should affect, because the proposals
cover a loan going to an employee from a third party. Loans from
directors to companies, and so on, do not seem relevant. If I have
misunderstood what was described, I will let him know. I may need to
write to him, but I do not think that the proposals would be caught up
in the circumstances that he has mentioned.<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000164">&#160;</a>

confused the issue. A director of a company has put a loan into company
A, but company A is sold to company B, and that director therefore
becomes an employee. He is no longer a director. He has become an
employee, so for the sake of what the Minister is describing this
afternoon, an employee would be receiving a loan from a
third party.<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000165">&#160;</a>

the loan would be going from the employee, first, to one company, and
then there would be some corporate restructuring, and the flow of funds
at that point would be going from the company to the employee, not the
other way round. As I say, if I have understood that correctly, I do
not see that those circumstances would be affected by schedule 2. I
must press on and say a word or two about the amendments; after all,
there are a few of them.<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000166">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The changes
have been made in response to the ongoing dialogue with representative
bodies, and they will ensure that the legislation is better targeted.
The changes will provide greater exclusions, where relevant, or they
will clarify the existing position, and we want to do so in a way that
retains the target of avoidance and does not increase the risk to the
Exchequer. The changes will relax some conditions that excluded a tax
charge; expand the definition of a group; ensure that the tax position
that follows permanent “unearmarking” is right; and,
better allow settlements with HMRC.<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000167">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In relation to
pension arrangements, schedule 2 provides an up-front tax charge where
employers pay contributions to unregistered pension schemes to avoid
the new restrictions on pensions tax relief. We are removing the
possibility of unintentionally imposed tax charges, depending on the
value of the security provided and not on the value of the
contributions the employer was to pay. Such concerns are dealt with by
the relevant amendments, ensuring that the tax charge is appropriately
focused.<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000168">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">There are also
amendments that ensure that the legislation does not interfere with the
legitimate use of deferred remuneration and share schemes to reward
employees. Although there were a number of exclusions within the
initial draft legislation, in some cases, those were too narrow. The
related amendments mean that the employers can continue to use employee
share schemes and pay remuneration in genuine deferred arrangements,
without unexpected tax charges.<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000169">&#160;</a>

this area, because we think this is the right approach to address the
concern. HMRC will need to provide guidance and advice as the rules bed
in. However, resources will be released because it will no longer have
to monitor and challenge the schemes on a case-by-case basis. That
should strengthen HMRC’s ability without increasing demands on
it. It does not create any new requirement for HMRC to identify and

welcomes the additional powers, and we believe that they will be

is a significant issue and a substantial risk to the Exchequer. It is a
widespread problem that is difficult to target. We do not want to dance
around the issue any more. For every step, the avoidance industry makes
a counter-step, but we have marked its card and taken a big step
forward. We have consulted widely and have further targeted the
legislation in response, but the risk tackled by schedule 2
is broad and long-standing. Schedule 2 is needed to maintain a fair tax
system. I hope that I will have the support of the whole
Committee in accepting the amendments, the clause
and the
schedule.<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000184">&#160;</a>

nature of a Finance Bill in these particular circumstances. One of the
overarching aspects from this morning is that my right hon. Friend the
Member for Delyn, who introduced the debate, is merely the asking the
Treasury team and the Minister to reflect a little on the complex
nature of not only schedule 2 but the 88 or so amendments to it, and to
bring back a more coherent and understandable approach on
Report.<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000185">&#160;</a>

it comes to financial knowledge and Finance Bills, we are all lay

amendment 105, that use terminology that I have not come across before.
I am not really sure exactly what it relates to and how we should
cross-reference it. At the very least, the Treasury team could bring
back on Report a coherent analysis of what the provisions actually
mean, what they meant in December, what changes the consultation
exercise allowed the Treasury team to make and the consequences of
those changes. That would provide the Committee and, indeed, the House
with some kind of explanation about which direction we are travelling

When the Bill was originally presented to us, it came with a good set
of explanatory notes, and they helped us to understand the
implications of the clauses, subsections and schedules. However, the
Government amendments do not come with explanatory notes, and that
makes it difficult for us as financial lay people, as my hon. Friend
pointed out, to understand the implications of things that the Minister
is asking us to agree

reading some of the provisions and still have no idea what they mean. I
am disappointed that my hon. Friend the Member for Gateshead has the
Adjournment debate this evening on the east coast line, because
otherwise we would be sitting for three hours on the train north

gained some idea from the Minister of the complexity of the
anti-avoidance industry. We all agree that the purpose of the
legislation is to avoid some of the tricks which, although legal, we
want to exclude. By definition, the legislation should be complicated
for lay people such as the hon. Gentleman and me, because it is meant
to deal with the complexities of the anti-avoidance industry. Would he
agree that this kind of complexity is necessary for highly detailed tax
legislation?<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000195">&#160;</a>

that the anti-avoidance measures in the Bill are welcome. The
Opposition’s contention is that they are so complex that they
will swamp not only small and medium-sized enterprises but HMRC.
Indeed, the main people we want to catch with these regulations are the
bigger offenders and they will find ways and loopholes around them.
There is perhaps a small democratic deficit if members of the Committee
are not really sure what we are talking about and what we are agreeing
to in a very complicated Finance Bill. We should have that

                           </strong> The real factor is that yes, it is complex,
but employees seem to be most caught in this web of complexity. As a
trade union officer in the steel industry, I relocated people and
negotiated relocation packages with Tata to move people from places
like Workington or Hartlepool to Scunthorpe and other steelworks, and
such loans may now be taxable under these regulations. In industries
such as chemical and steel, self-employed contractors are often given
money to provide their own personal protective equipment, which is part
of health and safety regulation. Would that be taxable? We are looking
at practical examples of how the changes will affect the average
working person.

looking at employees who may be innocent bystanders in the examples
that have been highlighted. The taxi driver example emphasised how
employees might be the unintended recipients of a large bill from HMRC,
given that employers put together a complex remuneration package for
such employees. Things such as moving home or, to coin a phrase,
“getting on your bike” to get work and employers paying
for that package of measures may be taxable under these
proposals.<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000198">&#160;</a>

document from the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and
Wales has been referred to in great detail today, and I am sure that
the Scottish equivalents will be similar. The institute questions at
great length, on several pages, when an employer is a third party. I am
not quite sure about all the specifications that it gives, but several
examples are provided; we can all think of small businesses or
employees in our constituencies who might fall into those categories.
The document mentions at great length benefits such as share plans; it
mentions shareholders; and it mentions dividends. The Minister dealt
specifically with dividends in his answer to my hon. Friend the Member
for Walthamstow, but the Institute of Chartered Accountants states that
although tax on the dividend is now collected in PAYE, arrangements for
recognition or award to an employee may be put in place that will
result in those problems. Indeed, it mentions

party organisations may force employers to take potentially offending
services back in-house to avoid falling foul of HMRC regulations. I do
not think that the institute is saying that everyone operating in those
types of business will fall within the regulations—far from it.
However, the last thing a small or medium-sized business needs, when it
complies with every piece of legislation and regulation, is HMRC
crawling all over their accounts and books to try to determine a
complicated matter that that business is using for day-to-day
operational
purposes.<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000208">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> It is important to think about how practical some
of the arrangements will be, and what they will mean for HMRC. I hope
that the Minister has read the original report and the response to the
Treasury, because we found that only 20% of cases referred to the
dedicated investigation teams were adopted. That created a high level
of disillusionment among HMRC employees. Part of the problem had to do
with training, understanding the tax codes, and understanding how to
deal with compliance. That is one reason why a quarter of the civil
investigation cases undertaken were completed within the 18-month
target. Does my hon. Friend share my concern that if it is not clear to
the Committee and

have a further de-motivating effect on HMRC staff, who have to tackle
compliance to ensure that we get all the money owed to the Exchequer?
Does he agree that one of the problems with complexity is that
enforcement is also
harder?<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000209">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> My hon. Friend makes a valuable point. The more
regulation put in place, the more difficult it is to enforce. I bet
that everyone on the Committee has had two constituents come to their
surgery with similar cases where HMRC has advised different things.
That must be part of the training at HMRC. Staffing and staff morale
are key issues. Many employees who work in the HMRC offices in
Haymarket Yards in Edinburgh have come to my surgeries to express their
concern at the lack of not just financial resources, but staff
resources. Although the Government have committed to putting in extra
resources, at a local level—I concede that this might not be the
case across the country—more experienced HMRC staff members on
higher salaries are being moved on, retired, or made redundant. They
are being replaced by younger, cheaper graduates and trainees. The
brain drain from the HMRC office in Edinburgh is having a significant
effect on personal taxation. Indeed, if that kind of personal taxation
problem is not dealt with, all these complex rules coming in on top of
those problems will make HMRC’s work very
difficult.<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000210">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
are two other things that I would like to mention. The first is the red
tape challenge that the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and
Skills has championed. If anybody visits the red tape challenge website
at redtapechallenge.cabinetoffice.gov.uk, they will see that the
Government particularly intend to cut red tape and regulation for small
and medium-sized businesses. That is the thrust of the
Chancellor’s growth package. The website shows various aspects
of regulation and legislation that they want to cut.<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000211">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">An example is
hallmarking, a practice that has gone on for many hundreds of years and
is renowned around the world. Indeed, the assay offices across the
UK—there is one in Edinburgh where many of my constituents
work—are concerned that scrapping hallmarking will cost jobs in
Edinburgh, and we will lose an ancient industry. The Minister is
looking at Mr Gale for some guidance as to whether I am keeping to the
amendment. On the one hand the Government are saying,
“Let’s scrap 600 years of tradition to cut red tape for
small businesses,” and on the other they are producing a
plethora of documents and regulation that people cannot understand or
will not be able to follow. In addition, there are concerns that the
people at HMRC who could give guidance to small businesses will not be
able to do so in the current economic
environment.<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000212">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">A
second point on the red tape challenge relates to the Equality Act
2010. Along with other Members of the Business, Innovation and Skills
Committee, I have pushed the Business Secretary to denounce the front
page of the red tape challenge website, which asks whether the Equality
Act should be scrapped to reduce regulation for small business. The Act
provides for growth and employment opportunities across the equality
spectrum. Do the Government want to slash and burn what is being called
red tape, but I consider a significant move in primary legislation
towards a progressive society? At the same time, they are throwing in
all these regulations

                           </strong> Having run a small business for many years under
both a previous Conservative and a Labour Government, I must say that I
was not aware of any great difference between the two in the level of
regulation or red tape. I wondered whether my hon. Friend was
suggesting that there was a deliberate ploy by Government to push the
burden away from Government and on to small business. For instance, the
reduction in staff employed to enforce the rules would force small
businesses to take on the role of policing such
regulations.<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000214">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> My hon. Friend makes an incredibly important point
about where the liability lands. My right hon. Friend the Member for
Delyn earlier made a point about enforcement. Any tax or company law
avoidance is a criminal offence and should be dealt with properly.
People who try to avoid tax in the ways set out in the legislation are
committing a criminal offence that should be treated as such.<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000215">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The Minister
mentioned the Office for Budget Responsibility in response to an
earlier intervention. Has the OBR factored in the additional burden on
business, and will any of this affect the growth agenda? The OBR has
obviously assessed the Bill as a whole, through the Chancellor’s
Budget statement in April. However, I wonder if it has assessed whether
this particular part is a stimulus for growth or not. Everyone would
want us to close loopholes that enable tax avoidance and evasion.
However, how compatible are the £750 million going to
the Treasury, the additional moneys to HMRC, the additional burdens on
small business, the potential impact on growth, and the contradiction
between the red tape challenge and the additional burden of complex
regulations?<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000216">&#160;</a>

the history of the world when a Chancellor has come to any Dispatch Box
in any Parliament and championed a Budget for growth that has reduced
growth every year; the independent Office

no defence in law, but some employees will be trapped by the proposals
and will get a bill from HMRC. To go off on a slight tangent for a
second, the biggest complaint I get about HMRC is that it is incredibly
aggressive in claiming back money and dealing with individuals. As
ignorance is no defence in law, employees could be caught in the
provisions through ignorance, and HMRC will go after them quite
vociferously. Indeed, I had an 82-year-old man at my constituency
surgery a few months ago who had received a letter from HMRC
saying—I paraphrase—that it would be sending HMRC
officers to his house to pin his valuables and assets in order to pay
off his debt of £56.73. That debt did not actually exist; it was

an important point about the functioning of HMRC, especially where
there is complexity, as there is in the provisions before us. I, too,
have had people coming to my surgery about that. Would he agree that
part of the problem is sometimes the language that is used by HMRC in
its communications, and that this complexity will not make things any
better?<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000226">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> My hon. Friend gets to the heart of the problem
with HMRC. Indeed, we have all experienced problems with it. While tax
collection, the closing of tax loopholes and stopping tax avoidance are
important, HMRC does not always get it right, and it goes after people
aggressively. That makes these complex regulations all the more
disheartening for small businesses. All they really want to do,
particularly in the current climate, is run the business, tread water,
do well, get through this particular bit of uncertainty, re-elect a
Labour Government and allow the economy to grow disproportionately
after
that.<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000227">&#160;</a>

shares my view that the staff who work for HMRC are dedicated, very
knowledgeable people who will adapt to any circumstances. However, does
he share my concern that the Minister is perhaps being unduly
optimistic when he makes the assessment that additional training above
and beyond that normally undertaken following a Budget will not
necessarily be required, especially given the complexity of what we are

criticising HMRC staff, because they do a marvellous job under
incredibly difficult circumstances. I think it was my hon. Friend the
Member for Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland who mentioned that
when the public or small businesses—or anyone, in
fact—contacts HMRC, they do so, in the main, for all the wrong
reasons. From the start, therefore, the circumstances are particularly
difficult, and the vast majority of HMRC staff do a marvellous job
dealing with such problems, often in situations that are incredibly
stressful and hostile.<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000229">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Before we move on to loans, my hon. Friend made
a point about how the changes will impact on staff. Surely the key
issue is that there will be fewer staff, due to the very high numbers
of redundancies being pushed through by the Government. That will put
staff under increasing pressure. The levels of training and new
knowledge required, therefore, will be far higher than would normally
be the case after a Budget. That is the key issue; there is more
information for fewer people to learn and
apply.<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000231">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> My hon. Friend is absolutely right, and the
information that has come directly from the Treasury about HMRC is that
there will be a 15% overall resource cut, and a 25% efficiency saving,
which has been mentioned already. The £900 million for tax
avoidance is certainly not new money, because it is a replacement for
those efficiency savings, or for that shrinking budget. That was
emphasised by the Chartered Institute of Taxation, and we have heard
this already, but it bears repeating. It has said that as it
stands,<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000232">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“the
legislation, which includes 14 separate tax avoidance tests, was likely

their particular
circumstances.”<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000533">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Considering
how complicated those circumstances may be, we could reach a situation
where every single business in the country—whether small,
medium-sized, or bigger, and whether the people in them are
self-employed or otherwise—might contact HMRC with incredibly
complex personal circumstances. HMRC would have to give a judgment on
their concerns. That judgment may not necessarily be correct, because
the regulations that the Minister is promoting are so complex that they
would make an insomniac sleep. As we have discussed, they were
incredibly complicated to run through at lunchtime.<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000233">&#160;</a>

has a problem. I feel sorry for its staff, and I would be interested to
hear how the Public and Commercial Services Union would respond to
issues that we have raised, from the point of view of supporting the
majority of the work force at HMRC, whom it
represents.<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000234">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> It seems a strange irony that the body responsible
for collecting all taxation in the country, and for regulating the
collection of taxation, whether

                           </div>through self-assessment, PAYE, corporation tax or VAT, has a shrinking
budget. In times of austerity, people may think that HMRC would be
given more resources. This statistic is from memory, so it may be
incorrect, but for every HMRC employee, around £400,000 is
collected for the Exchequer—my memory is not as good as that of
the hon. Member for Watford, even though I studied law, too. I cannot
remember why I studied it in the first place.<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000236">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There is a
real dilemma here. In times of financial difficulty, when every single
penny coming into the Exchequer is needed, and there is somewhere
between £40 billion and £120 billion of either
uncollected tax or tax avoidance in the economy, depending on what
estimates are used, we should plough money into HMRC, so that it has
the resources to collect those funds. In my view, the legislation is
overly complex, because HMRC is under-resourced, and if it were not
under-resourced, it would be far easier to look at tax avoidance
measures.<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000237">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I will now
move on to loans, which the Minister has discussed in great detail. The
Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales made its view
clear in the first sentence of its response to the
proposals:<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000238">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“The
exemption for loans is not broad enough.”<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000534">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Minister spoke
eloquently and at great length about carve-outs, but the ICAEW has
stated that the exemptions for loans are not broad enough. It mentions
reward and recognition for employees in that regard, and the issue of
what could constitute an unpayable
loan.<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000239">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Let
us take the example of an employee who is awarded £1,000 in a
reward scheme. Who determines whether that is a loan? Who determines
whether that is to be repaid? Who determines whether there is tax
avoidance in that payment? The business that gives that reward and
recognition to that employee would have to phone up HMRC and—I
do not say this flippantly—perhaps spend half an hour, 45
minutes or an hour trying to get through. It will then speak to an
adviser and have to be put on to a specialist unit, because not all
HMRC staff can be retrained. That specialist unit will have to ring
them back, as anyone who has recently dealt with HMRC will know, and
they often ring back with a different perspective on the question
asked, instead of replying to the one that needs answering. This whole
churn is going on while the poor employee is waiting for the bonus, and
while the squeaky-clean employer is, quite rightly, going round trying
to find an answer to their questions about the perceived loan that is
being given. That is why I thought that it was important to press the
Minister on loans that are given to
employees.<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000240">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">An
employer could give a loan of £1,000 through a third party to an
employee and that could be repaid at £50 a month with no
interest. Is that market value for loan repayment? I would suggest not,
because the amount paid for a £1,000 loan over a period of time
would certainly be more than that if interest were payable on it. If it
was determined that that was not market value, would the employee be
hit with anything up to 40% tax on that loan as a benefit through the
payroll system? What happens if the loan is constructed so that it is
paid back at 10p a week for life and then, when the employee passes on,
the remainder of that loan is repayable from the estate? That is a
commercial loan, and many loans—perhaps not even through
companies—are constructed in that way. Indeed, buy-back
mortgages for elderly people work in that way. They can borrow money on

			Column number: 299<a class="bkMark" name="Column299">&#160;</a>
                           </div>their house, and the house then reverts to a third party. I know that
that is slightly different, but it is a practical example of how people
in their day-to-day lives view such benefits, and they could be caught
in the
middle.<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000241">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">To
conclude, my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield Central mentioned
that the proposal fails the small business agenda, and it certainly
does. If anyone has run a small a business or knows someone who has, it
will be clear to them that all the owner wants to do is run the
day-to-day affairs. Every single small business owner in the country
has a great affection for their employees and vice-versa—I am
not sure that there are many exceptions to that—and they want,
therefore, to reward employees in the best way possible. They do not
want to avoid tax or go through loopholes, but they may be reluctant to
reward, given the complexity of the proposal. Even after the amendments
were brought forward following the consultation, the Institute of
Chartered Accountants in England and Wales
said:<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000242">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“We
still believe that the current structure and fundamental
principles…are wrong. While we understand the wish to avoid
leaving scope for abuse we do not accept that it can be right to impose
severely penal tax charges on a wide range of very common commercial
remuneration
arrangements.”<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000535">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

agenda.<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000243">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We
have had a long debate today on what everyone will agree is an
important clause. I re-emphasise that any tax avoidance measures are
welcome, but they have to be clear, as simple as possible and
understandable. That is why we are asking the Treasury team to go away
before Third Reading and find a simplified way of presenting the
information, so that we can make a proper determination on it. That
would be the best way to proceed. Some of the debate that we have had
today highlights the complexity of the legislation and why we need to
reflect on what we are trying to achieve.<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000244">&#160;</a>

not, and I hope that he will accept that. We are simply trying to
reflect strongly the concerns outside the Committee on these key

three areas. As we have discussed, those areas are: loans that will not
be repaid; making assets available to an employee via a trust; and
questions on an effective pension cap. Clause 26 and schedule 2 will
bring about £750 million into the Treasury, and they
will tighten up the existing loopholes. I do not oppose the principle
behind what the Minister has said, and for that reason I will not
oppose the Government amendments. This might seem illogical, but I want
to give him an opportunity to have a break over the next four to five
weeks to look at the issues seriously.

will not oppose the amendments, if the Minister is not willing to
withdraw the clause and schedule as amended, I will ask my hon. Friends
to vote against them. That is not because we want to forgo the
£750 million. If the Minister decided after the pause that he
wanted to bring back the clause in the same form, we would not oppose
it on Report or Third Reading. I want to give him an opportunity to
reflect on what the Opposition have said on behalf of a number of

saying that the Institute of Chartered Accountants states in paragraph
4 of its latest submission, which was written after the

                        <p class="hs_brev">“Our

                        </p>
                        <p>There are three pages of
concerns, which are not addressed by the amendments, including about
definition, enforcement and complexity. On those questions, the
schedule will fall short of achieving the objectives that we both
share, even when amended.<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000249">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There are real
concerns about definition in the Bill. For example, the words
“reasonable chance”, which will not be amended, are used
on page 65. “Reasonable chance” is open to so many
definitions and so much legal interpretation that the resulting lack of
clarity will damage the Minister’s objective. The Minister could
reconsider the Bill and discuss it with colleagues outside the House
before bringing back clear legislation that meets the three tests that
he has set. Then we would not have to have the range of exclusions in
the Government amendments. Those exclusions will ultimately lead to
further confusion and complexity
downstream.<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000250">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
Minister should not take our opposition to his revised clause as a
spending commitment or as a concern for the loss of that revenue,
because it is not. Let me be clear about that. If the Minister will not
accept our suggestion of a pause for thought, that is our attempt to
force him into one. If that fails, we will look at it outside, and
might table our own amendments on Report to clarify the matter. I could
have tabled hundred of amendments to this legislation; I chose the task
of applying a “delete” option to the clause, because we
feel the clause needs a substantial rethink. We will not oppose the
amendments, but if the Minister will not withdraw the schedule and the
clause, we will vote against and give him a chance to reflect more
comprehensively over the next few
weeks.<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000251">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I can understand why the Opposition would want to
raise questions about legislation, particularly when it is complex and
controversial. I can understand representative bodies raising concerns.
However, I have to underline to the Committee the fact that we are
talking about an independently verified assessment that
the measures will bring in additional revenues of
£750 million. If there were an easy way to do it in simple
terms, we would have done it. I would rather the legislation were on
two pages, not 66. However, we do not believe those other options would
be as effective, or, if they were, they would be equally
complex.<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000252">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">It is important
that we move on, and that the Committee shows its determination to
tackle this form of tax avoidance. Were we to reject this legislation,
the signal we sent would be most unfortunate, suggesting a lack of
willingness. If there were an alternative way to do it, the Opposition
could have tabled amendments. This matter has been debated, it has been
out in the open and we introduced the draft legislation in December. If
there is an easier solution, we would welcome constructive amendments.
We do not believe that is the case. The Committee would make a
significant mistake if it struck down this clause and schedule. If hon.
Members want to address this serious problem and loss of
revenue to the Exchequer, there are better ways of allocating
£750 million than opposing the legislation. I urge
the Committee to support the clause and
schedule.<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000253">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The clause introduces schedule 3 to allow the
new anti-avoidance measures to prevent the abuse of tax reliefs on
charitable donations for income tax, corporation tax and capital gains
tax. I think we all agree that the whole point of charitable donations
should be to benefit a charity, so it is right to continue to crack
down on misuse for tax avoidance purposes. Our amendment is designed to
ensure that the Treasury reviews the impact of the new rules to
determine the most appropriate and effective means of doing
so.<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000416">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The Finance Act
2006 introduced the substantial donor rules, which applied where a
donor made a charitable donation of at least £25,000 over 12
months or at least £100,000 over six years. The substantial
donor rules limited tax relief where the donor entered into a
subsequent transaction with the charity from which the donor benefited.
It is necessary to tackle such tax avoidance measures, of course, but
charities raised concerns about the application of the 2006 rules in
practice. Some reported that innocent donations were being wrongly
caught and that the rules had the potential to deter much-needed and
genuine substantial
donors.<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000417">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Given
the increased burden on the charitable sector from the big society
agenda and the cut in local authority grants, charities are basically
being asked to do more for less money. Now is the time when charities
can least afford to lose potential donations. Charities also reported
that the substantial donor rules added to their administrative burden,
as they were required to hold records on both substantial donors and
their connected parties. As the charities were responsible for ensuring
compliance, it was they who were held responsible for any
penalties.<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000418">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Following
consultation with charities, it was clear that there was scope for
improvement, and that was why the 2009 pre-Budget report announced the
intention to replace the substantial donor rules with new rules to deny
tax relief on donations to charities when the donor was party to an
arrangement the purpose, or one of the main purposes, of which was to
extract value from the charity. That is the context of schedule 3,
which accordingly introduces a purpose test and sets out the three
criteria that must be met for a donation to be classed as tainted and
consequently as ineligible for tax
relief.<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000419">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Treasury’s consultation on the draft legislation
stated:<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000420">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“The
new legislation is intended to catch only donors (or persons connected
to them) who, in respect of a donation to charity, have entered into
arrangements with the purpose of receiving an advantage from the
charity.”<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000537">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>The
intention of schedule 3 is, accordingly, to ensure that anti-avoidance
legislation targets only people who have made a donation for personal
gain, does not wrongly catch out or discourage genuine philanthropic
donors and does not penalise the charitable organisation unless they
have knowingly entered into the avoidance arrangement. Can the Minister
tell us how many, or what proportion of, charitable donations over the
past five years have been deemed to breach the existing substantial
donor rules, and whether the Government have an estimate of the
proportion of them that were wrongly judged to have broken the
rules?<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000421">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
am also interested to know whether the Government have any indication
of the number of potential substantial donors who were deterred by the
regulations, because it is important to have as much information as
possible about the apparent weaknesses of the previous system to ensure
that the provisions in schedule 3 are the appropriate
solution.<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000422">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">A
common concern raised during the 2008 consultation was that the
substantial donor rules were complex and insufficiently targeted, and
it is not clear—as I shall come on to discuss—whether
schedule 3 addresses that concern. The Government published draft
legislation in December on the tainted charitable donations provisions 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 317<a class="bkMark" name="Column317">&#160;</a>
                           </div>and the consultation on it was welcomed. The responses were informative
but, although many of them welcomed the review of the substantial donor
rules, the draft proposals did not receive a glowing endorsement. For
example, Russell-Cooke solicitors noted
that:<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000423">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“on
a close analysis, these new rules may also catch genuine donations (for
example, a sale at an undervalue), and many are now querying whether or
not the tainted charity donations rules will improve the current
position.”<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000538">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">James
Kessler, QC, the author of “Taxation of Charities”,
described the proposals as<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000424">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                        </p>
                        <p>and
concluded
that<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000426">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“the
tainted donation rules are unfit for purpose, and…would
seriously damage charities and charity
fundraising.”<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000539">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>Worryingly,
he also highlighted a number of inaccuracies in the explanatory notes,
including the wrongful assertion that a donation to a hospital in
return for treatment would qualify for gift aid. Under the Income Tax
Act 2007 that is clearly not the case, as there is an
obvious benefit attached to the donation. I am glad to say that that
inaccuracy has been corrected in the final version of the notes, but it
raises questions about the level of consideration given to the existing
legislation and to the draft
proposals.<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000427">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
intention is clearly to ensure that innocent donors and charities are
not penalised, but James Kessler unfortunately came to the conclusion
that the tainted donor
regulations<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000428">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“are
not better for the charitable sector than the substantial donor rules.
They are in fact
worse.”<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000540">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>Similarly,
the Law Society warned that the suggested replacement of the
substantial donor rules is complex, and the uncertainties that are
likely to result seem contrary to the Government’s stated aim to
promote greater predictability, stability, simplicity, scrutiny and
transparency in the UK tax system. That body has also expressed its
concern that the legislation may not be easy to follow and apply in
practice.<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000429">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Some
modifications have been made to the draft legislation—the
Minister might want to comment in more detail about the changes that
were made in response to the consultation—but things that the
Law Society, and others, have reservations about, including the lack of
a minimum level for donations that could be considered tainted, and the
potential for charities to be held jointly and severally liable,
remains in schedule 3. Although many people criticised the previous
rules for being insufficiently targeted, it seems that they are now
concerned about the potential impact of broadening the scope of the
anti-avoidance measures to include all donations, not just, as within
the substantial donor rules, donations of more than £25,000 or
£100,000 in the given period. Have the Government given any
consideration to whether that might discourage donors? Also, will
charities have to be cautious with all donations to ensure that none of
them may be considered
tainted?<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000430">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">A
prime objective in replacing the substantial donor rules seems to be to
ensure that charities do not pay the penalty for a donor’s
mistake or abuse of the system. However, it seems that that objective
will not necessarily be achieved. Proposed new section 809ZN, which is
in schedule 3 of the Bill, makes it clear that a charity will be held
liable only if it was “party to” the arrangements, but
whether a charity was or was not aware of such arrangements could be
open to misinterpretation. Will the Minister give more information
about where the burden of proof will fall and what criteria will be
used 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 318<a class="bkMark" name="Column318">&#160;</a>
                           </div>to judge a charity’s liability? Are the Government satisfied that
there are sufficient safeguards to ensure that charities are not
wrongly
accused?<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000431">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Regarding
the three Conditions set out in proposed new section 809ZJ in schedule
3, the Institute of Chartered Accountants expressed concerns that
Conditions A and B could bring within the new provisions many
arrangements that are not the intended target of this new legislation.
It is important to ensure that the regulations do not target genuine
philanthropic donors, and Condition A accordingly requires some proof
of intent. Although the explanatory notes to the Bill provide a number
of examples in which Condition A may or may not apply, the term
“reasonable to assume” that Condition A relies on to a
large extent seems rather vague and open to subjective interpretation.
Will the Minister provide more information about who will be the
arbiter of that issue and the criteria they will use?<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000432">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In contrast to
the substantial donor rules, the tainted donation rules include only
people living together as husband and wife or civil partners, trustees
and connected companies, rather than most immediate family members.
Although that may represent a simplification, the new rules introduce
the problem of associated donations, whereby all tax reliefs are
disallowed on donations connected to the tainted donation even if they
are not tainted directly. Accordingly, doubts have been raised about
whether that achieves the Government’s aim of focusing on the
purpose of an arrangement.<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000433">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On publishing
the draft legislation, the Treasury estimated that the tainted charity
donation provisions would cost £10 million per annum, due to the
projected rise in tax relief claims. Will the Minister say how that
estimate was arrived at, how many donors the provisions are expected to
affect and by how much charitable donations are expected to
increase?<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000434">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It is also
unclear how the rules on tainted donations will be applied and how
tainted donations will be monitored if the starting point is to be tax
return audits. With no limit on donations, it seems that every donation
on which relief is claimed could be examined, so how will HMRC decide
which claims should be investigated and how will HMRC apply the purpose
test?<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000435">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">If new rules
are to reduce the administrative burden on charities, they need to be
simple to understand and administer, but they have been described as
user-unfriendly and the Treasury itself concedes that they could mean
that donors incur more costs in seeking accountancy advice on the
validity of their donation arrangement. Therefore, we want to ensure
that schedule 3 is not unnecessarily complex and represents a
significant improvement on the substantial donor rules in terms of ease
of administration for HMRC, the administrative burden placed on
charities, the incentive for potential donors and, of course, the
reliability of the test.<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000436">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
reservations that I have outlined indicate that there are doubts about
how the tainted donation rules can be applied in practice and about the
impact that they will have on charities. It is also clear that the
consultation on the substantial donor rules proved very informative in
highlighting the weaknesses and unintended consequences of that regime.
Therefore, I encourage the Minister to consider our amendment, so that
the impact, effectiveness and scope for potential improvement to the
provisions are kept under review.<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000437">&#160;</a>

Clause 27, along with schedule 3, introduces new anti-avoidance rules
to replace the anti-avoidance rules on substantial donors to charities.
As we have heard, the path that we have taken to the clauses that we
are discussing started back in 2008, when the first formal consultation
on the existing anti-avoidance legislation was undertaken.
In Budget 2009, there was an announcement that further informal
consultation would take place with charities, their representative
bodies, large donors to charities and charity tax professionals to
develop a replacement for the existing rules. That informal
consultation took place during the summer of 2009.<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000438">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In the 2009
pre-Budget report, there was an announcement that the existing rules
would be replaced with new rules based on a purpose test. As part of
clause 27 and schedule 3, we set out that purpose test. On coming to
office, the Government confirmed in the June Budget our commitment to
replacing the existing
rules.<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000439">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
is probably worth setting out why it is important to take donor abuse
seriously. Charities and their donors receive a generous package of tax
reliefs designed to encourage and support charitable giving, in fact in
total the reliefs are worth more than £3 billion each year.
Unfortunately, as the Committee can imagine, that generosity attracts
not only people who wish to support charitable activities but those who
seek to gain a financial advantage for themselves by avoiding tax, so
we need anti-avoidance legislation to ensure that we can counter that
abuse.<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000440">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">A significant
area of abuse of charitable tax reliefs is donors’ abusing their
control of a charity. Large donors are often in a position of influence
and may look for ways to extract the funds that they have donated to
the charity after they have received tax relief on them. It is worth
pointing out that the vast majority of such donor-controlled charities
act with complete propriety, but a small minority are involved in
abusive behaviour, which puts at risk the good name of all charities in
the UK. The new rules will counter that behaviour. They will also mean
that the taxpayer’s money that we, as a country, want to use to
support charities will go more holistically towards doing so, and we
will not see an element of it being, in effect, siphoned off to people
who should not have been eligible for tax relief in the first
place.<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000441">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
is widely accepted that the rules were poorly targeted. The burden was
on the charity, both administratively and financially, and it, not the
offending donor, was liable for any tax loss if an offending donor was
caught. Furthermore, the rules caught unintended transactions and
discouraged large, genuinely philanthropic donations to charity. Quite
simply, the substantial donor rules were not fit for purpose, and work
on reforming them rightly began under the previous
Government.<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000442">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">HMRC’s
consultation has been broad and inclusive, and everyone agrees that,
although it is essential to counter real abuse of tax reliefs, we
cannot leave legislation in place that deters genuine donors from
supporting charities. The change is supported. Nicola Evans, of the law
firm Bircham Dyson Bell, said that
it<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000443">&#160;</a>

                        <p>The
hon. Member for Bristol East mentioned James Kessler, and he is a part
of the HMRC working group looking at the rules, but most people in the
working group have welcomed the changes. Those who oppose them
generally do not approve of any anti-avoidance rules at all. Therefore,
the opinions that she quoted are, first, not the views of the majority
and, secondly, certainly not the views of the Government, because we
want to ensure that the £3 billion of taxpayers’ money
for tax relief on charitable giving has integrity. The new rules are
the culmination of an extensive consultation, which ensures that
unintended transactions are not
caught.<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000445">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">At the centre
of the new rules is a new purpose test that must be satisfied before
they are triggered. First, has the donor, or someone connected with
them, entered into arrangements with the intention of receiving some
sort of financial advantage from the charity over and above any tax
relief properly due on the donation? Secondly, would the donation and
the arrangements have been made independently of each other? If the
donor would not have made the donation without the prospect of a
financial advantage, the donation will be deemed to be a
“tainted donation”, and the tax relief that would have
been due on it will be
denied.<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000446">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
vast majority of donations to charity are not caught by the
legislation, because the vast majority of donors do not donate to gain
a financial advantage. When abuse occurs, it will be the dodgy donors,
rather than charities, who will have to pay the additional tax. The one
exception is when a charity knowingly becomes involved in an
arrangement that results in a tainted donation, but it is not possible
to obtain the tax from the donor. That, however, would be a last resort
and it is only in place to prevent such deliberately contrived
arrangements that would seek to undermine the
rules.<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000447">&#160;</a>

                        </h4>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
new legislation will also largely repeal, in two years’ time,
the current rules in relation to substantial donors to charities. In
the meantime, there will be a transitional period, during which people
who have made donations before 6 April 2011 may still be caught by the
substantial donor rules. The only limited scope for a substantial donor
to be caught after the two-year transition period is when they enter
into a contract before April 2013, but payment under that contract is
deferred until after that date. This is anti-avoidance legislation and
not catching that situation would allow people to circumvent the old
and the new
rules.<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000448">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
new rules will cost an extra £10 million to the Exchequer, but
that is an extra £10 million in tax relief, because donations
that have been disallowed or discouraged under the old rules will no
longer be caught. Effectively, that means that more will be given to
charity. The hon. Member for Bristol East has asked what impact the
clause will have. It is anticipated that it will mean an extra
£10 million in tax relief to
charities.<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000449">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
I have said, the consultation undertaken over a number of years, under
both this Government and the previous one, has helped to develop the
underlying

			Column number: 321<a class="bkMark" name="Column321">&#160;</a>
                           </div>principles for the new rules. The group of interested parties that we
set up to work alongside HMRC helped significantly in the development
of those principles, and their comments on the draft clauses have
resulted in several significant changes, ensuring that the rules target
real abuse of charity tax
relief.<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000450">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On
amendment 96, the impact of all the measures has been published in
their respective tax information and impact notes. The note for this
measure was published alongside the draft legislation on 9 December. I
shall explain it further for the benefit of the Committee and hope to
resolve any remaining queries. Charities will be helped by the new
rules, because they move the compliance burden away from charities and
on to donors. As I have said, the cost of £10 million to the
Exchequer represents additional tax relief on donations, so those
charities that will benefit will do so, all together, by £10
million each
year.<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000451">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
have not made an estimate of the additional cost for individual donors,
but it is likely to be very small. Obviously, most donors simply make a
donation and then enter into an arrangement with the charity. Those
donors will be unaffected by the new rules and will incur no costs. The
majority of donors who enter into arrangements with a charity will not
be caught by the new rules, because their purpose will not be to obtain
a financial advantage. They will not, therefore, need to consider this
legislation. As for those individuals who seek to gain a financial
advantage, HMRC does not generally estimate the administrative burden
of trying to avoid tax. Presumably, the harder and higher, the
better.<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000452">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">My
final point on the amendment is that the door has not closed on this
legislation. The impact of the new rules will be reviewed by a
sub-group of the HMRC charity tax forum, which has proved helpful in
working with me as a Treasury Minister and with HMRC over recent months
to help us develop not just this legislation but the whole philanthropy
package that we introduced in the Budget. I am sure that we will
discuss that package later. The first meeting of the HMRC charity tax
forum to review the new rules is anticipated by the end of the year. If
it becomes apparent that innocent donors are being caught by the new
rules—although we do not anticipate that—we will, of
course, look at what changes we might need to introduce in a future
Finance Bill. I hope that I have reassured the hon. Lady that we keep a
watching brief on the issue. We want to make sure that, although they
are complex, the rules operate as
intended.<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000453">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
conclusion, the new tainted charitable donation rules represent a huge
improvement on the substantial donor rules. The new rules have been
broadly greeted by a number of charity representatives, who are keen
for them to be included in the Bill. The new rules remove the
administrative burdens imposed on charities by the substantial donor
rules. The vast majority of donors will be unaffected. A donor will
always know if they have entered into arrangements with the purpose of
getting a financial advantage in return for a donation. It will be the
donor, not the charity, that is liable for any tax charge. The new
rules will protect the Exchequer from the abuse of the UK’s
generous charity tax reliefs, leaving charities to concentrate on
building their relationships with donors and making their contribution

                           </strong> I have a question on clause 31 as a whole. The
clause amends an aspect of de-grouping charge rules in the corporation
tax regime for chargeable gains. I want to raise the issue of
intangible assets, which are not included in the clause. I am
interested as to why they have not been included. For example, if I
bought a hotel, I might also buy the goodwill for that hotel. If I sell
the hotel, the intangible asset will still attract a tax charge if the
goodwill was bought after April 2002. There seems to be an
inconsistency between the pre and post-2002 intangible arrangements.
There seems to be no sensible reason not to revise the intangible asset
rules to harmonise the treatment of tangible and intangibles in this
matter. I welcome the Minister’s comments now, or, if not now, I
would welcome some reflection

                           </strong> Clause 31 ensures that companies cannot avoid
corporation tax on chargeable gains by using complex arrangements that
seek to exploit a perceived loophole in the de-grouping charge rules. A
de-grouping charge ensures that tax is paid on gains when, instead of
selling an asset directly, a group of companies sells a company that
owns an asset. Otherwise, there could be a loss of tax, whether as a
result of normal commercial arrangements or through tax
avoidance.<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000474">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> These amendments make changes to ensure that

including CFCs, to elect prospectively to change the currency in which

                           </div>they prepare their accounts—their functional currency—for
tax purposes. It also stops changes in companies’ functional
currency having a tax effect until the accounting period following the
change. The deferral of a tax effect to the change in functional
currency blocks an avoidance scheme that allowed companies
retrospectively to crystallise foreign exchange losses for tax
purposes. Following the publication of the Bill, it came to
HMRC’s attention that certain provisions in the CFC code prevent
the restriction on the timing of the tax effect of a functional
currency election from applying to
CFCs.<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000485">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendments ensure that UK resident companies with interests in CFCs
will not be able to change the functional currency of the CFC with the
benefit of hindsight to realise a foreign exchange loss for tax
purposes to reduce or avoid a CFC apportionment. The amendment will
apply to multinational groups with CFCs and protects tax revenue in the
low hundreds of millions per
year.<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000486">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Although
the amendments may at first sight appear to be pre-empting the wider
CFC reform, their effect is to ensure that schedule 7 applies to CFCs
in the same way as it applies to UK investment companies.
Schedule 7 benefits companies by allowing them to elect
prospectively to change their functional currency for tax purposes. The
amendment is, therefore, not counter to the direction of CFC reform.
The amendments ensure that the avoidance opportunity that the original
measure was designed to close is blocked for controlled foreign
companies in the same way that it is blocked for UK investment
companies. I therefore urge the Committee to accept the
amendments.<a class="bkMark" name="1105203000487">&#160;</a>
