<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I welcome Committee members back to our proceedings. I look forward to our making brisk but orderly progress.

<H4><center>Clause 12</center></H4>
<H4><center>Maintenance of interception capability</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Oliver Heald </B>(North-East Hertfordshire): I beg to move amendment No. 49, in page 13, line 45, after ``order'', add
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`, a draft of which has been laid before Parliament and approved by a resolution of each House,'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, we may take the following amendments: No. 50, in page 14, line 27, at end add-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(aa) such persons appearing to him to be consumers of public postal services or public telecommunications services,'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
No. 51, in page 14, line 28, after ``(a)'', insert ``and (aa)''.

<P>
No. 52, in clause 73, page 76, line 43, after ``section'', insert ``and section 12''.

<P>
No. 53, in clause 73, page 76, line 45, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) Section 12 of this Act shall come into force on such day as the Secretary of State may by order appoint, save that he shall not appoint such a day unless he has made a statement to the House of Commons to the effect:<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) that such obligations as it appears to him reasonable to impose for the purpose of section 12(1) of this Act would be-

<P>
(i) technically competent for the purpose; and

<P>
(ii) proportionate thereto; and

<P>
(b) that he has assessed the costs of compliance and-

<P>
(i) that they are reasonable and

<P>
(ii) that he shall make a contribution thereto;
<P>
and he shall specify the amount of that contribution.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> As ever, Mr. O'Hara, we are committed to making speedy progress, although we shall not let the Minister off lightly. We shall scrutinise the clause carefully-its provisions are crucial to the internet industry and to internet consumers.

<P>
The press's view of the Bill has started to emerge. I wonder whether the Minister noticed that last Sunday's The Observer described the Bill as the ``worst UK legislation ever''. The Financial Times stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>technical experts point out that  the ability to monitor communications is technically classed as a flaw<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
which
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>may have unpredictable results in terms of the workings of the security system as a whole.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
In other words, in the interests of law enforcement, the Government is proposing regulations that undermine the mechanisms needed to ensure authentication, integrity of data and the confidentiality in e-commerce. Those concerns involve the details of the clause.

<P>
I shall begin, however, by raising some preliminary points. It became clear last summer that there were technical problems with the provision of an intercept capability, but nothing seems to have been done since then, and it was only in January that external consultants were asked to find a solution. Will the Minister confirm the identity of the consultants concerned? Is the Smith Group of Guildford going to produce the report? I tabled a written question that asked whether the Home Secretary would
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>list the external consultants used by his Department since 1997, excluding public relations and marketing consultants, and their cost.-[Official Report, House of Commons, 14 March 2000; Vol. 346, c. 168W.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The answer does not mention the Smith Group, but is it involved? If not, which of the companies that are listed in the Home Secretary's answer is involved? I have researched the matter, but none of those companies appears to be the appropriate consultant for this job.

<P>
Numerous industry bodies raised technical concerns about this part of the Bill. As I said previously, the Federation of the Electronics Industry tried to explain the complications of intercepting packet-switched networks, and I quoted the comments of Mr. Wills-Sandford. Amendment No. 49 seeks to ensure that, in relation to this fast-moving tableau of technical change, when an order setting out the generic obligations on internet service providers and others is laid under the provisions of clause 12(1), the House will debate it and ensure that it is competent and proportionate.

<P>
The clause will give the Secretary of State two powers: to set generic obligations, under subsection (1), and to serve notices on individual communications service providers requiring steps to be taken to implement the provisions of clause 1, which involve the intercept capability.

<P>
The concerns that have been expressed fall into a number of categories, but into one in particular. The Minister has kindly sent us a document from a company, which I believe that he has named, so I shall mention it: Demon, which is owned by Thus plc. It deals with one aspect of intercept capability, namely that of tackling the issue of dialled-up access. However, we are moving towards an environment in which that kind of access might no longer be current, even in a year's time.

<P>
Against that background, the House of Commons should have the ability to examine any order being laid to set out these obligations as the technology changes. It is all very well to offer a partial solution to one aspect of the problem now, which is, in essence, what the Demon document addresses. However, that does not, and cannot, deal with future problems. That gives us cause for concern.

<P>
The Government seem to be saying three things: first, that they are committed to consultation under clause 6(6); secondly, that there are grounds for believing that it will be technically possible to provide the facility; and thirdly, that they can be trusted not to put disproportionate burdens on business. Only when one understands the seriousness of this business does one appreciate how important it is to debate the matter.

<P>
The Internet Services Providers Association makes the point that the Home Office is working with consultants, and that one proposal is to place interception boxes on to the networks. Internet service providers spend huge amounts of time and money ensuring that their networks are efficient and safe. They have told me that they would not be happy to accept interception boxes on their networks, especially if they did not know how they operated. They believe that strict security checks and inspections would be necessary before such boxes could be accepted on to the networks. The internet service providers are very keen to work with the Government but they want assurances, and I ask the Minister for those assurances today.

<P>
British Telecome is very interested in this aspect of the Bill, and states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The mechanism for deciding what is a ``reasonable intecept capability'' will be a key factor in ensuring the successful implementation of the Bill and avoiding putting the UK at a commercial disadvantage to the rest of the world. This will be the subject of secondary legislation and the effect of the Bill can only be adequately judged in the light of a draft requirements document.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The wording of the order will be important and it seems wrong, therefore, that it should be dealt with under the negative procedure and not debated. Only a handful of the negative orders that go through the House-about 35 out of every 2,500-are debated. There should be an absolute right to proper debate on the wording of the order, and it should not be left in the hands of the Government.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Taylor </B>(Esher and Walton): While my hon. Friend is discussing this matter, may I point out that there is a considerable problem with the word ``reasonable'' as it relates to the technology to be deployed? Are we talking about interception at the edge of the network? In what context is it reasonable to be kept up to date with changes in technology, bearing in mind that packet switching is very complex? Is the technology to be specified by the powers that have the authority to intercept, or can it be reasonably interpreted as something that the internet service provider or the telco should try to make available? Those are big questions and they relate to another clause to which we shall return dealing with the level of compensation.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> My hon. Friend, who has detailed knowledge of these matters, has raised some important issues. The clause is somewhat vague. It says:
<P>
The Secretary of State may by order provide for the imposition by him on persons who-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) are providing public postal services or public telecommunications services  such obligations as it appears to him reasonable to impose for the purpose of securing that it is and remains practicable for requirements to provide assistance  to be imposed and complied with.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
However, we have been told that the order will contain general requirements that do not go into detail in respect of the steps that an individual ISP or communications service provider needs to take, which are provided for in the notice that would be served under subsection (2).

<P>
It is a pity that we are having this debate in a vacuum-nobody knows how general the obligations under subsection (1) will be and to what extent there is room for negotiation of the notice. Clearly, under subsection (6) the Secretary of State must consult the industry, but that relates to the general obligations. The concern is that he will negotiate a set of general obligations that do not worry the industry too much because they are broadly specified, but the notice that is served on individual ISPs may impose a detailed requirement that allows no right of appeal and no right to suggest a better and simpler solution. There is nothing of the sort in the Bill; the Secretary of State simply imposes the obligations in a notice. Many of the amendments that we shall debate today concentrate on that, because there is widespread concern among the industry and others about the requirements that will be imposed, as they know how the Government work. The Minister can say today that there will be general obligations under subsection (1) and specific obligations under subsection (2) and point us to a helpful document from Demon, which deals with a small part of the problem in the longer term. However, the issue is clearly relevant today. In the longer term, technology will change.

<P>
What will happen when the notices are produced? Every one of the Secretary of State's clients-the various authorities-will want copper-bottomed provisions that give them the interception capabilities that they want. That is how government works. Therefore, we may end up with detailed, gold-plated notices that are burdensome to industry, without even having been able to debate the general obligations and with the ISPs and CSPs unable to go to a court or anywhere else and say, ``This is ridiculous. If we did that, we would be out of business.'' Therefore, the points that my hon. Friend the Member for Esher and Walton made are right.

<P>
The European Informatics Market recently held a meeting that I attended, along with several of the Minister's officials. EURIM was worried about the process of consultation, saying that the wording of the clause was not open or transparent and that, although consultation was provided for, there was no requirement to listen. It also felt that, because the order would be laid under the negative procedure, the opportunity for consultation and debate was reduced. According to EURIM, that contrasts with the fact that at previous meetings with others in the industry, Home Office officials had said that CSPs would need a clear idea of what was required and had accepted that the generic requirements consultation document would be published. There would be a level playing field domestically and internationally, an order would be laid before Parliament-they understood that the matter would be debated in the House-and the individual notices to ISPs would be subject to consultation and negotiation.

<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
The Minister, in his usual courteous way, may tell us that that is what the Government intend. He says that a lot, but it must be reflected in the Bill. It is not good enough for him to say that he is a Minister with good intentions-of course he is, but the industry wants a copper-bottomed guarantee of what will be in the law. It is all very well for the Minister to say that the Government will always act as the authority within the law if the law is narrow enough to impose sensible obligations on the Government. If it is not and if the powers are so broad that almost anything is acceptable legally, it means nothing to say that the law will be followed. The law must be right and that is what we are aiming to achieve with the amendments. I have explained what EURIM has said, but it also believes that there should be a right of appeal against the notice.

<P>
Turning from consultation to technical feasibility, in that respect the letter from the Minister raises as many questions as it answers. The technical brief that the Minister distributed to us is confidential and I shall respect that. My comments will be drawn from representations that have been made to me and general points that do not conflict with that confidentiality. I have been told that it is possible, as the document shows, to have a limited interception capability that depends crucially on the number of times that someone wants to tap into the system. Originally, the industry thought that a significant number of taps would be necessary. The Minister will remember the point that was made at last week's conference entitled ``Scrambling for Safety''. It was thought originally that one in 500 would need to be capable of being intercepted under the Government's proposals. Present thinking is that the Government would be satisfied if one in 10,000 could be intercepted. I should be grateful if the Minister would go a little further than he did at the conference last week and tell us what the technical requirement is.

<P>
Being able to provide any sort of capability depends on a limited number of taps, or what has been described as a handful of connections. Can the Minister give the Committee some clear information on what the Government have in mind? Is it the limited facility to which the document attached to his letter refers, or could it be expanded? Only if he is prepared to give a commitment that the activities will be limited to that small number of connections will his proposal have any weight or authority. If he is not prepared to say that, the proposal is pointless. He must make the position clear today.

<P>
The outlined scheme would not intercept all communications targeted, even with that low level of connections. Is the Minister satisfied with that? Is he content to follow that recommendation and to exclude other access methods, or is he saying, ``This is just an idea; it is no more than an indicative document''? If the document is nothing more than an indication of what might possibly be done, the industry will be concerned. It wants to see the Smith report produced by the external consultants.

<P>
At the beginning of the Committee's proceedings a fortnight ago, one of my first points was that that report is crucial. The Minister replied that it would be produced shortly, while we were still considering the Bill. However, the industry has been told that the report will not be ready until well into the summer. Will the Minister tell us whether it is still on track to be produced within the next few weeks? If not, we will merrily go on debating the matter without ever seeing the report, or at least not when it will be useful to our deliberations. If that happens, it will be the Government's fault. They did not start the report until January, although they knew about the technical problem with the intercept capability because it was one of the first points that was made in response to the consultation last year. Everyone was asking, ``Where is the technical detail?'' Mr. Wills-Sandford from the FEI said openly that while it may be technically feasible, the industry does not know how to do it.

<P>
The Opposition should never give the Government a blank cheque. I did not agree with much that the Labour party did in opposition, but it would not have given us a blank cheque in respect of such an issue. That would be to say, in effect, ``You can impose massive burdens on business under existing law without debating them''. The Labour party would not have agreed to do that in opposition, and neither do we. The whole purpose of parliamentary procedures is properly to scrutinise such matters. Where is the report? When will we get it?

<P>
The document seems to exclude the possibility of intercepting the new access products-ADSL and so on. Those products are the future. Is the Minister content to say that there will be no possibility of intercepting them? Is he saying that the Government will start with the method that is described in the Demon document and may impose new requirements in future? If so, it is even more imperative that those requirements should, in due course, be properly debated in this House.

<P>
I should like to ask the Minister about another matter that we shall return to in much greater detail when we reach clause 13. On page 3 of this letter, he seeks to reduce, in various ways, the costs estimate given by Demon. How can that be realistic if he intends to deal with the new methods of data access as they become available? In that case, the costs figures would be totally inadequate. It has been suggested to me that finding a way of intercepting ADSL could cost millions. It cannot be right for us to say, ``Oh well, the Minister only mentioned a smallish figure, and we can reduce it in the ways that he suggests in his letter'', if in the near future-perhaps in a year or so-extremely high costs may be involved.

<P>
Apart from the costs for large CSPs, how can the Minister justify the imposition of similar levels of costs and burdens on small ones? Is he confident that criminals will not realise that small CSPs are exempt? Will not the burdens have to be imposed on large and small CSPs? Is he confident that that is the right thing to do? We certainly want crime fighters to have such a power, but will it be possible to impose such burdens on small organisations? Given the complexity involved, will they be technically able to handle it? It is vital to reassure the industry on those issues.

<P>
Amendment No. 50-and No. 51, which is consequential-would require the Minister to consult internet and other communications users on generic requirements. Currently, only three groups of people must be consulted. Those who are likely to be subject to the obligations-business-must be consulted, as must those who represent business, although it is not clear why both are required. Does the Minister feel that the representatives are not up to the job? Those with statutory functions must also be consulted, which, I suppose, refers to the Office of Telecommunications. However, those who use the internet-the consumers-will not be consulted.

<P>
It is easy to get wrapped up in the details and consider what the industry wants. That is important. However, it is also important to recognise that millions of people use the internet, and belive that they own it and can use it freely. Many of them find it an exciting method of communication. Even elderly people use the internet and find it an exciting experience. People of all ages use the internet, not just for business purposes. One of my elderly constituents has just started using the internet, communicates with 20 people around the world, surfs all the sites and enjoys the experience. Many hon. Members will have such constituents-[
Interruption.] I can see nodding. One or two voices off are suggesting that my constituent might be a bit sad. He is not; he is happy to communicate on the internet. Such people do not expect large parts of their conversations to be hovered over in a mass surveillance operation, sieved for key words and intercepted in other ways allowed by modern software technology. It is therefore important to have regard to the perspective of the consumer or user. Consideration of proportionality or reasonableness-a key part of subsection (1)-might therefore take into account the likely effect on the use of the internet if the obligations were especially onerous.

<P>
Confidence in the internet is important, and was discussed at the ``Scrambling for Safety'' conference last week. Participants who were not necessarily professionals, but who enjoyed the freedom of the internet, were worried that it could be blighted by too heavy a hand from the Government. The amendments require better consultation to take account of the interests of communications users. If the Minister cannot accept them, will he say why? Given that the purpose of the internet is to provide users with a free method of communication around the world, why should they not be consulted on such an important issue?

<P>
Amendments Nos. 52 and 53 would create what I would describe as sunrise clause. When the clause became a section, the Minister would be able to implement it only if he made a proper statement to the House about the technical competence and proportionality of the generic obligations and about the costs and his contribution to them. That would apply only to the first order and the first contributions, although it will clearly be necessary for the Minister to issue further orders. It would, however, be a good discipline for the Minister to have to explain the technical aspects and cost implications to the House, particularly as the Bill has been conceived without any technical knowledge-[
Interruption.]

<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
The Minister shakes his head, but it is true. That is why, in January, which was very late in the day, he asked consultants to find a technical way of achieving his aims. He has received a partial proposal from Demon Internet. In his letter, he says that that will provide for a full interception capability, but it is clear from the document that it will not. The proposal is restricted to one access method, does not claim to catch every connection targeted and does not cover future access methods. It is a partial solution.

<P>
It would be a good discipline for the Minister to come to the House before implementing the section. He could say, ``Right. We have at last received the Smith report''-if it had been received by then-``we've considered it, consulted on it, and now we have a technical way of doing this.'' The Minister could explain the cost to the House and say how much he was prepared to pay. If he is not prepared to introduce a sunrise clause, he should explain why. We are trying to create a double lock. Commencement would take place only if the Minister made a satisfactory statement, and an order would be made only if he could satisfy the Houses of Parliament under the affirmative procedure. That would put proper protections in place.

<P>
We are interested in hearing the Minister's assurances, but if they are not backed by reflective measures in the Bill and an offer to make amendments later, they will not be satisfactory. It is not good enough for such an important matter not to be debated and dealt with properly. I hope that the Minister has gathered from the way in which I have put the argument that we feel strongly about it.

<P>

<B>Mr. Richard Allan </B>(Sheffield, Hallam): This is a useful group of amendments, which we are happy to support. Amendment No. 49 would provide for the affirmative procedure. We prefer that as a general practice in any case, but the orders suggest important reasons for it. I am also especially interested in amendments Nos. 50 and 51, which concern consultation with consumers, because consumer confidence is important.

<P>
The data protection commissioner has talked about the provision and said that ISPs, or CSPs in this context, have a duty to provide privacy for their customers under data protection legislation and the privacy requirements of the European convention on human rights. Government diktats, however, will require them to work against that and undermine the privacy of their customers. We must be careful about that, because we are putting CSPs in a difficult position, and that is why the industry has responded to the proposals with great concern. Consumers have the right to be heard, and amendments Nos. 50 and 51 would provide for that.

<P>
There are major questions about publicity and about consumers' rights to be told when they sign a contract with a CSP of the interceptions that are likely to take place. It is important that a CSP can tell consumers what can and cannot be done with their communications. There is a tendency, especially in the security services, but also in the police, not to want to tell people what technology is being used. Consumers do not need to know the technology in detail, but, as a matter of principle they need to know, when they sign the contract, under what conditions their communications could be intercepted. We need to ensure that the orders make clear what consumers are signing up to-that consumers are given that right.

<P>
There are also major questions about liability. The CSPs should be reminded of the fact that if one builds a back door, people can get in through it-people spend a lot of time trying to close back doors. When Microsoft had a problem with it's hotmail system-which made the headlines-it was running around trying to plug the gap before people lost confidence. Yet we are again requiring CSPs, by Government order, to put in place a technological back door. The CSPs rightly say that once the back door exists, it is hard to prevent the criminal elements from using it.

<P>
Consumers will probably have great concerns about such possibilities. What would happen if, for example, a piece of communications equipment that had been put in place by order of the Secretary of State were hacked into by a criminal element and credit card numbers stolen? The consumers affected would want to know who would reimburse them. Would the Secretary of State accept third party liability for the back door that allowed criminals to carry out criminal acts? As the clause stands, we will end up with terrible disputes. The consumer will say, ``I've lost 500 quid out of my Visa account'', the CSP will reply,``Not my fault, guv-it's the Secretary of State's equipment; I wouldn't have put it in there if I'd had any choice, but he made me do it'' and the Secretary of State will say, ``What equipment? We can't tell you about that; it's top secret.'' Most disputes will be of great interest to the consumer and should be dealt with now, before we go any further.

<P>
<B>Mr. David Ruffley </B>(Bury St. Edmunds): I am puzzled about the concept that the hon. Gentleman describes of the Government having liability in such circumstances. Perhaps he could develop the argument by telling us what precedents exist of a Government Department having third-party liability under English law?

<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I am not aware of any such precedent because I do not think that such an operation has been carried out. Some of the press reaction, to which the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire referred, was caused by the fact that the powers are unique. The only partly comparable situation that I can think of is that of people giving credit card details over the phone, which somehow go astray, but that is different because telephone intercepts are much more targeted.

<P>
We have yet to see exactly what systems will be put in place, but we are potentially talking about an intercept capability in a highly technological environment, when we know that there are people whose greatest pleasure in life is to try and crack into such systems. If that occured, there would be no precedents for sorting out those liabilities. Large corporate organisations, such as internet service providers, have not previously been required by Government order to put in place something that they do not want and which compromises their integrity with a large group of people who will target the system and try to break into it. That is why we need to get the system right now. The history of the internet and of such communication devices-no matter what system is put in place-represents a challenge to a certain group of people, which we can expect to grow.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that helpful amplification, but would he agree that there are not many examples of an individual being able to sue Government Departments for damages for a loss arising from their acts or omissions? The general principle of English law does not permit that possibility.

<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> That is the point I am trying to make. The consumer will be in an impossible situation. He will be left to go to the CSP. He will be told, ``That's your redress: the communication service provider is liable.'' However, that sparks off another set of questions related to the fact that the CSP is potentially liable to pay large amounts to consumers-a situation that the CSP did not want. Someone somewhere must take responsibility. My fear is that under the legislation CSPs will take responsibility and will be a commercial hit. They would have a case against the Government of the day. It would not surprise me if, when ECHR law evolves, the CSP does not have a case. It would have to go to the courts and explain that its problems were imposed by Government orders, that it did not choose this course and that it faced bills for credit card numbers going astray. We are entering a legal minefield. The amendments would allow a consumer voice to be heard and would require the affirmative resolution procedure. The amendments should help to expand our debate, as the bare-bones clause does not address important issues. Our opportunity for debate is restricted to the amendments, as we cannot debate specific orders. We need to spell out clearly whose responsibility lies where.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 52 and 53 deal with technological problems. They are important because a variety of models could be taken forward. There are historical examples of things going wrong. The United States Government had proposals for a clipper chip. They wanted to stick a chip in all equipment in order to acquire an intercept capability. By the time the equipment reached developmental stage, the industry had moved on and it would have been impossible to implement the original proposals. Time scales are an important issue. Proposals must be framed for an appropriate time scale. By the time these provisions come into force, we may be living in a different technological world. As I said earlier, if we do not get the technology right, people will flee the straightforward providers to new providers, which develop precisely because they offer a way round current problems.

<P>
The hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald) asked important questions about the quantity of connections that may be intercepted. Let me use an analogy from another packet switch network, the postal system, which switches packets between customers via postal boxes to an end point. Within that network, capability to intercept everything simultaneously is not sought. Interception means setting up a particular address point and intercepting only that. It requires manual intervention. It is a specifically targeted intercept, not a general one. Not every item of mail is opened for the interceptors to find what they are looking for. Only a particular address point is investigated. That is an appropriate model for a packet switch network.

<P>
If people realised that only a software bug on a particular address point was being set up, they would have enough confidence to continue using the main providers. An address point needs to be identified and a bug placed on the line in order to start intercepting. That is preferable to the black box solution of intercepting everything that goes through. We talked about the Echelon model when we debated external communications, but it would reduce confidence.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 52 and 53 are important. We should not introduce the provisions until we have seen which model the Government intend to follow in their orders. If it emerges that they want a general intercept capability, the industry will scream loudly and will not want to proceed with the provisions. It will want to co-operate, but it will find the orders and their conditions unacceptable. If that is the case, the amendments will be crucial in allowing opponents to show that the provisions are not technically competent for the purpose.

<P>
The Government would be implementing proposals that the industry would resist because they simply would not do the job. The industry must have a chance to give its view. As I said, the environment could be different then from now, so we must have the opportunity to question whether the proposals are technically competent. Otherwise, we could be implementing provisions that encourage everyone to flee mainstream providers and use fringe providers based outside the UK that can offer an anonymous service and work rounds. It is in everyone's interest to ensure the requisite technical competence, which can be achieved through targeted methods based on particular addresses rather than through general interceptions, which undermine confidence in the system.

<P>
It is an important group of amendments and we are prepared to support any or all of the amendments that Conservative Members wish to take to their logical conclusion. Every amendment offers something new in fleshing out the clause. It is essential to flesh it out to avoid ending up either with technically incompetent solutions or solutions that consumers feel they have no voice in, and that undermine their reason for using the system. The Minister's duty is to try to reconcile the three different interest groups. One way in which he could do so is to generate a sense of confidence. That might best be done by affirmative resolution, as my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Hertfordshire has said, so that developments triggered by the clause could be debated in Parliament. That is the right approach, as suggested in amendment No. 49.

<P>
The Minister could also generate confidence by introducing greater transparency in the consultations on how to apply the Bill that he is holding with the various interest groups. I think that all members of the Committee have received a submission from the operators group-an informal group of telecommunications operators active in the United Kingdom market. A long list of well-known names is appended to the submission. The operators group has been less than enthralled by the openness of the consultation process. The groups said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Clause 12 does not guarantee an open process of establishing the requirement for intercepting capabilities to be implemented by service providers. Nor does it provide any means for service providers to affect, or challenge in any real sense notices that are served on them. If this Bill is enacted, UK industry will be unique amongst the developed industrialised countries in having to provide these capabilities at their own cost.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Those costs are dealt with in clause 13. However, we cannot discuss clause 12 without bearing in mind clause 13, because problems will arise if the authorities regard the costs involved in the technological requirements as reasonable but the CSPs do not. In other words, who will ultimately pick up the bill? As I said in an intervention in the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Hertfordshire, the way in which the interception is carried out will determine the cost; the one relates to the other.

<P>
It is of great importance that the operators group also said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>For potential investors in the UK there will be unknown technical implementation requirements and costs to consider, which may constrain both the possible technical solutions and the legal framework within which services are provided. These uncertainties will tend to discourage such investment given that investment can easily be made in places where such uncertainty does not exist.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
during an intervention in a previous sitting, I asked the Minister whether he would tell us what happens in other countries, and he consented to do so. It is important, especially in relation to clause 12, that we understand what happens elsewhere because the telecommunications market is competitive and the internet is a global operation.

<P>
As I have said previously, the internet is anarchic and designed to be difficult to control and to continue to operate in the event of nuclear attack. It is likely to be difficult for Ministers to dictate what happens on the internet in the way that they might have been able to dictate to fixed-line, circuit-switched operating companies. Therefore, it is absolutely vital that technical requirements that the authorities impose on ISPs and CSPs are reasonable. If they are to be reasonable, they must be openly discussed with those companies. Given that, as the Minister says, the technology moves on apace, those discussions must take place on a recurring basis.

<P>
The Minister should assure the Committee that those conversations will not only take place but be transparent so that the authorities will be almost obliged to take into account the cost elements, which we shall discuss subsequently, and what technically can be done by ISPs if they are still to function without blocking new entrants. I am sure that the Minister will agree that an affirmative resolution would be one way of ensuring that those discussions had taken place and would spread confidence among all concerned.

<P>
If the Minister meets the objectives of this group of amendments he will not only have done a great service to his relations with the industry and have ensured confidence among consumers but will have improved the application of the Bill. I believe that we have made a pretty convincing case, and I hope that he will give his support to it.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> I wholeheartedly endorse the remarks of my hon. Friends the Members for North-East Hertfordshire and for Esher and Walton (Mr. Taylor). The clause is very important and, as drafted, it gives rise to several concerns. I want to endorse our concerns and the reasons for them and make some further points.

<P>
We have already heard that the industry does not yet know how to satisfy the requirements that the Department may impose on it. All sorts of technological changes might take place before the Bill receives Royal Assent. The point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Esher and Walton about international experience should give us pause for thought. What work is the Home Office doing on international requirements or on the requirements imposed on, say, the French, German, Italian, or United States industries? I am not clear whether the United States, France, Germany or Italy has a similar regime or is seeking to put one in place. It would be hugely helpful if the Minister could give us an international perspective-I was about to say an intellectual perspective-on exactly how the arrangements in clause 12 compare with other countries. We need to know that because we need to know whether our regime will put us at a competitive-

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I understand the contextual point that the hon. Gentleman is making, but we have enough on our plate looking at the complexities of the system that we are trying to set up for our own country.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> I am grateful for that helpful guidance. The point was made much more pithily, you may believe, Mr. O'Hara, by my hon. Friend the Member for Esher and Walton. The amendments-in particular amendment No. 53-relate to the costs and burdens and what contribution might be available from the Home Office. My right hon. and hon. Friends have tabled an amendment in relation to that.

<P>
How many communication service providers are likely to be affected by the clause? What provisional estimate has the Minister made of the costs that will be imposed on the total number of service providers? It is important to ask that question, because the Government sensibly and rightly talk about better and lighter regulation. They have a Cabinet Office unit that continually considers the matter, and we often hear from the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry and the Prime Minister on the subject. We need to be given some idea of what the clause might cost the industry. Amendment No. 53, in particular, relates to that question. If we get some notion of the total cost to the industry, we might get some idea of the reparation or compensation that the Department would be prepared to dole out to those who might have to cough up huge sums as the result of the clause.

<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
We have not heard much about costs, and that is why amendment No. 53 is so important.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. That is the subject of the next clause.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> I seek your guidance, Mr. O'Hara. I believe that amendment No. 53 is included in this group of amendments.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> My point is that clause 13, which deals with costs, is to come. On clause 13, I might have to rule that we have already had the debate under this clause. I ask hon. Members to be aware of the fact that there will be an opportunity to address costs specifically.

<P>
<B>Mr Ruffley:</B> I am grateful for your guidance, Mr. O'Hara, and I shall observe your strictures.

<P>
My next question concerns the consultation process, to which my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Hertfordshire referred. To what extent have the Minister and the Department borne in mind the security services outside this country? Various experts and commentators in the industry have said that experience on-line has proved that the only truly secure system is one that is testable by security experts the world over. They have concluded that if this country is putting a regime in place, and wants to place technical obligations on service providers, experts from beyond these shores should test the nature of that obligation. Technological experts from security services outwith this jursidiction need to examine the obligations that the Home Office seeks to impose, and find out to what extent they are up to world standards. We need to ask whether there are practices and information beyond this country that are far ahead of what is envisaged in this clause. For security reasons, we need to hear about the discussions that the Government might be having with other Governments. The Minister will not want to go into too much detail, but it would be helpful if he could tell us that the regime that the clause seeks to implement is up to the highest standards. Do we know whether other security services might be able to crack the code?

<P>
I close by asking a question to which I may already know the answer. It concerns the phrase ``telecommunications provider''. The assumption by the industry is that the phrase includes communications with websites. If that is not the case, or if there is doubt, is every machine that runs a web server capable of being bugged or intercepted? Would every site provider need to set up its website to keep track of encrypted communications? What about unencrypted communications?

<P>
The key question is whether the provision will apply to all websites rather than to a company that provides an internet connection. I note your ruling, Mr. O'Hara, that the important matter of costs will be considered later in the Committee's proceedings.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> My hon. Friend has made the important point that the provision applies not only to internet service providers, but, among others, to the suppliers of the back-bone that internet service providers use. Companies such as Nortel and Cisco would also be covered, and it would be useful if the Minister would explain the range of suppliers that are covered.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> My hon. Friend makes a typically lucid point in support of my almost lucid point. It is important to work out whether companies such as Nortel and Cisco will be covered. The point has been made outside the Committee that internet service providers will almost certainly not be liable, but their suppliers will be-which is my hon. Friend's point. They are likely to have to carry the burden of much of the development work. It is important to clarify my point and that of my hon. Friend, or we shall be in a mess.

<P>
<B>Mr. David Maclean (Penrith and The Border):</B> I wish to speak briefly to a couple of points. Clause 12 is dangerous. I cannot suggest an alternative if the Minister wants to delete it from the Bill to make the rest of the legislation satisfactory, but I nevertheless see fundamental dangers in it.

<P>
First, there is the security obsession with electronic commerce and the internet. Systems are always being designed to try to stop people hacking into them. Kids in the United Kingdom who have been hacking into computers seem to be swept away in dawn raids now. Computer hacking is an industry in America, especially for youngsters who have the opportunity at university to pursue it. They have done so very successfully: they have hacked into Pentagon computers. I suspect that the next time the United Kingdom is engaged in warfare, we shall need extra battalions, not of Scots guards, but of computer warfare defence specialists, the oldest of whom will be aged 17 and the youngest 10. They will defend the Ministry of Defence from electronic warfare.

<P>
The point that I am trying to make is that if I am signing up to an ISP, I want to know that my e-mails are safe from hacking. Hotmail.com went down because people hacked into it or Microsoft had designed a little weakness in it so that people could break in and corrupt it. Microsoft then spent millions trying to ensure that no one could tap into Hotmail.com.

<P>
The whole thrust of the industry is to try to make the system more secure. Then along come the Government and say, ``Aha! But now you must build in a breach. We want you to make the system secure, except against us. We want you to design software, machinery and methodology into which we can plug things and listen to a range of stuff and target and individuals.'' It is as if Chubb were to design a wonderful huge titanium safe with the best combination locks on the front, but with a plywood back.

<P>
The Government are asking for electronic commerce systems that are secure from everyone except for certain organisations listed in clause 6. Of course one can understand their need and desire to tap into information, but you can bet your bottom dollar that the second the Bill becomes law hundreds of kids-and infinitely more dangerous people-will think that they can find that breach too. The Government have had a breach deliberately built into the security system by the internet service providers and communications companies somewhere betwen Joe Snooks sitting at home and his mate in America-whether the communication goes through the cables under the sea or by satellite.

<P>
As soon as a legitimate breach is created for the Government in an otherwise absolutely secure system, criminals, hackers and others will get on the back of it. They will design their systems to find the loophole that the Government have created for the Secret Intelligence Service, the Security Service and others. That is my big worry. The Government, with their legitimate desire to penetrate these systems themselves, could allow others to get in as well, resulting in enormous damage.

<P>
In a computer magazine from the shelves in W H Smith there is an article called ``Trading on the Web-who can you trust?''. We happily pick up the phone and recite our credit card details to companies if we are buying goods that way, but whenever we are told that we should get on-line to do our electronic banking, share dealing and shopping doubt is expressed as to whether it is safe for us as amateurs to give bank details on the internet. Everyone now insists on much more secure encryption methods so that if we decide to give our credit card details or to bank with Barclays on-line and egg.com all will be perfectly safe.
 
<P>
The Government would not, in the main, be interested such activity, although they should be interested in the movement of money by certain individuals. That is why banks and financial institutions are under an obligation to report the National Criminal Intelligence Service any suspicious movements of cash around the country. My concern is that when the word gets out the the Government will now be able to intercept all our electronic commerce and collect information, many people will assume that the encryption systems for banks and electronic trading are no longer secure and that our details can now be tapped into by the Government. If the wrong message gets out about that, it will be a blow to companies.

<P>
All of us have made promises to the electorate and in some people's views we may be guilty of not fulfilling those obligations to the letter, but apart from that I am not engaged in criminality. I do not want messages to be encrypted, but the bloody-minded part of me thinks that an internet service provider operating outside the country-in France, the Cayman islands, the Scilly isles or the Isle of Man, for example-or a satellite provider using wide-band transmission could put an awful lot of stuff through the atmosphere.

<P>
Let us suppose that a company's advertisement in a computer magazine asked, ``Do you want to stay with your present internet service provider, where the Government can listen in on everything, or do you want to move to dodgysat.com, where we have beaten the Government's encryption system, where the spooks can't listen in, and which is totally secure?'' If I were to read such an advert, I would move to that service provider, and so would millions of others, not just computer wierdos or nerds. Many British people would do so, because they want to be able to send information without he Government listening in, no matter how innocent and innocuous the information is.

<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
The danger of clause 12 is twofold. First, if internet or electronic security is breached for legitimate, governmental reasons, others can come in on the back of that and spend their lives finding out how it was done, copy the technique and make security easier to breach. Secondly, alternative provisions may be offered from elsewhere, and not only by little fringe providers. Let us not assume that the big internet boys and girls will sign up with the Government and remain in this country, providing the service with all the technology added on so that the Government can listen in, and that just a few little fringe wierdo companies will offer alternatives. If it is technologically and legally possible to offer customers a service that the Government cannot access via the Bill, an explosion in the provision of such services will result. I suspect the demon.coms of this world and other internet service providers will continue to offer their legitimate Birtish-based service but will quickly develop their alternative service for customers who do want the British Government-or any other Government-listening in to their electronic commerce.

<P>
I am sorry that I have a couple of major complaints for the Minister but cannot offer an alternative or a solution. However, those are the main worries that I have picked up from my reading on the subject. The Government are going too far with the clause, but I cannot offer an alternative that is slightly less advanced. However, the Minister is paid a lot more than I to find such solutions.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> I rise briefly to make a technical point that was made by the Federation of the Electronics Industry and which is pertinent to the amendments. It relates to the technical nature of packets. Most packets do not enter the memory of routers but are switched from one port to another, based on information contained in the first packet. Some intersection requirements may mean that packets need to be intercepted and identified in transit, which would add significantly to the computer processing power and memory required. Does the Minister understand those anxieties? They have not been resolved to the FEI's satisfaction. The FEI does not understand how the requirements under the Bill will be met, given that anxiety. It is a technical problem. In proposing the clause, is the Minister comfortable rejecting the amendments? They would go some way to flushing out the sort of problems to which I refer and which the FEI has raised. If the Minister cannot answer that question, I am not sure how the Committee can support the clause.

<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I do not wish to prolong the debate. However, the reference made by the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Ruffley) to the definition of a telecommunications system reminds me of a point that I wish to make about consumer interests.

<P>
Will the Minister clarify where the telecommunications system ends for the consumer? According to clause 2(1), a telecommunications system consists of telecommunications equipment and apparatus comprised in the system
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>for the purpose of facilitating the transmission of communications by  means  of electrical or electro-magnetic energy.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
According to that definition, one's own personal computer is part of the telecommunications system when one is connecting to an internet service provider.

<P>
That is relevant to consumer interests and orders that may be made in relation to that. Software created by the internet service provider that is sent down to the user's PC and flags up the packets that are sent from it is a form of technology that could be used to facilitate interception. Certainly, the consumer's apparatus could play an important part in setting up a targeted interception that could be more effective than a general catch-all interception.

<P>
Will the Minister clarify whether that is possible? How does the Computer Misuse Act 1990 relate to the Government requiring internet service providers to hack into people's computers on government business? From a technical point of view, workable solutions involve the link between internet service providers and customers' PCs. It is hard to say where the software ends and starts, but ISPs may be required to alter that link and create special circumstances in relation to it.

<P>
If that is so, consumer interests are relevant. Consumers may agree to such a system if it provides an alternative to the general catch-all interception. From their point of view, it may be better for a specific bug to be planted rather than everyone being swept up. Is the consumer's PC part of the telecommunications apparatus as defined in the Bill?

<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Home Office (Mr. Charles Clarke):</B> We have had a substantial discussion with Opposition Members lasting an hour and 21 minutes. I say that in case anyone suggests that we have not had adequate opportunity to ventilate the relevant issues. I believe that we have, so I shall deal with the points raised, as I have done throughout our deliberations.

<P>
First, I respect the motivations beind many of the points made by Opposition Members. Confidence in the industry is important and it is appropriate to tackle that issue in Committee. Secondly, we do not seek a blank cheque, as the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire suggested. On the contrary, we have set out a process that I shall elaborate.

<P>
Thirdly, I remind the Committee that we are discussing interceptions that fall within the fundamental provisions of the Bill, so must relate to national security interests, preventing or detecting serious crime, or safeguarding the economic well-being of the United Kingdom. Those are serious matters, informing everything in the Bill. It is important to put them on the record, and to bear in mind the fact that they are the key factors.

<P>
We are prepared to reconsider the proposal for an affirmative order. Several hon. Members, including the hon. Member for Esher and Walton, made a strong case for an affirmative order procedure, which would provide further reassurance to the industry. I wish to place on record the fact that we are prepared to examine that matter more closely.

<P>
Concern about how reasonable intercept capacity will be arrived at lies behind these and other amendments. As I have said in Committee and elsewhere, I accept the need to make our intentions clearer. I trust that all Committee members have seen my letter spelling out how far we have got with that and what steps lie ahead. I acknowledge directly and publicly that we must continue putting that message across. We have received that advice as a result of consulting directly with industry. Most of those to whom we have spoken are reassured about the detailed consultations that will take place before individual notices are served.

<P>
In response to the point made by the hon. Member for Esher and Walton, let me make an observation about the operators. We received late yesterday the letter to which the hon. Gentleman referred and have sent a holding reply. The operators group accept in their letter that all of them were consulted but in many instances they failed to reply at the right level. We have had very close consultation with various members of the operators group. Many were present at a conference that I attended to discuss these issues with operators earlier in the year, and we continue to meet them regularly. I point that out because I wanted to comment in the context of the letter that the hon. Member for Esher and Walton mentioned. The people whom we consulted advised us that we should take every opportunity to put our message across, because doing so reassures them. Therefore I take this opportunity to restate our plans in relation to the reasonable intercept capability.

<P>
There will be a three-stage process towards reasonable intercept capability. The Bill is the first stage. It sets out the principle that service providers should maintain an intercept capability. This is an established principle that has been long adhered to by public telecommunications operators. But, as I said at the outset, we recognise that new technologies are involved and that new techniques will have to be devised. The second phase will be an order laid before Parliament for the establishment of a reasonable capability. Ultimately, this will require formal consultation under clause 12. Prior to that, we expect a great deal of informal consultation to take place: this has already begun. My letter to members of the Committee sets this out in greater detail. When we receive the consultants' study, consultation can truly get under way.

<P>
As we go through the debate I will answer many of the specific points that have been raised. I do not accept the charge made by the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire that we have been late in coming to this stage. The Government have considerable experience of intercepting on the public telecommunications network because that is what the law now allows. The Government's technical experts have, in close co-operation with parts of the industry, examined the practicalities of intercepting the new types of technology. The Bill will allow the interception of intercept service providers. But technology is moving fast, and it is important, as I know the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire, given his comments, acknowledges, that the Government base their requirements on the latest technology, otherwise we shall be criticised for using old figures.

<P>
I can confirm that the Smith Group will conduct and carry through the consultation. I shall write to the hon. Gentleman in answer to his question. There were technical reasons for our not mentioning it, but I promise that I shall write to him. Worries about timing, which the hon. Gentleman raised, are not well founded. We still hope and intend to publish before the Easter recess, not into the summer months, as he feared. We have a draft report, but we are currently conferring with the ISPs that we consulted about whether the report accurately reflects their thoughts before we issue the report more widely. therefore I hope that some of the concerns about timing that the hon. Gentleman expressed will be unjustified. I do not criticise the hon. Gentleman; he was merely reflecting concerns that were put to him.

<P>
The report will deal explicitly with the technical issues involved in intercepting the internet, including the points that the hon. Minister for Bury St. Edmunds said were put by the FEI. It will also explain the different solutions for the different types of ISPs, and it will give the costs of each different solution for each ISP. The report itself will not be the answer to those questions, but it will provide the basis for further necessary detailed discussions. As I have emphasised, I believe that our approach will enable the industry to consider the issues in the necessary detail. I re-emphasise that we regard this partnership with the industry as the key factor in the successful working of the Bill.

<P>
The hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire mentioned new access products. That aspect will be addressed in the report, as will the issue of reasonableness to which the hon. Member for Esher and Walton referred, which will be key to the general approach. I want to make it clear to the Committee that the Government do not intend to impose specific technologies on communications service providers. We will work with CSPs, as we do now, to find interception solutions for each type of technology.

<P>
<H5>12.00 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
As for the specifics that have been raised in this context, let me remind the Committee that ISPs are licensed under the Telecommunications Act 1984 and are telecommunications providers. The provider of the telecommunications service must provide the intercept capacity under this Bill. The duty does not fall on back-bone providers such as Cisco or similar organisations.

<P>
On the question of what this clause covers, we discussed this to some extent in the debate on clause 2. It covers public telecommunications and service providers and public postal services. No one else is covered by the legislation; for exmaple, websites are not covered.

<P>
The first stage of the consultation process is the Bill, and the second phase is the order, which follows the informal consultation. As I have said, the consultants' report will inform that informal consultation. When we have that study, the consultation can begin. We must bear in mind the fact that at the end of the process of informal consultation the formal consultation period will begin, during which people can make their observations in whatever form they want. After the consultation, an order will be laid before Parliament specifying the reasonable intercept capability for the entire industry. I am prepared to give further consideration to the manner in which that order is laid. The fact that it goes before Parliament should be an extra reassurance to industry. Indeed, that is the point made by the hon. Member for Esher and Walton. The order will be the culmination of the second phase of the development of a reasonable capability.

<P>
The final phase will be the serving of individual notices on communication service providers. These will state the capability they are expected to provide and the time scale for provision. The individual notices will result from a dialogue between the Government and the service providers themselves. It is important-and we establish this principle in the Bill-that we have dialogue with the specific service providers as well as with any representative organisation. It is an important part of the process, which will reassure the industry as a whole. We shall consult more widely rather than say, ``Here is a group claiming to speak on behalf of everybody and we will talk to them alone.'' The notice will take account of the circumstances of each ISP-much of that information will be commercially sensitive-and will be consistent with the order passed by Parliament. We believe that the notices will ensure consistency across the industry.

<P>
The three-stage process is made up of the Bill, the order and the notice. The order will be the subject of substantial consultations with everybody concerned, both informally and formally. We are only at the beginning: the Committee Stage of the first stage in that three-stage process. It is not just a question of good intentions, as the hon. member for North-East Hertfordshire suggested, or anything of that kind-it is the law of the land. I acknowledge that we could have done this differently. We could have done without the inherent flexibility that I am suggesting-a flexiblity that has led to the criticism that the industry will not know from the start what they will be reuqired to provide. We could have had a more Stalinist approach that imposes the solution directly. The other end of the scale can be seen in Germany.

<P>
On the question of Stalinism, I am always willing to be guided by the hon. Gentleman. [Laughter]

<P>

<B>Mr. Heald:</B> I am grateful to the Minister, who was no doubt friendly with Stalin at one point in his life.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I was three when he perished. [Laughter] 

<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> The Minister may not have sat at Stalin's feet, but may none the less in a former life have found his philosophy appealing; at least, that is what I am told.

<P>
Is the Minister seriously suggesting that to put those obligations in the Bill would be Stalinist. If they were in the Bill, they could be properly debated by the House. I am grateful for his concession, but he proposes that they should not be in the Bill and that the only debate on them should be on the negative procedure. Surely that is a far more Stalinist approach.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I shall not detain the Committee by trading insults about Stalin, Trotsky or anybody else. Mr. O'Hara, you have more expertise in these matters with your technological and political education and can guide us through the various personalities of history. {**UF3**}Mr. Clarke: I do not understand that point.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. For clarification, I had better explain that I was referring to political battles.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> Will the Minister give way?

<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I will give way on Stalinism.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> Perhaps the Minister will confirm for those of us who have read Mr. Philip Gould's book ``The Unfinished Revolution'' that he was in fact Stalin.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Although I bear some responsibility for this, I shall rule references to Trotsky or Stalin out of order.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> We should also try to avoid Mr. Gould, although I would not wish to put him in the same category.

<P>
We have tried to establish an inherently flexible system. I was about to contrast that with the other end of the scale, which can be seen in Germany, where the Government dictate to industry precisely what it must have and how it must operate. As the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire would confirm, our discussions with industry showed that it would not favour such a directed and controlled option as it is keen to retain the flexibility and creativity-if that is the right word-that has characterised its development.

<P>
I want to emphasise that not only do we want to maintain good relations-and some are extremely good-but we believe that the relationship with industry is the foundation stone of the legislation. If relations became poor or flawed, it would be difficult to operate the legislation. I acknowledge that completely and openly. We believe that the right approach is to adopt the flexible procedure that we have in mind.

<P>
There is a down side to flexibility, however, We cannot always offer the certainty that some might wish for in other circumstances. That is a dilemma, but we have decide that the option that best suits the development of e-commerce in this country is the flexible legislation to which I have referred.

<P>
I hope that I can reassure industry in another way. Some concerns expressed to us by industry have been based on fears that we expect to replicate the coverage that we have enjoyed in the past in respect of the interception of communications. I should emphasise what the Home Secretary stated on Second Reading: we expect law enforcement to suffer as a result of the development of new technologies. That is a fact of life. That applies not only to encryption, which has been widely discussed, but to more fundamental developments in communications technology. We are trying to preserve as much as we can of valuable intelligence, while always focusing on the key purposes set out in clause 5 and remaining consistent with our e-commerce objectives. We should not adopt-and the hon. Gentleman is not proposing-a philosophy of despair, of saying that we can do nothing about the matter or make any progress. However, we acknowledge that law enforcement will suffer from the development of new technology. Communications will be missed. We cannot establish a system that is totally rigid. I hope that my statement, reinforcing what the Home Secretary said, will reassure those who believe that we prize intelligence from interceptions above all other goals-we do not.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> Will the Minister give way?

<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I shall give way in a moment, but I must make more progress.

<P>
 I should spell out a final important consideration. The Committee discussed which services would be deemed to be offered to a ``substantial section of the public''. That consideration is important because only those services will come under clause 12 and only those service providers might be required to maintain a reasonable intercept capability. I offered the Committee some comments on which types of networks might be covered, but was unable to commit myself. I can now say that the order to be laid under clause 12, as the second part of the process that I described, will have to deal with the question of which services will be deemed to provide for a substantial section of the public and so be addressed. The instrument, which Parliament could reject, will advance the issue. I hope that the Committee will welcome the fact that I am making that commitment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> One of my concerns with the Minister's remarks, which I hope that he might be prepared to remedy, is that he is not descending to the detail for which I asked. For example, the technical document attached to the Minister's letter to us discusses a particular level of connections. That is crucial, because it is the only way, if he is prepared to accept a low level of connections, that that scheme will work. Will the Minister commit himself to the level referred to in the document?

<P>
As to scope, I asked the Minister if he would exclude access to asymmetrical digital subscriber lines and the other sorts of lines referred to in the technical document. We need an answer on that. Otherwise, the document is meaningless. What will happen with small ISPs? They provide a service that is available widely, but they are only small operators.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> The hon. Gentleman's only irritating characteristic is that he intervenes before I can finish dealing with what I hope he will agree is a wide range of comments made during the debate. I am trying to make progress, but am finding it a little more difficult, as I generously give way to the hon. Gentleman so often.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> Well done!

<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> As always I appreciate the remark made by my former pair, the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds, with whom I have never paired in the whole of this Parliament, as his Whips have not permitted him to do so.

<P>
No one will have to maintain the capability unless a notice to that effect has been served. All notices will be preceded by a bilateral contract between the service provider and the Government. All such contracts will be preceded by an order before Parliament, setting out the generic requirements. The order will be preceded by full consultation. Discussions with industry to date reveal a lack of understanding about the process that we envisage, and I take full responsibility for that. No doubt we have not set out the process as clearly as we should have done. I have tried to do that again this morning. Once I am clear that everyone understands the process, I shall be happy to entertain suggestions aimed at improving it.

<P>
It is right that users of communications services should have an opportunity to offer their opinion on the use of interception and the circumstances in which it may be deployed, as suggested in two of the amendments. Substantial opportunity has already been provided in the public consultation exercise and will be again when the Government consult on the code of practice. I emphasise that clause 12 concerns not the principle of interception, but the practical and technical aspects of the process. That is why we restricted the requirement on the Secretary of State to consult those who will be able to be most effective in that regard.

<P>
There are hundreds of millions of consumers in the world. Other than by debating through websites, as we do, and putting all the orders in the public arena on the website, it is difficult to see how a commitment in the Bill to consult all consumers could be fulfilled. Equally, there is no body that we could consult, representing all consumers of the relevant services, because the group is so wide and dispersed. While we are open and ready to discuss all questions directly, the key aim of the provision, which has been fully explored by all members of the Committee, is to arrive at a point where the industry is prepared to work with us in the relevant context.

<P>
The Bill requires the Secretary of State to consult the bodies that are listed and that any requirements imposed should be reasonable. That is the right thing to do. We are aiming to create a level playing field for all types of industry and the Bill enshrines in statute the existing principle that the service provider should maintain a reasonable intercept capacity. We are keen to minimise any additional burden on United Kingdom industry. In particular, it is important to us to avoid damaging international competitiveness.

<P>
The hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Allan) again asked where the public network ends. In our debate on, I think, clause 2, I said that it ends at the white BT network termination box inside the front door. The private part of the network includes the telephone and the personal computer. We are discussing the public part.

<P>
The hacking point made by the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border (Mr. Maclean) reinforces the need to build in an intercept capability from the start to make the process secure instead of bolting on an intercept capability at a later stage. Our purpose is to ensure that we build in the ability from the outset.

<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
Finally, I want to comment on international practice. We continue to talk to colleagues in comparable countries. For example, we are in close discussions with the United States. Indeed, one of my officials is having detailed meetings in the USA and Canada this week on relevant matters. Holland is the only concrete example of a country that has made an irreversible decision, but other countries are actively discussing what is happening. We are all grappling with the technicalities of interception on the internet. Holland has imposed requirements with which service providers must comply by August this year.

<P>
We will continue to pool our knowledge with our international colleagues. We have two aims in mind: first, to ensure that requirements are consistent with international practice-the e-commerce aim; and, secondly, to ensure that between us we are as well equipped as we can be, which I qualified earlier, to the menace of the growing internationalisation of crime. Those shared objectives need to be married up on a daily basis. The process will be one of constant iteration and improvement.

<P>
Many other countries face the issue of interception against the background of expecting service providers to pay for an intercept capaiblity. Internationally recognised standards exist, such as the international user requirements for the lawful interception of communications. Those standards were adopted by member states of the European Union in the January 1995 Council resolution and subsequently by the Governments of the USA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. We are not forging ahead in isolation but proceeding with great care, fully confident of the history of interception and the knowledge of our colleagues' intentions in other countries.

<P>
The hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire might think that I have not dealt with some of his technical points, but they would be better tackled in other ways. There should be a collective discussion with the industry on the basis of information in the consulation committee report before matters are considered in more detail. I hope that what I have said on the affirmative resolution will persuade the hon. Gentleman to withdraw his amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Heald:</B> I am afraid that we are dissatisfied. The Minister suggested that he would make a concession on the affirmative resolution procedure. Although welcome, it would not be enough to meet our concerns. Other amendments touch on he issues and I shall not trespass on their ground, but the Minister should have responded to the industry's concerns. His letter bases its costing assumption on his technical document, which relies on the number of connections being a mere handful. Why will he not descend to the detail and say, ``Yes, a handful of connections is adequate for one kind of data access, but not for all of them. We are happy if we cannot get a connection every time''? It is one thing to talk about a small partial scheme, but if he wants to allow wider interception, he should say so. The mischief is that the Minister does not know. The Government decided to tackle this problem before they had a technical solution. They consulted on it and were told, ``This might be possible but we do not know how to do it''. It was not until January this year that consultants become involved. I am reassured that the consultants will report before Easter, but we are discussing the matter now. The Minister should be able to answer the sort of questions that he was being asked-and scrambling for safety-about the number of connections and whether the Government are content to limit what they are trying to do, because it makes all the difference in the world.

<P>
Despite all that the Minister says, the procedure is not flexible. It involves obligations being set by the Home Secretary and other Secretaries of State under subsection (1) and, under subsection (2), it involves notices being served on businesses requiring them to do certain things. The Minister may discuss and negotiate but, at the end of the day, the law will provide that he will have the power to tell businesses what to do and they will have to comply, so it is not flexible.

<P>
I do not dispute the Minister's good intentions, but one of the Bill's themes is that the powers should be wide and strong, so the law should match the Minister's intentions, whatever they are. He should not be in a position to say sweet words when he will actually have tough powers, unless he can justify that, which he has not done. He described it as Stalinist to include the obligations in the Bill and debate them in the House of Commons. How can that be Stalinist compared with being able to set requirements against which there is no right of appeal, no right to be consulted and no voice for consumers, although that could be important for the confidence of the internet?

<P>
We are not satisfied. The Minister made international comparisons but he did not provide a full and frank explanation of the Government's position. For example, I understand that, in Germany, there is no attempt to intercept at the ISP level. Germany's provisions relate entirely to telecommunications operators and black boxes on the backbone. The Minister might also like to expand on the Dutch example, but their system is not equivalent to the one being introduced by the Government.

<P>
We are looking to the Minister not for generalisations or for pleasant words about consultation, but to put his money where his mouth is and get the legal powers right, so that we can all feel that the Bill is satisfactory. We all share the Minister's aims, but this is a mess. The provisions are being described in the media in slightly extravagant terms. For example, it is slightly extravagant to describe the Bill as the worst piece of legislation ever. However, it does have it problems, which must be addressed, and the occasional concession on affirmative procedure, although welcome, is not enough.

<P>
We shall certainly ask leave to withdraw our amendment relating to the affirmative procedure on the basis of the Minister's assurance, but we shall press amendment No. 50, on the role of consumers, to a vote. We shall consider what the Minister has said about the sunrise clause and may wish to return to the subject. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> For the benefit of the Committee, I must point out that the debate on that first set of amendments to clause 12 has been so discursive that I am minded, when we come to it, to move clause stand part without debate. Members of the Committee may wish to bear that in mind during the debates on the next two groups of amendments.

<P>

<P>

New clause 2-Technical Approval Board-
<P>

<P>
(b) such persons with statutory functions in relation to persons falling within paragraph (a).'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> The amendment returns to the provision of subsection (2) that the Secretary of State should give notice requiring ``the person'' to take steps. It should not be a blank cheque. I know that the Minister does not accept that it is a blank cheque, but the obligations that he can make by order under subsection (1) are general and he has carte blanche to impose steps on persons without let or hindrance. The Minister says that he will consult, but that is not a requirement. The worry is that, with new technologies constantly coming on-line, the obligations to be imposed could be technically incompetent or disproportionate. Indeed, a better or simpler technical solution could be put forward by the CSP, the ISP or the person who is operating the telecommunications network.

<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> I hope that the hon. Gentleman will give us some costings of the quango that he intends to set up before he asks us to vote on the proposition.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> I am always grateful to the Minister for his hard work and the assiduous way in which he goes about his duties. As he has the benefit of the huge and excellent civil service behind him-including, no doubt, Treasury officials-I look forward to hearing his estimate. I am sure that his friends in the Treasury will be able to provide one.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> It is the hon. Gentleman's proposal.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> It is not unusual for the Government to make estimates; they have access to all the books and figures. I should be happy if the Minister gave me an estimate. It is the principle that is important.

<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> The Minister seems to suggest that the proposal would cost money. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that if it were not for the technical approval board, civil servants or others would have to do that work? An industry body would probably do it more cheaply.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. It is important to bear in mind that it is suggested that the board will include representatives of industry and the regulator. The Government already provide funds to the regulator, and I am not sure that such a provision would result in huge extra costs. However, it would not be entirely in the hands of the Government; they would not be able to say, ``This is what you must do''; it would not leave the industry with no recourse.

<P>
Amendment No. 19 suggests that before notice is given the Minister must obtain a written certificate of technical approval from a technical approval board to ensure that the steps taken were technically competent and proportionate. Amendment No. 22 would incorporate into clause 71 a definition of the term
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>technical obligations under this Act<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
to include steps specified in the notices described in clause 12(2). New clause 2 would set up a technical approval board comprising six representatives from the industry and the regulator.

<P>
Our purpose is to ensure that the Secretary of State serves notices that are technically practicable and proportionate, especially in technical conditions that we cannot now predict. The Minister does not know what those circumstances will be, for reasons that we have already discussed. It seems likely that he will want to serve notices dealing not only with current dial-up access routes, but with digital subscriber technology. That technology will lead to new challenges as the infrastructure changes.

<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
In effect, many of the access methods will involve a continuous data signal. This process is part of the initiative that the Government have allowed, in which British Telecom is to be required to provide access to its lines. I am told that, under the new scheme, data will be sent separately from voice communications, and that that will raise a raft of technical issues.

<P>
Will the Minister tell us whether it is technically feasible to intercept ADSL? What about single pipe IP data streams? Is he prepared to say now that he will not issue notices in respect of those technologies? If not, he must explain the technical aspects and the costs-[
Interruption.] That is not my phone ringing, but it is certainly noisy. I am worried that the Minister's letter contains a great deal of information about costs that is based on an incomplete example. He then seeks to reduce the sums set out there in various ways, and ignores the new technologies that are coming on stream. We find that most unsatisfactory. The sweet words are not matched by the reality of what is happening from either a technical or a legal point of view.

<P>
The technical challenges that existed last summer are different to the ones we face now. The evidence that the Minister has produced suggests that they will be different again by the end of this year. How can we accept assurances now about what will be included in notices in a year's time? The suggestions in his letter about limited technology are not matched by his assurances today.

<P>
We do not want to write a blank cheque, and we want to avoid gold-plating. How is that to be achieved? The appointment of a technical board would be one way of doing it. Is the Minister against that proposal only because he thinks it will cost money? Or does he want the Government to have the final veto on the steps to be taken? I am sure that that is the real reason, rather than the cost of a technical board.

<P>
We believe that, given the Government's poor record on technical issues, a proper independent body is needed to examine these issues and, if necessary, to veto them. If the Government produce a measure that makes no technical sense, or is incompetent, why should it not be vetoed? Why should we live in a world in which the law allows the Government to force on companies technological changes that make them uncompetitive? The Minister says that that is not his intention, but the Bill would let him do that. He must make concessions on these issues. We need protection written into the Bill, rather than assurances from the Minister.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I am pleased that, during the speech made by the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire, the Conservative Whip was able to intercept the mobile telecommunications at the back of the Room. They might have disrupted our proceedings, but they have now been dealt with securely.

<P>
I support the amendment proposed by the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire. It deals with an important area of the relationship between the industry and the Secretary of State. As a matter of principle, we like to bind the hands of Secretaries of State. It seems to us sensible that executive powers should answer to others. As we said earlier, we bear in mind the possibility of our legislation being used at a future date by a Secretary of State of evil intent, or one who is slightly more Stalinist than the current occupant, if that is possible.

<P>
The Minister assures us that the powers will not be abused and that no Secretary of State will create arbitrary orders that the industry cannot carry out, but if we put legislation on the statute book without provisions of the kind suggested by the amendment, we have no guarantee that a future Secretary of State will not say-I have used the clipper chip example from the United States-``I insist that every ISP puts this black box on the network''. The Secretary of State goes through the consultation process, the industry says, ``We don't like it, we don't want it'', but the Secretary of State says, ``I'll do it regardless''. The Secretary of State brings forward an order under the affirmative or negative procedure. The House debates it and says ``We don't like it'', but because, by definition, the Secretary of State can command a majority in the House, the order goes through and there are no further safeguards. That is why we are always keen to include safeguards of the kind suggested by the hon. Gentleman's amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> It is not that a Secretary of State of evil intent might come along-I know that the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam was making the point for the sake of emphasis-but that a new and unheard of incident may occur. Laywers and civil servants would rightly check the powers and say ``Ah, Home Secretary, this problem must be grappled with. Don't worry, you have powers. We never thought we would need them, and we told Parliament 10 years ago they would never be used, but here's a solution now, and we can use your powers to make a certain instrument.'' As I think Macmillan said, there are events that would cause a Home Secretary of the most modest and non-evil intent to use draconian powers.

<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for that intervention. I was using the phrase lossely rather than specifically. The circumstances that he describes are more relevant to the sort of situation that I envisage becoming a problem: the ``dangerous dogs'' phenomenon. Somebody may carry out a terrorist act, which is traced back to plotting that took place across the internet. There will be political pressure on the Secretary of State to take action immediately, followed by advice that says ``Go out and buy these boxes, stick them on the internet, and you have no problems-they will all be resolved.'' The powers in the clause will give rise to that kind of instantaneous reaction, which might cause all sorts of problems without achieving the technical solution that was sought.

<P>
There is a real risk that, at some future date, a mild-mannered Home Secretary with no wicked intent may be persuaded by public pressure to drive measures through, even when the industry says no. The technical approval board would provide an important counterbalancing force, because it could act as a block where a proposed solution could not work.

<P>
We must not pretend that we will generate more costs by using the industry; in fact, more costs will be incurred if we fail to use it adequately. If we use poeple outside the industry to help us to keep up, we will create more problems and incur considerable additional expense compared to the model used in the Electronic Communications Bill, where the T scheme has been set up for encryption. That will be a cost-effective way to bring together and built on the expertise of people in the industry who do this stuff for their bread and butter.

<P>
The model for the technical approval board will build on the expertise of those who already have it. We will not have to pay people in, for example, the civil service or the police to develop expertise from scratch. The industry will do it only if it feels that its voice is taken seriously; if it is being consulted but not being taken seriously, it will soon lose interest. If industry is formally built into the structure, it will feel that it is being taken much more seriously and will put in the effort.

<P>
Again, the international dimension is important. The industry frequently operates on an international basis, and many of the businesses already cross borders. They are much more conscious of the international dimension from a technical point of view, and can bring that to the debate in a way that would not be achieved by keeping it within the UK Executive. The T-scheme model will be effective in that respect, because it will give an international dimension to encryption. A similarly international dimension in interception would be better provided by industry representatives than by people working within the Executive.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Taylor:</B> It is vital to get a buy-in from the industry in terms of advice to the Government, for a variety of reasons. That has been done in the past, for example, there was an advisory committee on radio spectrum issues. As the hon. Member for Hallam said, that will be vital in many contexts, because the industry is international. If a system is devised in this country is technically at variance with systems in other countries, it will have considerable manufacturing implications. We have talked about Cisco and Nortel; Lucent and its subsidiary Ascend are other examples. They are all American companies, and the UK is but one market, but routers and switchers will have to be manufactured for the UK market. For the record, Nortel is a Canadian company, which has a big American interest through Bay Networks. I say that in case anyone in Canada might be offended that I agglomerated it into the United States.

<P>
At each stage of these technological developments, it is crucial that the Government ensure-in their own interests-that the industry is on side and working closely with them, and that the technological possibilities, as well as the impositions on industry, are well understood by both parties. That will ensure that confidence is built up across the divide between industry and the interests of the Government and the Home Secretary.

<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> We have three substantial objections to the clause. The core of the whole approach, which I tried, albeit unsuccessfully, to convince the hon. Gentleman-

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I think that the Minister intended to say ``objections to the amendment''.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I beg your pardon, Mr. O'Hara. My normally fluent language, on which I was complimented earlier, obviously escaped me at that point.

<P>
Buy in from the industry is vital, and the Bill is not deliverable without it. A key fact that I did not emphasise during the previous debate is that, if the Secretary of State were to serve a notice that was unreasonable or disproportionate, the communications service provider would have the option of non-compliance. The onus would then be on the Secretary of State to enforce the notice through civil proceedings, whereby he would have to convince the court of the reasonableness and proportionality of the notice. That process would be in the interests of neither the communications service provider nor the Government. The Government will be strongly committed to proceeding on a consensual and agreed basis. That is the way to deal with the technological changes that the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire raised.

<P>
The first of the three objections to which I referred is cost. The Conservative Government had a long history of establishing a wide variety of quangos, which we are now in the process of tearing down-[Hon. Members: ``Oh!''] I am amused and entertained that the amendment proposes another quango, the procedures of which would involve further costs.

<P>
However, the most substantial argument against the amendment is its proposal that the quango should include
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>six representatives of persons appearing to-<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the Secretary of State-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>to be likely to be subject to technical obligations under this Act.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That definition means that six competitors in the business would have privileged access to information about technological developments and proposed new changes in the industry. The industry as a whole would not accept that giving what may well be highly commercially sensitive information to a technical approval board, and therefore to the companies that were represented on it, is appropriate.

<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> That is how the industry works. Whenever new standards are drawn up, competitors, who are often at each others' throats, work together in the interests of the industry as a whole. To suggest that they would find the arrangement unacceptable makes assumptions about the way in which the industry works that are not correct.

<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I am well aware of the way in which the industry works. The hon. Gentleman and I earlier commended the T-scheme, which the Department of Trade and Industry established. In view of the rapid pace of technological developments and the numerous discussions that the Government and companies have had about interception, to give that information to competitors, as the amendment would do, would be-

<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> Will the Minister give way?

<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> In a second. I shall give way to the hon. Gentleman in my own time. I shall first deal with the comments of the hon. Member for Hallam.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman rightly said that schemes move forward, but I remain of the view, and I believe that I have good reasons for doing so, that many in the industry would not welcome a scheme that allowed a quango to give technically sensitive information to competitors.

<P>

<B>Mr. Heald:</B> The Minister said in the letter that he sent to us that that would happen. It was one of his main arguments. He wrote:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>experience with PTOs has demonstrated that sharing expertise across the community can lead to significant cost savings.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That suggests that the information in the notices would be shared.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> The whole point of that development in the ISP world is, as the hon. Gentleman said in various interventions, that there are many more ISPs and a much more rapid pace of technological development and change than was the case under the structures that applied previously. My letter to him described the situation, but I remain of the view that the process that he describes would not be welcomed by the industry for the reason that I gave. That is my second argument in this context.

<P>
I shall not labour my third argument because I have already presented it on several occasions. We are setting up a far more effective regime of dialogue and discussion with the industry and with individual providers and we are doing so in a way that takes account of technological developments and of the economics of the situation. On those grounds, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I understand why the Minister does not want to go down this route, but his second argument was very weak. The Government will effectively end up taking such steps anyway. He stressed how much the Government want to engage in the co-operation process and to consult with business. They will end up working closely with the largest providers of telecommunications services-they currently work with Demon in that way. It is a structure that he does not like, but the industry-in small and larger groups-will work effectively with the Government.

<P>
I am interested in the use of the phrase ``ripping down'' in relation to quangos-it appears to mean stuffing it with members of one's party. I have not previously heard the phrase used in that way. However, I shall not develop that point further.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. That is just as well.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> We are not satisfied by the Minister's reponse. His second point-that it would be wrong to share technical information-is absolutely staggering. In his letter to us of 14 March, he sets out the costs-I shall not give them because they are confidential-that one of the largest ISPs had estimated for the partial system that I mentioned earlier. He said that those costs could be reduced for three reasons, the second of which I quoted earlier. He wrote:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>experience with PTOs has demonstrated that sharing expertise across the community can lead to significant cost savings.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The letter refers to sharing the technical knowledge that will be in the notices. That is one of the key points in his argument for reducing costs, but the estimates of costs are nonsense and the Minister was not prepared to give any assurances today. It is wrong for the Minister to argue that it would damage the industry to share the information when, a few days earlier, he sent us a letter stating that it would be vital to share the information because it would reduce costs. He cannot have it both ways and we wonder whether he is not simply making debating points that have been provided by his officials-``Here is an answer for the Minister, we'll send it to him''-with no thought for the context. The Bill deserves better than that. The Minister referred to consultation and to trying to introduce participation, but it is not working.

<P>
I have a briefing paper from the Federation of the Electronics Industry, which is willing to consult, to be involved and to participate, but many of its members have the impression that the Government's belief is that if they ask, the industry will comply. The federation wants to know whether the Government want to win over the hearts and minds of the ISPs. The Minister will say yes, but I have already cited EURIM, which has criticised the consultation process because it is not open and transparent. The Minister should come clean and say how he will consult.

<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman accept that under his amendment representatives of companies on the board would be able to see the detail of the specific notice that is set out for every internet service provider? That is very different from the sharing of expertise that operates now among telecommunications operators. The hon. Gentleman is suggesting that the representatives of one company should see the specific notice that is served on another company. Will he confirm that that is his intention?

<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> It it better than that. The notice would be vetted to see whether it is technically competent and proportionate. The board would say whether it goes out or not. The Minister cannot get off the hook by saying that the sort of exchange of information to which he referred in his letter is different. Only if the information descended to real detail would the sort of savings to which he referred be achieved. Unless the technical details of the interception were given, how on earth could costs be saved? The letter is directly contrary to his argument. I am sorry to have to chide him, but he is arguing two inconsistent points. He referred to the industry and whether it would accept the technical approval board. I have had preliminary consultations that suggest that it would but I am prepared to consult more and I shall do so. The Minister said that people in the industry would find the requirement unacceptable, although he did not mention anyone specifically, and I shall consult on that.

<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I wonder whether the Minister was trying to be helpful and to improve the proposed scheme, and I wonder whether the hon. Gentleman would consider a duty of confidentiality on the members of the technical approval board in respect of their work on the board. If the Minister was suggesting a way of making it work, I would find that acceptable and I hope that the hon. Gentleman would also.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> We might need to reflect on what the Minister said and to give him an opportunity to reflect. I am happy to do that, but I shall consult. I hope that the Minister will think about the matter and perhaps return to it on Report. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heald:</B> I beg to move, amendment No. 98, in page 14, line 31, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) A person on whom a notice under subsection (2) is served may, within seven days from the date on which the notice is served, appeal to the Court.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>( ) An appeal may be brought on any of the following grounds-

<P>
(a) that such steps as may be specified or described in the notice are not technically competent for the purpose set out in subsection (1);

<P>
(b) that such steps are not proportionate to the purpose set out in subsection (1); or

<P>
(c) that such steps exceed what is necessary to achieve the purpose set out in subsection (1).

<P>
( ) On an appeal under this section, the Court may either cancel or affirm the notice, and, if it affirms it, may do so either in its original form or with such modifications as the Court may in the circumstances think fit.

<P>
( ) The Court to which an appeal may be made under this section shall be-

<P>
(a) in England and Wales or Northern Ireland, the High Court, and

<P>
(b) in Scotland, the Court of Session.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The amendment would introduce the safeguard of a route of appeal against a notice to set out technical steps. The proposal is that that route of appeal should be to the High Court in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, and to the Court of Session in Scotland. The grounds for such an appeal would be that the notice was not technically competent, not proportionate, or was an excessive provision in the sense that an easier alternative could be put forward. On that basis, the court would be able to cancel or affirm the notice, and, in affirming it, to modify it.

<P>
One hopes that a decision to serve a notice detailing technical steps would involve steps that were competent for and proportionate to the purpose. Will the Minister confirm that it would be possible, in limited circumstances, to seek a judicial review of the notice? If so, I believe that it would be possible only on the basis of the Wednesbury principle, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Decisions of persons or bodies which perform public duties or functions will be liable to be quashed or otherwise dealt with by an appropriate order in judicial review proceedings where the court concludes that the decision is such that no such person or body properly directing itself on the relevant law and acting reasonably could have reached that decision.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That classic statement was made by Lord Green, the then Master of the Rolls, in the case of Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd. v. Wednesbury Corporation in 1948.

<P>
The grounds on which the courts might review the exercise of an administrative discretion would be an abuse of power, bad faith, a mistake in construing the limits of the power, procedural irregularity, or unreasonableness in the Wednesbury sense-that is, unreasonableness verging on absurdity. There are cases which do not reach that high standard of absurdity, but which are none the less wrong. The amendment would address the circumstances in which a decision behind the serving of a notice was a bad one, or in which the technical steps were dubious or disproportionate, or in which a simpler technical solution would be possible and effective. Those circumstances might not be quite so ludicrous as to be described as an absurdity. Can the Minister point to another example in which the Government or a public authority can serve a notice on a business or an individual requiring such substantial and potentially costly measures to be taken by so many people, without a right of appeal?

<P>
These cases cover a very wide area. For example, under section 40 of the Data Protection Act 1998, the commissioner is able to serve a notice, which could involve technical steps, in order to comply with schedule 1 of that Act. However, under section 49, there is a right of appeal to a tribunal, and, failing that, to the High Court. Avenues of appeal seem to exist in most circumstances in which technical requirements are placed on an individual by the Government or an authority. The Building Act 1984, for example, contains the provision for appeal against notices relating to alterations of building work, to planning notices, to listed building consents, to alterations to licensed premises, and against notices dealing with the detailed technical aspects of sports ground safety, and work to water courses.

<P>
Acts of Parliament such as the Agriculture (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1954 and the Consumer Credit Act 1974, which dealt with the Office of Fair Trading requirements, contain a great many technical details and might involve large amounts of money and big issues for companies. They provide for a right of appeal, as does legislation relating to valuation issues, for example, or to conservation area consents. One can even appeal in matters rleating to the billeting of Her Majesty's forces, on the grounds that one does not have room for them. There are many examples of provisions in which Governments or public authorities can serve notices of technical requirements, and in all cases there seems to be a right of appeal, especially when a substantial range of individuals or companies is affected.

<P>
Given the importance of the notices covered in clause 12, with all the technical concerns and costs involved, should not there be a right of appeal? If not, why not? EURIM-the views of which I have already cited-has made the point that there should be such a right. Although those rights are not inherent in law and are creatures of statute, I believe that, in circumstances such as these, they are matters of substance and not merely of procedure.

<P>
Given the Minister's adamant refusal to involve any independent body in the process, should not the ultimate arbiter be the courts when technical issues need to be resolved? Is not that the system, and the rule of law, under which we live?

<P>
It being One o'clock, The Chairman adjourned the Committee without Question put, pursuant to the Standing Order.
