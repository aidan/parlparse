<H2><center>Standing Committee B</center></H2>
<H4><center>Tuesday 18 November 1997</center></H4>
<H4><center>(Morning)</center></H4>
<H4><center>[Mr. Roger Gale in the Chair]</center></H4>
<H3><center><a href="/pa/cm199798/cmbills/042/1997042.htm">Social Security Bill</a></center></H3>
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Nigel Waterson (Eastbourne):</B> On a point of order, Mr. Gale. I should like to repeat a point of order that I have already made during the Committee stage which relates to ministerial promises in previous sittings about providing the Committee with draft regulations to be made under the Bill. We were given a clear commitment on that, and we have received a paper on regulation-making powers for which I thank the Minister, but where are the draft regulations?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The provision of information to the Committee is not a responsibility of the Chair. If the Minister wants to respond in due course, no doubt he will do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Burns (West Chelmsford):</B> On a point of order, Mr. Gale. Could I, through you, seek a point of information from the Minister? He wrote to me yesterday, helpfully and kindly, concerning our debates on amendment No. 25 in the sixth sitting, and provided useful information on allowances and remuneration. He did not in that letter mention gratuities, which he promised--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Points of information are not for the Chair, as the hon. Gentleman well knows. If the Minister wants to respond, no doubt he will do so. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will find the opportunity to raise the matter in the appropriate manner during the debate.
<P>
Clause 64 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 65</center></H4>
<H4><center>Rates of short-term incapacity benefit</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Steve Webb (Northavon):</B> I should like to make a brief observation about the clause. I ask the Minister to address an anomaly in rates of short-term incapacity benefit, which I should have liked the clause to have dealt with, so I hope that the Minister will amend the clause at a later stage to take account of it.
<P>
The short-term rate of incapacity benefit for the first six months of the claim is below that for income support, so recipients with no other income will also receive income support. After six months, the rate of incapacity benefit rises but the income support rate does not, so they cease to be entitled to income support. However, after 12 months, although the rate of incapacity benefit rises further, the rate of income support rises further still because entitlement to a disability premium is triggered, so at that point the recipients start to become entitled to income support again.
<P>
Welfare rights advisers have pointed out to me that bizarre situation--caused by the current structure of rates of incapacity benefit--which means that recipients have six months on, six months off and then an indefinite period on. I would be grateful if the Minister, when commenting on the clause, stated whether he intends to address that anomaly.
<P>
<B>The Paliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security </B>(Mr. John Denham): It may be helpful if I begin by outlining the purposes of clause 65. It introduces a minor measure to deal with an anomaly in the workings of the tax and benefits systems which can, in a small number of cases, lead to some people effectively being taxed twice on the same income.
<P>
Section 44(4) of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 sets out the rate to be used in calculating entitlement to short-term incapacity benefit for people over pension age. At present that is based on a rate set below the standard rate of retirement pension. The clause increases the rate to one equal to the standard rate of retirement pension.
<P>
A person who is over pension age and is not in receipt of retirement pension may claim short-term incapacity benefit for up to a year of incapacity. The higher rate of short-term incapacity benefit payable in that case is based on a person's notional entitlement to retirement pension. However, under existing legislation that calculation is not based on the full standard rate of retirement pension because of an abatement of 5 per cent. introduced in 1980 in lieu of taxation. However, after 28 weeks of incapacity, incapacity benefit becomes liable to income tax. That means that some people over pension age and receiving the benefit at the abated rate could effectively be taxed twice. To compensate for that, the Benefits Agency currently pays extra-statutory payments to make up the difference--currently &#163;2.55 a week--between the two rates of benefit.
<P>
The clause will mean that, after 28 weeks of incapactiy, the Department will use the full standard rate of retirement pension to calculate the rate of incapacity benefit for a person over pensionable age. That will ensure that those whose income level makes them liable to pay income tax will pay only once, thus removing the need for extra-statutory payments.
<P>
On the question raised by the hon. Member for Northavon (Mr. Webb), the relationship between income support and incapacity benefit is not the subject of the clause, but I should be happy to write to him about the matter.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 65 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 66</center></H4>
<H4><center>Discretionary payments out of social fund</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 280, in page 43, line 18, leave out from `payments' to end of line 34 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`to meet other needs, in accordance with directions given, or guidance issued, by the Secretary of State.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Trying to amend the clause and the related clauses 67 and 38 is like trying to hit a moving target. Some of the things that the amendment would achieve may be brought about by subsequent Government amendments. I shall set out the thinking behind our amendment. I should be grateful if the Minister explained any changes that the Government have made since last we met; then, we can decide whether to withdraw our amendment.
<P>
The clause separates community care grants and crisis loans from budgeting loans, treating budgeting loans separately. The purpose of the amendment is to overturn that distinction and to restore similar treatment. The corollary of the amendment would be to delete clause 67. In itself, our amendment would not make much sense if clause 67 remained unchanged, and we should have sought to amend it had the Minister not decided to do so himself.
<P>
Our concern is that currently a claim to any part of the social fund is treated as a claim to the whole. An applicant does not have to know what budgeting loans, crisis loans and community care grants are--he makes one application, all the information is provided, and if he is entitled to any of those benefits he has a chance of getting them. We appreciate that there are problems with that system--forms are long because they must deal with everything--and we appreciate the Government's desire to simplify it. However, given the tight cash limits on the social fund, channelling everyone through either the loan or the grant route could lead to anomalies.
<P>
I refer to evidence from the Kent county council social services department--the Minister may also have seen it--which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Many vulnerable claimants are unaware of their potential eligibility for grants and, as a result, take on Social Fund loans which result in high rates of repayment from benefit and considerable indebtedness.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>People go to benefits offices and are steered in the direction of loans. Under the proposals, there is a risk that, once they have applied for a loan, their eligibility for, say, a community care grant may be curtailed.
<P>
The evidence says of the present system:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Because of the current restrictions''
<P>
</UL></FONT>on grant, which presumably will not be eased,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``local staff inevitably encourage claimants to accept loans. The Unit deals regularly with claimants who are often misled about their eligibility for a grant and who are deterred or prevented from making a claim for a grant.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>At present, if people later discover that they were misled or mistaken they can reapply for a grant or ask for a review. The proposals may not be a barrier--as I have said, however, they keep changing--but they appear to be so.
<P>
The welfare rights unit in Kent continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Reception staff at Benefits Agency offices tend to act as `gatekeepers' to relieve the pressure of demand on their decreasing resources. Clause 67''--
<P>
</UL></FONT>and this clause--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``will accelerate this process and encourage bad practice''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>That is the thinking behind our amendment. I should like to think that the Government's new raft of proposals goes some way towards addressing the matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Oliver Letwin </B>(West Dorset): The Opposition understand thoroughly the logic exposed by the hon. Member for Northavon (Mr. Webb). Clauses 66, 67 and 38 are clearly profoundly related.
<P>
The Opposition have doubts about the amendment's precise wording. I understand the hon. Gentleman's suggestion that not so much the wording as the whole approach of clauses 66, 67 and 38 should be changed. We are debating the amendment in that context.
<P>
The aim of clause 66 is perhaps as unclear to the layman as any legislative drafting that the Committee has considered, and possibly as any that the House is likely to consider in the near future. Even with the assistance of the Department's admirable notes on clauses, provided overnight, and with the assistance of the many briefing notes that the hon. Member for Northavon and I have received, the clause has failed to give me the slightest indication of how its alleged results would occur.
<P>
My first request to the Minister is that he should explain in layman's language how subsections (1) and (2) are articulated to separate the loan from the grant elements. The inquiry should, as we understand it, be factually based. The Opposition understand the clauses's aim, but do not understand how that aim is conveyed by its wording. An understanding of the wording would help the Committtee now, and as it progresses with increasing attention through clause 67 and the key clause 38.
<P>
I move from that request for elucidation to second much of what the hon. Member for Northavon said about the matter's substance. No doubt in common with many other Committee members, at constituency level I have already found an alarming ratio of cases in which people who were arguably entitled to grants were steered towards loans by the intentions or omissions of well intentioned Benefits Agency personnel, and sometimes by those of expert advisers. I say by intention or omission because it appears that officials and advisers sometimes have so strong a conviction that a loan rather than a grant will ultimately be available that they overdo it, and steer towards a loan people who are or may be eligible for grants, expecting that a loan is the only achievable result.
<P>
If a claimant has an arguable case for a grant, it is sometimes not brought to the claimant's intention. The claimant is left to seek a loan without the full range of possibilities being illustrated to him. That comes close to the nub of the issue raised by the amendment, and it is my experience of the current arrangements. I should be surprised if other Committee members have different experiences in their constituencies. If, despite the opacity of the drafting, we have correctly understood the intent, the provisions that the amendment seeks to remove would intensify rather than ameliorate the problem. They would intensify it because they would, from the start, allow the applicant to be directed formally towards a particular goal. The Minister shakes his head, which is helpful--it would be very helpful indeed if he could tell us where we have slipped up. The clause as we understand it would allow the claimant to be steered quite specifically towards the loan rather than the grant--or, indeed, a range of other possibilities. It is helpful that the Minister shakes his head, and I hope--as I think that the hon. Member for Northavon does--that we shall receive clarification of how the clause is meant to work and the results that it will have. That would alleviate some of our concerns.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
In anticipation of the possibility that we will not be wholly reassured by that clarification, however, I want to raise one further point, which amplifies an issue that the hon. Member for Northavon began to explain. Some members of the Committee feel that a particular problem is associated with loans. It is commonly the experience of those concerned with such matters--Members of Parliament dealing with constituency cases, staff at citizens advice bureaux or other advisers--that the spiral of debt is one of the major causes of difficulty for the people about whom we are talking. Consequently, some of us have severe reservations about the application of budgeting loans. Clearly, they are an entirely appropriate way forward where a temporary problem needs alleviation. Cures for temporary problems which cause diseases that are worse than the original one are, however, not favoured by the medical profession. Similarly, loans that administer to a particular problem, but which help to create a spiral of debt should not be the preferred solution of the benefits system. The way in which the clause will work is, therefore, of particular concern.
<P>
We are dealing, in clause 66, not just with mechanics or with simplification, but with an issue that lies at the root of the relationship between the claimant and the state and between the claimant's present and future. It is important for us to understand in as much detail as possible how the clause will work and to be confident that it will not result in the application of loans in inappropriate cases or where that might worsen rather than improve the claimant's situation. That is why Conservative Members share the desire of the hon. Member for Northavon to use the probing amendment before us to seek great clarification from the Minister. I am sure that he will be able to deal with the issues with great vigour--he must be refeshed, given that he did not need to address our previous sittings, which his ministerial colleague so ably addressed.

<P>

<B>Mr. Howard Flight (Arundel and South Downs):</B> I want, first, to add to the point made by my hon. Friend and Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin) by asking whether the Minister will, in line with what he has said are his general intentions, publish clear guidelines for customers on when they should apply for loans rather than grants. That in part reflects Opposition Members' point about people being misdirected.
<P>
Secondly, my broad understanding is that the loan arrangements have been fairly successful and that the repayment rate ratios are extremely high. As a method of getting people back on their feet, loan arrangements have been one of the successes of the system. It is not entirely clear, given the opaqueness of the clause, whether the Government intend to increase the use of loans. Do the clauses that have been mentioned widen the circumstances in which loans are available, or are they part of a clarification and tidying-up operation? Will the Minister consider the wider usage of loans where the circumstances are relevant?
<P>
<B>Mr. Denham:</B> The amendment would, as the hon. Member for Northavon understands, retain the current wording of section 138(1)(b) of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992. To explain why we do not support the amendment, perhaps it would be helpful to describe the purpose of clause 66. In so doing, I shall address many of the points that Opposition Members made.
<P>
Clause 66 defines, in primary legislation, the three separate types of discretionary social fund--budgeting loans, community care grants and crisis loans. That is a change from current legislation, which does not specify the different types of discretionary payments that the social fund provides. Under current legislation, therefore, each application has to be treated as if it were a request for all the fund's three parts, regardless of which one is being asked for. Customers have to provide enough information for staff to be able to consider each application under all three parts of the fund. That answers the question of the hon. Member for West Dorset.
<P>
Clause 66 will clarify the aims of the three parts of the discretionary social fund and thus improve the Benefits Agency's capacity to advise customers of the most appropriate part of the fund to which to apply according to their circumstances.
<P>
Clause 67 changes section 138(1)(b) of the 1992 Act, to facilitate the introduction of a distinct method of decision making for budgeting loans. We shall discuss that in more detail shortly, but in the context of amendment No. 280, which would prevent that change from taking place, our aim--which I am sure is shared by all hon. Members--is to make the budgeting loan application and decision-making processes simpler for both customers and staff.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> The Minister explained that the purpose of subsection (2), part of which would be removed by the amendment, was to clarify the distinctions between budgeting loans, community care grants and crisis loans. The Bill's drafting does that by allowing the Secretary of State to specify in directions what each of those shall mean. Can the Minister describe what definitions those directions will contain when they are issued?
<P>
<B>Mr. Denham:</B> The important point at this stage is that the clause changes the existing position by defining the three different types of social fund payments in primary legislation. That will enable us to move on to a new form of decision making for budgeting loans, as prescribed by clause 67. Current legislation refers only to payments out of the the social fund, which means that Benefits Agency staff have to consider each application for any type of discretionary payment as if it were an application for all three types of payment. By defining each type of payment, clause 66 will thus allow for separate applications.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I understand that the mere fact of having definitions in the Bill permits an articulation at a later stage in which the Government would make use of the distinctions--not available under the current omnibus definitions--between the three types of grant or loan, but that takes us only so far. Is the Minister willing to elucidate for the Committee roughly what will be meant by the three definitions? It is not enough to understand that they will be objects in law; we need to know what kinds of objects in law they will be.
<P>
<B>Mr. Denham:</B> It is important to recognise that the Act sets out the key change, which is to define those purposes in practice. The directions referred to in clause 66 will give the Secretary of State the power to implement the clause. In circulating the material beforehand, we have aimed to ensure that the Committee is as fully informed as possible about how we propose to use our powers under the legislation. The key issue is what we propose to do. For example, last week, we circulated a background note setting out the purposes behind the policies that have been pursued in clause 66 and subsequent clauses. I hope that the information made available at this stage, which shows the purposes of the different types of grant and loan, will have helped the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I am sure that all members of the Committee are grateful for the explanatory note that was issued recently. In common with many other such notes that were issued subsequent to the original notes on clauses, it is a great help to those of us not equipped with civil servants to elucidate these matters.
<P>
I draw the Minister's attention to the explanatory note, which comes under his covering letter of 13 November, in which the current position vis-a-vis the three types of legal item is set out. The note says that budgeting loans are to help recipients of income support or jobseekers allowance to meet important intermittent expenses which might be difficult to budget for. Community care grants are
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``to help vulnerable people live as independent a life as possible''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and examples are given. Crisis loans are to meet immediate short-term need.
<P>
What is the difference between an immediate short-term need and an important intermittent expense? I find it difficult to get a sense of the circumstances in which these different payments--budgeting and crisis loans--will be administered. However, much more important is the fact that, to someone as woefully ignorant as me, the notes fail to make clear the distinction--the dividing line--between when either kind of loan will be administered and when a community care grant will be administered. In other words, how intermittent does the expense have to be, or how much of a crisis does there have to be for it to be a loan? What sort of period is envisaged? Are we talking about the extension of loans for very wide kinds of expense which may be intermittent but might continue for a long time? Or will budgeting and crisis loans be narrowly defined by directions or regulations, giving community care grants a wide scope for action? That is an important distinction, and although the explanatory notes are a help, we still lack a full grip on understanding them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Denham:</B> The description of the different categories of the purposes under the social fund included in the explanatory note is intended to reflect existing budgeting, community care and crisis loans. The way in which those are handled by social fund officers at local level is covered by directions and guidance by the Secretary of State. That is the current position. The change that we are introducing is that those categories are now to be covered by clause 66 in primary legislation.
<P>
It may be helpful if I give a brief description of the terms. Intermittent expense would be regarded as routine, whereas short-term need relates primarily to unexpected occurrences. Community care grants are concerned with helping people to establish themselves in the community after a period of care to prevent them from going into care, or with helping families under exceptional pressure. Crisis loans are concerned with helping in an emergency or following a disaster. The change made by clause 66 is that it recognises those categories in primary legislation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> Does the Minister want in any way to change the definition of, or the qualification criteria for, a crisis loan? At present, people in crisis who have to move home or lodgings cannot get a crisis loan to meet the deposit on their next home. Those people are in a Catch-22 situation: will the rules be relaxed to help them?
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Denham:</B> I am anxious not to lose track of the earlier questions from the hon. Member for Northavon. The question from the hon. Member for West Chelmsford goes into the detail of the guidance and directions given by the Secretary of State, but although it is a legitimate matter for debate, it is not covered by clause 66.
<P>
The hon. Member for Northavon also asked whether the removal of consideration for grants and loans for all applications was unfair to customers. I stress that the Bill's aim is to improve the social fund system and to make it more user friendly. The application and decision-making process for discretionary social fund loans will be simplified, streamlined and made more efficient.
<P>
That is fully in accordance with the Government's strategy for modernising the social security system as a whole. Customers will no longer have to complete a daunting, 20-page application form and provide information that may have no relevance to their request. Staff will not have to spend time in every case considering a payment for which the customer has not applied.
<P>
To complement the change, we shall improve the information available to customers in forms and leaflets to help them decide which type of assistance is most appropriate to their circumstances. People will still be able to seek advice from the Benefits Agency. However, the Bill, through clause 67, also provides that crisis loan applications may be considered for a grant, and vice versa, where it is sensible to do so.
<P>
Finally, I intend that a direction will be issued by the Secretary of State requiring appropriate officers to have regard to the refusal of a budgeting loan as part of the considerative process for crisis loans.
<P>
The hon. Member for Northavon asked a further question, and I am trying to find the answer for him. Perhaps I should invite the hon. Gentleman to return to any other matters that he wishes me to deal with.

<P>

<B>Mr. Webb:</B> I am sure that the Minister wants to deal with the question of the extent to which budgetary pressures steer officers in one direction or another.
<P>
<B>Mr. Denham:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. There is a fear that people who are unaware that they could qualify for a grant will apply for a loan erroneously. It must be borne in mind that eight out of every nine combined loan and grant applications do not qualify for a grant. That means that the system wastes time in processing those applications inefficiently.
<P>
The facility has mainly served as a safeguard for customers who may not have been aware of the existence of qualifying rules for community care grants. We intend to improve the information about each of the three components of the discretionary social fund. It must be better for customers to be better informed at the outset, and to target the most appropriate payment, than to rely on redress procedures, which mean that they must go through the process twice before they get the most appropriate form of payment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> The Minister said that if people are turned down for a budgeting loan, that will be considered relevant and important when they are being considered for a crisis loan. Am I right in understanding that it will not be considered relevant when they are applying for a community care grant? Was he making that distinction?
<P>
<B>Mr. Denham:</B> There are two types of loan systems--the crisis loan system and the budgeting loan system. Having considered the consultation that we did in the summer and autumn on those systems, and the responses that we received, it has been decided that the Secretary of State will issue a direction that will require appropriate officers to have regard to the refusal of a budgeting loan as part of the considerative process for crisis loans.
<P>
We are also retaining the possibility that crisis loan applications can be considered for a grant and vice versa, where it is sensible to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> I still have some concerns. I appreciate that there will no longer be one long, combined form. Presumably, there will be three separate forms--one for a budgeting loan, one for a crisis loan and one for a community care grant--and the well advised applicant will submit two or perhaps three applications on the off-chance that he or she will be the one in nine who gets the grant. It is not altogether clear to me that that makes the system simpler.
<P>
In the interests of getting on to the substantive clause, which is clause 67, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind hon. Members that we are debating clause 66, not matters that are contained in clause 66, and not clause 67, either.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> Thank you, Mr. Gale. I aim not to stray.
<P>
I want to make a narrow point which arises from a constituency case from the Friday before last and concerns the definition of a crisis loan in clause 66. The Bill states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`` `crisis loan' means a loan awarded in circumstances so specified for the purpose of meeting an immediate short term need''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I seek further clarification on that definition. My constituency case concerns a gentleman who had to leave his accommodation and who was out of work. There was a further complication due to a benefits mix-up that was not the fault of Benefits Agency--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman will understand that the Minister can be expected to respond on the Bill's principles, but not on a specific constituency case.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> I am grateful for that guidance.
<P>
In the context of what will be specified as an immediate short-term need in the definition of a crisis loan, can the Minister confirm whether the Government will change the guidance from the current situation in which an individual cannot qualify for a crisis loan for a deposit for accommodation, for example? That is an immediate short-term problem for individuals, particularly if they are not in work and have no income whatsoever. If they have to move from one form of accommodation to another, they will invariably have to pay a deposit, but will not have the money. Can the Minister clarify whether that sort of problem will be caught in the guidance that presumably will be issued to further explain the definition of a crisis loan?
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> The Committee will be grateful to the Minister for his clarification of clause 66, but severe doubts remain. I hope that the Government will reconsider the clause's construction, and that they will return at a later stage with some changes.
<P>
The Minister did not appear to have the slightest idea how the directions to officials in the use of their discretionary powers will define the three terms that the Bill creates but does not define. That is understandable: the Minister cannot be expected to draft all the directions. Indeed, the directions may be similar to some that exist already but, like other Committee members--including, I suspect, the two Ministers--I have to plead ignorance of any existing directions.
<P>
The Bill does nothing to help. It does not direct the Secretary of State's direction, but merely gives the Secretary of State power to direct. That returns the Committee to a problem that we have often adumbrated: the extent to which the Bill gives the Secretary of State wide powers without defining those powers.
<P>
It is especially important to focus on definitions in connection with clause 66. The social fund is the end of the road, the safety net of all safety nets. As a result, it is of necessity discretionary: hard and fast rules cannot be laid down for dealing with crises and emergencies.
<P>
Conservative Members, however, retain a severe scepticism--shared by our Liberal Democrat colleagues--about the Minister's claim that clause 66 will simplify matters a great deal. The hon. Member for Northavon said that a person in desperate need of some form of aid from the social fund would have to fill out not one complex form but three rather simpler ones. The Minister so far has not contradicted the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
I wish to sound a note of caution on that point. All hon. Members are familiar with the forms produced by bureaucracy. No matter what efforts officials make, the forms are always complex: any assertion that a form will be simple must be treated with some hesitancy and scepticism.
<P>
So in place of one form, three rather simpler forms will exist. That will place the onus on the claimant to decide which of the three to apply for--an implausible onus, as the claimant is not going to be in a condition to know. The onus of decision will then fall on the claimant's advisers. I share the view of the hon. Member for Northavon, in that--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman may not have been satisfied with the Minister's answers, but much of this ground was covered in the debate on clause 66. The clause stand part debate should cover fresh ground.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Thank you, Mr. Gale. I shall conclude my argument very swiftly. There is a desperate need that the three items be defined clearly so that claimants know which of the three forms to use. In the absence of that clarity, severe doubts will remain about whether the clause will achieve its ostensible purpose.
<P>
<B>Mr. Denham:</B> I shall answer some of the matters that have arisen in the debate.
<P>
There will be no need for customers to feel that they have to submit three applications rather than one, as at present. We will ensure that explicit information is freely available through forms and leaflets on each type of discretionary payment. Customers will be able to identify which payment best fits their particular circumstances and complete the appropriate application form. Anyone needing advice on which application to make will be able to get it from the Benefits Agency. We are retaining a power to consider crisis loan applications for community care grants and vice versa.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> Given the evidence we have heard that people are being steered towards loans rather than grants because money is tight, is it realistic to expect that the Benefits Agency will be an impartial arbiter of what should be applied for?
<P>
<B>Mr. Denham:</B> We intend to ensure that people get good advice from the Benefits Agency. That is part of our wider commitment to modernise and simplify the delivery of the Benefits Agency service.
<P>
The hon. Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin) was inviting me to debate every single direction and guidance note under the current system and to compare them with what they might be. That exercise will not help the Committee. The purpose of the clause is to put existing categories of loan and grant which are not included at present into primary legislation. [Interruption.]
<P>
That response is directed also to the hon. Member for West Chelmsford (Mr. Burns). I am being invited to get into the detail of guidance and direction. The clause does not change existing guidance and direction; it puts into primary legislation the three purposes of the existing categories in the discretionary social fund.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 66 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 67</center></H4>
<H4><center>Budgeting loans: criteria for making awards</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Denham:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 302, in page 43, line 39, at beginning insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Subject to subsection (2) below,''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 303, 263, 304 and 264.
<P>
<B>Mr. Denham:</B> This group mainly serves to clarify the provisions of the clause in relation to the budgeting loans scheme. Amendment No. 302 makes clear that new subsection (1A) will be subject to the existing subsection (2) by relocating the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Subject to subsection (2) below''
<P>
</UL></FONT>to the beginning of subsection (1A). Amendment No. 303 simply places those words elsewhere in the clause. Amendment No. 263 makes it clear that the personal circumstances of an applicant, which will be taken into account in deciding budgeting loan applications, will be specified in directions issued by the Secretary of State. Amendment No. 264 simply ties the subsequent reference within the clause.
<P>
A more substantive change will be made through amendment No. 304, ensuring that the further considerative stage will be undertaken automatically when no loan is awarded rather than, as the clause currently implies, leaving it to the discretion of the appropriate officer.
<P>
To put the amendments in context, I should explain that the clause will simplify decision making on social fund budgeting loans. Currently, all budgeting loan decisions are based wholly on the discretion of the social fund officer. That means that applicants must provide a lengthy and detailed justification of every item for which they want money and may be subjected to intensive and arguably intrusive questioning so that the social fund officer can use his discretion on whether a loan should be awarded. That is inconsistent with the purpose of a budgeting loan and leads to unclear decisions, confusion for customers, disproportionate effort by staff and unnecessary expense in administration.
<P>
The clause replaces discretion-based decisions with fact-based decisions. That will involve testing all applications against a simple set of common factual criteria related to the customer's personal circumstances. Where applications would fail on those criteria alone, a further test involving a wider set of criteria will apply.
<P>
The clause as amended will enable decision making to be automated and become quicker, and decisions to be clearer and more comprehensible.

<P>

<B>Mr. Burns:</B> Amendment No. 26 adds to the Bill the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``such of the applicant's personal circumstances as are of a description specified in directions issued by the Secretary of State''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We are grateful to the Minister for the background brief on clauses 66, 67 and 38 that he sent to the Chairman; but will the contents of directions issued by the Secretary of State literally repeat existing practice, or will they be broadened or constricted?
<P>
<B>Mr. Denham:</B> Details of the precise personal circumstances and other criteria to be taken into account have not been finalised. In keeping with the Government's determination to involve and listen to subject experts, however, my officials have conducted a consultative exercise with interested welfare groups and academics to obtain views on the proposals as a whole and the personal circumstances that we have in mind.
<P>
Following the consultation exercise with interested parties, I have decided that the criteria will include the length of time on qualifying benefit--income support or income-based jobseeker's allowance--and the number of people in the assessment unit, by which I mean the number of people for whom the customer receives income support or income-based JSA. Those criteria recognise that the need for budgeting help is likely to increase with the time spent on income support or income-based JSA. Experience and research has shown that families tend to have particular difficulties in budgeting for intermittent expenses.
<P>
Both of the criteria received general endorsements during consultation. There will be other criteria, but I want to evaluate fully all the consultation responses and suggestions before deciding what they will be.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> The Minister said that there will be other criteria, but that he is still evaluating them. What is his thinking on them? In what direction are they moving?
<P>
<B>Mr. Denham:</B> Two issues were raised in discussion and are under consideration. One is the time since the previous budgeting loan award. The thinking in that case is that taking account of that will spread loans more equally between customers and ensure that the same customers do not make excessive use of the scheme at the expense of others. I am, however, still evaluating the consultation responses on that point.
<P>
The second criterion under consideration is the amount of the budgeting loan applied for. The thinking in that case is that taking account of that should encourage customers to exercise more considered judgments when deciding what amount they need to borrow from the fund. We do not want to encourage people to bid for more than they need. I am still considering consultation responses on that point.
<P>
There was a general recognition during discussions that some form of rationing was necessary in a cash-limited scheme and that using the time since the previous award and the amount of that award as criteria was a legitimate spreading device. The consultation also provided the alternative suggestion of considering customers' existing social fund debt position and repayment rate as a means of effective rationing. My officials are considering that possibility, but I hope that hon. Members will understand that it is too early to express a view at this stage.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I should like to draw the Committee's attention to amendment No. 263, which my hon. Friend the Member for West Chelmsford mentioned, but on which I want to put a slightly different emphasis. Some members of the Committee have been concerned throughout our perusal of the Bill that it gives the Secretary of State unconstrained regulation-making powers. In some cases, we have received reassurance from the Minister and his predecessor in Committee, the Under-Secretary of State for Social Security, the hon. Member for Manchester, Withington (Mr. Bradley), about the way in which that power will be used, and in other cases, we have not. The constitutional point remains that there is, and continues to be, a worry about the excessive and unconstrained use of regulation.
<P>
Amendment No. 263, alas, moves in reverse of the correct direction. Clause 67(2)(1A)(a) gives a clear definition--the officer is to act in the light of ``the applicant's peronsal circumstances''. That gives a certain discretion to the officer concerned; it gives no discretion to the Secretary of State to define which personal circumstances are to be entertained. It would have been perfectly reasonable for the Government to have introduced a shadow amendment No. 263 to have specified those circumstances. Although some stipulated by the Minister seem entirely reasonable, one can imagine others.
<P>
Amendment No. 263 gives the Secretary of State an additional power to make directions or regulations--in this case, I think that directions are more appropriate than regulations, but it makes no odds. The Secretary of State effectively has the power to negate the Bills intention by specifying such narrow personal circumstances as would never arise. He could negate the effect of much of what underlies clause 67. No constraint is put on the Secretary of State in that respect.
<P>
This point may or may not matter in the context of this particular provision. The Secretary of State may use his direction-making power in a reasonable way, now or subsequently. But the constitutional point is frightening. It intensifies our fear that the Government seek in the Bill to give the Secretary of State the greatest possible discretion. Amendment No. 263 would give the Secretary of State the power by direction, without even appearance of such safeguards as regulations and the negative resolution procedure, to negate the effect of the provision.
<P>
Has the Minister adequately considered the precedent effect of introducing that kind of amendment into a Bill that is already subject to severe and sustained criticism about its constitutional effect?
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> As the Minister's paper sets out, the main purpose of clause 67, which the amendments tighten up, is to make a budgeting loan essentially non-discretionary, based on factual criteria. What is the background? What are the relative sizes of budgeting loans, community care grants and crisis loans? What is the rationale regarding when the award of community care grants or crisis loans cannot be tightened up to be less discretionary and more fact-based? What lies behind the difference in assessing budgeting loans and assessing community care grants and crisis loans? Are there thoughts of reducing expenditure? Is the net effect of the proposed changes likely to increase or reduce the amount dispensed under the three headings?
<P>
<B>Mr. Denham:</B> I am anxious not to repeat the entire constitutional debate about primary legislation, regulations and directions, which has been well rehearsed in previous sittings. However, I should like to reply to the hon. Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin) as swiftly as possible.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> This is a new departure. To my knowledge--unless I have been asleep--we have not previously discussed the further step of moving to directions. In almost all the provisions that we have dealt with, we discussed regulations, which have at least the appearance--and in the case of those that are subject to affirmative resolution, the reality--of parliamentary approval. Now we are dealing with directions, which seems to be a further step, which must require some attention from the Minister.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Denham:</B> It is worth pointing out, if it is an issue of principle that concerns the hon. Gentleman, that at present, primary legislation stipulates the broad basis on which decisions can be made. Directions issued by the Secretary of State under the existing provisions of section 140(2) set out the detail of the decision-making approach. I do not think, therefore, that a new principle is being introduced, although we have tried to make clear why the amendments are being made.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> This is an important point. I entirely accept that it is the practice, when a piece of primary legislation specifies a general category of action, to specify in directions how officials are to approach the interpretation of that piece of primary legislation. That causes us no trouble whatever.
<P>
The departure here--perhaps the Minister was not sufficiently conscious of the extent to which it is a departure when he was preparing the Bill--is that the definition of the thing that is to be interpreted is itself subject to the direction-making power. The Secretary of State is being given, not the ability to direct her officials about how to interpret something that is set out in statute, but the power to make directions about what officials are to take into account, which itself becomes statutory in force because the statute will say nothing about which personal circumstances or, indeed, that it is personal circumstances. It will merely say whichever personal circumstances are subject to direction, which could mean no personal circumstances. In other words, amendment No. 263 will give the Secretary of State--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I remind that hon. Gentleman that this is an intervention and not a speech.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I will try to be brief. To conclude, the provision gives the Secretary of State the ability to negate the clause in question, which is a departure.
<P>
<B>Mr. Denham:</B> We seem to be making heavy weather of this. The directions that are currently issued by the Secretary of State under section 140(2) of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 also set out the detail of the decision-making approach in regard to, for example, the nature, extent and urgency of circumstances. I do not believe, therefore, that the clause contains a new issue of principle, although the amendments and the clause introduce the concept of personal circumstances as opposed to the current needs-based definition.
<P>
I remind the Committee that it is not appropriate for primary legislation to lay down detailed rules. Details are normally prescribed in secondary legislation. Since 1988, power has been delegated to the Secretary of State to make directions and issue guidance on how payments should be made from the discretionary social fund. Those directions perform a function similar to that of regulations as regards discretionary payment from the social fund.
<P>
Specifying each individual's personal circumstances and other criteria in primary legislation would be too inflexible. To operate the cash limited of the fund requires flexibility.

<P>

<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I apologise for trying the Minister's patience--and yours, Mr. Gale--but I want to make one more brief attempt to make my point.
<P>
The Minister is missing a vital distinction. We are not discussing whether the phrase ``the applicant's personal circumstances'' needs further definition in statute: there is no suggestion that it does. We are debating a narrow point. If Government amendment No. 263 either widened or narrowed the scope of the definition of the Bill, we would have no qualms, but it will, on the contrary, establish a kind of definition which defines, in statute, that which the official is to do as something which is to be subject to direction. That is different from giving the Secretary of State the ability to issue directions about the interpretation of something that is in statute, defined in words--as, for example, ``the applicant's personal circumstances'', with which we have no trouble.
<P>
The Minister is missing that distinction. He is doing something that is constitutionally important, yet he seems to think that he is doing nothing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Denham:</B> The point being missed is that that is how the social fund works. The part of the social fund in question is governed by directions and guidance, not by regulation. There has been no change since the social fund's inception in 1988.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I plead with the Minister to recognise that the Opposition do not object to that, and that we understand how the social fund has to work. There is no problem with the Secretary of State making directions. We are speaking about what amendment No. 263 does to the law, and how it will affect people's concept of English law making. The Secretary of State is not being enabled to make directions. As the Minister has pointed out, the Secretary of State has that power already, and would have power to direct officials about how to interpret proposed subsection (1A)(a) without the change introduced by amendment No. 263.
<P>
I fear that the Minister persists in not believing that the Opposition are making an important point. We are trying to debate whether it is good administrative practice to introduce into the Bill a definition of something that is to be examined, which refers to the direction-making power. The definition is therefore made contingent on the direction, rather than the direction being made an interpretation of the definition. That distinction may seem to be without a difference from the practice of social security, but it is not so from the development of our constitution.
<P>
<B>Mr. Denham:</B> That is the last try. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman is misunderstanding the kind of direction. In the social fund, direction is effectively equivalent to regulation in other aspects of law. I do not, therefore, believe that the amendment introduces a new principle. Personal circumstances have to be identified for our proposed system to operate.
<P>

Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Webb:</B> In all the Committee's lengthy discussion of the amendments' constitutional niceties, I am anxious that it has lost track of the clause's substance. The change is very important--the Liberal Democrats should be grateful for a little more reassurance and justification from the Minister.
<P>
We were grateful for the Minister's note about the new system. In the new system, as we understand it, one supplies simple factual information for the budgeting of loans, which may produce high or low priority or refusal of a loan. If it is refused, a wide range of circumstances is automatically taken into account. I presume that information of those circumstances will be asked for on the original form, which means that it will not be as simple as has been made out, because it will have to encompass a wide range of information.
<P>
Paragraph 36 of the Minister's note states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Ministers will decide how variations in applicants' circumstances are to be treated''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>Obviously that sets alarm bells ringing. I do not want to go into that matter in depth, but does that reinforce what the Minister said earlier, namely that he has an idea of what some of the criteria will be but not others, that the matter is under review and that decisions will be made? If so, what will be the parliamentary scrutiny of the final decision on those issues?
<P>
Finally, can the Minister clarify whether an applicant who is turned down for a budgeting loan--a fact which is perhaps then taken into account in an application for a crisis loan--still has the right to apply for a community care grant, or would that be prevented by the act of having applied for a budgeting loan?
<P>
<B>Mr. Denham:</B> I shall respond to the hon. Member for Northavon and give an example of how the new procedure will operate which, I hope, will answer some of his questions.
<P>
Let us consider, for example, a single woman who has been unemployed for six months and who applies for a loan of &#163;120. Under the new procedure, she would simply have to complete a short application form requiring a minimum of information. First, the application would be subject to a simple test based on a common set of specified circumstances, including the length of time that she had spent on income-based jobseeker's allowance. I described earlier the elements on which we are decided and those that we are still considering.
<P>
If the applicant's particular position in relation to each personal circumstance did not qualify her for a loan at that stage, further consideration could take place on a wider set of practical criteria. The hon. Member for Northavon is correct in that our intention is to capture that information on the initial form. Those wider criteria under consideration include, for example, periods spent in receipt of other income-related benefits prior to the qualifying benefit, and easement of the rules, ignoring breaks in benefit duration, in calculating the time in which the customer has been in receipt of such a benefit. Other persons in the same household who are qualifying benefit recipients in their own right are counted in the number of people in the customer's assessment unit.
<P>
If, in this example, the woman had been in receipt of another income-related benefit immediately prior to receiving jobseeker's allowance, that period could be taken into account if those criteria were established. The effect could be to increase the priority of her application so that she then received a loan.
<P>
Those variations directly address concerns raised by participants in the consultation exercise about groups of customers who could lose out under the initial, simple test. I hope that the hon. Member for Northavon will accept that that is evidence that there was genuine consultation and that views have been listened to and taken on board.
<P>
In answer to another of the hon. Gentleman's questions, there is no parliamentary scrutiny of directions, but they are placed in the Library and are available to interested parties, including, of course, welfare rights and similar organisations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> I am grateful to the Minister. My final question was whether the application for a budgeting loan precludes future or simultaneous application for a community care grant. What is the relationship between the two?
<P>
<B>Mr. Denham:</B> I think I can reassure the hon. Gentleman that an application for one part of the fund does not preclude an application for another part, although it is our intention to improve the quality of information so that customers can make an informed choice about which part of the fund would be most appropriate for their application.
<P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> On a point of clarification, Mr. Gale. Are we taking the Government amendments in a group with amendments Nos. 293, 294 and 295? I had thought that they were grouped separately.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> My apologies: I have been over eager in my desire to make progress. We are considering amendment No. 293, with which it is convenient to take amendments Nos. 294 and 295.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I am grateful, Mr. Gale. I should have been severely embarrassed if I had been required to move Government amendments.
<P>
Essentially, amendments Nos. 293 and 295 are the same, differing only in that they affect the Bill in different places. I shall speak to those amendments first, and then turn to amendment No. 294.
<P>
The intention behind amendments Nos. 293 and 295 is plain: the specification of one mouth would replace the Bill's chronological vagueness, and is in tune with the Committee's efforts to give the Bill more definition and less arbitrariness. A careful look at paragraph (a) of clause 38(1) reveals a worrying arbitrariness in the drafting, quite apart from the use of the phrase ``such time'', with which the amendment deals. The paragraph states that an appropriate officer
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``shall review a social fund determination, if an application for a review is made, within such time and in such form and manner as may be prescribed''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>That is our old friend unrestrained regulation, applicable to all aspects of the conduct of the review. The Minister will be relieved that Opposition Members, having been defeated so frequently in similar debates, have forsaken the uphill battle of trying to introduce some clarity about ``form'' and ``manner''. The problem sooner or later will come home to roost for the Minister, and for ordinary people, so he should not be too delighted that we are not resuming that battle. Our intentions with amendments Nos. 293 and 295 are restricted to clarifying the question of timing.
<P>
That timing is important, as considerable doubts remain about the Government's intentions. Clearly, a regulation specifying the wrong period could lead to unintended consequences, and it is absolutely proper to defend individual rights by insisting that the Bill offer a clear definition of the timetable involved. We do not suggest that the present Secretary of State has issued regulations that were improper or which have had an unintended effect, but another Secretary of State might. The Minister should not object to the principle of introducing a time limit.
<P>
I anticipate that the Minister's response will be that specification of the period involved would inhibit too much the Government's proper flexibility. The Minister may find a more elegant form of words, but I have lost count of the times that his colleague the Under-Secretary has used a similar formula.
<P>
The amendment would not inhibit the Government's flexibility, for which we recognise the need. The question is whether that flexibility should be constrained within certain limits. If the Minister thinks that a timetable of one month is wrong, we shall not waste time quarrelling about the precise number of days or weeks. The intention is merely to constrain the regulation-making power on a subject of great concern.
<P>
Amendment No. 294 refers to a most interesting case. Throughout the Committee's proceedings, we have argued against unconstrained regulation-making powers. Clause 38(1)(b) takes us two steps further--not merely to regulation or to direction, but to the Secretary of State acting with complete arbitrariness, as complete as judicial review. We have already discussed the limits allowed by judicial review. Clause 38(1)(b) states that an appropriate officer
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``may review such a determination in such other circumstances as he thinks fit.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>What an extraordinary concept in such a context--the power is completely unconstrained.
<P>
One could imagine a one-line Bill which stated, ``The Secretary of State shall so determine social security arrangements as he thinks fit.'' That would be expeditious legislation. The Committee would not have had to have quarrelled long about the Bill--we could have reduced it to just one clause. But the purpose of the legislative process is precisely to avoid arbitrary decision making; to create procedures which allow the democratic process to be invoked; and to check and continuously revise the effects of legislation.
<P>
Amendment No. 294 is not wholly satisfactory, but it aims to take two steps back from the pure arbitrariness of the words ``as he thinks fit'' and from not only direction but regulation. Circumstances should be ``prescribed''. How can the Minister argue persuasively that making the Secretary of State prescribe how he is going to act somehow overly constrains discretion? The Minister's colleague has argued in countless other cases that that is precisely the degree of flexibility that the Government require. Why should this case be an exception? Why carry an already overly unconstrained Bill to the point of ludicrousness by including a phrase which allows decisions to be carried forward without even a description of how that will happen?

<P>

<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I support the amendments moved my hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset.
<P>
Clause 67 is designed to make more straightforward the applications under the three categories for loans, grants and budgeting loans to reduce the use of descretion as much as possible. Any grant or loan for which an application is made is, by definition, needed promptly. It is appropriate to have a time scale under which a decision must be taken on review. Clause 67 must make that period shorter than it would otherwise have been. If the period is to be prescribed by directive or regulation--the Minister will say that that makes it inappropriate to include such a requirement in primary legislation--what period does he have in mind?
<P>
Amendment No. 294 makes the same point. If we understand the jargon, in this territory, directives, not regulations, set things out. The reference to the circumstances that an officer ``things fit'' is inappropriate, even if it repeats provisions in the Social Security Administration Act 1992. Surely, such matters should be defined by directive, not regulation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Denham:</B> The amendments seek to repeat themes that have been heard frequently in debate in the Committee, and hon. Members will not be surprised to hear me echo the sentiments of my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary. The Government cannot accept the amendments. Our objective is to create a flexible welfare system that can respond quickly and effectively to the changing needs of our customers. The degree of flexibility that we want cannot be achieved when detailed technical provisions are set out in primary legislation or when discretion can be applied only in the circumstances set out in regulations. That is what we have at present, and it inhibits agencies in their efforts to provide a more efficient service to customers.
<P>
Clause 38 sets out the separate and distinct review arrangements for dealing with disputed discretionary social fund decisions in relation to community care grants, budgeting loans and crisis loans.
<P>
Amendment Nos. 293 and 295 would put in legislation a one-month time limit for customers to ask for reviews of discretionary social fund decisions. The effect of the amendments would be to introduce a rigid time limit for applicants, both for a review against an initial determination and for further review to the social fund inspector. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I am getting more and more confused. The hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs (Mr. Flight) seemed to be speaking about the need for the review process to be completed within one month. However, I agree with the Minister's understanding that, according to the amendment, it is the application which must be submitted within one month. The hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs seemed to be talking about the review having to be completed within one month. In other words, the onus would be on the person who did the review rather than on the applicant. There is some muddle about the exact meaning of the clause and the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Denham:</B> The effect of the amendments would be to introduce a time limit for applicants, both for a review against an initial determination and for further review to the social fund inspector.
<P>
Amendment No. 294 would provide for regulations to prescribe the circumstances in which a social fund determination could be reviewed without an application from a customer.
<P>
The paragraphs of the clause simply carry forward existing provisions for social fund reviews. On the point raised by the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs, the regulations we shall make will, similarly, mirror current provisions. Those allow a 28-day time limit for applying for a review against a discretionary social fund decision. That time limit is the same for applications for reviews of initial determinations and against review decisions to the independent review service. The period may be lengthened where there are special reasons. It is worth mentioning that special reasons are not prescribed in regulations or directions; it is for the discretion of appropriate officers and social fund inspectors to decide what they are. To give a common example, a customer may be waiting for supporting evidence from a third party, such as a doctor's letter or a social services report.
<P>
In the majority of cases, 28 days gives claimants ample time--
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I may be anticipating the Minister's remarks, but if that is his view and if the 28-day period is exceeded in exceptional circumstances, it would be helpful to know why he will not accept the amendment in the sense of allowing exceptional circumstances to be prescribed under which the 28-day limit would not apply?
<P>
<B>Mr. Denham:</B> The answer to that is one that we have rehearsed many times before. We have made clear our intentions in Committee, but we cannot achieve the degree of flexibility that we want when detailed provisions are set out in primary legislation or when discretion can be applied only in the circumstances that are set out in regulation. That argument has been rehearsed throughout the Committee. The paragraphs of the clause simply carry forward existing provisions for social fund reviews. We intend to make regulations that will similarly mirror the current provisions.
<P>
In the majority of cases, 28 days will give claimants ample time to challenge a decision that they think is wrong. Where, however, there are special reasons, it is important to have the discretion to extend that time limit. That would give the flexibility necessary to deal with a variety of complex situations. The amendment would undermine that.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Opposition Members do not doubt the good faith in which the Minister states that the initial regulations will prescribe a 28-day period. We find that comforting. Does he accept, however, that the paragraph as drafted would allow the Secretary of State to set, to give an absurd example, a five-minute limit? Does he agree that that would not be acceptable in terms of an individual's rights and that there is therefore an argument for setting down, when an individual's rights are considered, what I described slightly misleadingly as a limit--perhaps I should say a maximum--which cannot then be presecribed in regulation as five minutes?
<P>
<B>Mr. Denham:</B> The corresponding argument is that if all provisions of that sort are covered by primary legislation, it becomes extremely difficult to maintain the flexibility to develop a modern and efficient social security system, which we want to establish. That is why we always try to achieve the right balance between what should be in primary legislation and what should be dealt with by regulation. I feel that in the clause, as in other parts of the Bill, we have that balance right.
<P>
Amendment No. 294 would limit the use of discretion by the Secretary of State to decide the circumstances in which a discretionary social fund decision can be reviewed. There are clear rules for reviewing social fund determinations. A typical example would be when an applicant has been refused a budgeting loan because he has not been in receipt of income support for 26 weeks. If that decision was subsequently found to be incorrect, it could be internally reviewed and a budgeting loan awarded. We see no value in putting those social fund rules in legislation. The system needs to be able to deal with a wide range of circumstances and it is in the customers' best interests for agencies to be able to respond promptly to their needs.
<P>
I hope that I have explained why the amendment is unnecessary and that the hon. Member for West Dorset will withdraw it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I am afraid that my colleagues and I do not find the Minister's views either novel--they replicate those that have been frequently advanced by his ministerial colleague in response to other clauses and amendments--or persuasive.
<P>
We retain the view that it is inappropriate in a piece of primary legislation, where the clause in question relates specifically to the rights of an individual, to establish a principle that permits in regulation something to be stated which clearly conflicts with the reasonable expectations of individuals.
<P>
With regard to the ``thinks fit'' issue, we continue to find it surprising that the Minister believes that so wide a discretion is either the only way forward or, indeed, an appropriate way forward. Nevertheless, we accept that it is, alas, in tune with the remainder of the preoccupations of the Minister and his colleagues. We would probably be pushing large boulders uphill in pursuing the issue, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Denham:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 277, in page 23, line 11, leave out `Subject to subsection (4) below,'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss Government amendments Nos. 278, 300, 301 and 309 to 311.
<P>
<B>Mr. Denham:</B> Clause 38 sets out the separate and distinct review arrangements for dealing with disputed discretionary social fund decisions.
<P>
Government amendments Nos. 277, 278 and 309 will remove the restriction that would prevent certain budgeting loan determinations made in the Benefits Agency being further reviewed by a social fund inspector at the independent review service. These changes have emerged as a result of the consultation exercise on the new budgeting loans scheme. We have listened carefully to the responses received and think it proper that all budgeting loan determinations should carry a further right of review with a social fund inspector.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> As the Liberal Democrats originally tabled amendments Nos. 277 and 278, we are absolutely delighted that the Government have decided to pick them up and run with them and, I hope, improve them by adding the further consequential amendments Nos. 300, 301 and 309 to 311. I think it fair to say that that is probably a first in this Committee. I do not remember the Government accepting any Opposition amendments in full until now. Since they are clearly fair and sensible amendments, I am delighted that the Government are accepting them.

<P>

<B>Mr. Flight:</B> In view of my own misreading of clause 38, will the Minister say whether there are any regulations or directives hidden in the Bill that relate to the clause? Are there any to determine a time period during which an officer is obliged to assess a review and find one way or the other if such review is made within the prescribed 28-day time limit?
<P>
<B>Mr. Denham:</B> Perhaps it would be helpful if I described how the review of budgeting loan decisions is to be carried out. Appropriate officers and social fund inspectors will review budgeting loan decisions based on factual criteria introduced under clause 67. The appropriate officer and social fund inspector will check that the information used to decide a customer's application is accurate and complete. If it is, the decision will be confirmed. If an error is found by an appropriate officer, a new decision carrying a further right of review will be issued. If a social fund inspector discovers an error, the inspector may substitute a new decision or refer the case back to an appropriate officer to correct the information on the computer system and issue a new decision, which will also carry a further right of review.
<P>
Regulations will continue to set out time limits on review applications, the method by which a review application is made, and a procedure for applying for a review. The clause also provides that in making decisions on review, appropriate officers and social fund inspectors will act on directions issued by the Secretary of State and take account of general guidance issued by the Secretary of State and local guidance issued by the nominated manager in the Benefits Agency.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> It is appropriate that the Committee should step back a little at this point. We have spent much of the morning debating amendments to clauses 66, 67 and 38. As the hon. Member for Northavon rightly said at the beginning of the morning's proceedings, those three clauses needed to be considered together. We have completed that consideration and it is right to make a comprehensive statement of our unease about the three clauses and the Government's amendments to them.
<P>
Social fund discretionary payments are, as I said earlier, the safety net of safety nets. We accept that discretion must be exercised over those payments: they are by nature discretionary. That distinguishes them from most other aspects of the Bill which, although excessive elements of discretion have regrettably been introduced into them, are not by nature discretionary.
<P>
It behoves the Committee and the Government to consider especially the difficulties and dangers attendant on a system of discretionary payments. Clause 38--albeit amended by amendment No. 277 in response to Liberal Democrat proposals--concludes the sequence of actions inaugurated by clauses 66 and 67. It widens the power of discretion within the inevitably discretionary administration of the social fund. By refusing to accept amendments Nos. 293 and 295, the Government have blocked the protection for the individual offered by specific time limits.
<P>
The Government's ostensible intention with clause 38, as with clauses 66 and 67, is to simplify the process. Before I conclude my remarks, I shall make a brief diversion to adumbrate the implications of the word ``modernisation''. The Government have used that word repeatedly in describing the Bill, and no Conservative Member doubts that many things need modernising. But modernisation should not be used to mean depriving people of rights--or increasing their rights--or enlarging the scope of ministerial discretion. Modernisation has to do with administrative practice, with which the Bill does not deal.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It is an interesting thesis, but the hon. Gentleman is in danger of making a speech more suitable for Second Reading. He should confine himself to clause 38.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Thank you for that admonition, Mr. Gale, I shall do as you say.
<P>
Clause 38 does not modernise: instead, it increases the scope for discretion at the risk of endangering an individual's rights. The Committee has registered its doubts about that, and the Minister has offered clarification about the way in which the regulation-making and other powers will be used in the first instance. However, the danger arising from clause 38, and from clauses 66 and 67, cannot be counteracted entirely by the Minister's assurances.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will give the Committee a general assurance about the way in which the Government view the social fund's operation. He should make it clear that the Government will not use clauses 38, 66 and 67 to respond to budgetary pressures, even though a highly discretionary social fund inevitably will lend itself to such usage. For example, the danger is that the Government could use the Bill's wide powers of discretion to instil in officers certain attitudes so that the social fund takes the strain of budgetary implications from which other, more determined, parts of the social security system are protected. That would be a disaster, particularly because the social fund is the last stop. It is, therefore, extraordinarily important that in responding to the stand part debate, the Minister should make clear in unequivocal terms that it is not the Government's intention ever to use to that end the discretion given here.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Denham:</B> The purpose of the set of clauses that we have been discussing is to improve the operation of the social fund. As with clause 67, that means that we will simplify decision making. We will make sure that budgeting loan decisions, which are currently based wholly on the discretion of the social fund officer, will be replaced by fact-based decisons. The system will be quicker and the decisions will be clearer and more comprehensible.
<P>
Clause 38 sets out the separate and distinct review arrangements for dealing with the disputed discretionary social fund decisions. As amended, it will allow all budgeting loan decisions to be further reviewed by a social fund inspector at the independent review service.
<P>
Clause 38 is, for all practical purposes, a re-enactment of section 66 of the Social Security Administration Act 1992. However, there is a modification to subsection (7), specifically designed to support the introduction of the budgeting loans scheme, which we discussed in relation to clauses 66 and 67. That modification means that appropriate officers and social fund inspectors will review budgeting loan decisions based on factual criteria introduced under clause 67. The review process will therefore mirror the decision-making process at the original determination. Regulations will continue to set out time limits on review applications, the method by which the review application is made and the procedure for applying for a review.
<P>
The clause also provides that if making decisions on review, appropriate officers and social fund inspectors will act on directions issued by the Secretary of State, and take account of general guidance issued by the Secretary of State and local guidance issued by the nominated manager in the Benefits Agency.
<P>
The clause concerns the re-enactment of the current review arrangements for dealing with disputed discretionary social fund decisions, but the modification will set up a new, simplified procedure for reviewing budgeting loan decisions.
<P>
I have listened to the comments of the hon. Member for West Dorset, but I draw his attention to what I have just said. I grant him that if he had been here in the previous Parliament, he would have made precisely the same objections to those arrangements; but I have stated clearly and succinctly what action we are taking and why.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 38, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 71</center></H4>
<H4><center>Overpayments out of social fund</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Denham:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 305, in page 45, line 29, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(2) In relation to any time before the commencement of sections 10 and 11 above, section 71ZA of the Administration Act shall have effect as if for paragraphs (a) and (b) of subsection (2) there were substituted the following paragraphs--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``(a) in paragraph (a) of subsection (5) and subsection (5A), the words ``reversed or varied on an appeal or'' were omitted;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) in paragraph (b) of subsection (5), the words `appeal or' were omitted; and''.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The clause inserts a new section into the Social Security Administration Act 1992 to bring discretionary social fund payments within section 71 of that Act. That legislation gives the Secretary of State the power to recover overpayment of benefit where it has been determined that it was obtained by broad misrepresentation or the failure to disclose relevant facts.
<P>
As drafted, clause 71 makes reference to clauses in part I of the Bill and cannot therefore at present be commenced separately from clause 38, which will not be commenced until the new decision-making arrangements as a whole are in place. However, there is no practical reason why the provisions in the clause for the recovery of discretionary social fund overpayments should not come into effect from an earlier date. The amendment will allow clause 71 to take effect in advance of the commencement of clause 38, and I commend it to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> How will it be commenced---through a statutory instrument on a commencement order?
<P>
<B>Mr. Denham:</B> If I may, I shall write to the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> Does the Minister not know?
<P>
<B>Mr. Denham:</B> I am advised that it will be on a commencement order.

<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security </B>(Mr. Keith Bradley): I beg to move amendment No. 296, in page 44, line 21, leave out subsection (3).
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take Government amendments Nos. 312 and 313.
<P>
I call Mr. Denham--I am sorry, I did not notice the change. I should have called Mr. Bradley.
<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> There is a remarkable physical resemblance.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> I take that as a compliment. I apologise, Mr. Gale, and thank you for your forbearance as we changed places.
<P>
The Government intend that any regulations made under the clause should be subject to the normal rules for references to the Social Security Advisory Committee. The Social Security Administration Act 1992 provides that proposals to make regulations under the social security legislation be referred to the SSAC subject to a number of exemptions. Among those exemptions is the fact that the regulations are made within six months of the coming into force of the power under which they are made. The amendments will ensure that the standard rules will apply to any regulations which are made under the clause.
<P>
As it stands, clause 68(3) is causing confusion. The amendments will clarify the position. The Government are not seeking favourable treatment for regulations made under the clause. The amendments will ensure that regulations will be treated in the same way as others made under the Bill's powers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> Does the Minister accept that the amendment has superseded an Opposition amendment--Government amendments take priority--so the Government are, in effect, agreeing to the Opposition's amendment? Will he confirm that when the Bill was drafted the intention was not to include the referral power? Will he also confirm that the Government have had to think again, partially in response to the Opposition amendment and partially because of the pressure placed on the Minister behind the scenes over the past few weeks by his hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe) and others?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> Nothing could be further from the truth. I wrote to the hon. Gentleman to clarify the position. It was always the Government's intention to do this. When it was identified, we always intended to explain the confusion over clause 68(3), and it was always our intention to correct it in Committee.
<P>
<B>Miss Julie Kirkbride (Bromsgrove):</B> I am glad that the Minister couched many of his remarks in terms of ``confusion'', because there has been a great deal of confusion about the Government's intentions towards to single parents. Before the general election we heard that they intended not to proceed with the regulations, which were part of the previous Government's proposals.
<P>
<B>Mr. Kevin Hughes </B>(Doncaster North): Not true.
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> The hon. Gentleman may rebut what I am saying, but the Secretary of State, in an interview with Polly Toynbee before the general election, said that she would not accept the previous Government's proposals to change benefits for lone parents.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. There will be a clause stand part in due course and the hon. Lady may make such points then if she catches my eye. She must confine herself to the amendment for the moment.
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> Forgive me, Mr. Gale. I was being barracked by Labour Members and felt that I had to clarify my remarks.
<P>
To return to the germane point about the amendment, Conservative Members can claim this morning's second coup. The hon. Member for Newbury (Mr. Rendel) said that the Liberal Democrats had got the Government to accept an amendment, and Conservative Members can now claim to have had another amendment accepted because we proposed to submit the regulations to the Social Security Advisory Committee. The Government have been forced to accept our amendment, although they were not prepared to give us credit for it and proceeded on the basis that it was theirs, not ours. We welcome the amendment, inasmuch as we proposed to submit regulations to the SSAC so that arrangements for lone parents' benefit would not be separate from all others in the social security system. It is right and proper that the SSAC should be consulted on changes to our benefits system and welfare state.
<P>
We are pleased with the Government's amendment, but will the Minister explain why he has changed his mind. It is clear that there has been a change of mind because the Government's proposal was not originally in the Bill. That is astonishing bearing in mind that the SSAC's verdict, approval, recommendations and observations are germane to any matter that will change the benefits system. The fact that the proposal was left out of the Bill raises many questions. I am sure that the experts from the Department of Social Security who have so ably helped both Ministers would not have been so remiss as to have left out such a provision in the first place unless those Ministers had told them that they did not want regulations to be submitted to the SSAC. Why would Ministers have done that? Probably because questions would have been raised about the proposal to change lone parent benefit, which could have proved embarrassing for the Government. I do not want to be told off again for going wider than my brief: however, it may be embarrassing for the Government to hear what the SSAC has to say and they may find it difficult to explain their position as they have taken up our original plan to equalise benefit for lone parents and for married couples.
<P>
Will the Minister explain why the provision was not included in the Bill? Logical people will assume that the Government have changed their mind. If the Minister wants to blame his officials for not having included the provision, we would be interested to hear why that omission occurred. If he does not want to blame them, will he explain his change of mind?
<P>
Conservative Members welcome the Government's action, but we would like a little credit for the fact that we got there first and proposed the original amendment, which the Government were unable to accept out of pique.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> The Minister's opening speech was quite remarkable for its glibness and the way in which it glossed over the background to the situation. An amendment identical to amendment No. 296 was tabled by the Opposition some time ago and the Government have now acted, I suspect, on pressure from their own Back Benchers, as I shall outline in the course of my remarks. It is extraordinary for the Government to give the impression that there was confusion about clause 68 and that an amendment was needed.
<P>
Clause 68(3) categorically says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Nothing in any enactment shall''--
<P>
</UL></FONT>with regard to the power to reduce child benefit for lone parents--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``require the reference to the Social Security Advisory Committee of any regulations made by virtue of this section which are contained in a statutory instrument made before the end of the period of three months beginning with the day on which this Act is passed.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>That is quite clear. To my mind, unless the Minister wishes to correct me, it means that the Government were not planning to refer the clause's proposals to cut lone parent benefits and child benefit to the SSAC. It is incredible for the Minister to say that there is confusion; the clause is categorical.
<P>
Why have the Government decided to accept the Opposition's amendment, and to reinstate the former status quo, which enabled references to the SSAC, as my hon. Friend the Member for Bromsgrove (Miss Kirkbride) rightly said? I suspect that the answer is twofold. First, the Opposition proposed the amendment, which is eminently reasonable and aims to restore the status quo. Interested parties in Britain, keenly interested in benefits and lone parents, would like that amendment to be agreed to.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Secondly, the Government's decision has something to do with an article by the hon. Member for Maryhill in last Tueday's Morning Star, in which she heralded their climbdown. I suspect that that is related to early-day motion 333, which at least 39 Labour Members have signed, led by the hon. Member for Preston (Audrey Wise). The motion makes precisely the point made by our amendment, and now adopted by the Government. That point is that there should be references to the SSAC of important matters such as the one that we are discussing.
<P>
It is extraordinary that the Minister should make a brief, glossy and glib speech to try to hide the facts. The bottom line is that the Minister has come under extreme pressure from a group of his own Back Benchers--at a recent count, 39 of them. The hon. Gentleman is trying to buy off his own Back Benchers--by accepting the Opposition amendment, and to transcend it by tabling an identical amendent. The Minister should at least have the decency to come clean and accept that. He should acknowledge that the Government have been anxious about their original plans, have thought again and have listened to the arguments of Labour Members and of the Opposition. The Minster should tell us that he has decided to accept the merits of the case and to table his own amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Watson:</B> I echo my hon. Friend's remarks. The Minister should be clear that we welcome the change of heart. We are not trying to get at him, or anything of that sort. My hon. Friend the Member for Bromsgrove explained clearly the amemdment's provenance. [Interruption.] If I may have the Minister's attention for a minute, where the amendment came from, and why it is being tabled by the Government, is clear to everyone, inside and outside the Committee Room--except, perhaps, to the Minister.
<P>
It is a sign of strength, not of weakness, occasionally to recognise a good idea suggested by the official Opposition or any other opposition, and to adopt it. A little generosity of spirit would be appropriate, not least because nobody was convinced by the Minister's opening speech, except perhaps the payroll vote.
<P>
Secondly, the Minister referred to regulations to be made under the clause. The Opposition do not object to regulations being made under various clauses. My point of order at the beginning of the sitting, however, met with a resounding silence. Yet again, I asked the Minister when we will see draft regulations. The promise that we would see them was, I am sure, made in all good faith. It has not yet been kept. I am sure that Ministers have every intention of keeping it, and I should be grateful to know when we shall see some draft regulations. Will it be this side of Christmas, or the other side? In hope that the Minister can be more specific.

<P>

<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> I am always prepared to be generous in spirit when responding to arguments of substance. In this case, there are no such arguments.
<P>
It was claimed that the Opposition tabled the amendment weeks ago: in fact, it was tabled last Friday.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> The Minister is being slightly disingenuous. As he knows--and as his officials will be able to confirm--the Opposition tabled an amendment weeks ago that would ensure that the Bill made explicit reference to the SSAC. Sadly, however, the relevant amendment was badly drafted and out of order. It had to be re-tabled, but the intentions were the same. One of the problems of being in opposition is that amendments are sometimes badly drafted. The previous Government had to put up with such failures by the then Opposition for 18 years.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> I do not think that I need to comment further, although the Labour party in opposition did not need to redraft and re-table amendments in the way that the hon. Gentleman describes.
<P>
Clause 68 states that regulations will be referred to the SSAC after three months. It is normal practice not to refer proposals for regulations to the SSAC immediately after primary legislation. The Bill is no different from any similar measure under this or any previous Government. It was always our intention to refer regulations to the SSAC, but there was confusion about the drafting of the clause. That has been corrected, to everyone's benefit.
<P>
I commend the amendment to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Given what the Minister has said, why does subsection (3) appear only in clause 68? Why does not an equivalent subsection appear in other appropriate clauses?
<P>
It seems to me that what the clause says is the reverse of what the Minister contended. It states that regulations will not be put before the SSAC within three months. In other words, time will be given to produce proposals. The clause does not say that such proposals will be brought forward after three months.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> As I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will realise on reflection, that point is covered by section 173(5) of the Social Security Administration Act 1992.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Webb:</B> We have reached one of the most important clauses in the Bill, and I am glad that we have the chance for a significant debate.
<P>
Parallel measures largely affecting lone parents on means-tested benefits were debated recently in a separate Committee on delegated legislation. Clause 68 contains a corresponding change for lone parents who receive an addition to child benefit. As has been mentioned, 41 Labour Members have signed an early-day motion opposing the cut in one-parent benefit. As far as I know, that represents the largest single statement of opposition to a Government policy since 1 May. That in itself should cause the Government to consider whether the clause should stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Liberal Democrats believe that this is a Tory policy that the Labour Government have decided to implement. Our party is therefore the only one that can stand against it with any credibility.
<P>
There are two principal arguments against the abolition of one-parent benefit. The first has to do with the original reason for the introduction of the benefit: it was to help with the extra costs--in comparison with the costs borne by two-parent families--that lone parents faced when bringing up children. The Finer committee, a Government committee of the late 1960s and early 1970s, identified the problem, and a significant amount of evidence has been accumulated since.
<P>
The family budget unit at York university found evidence in support of the proposition that lone parents face additional costs. It attempted to construct budgets for different sorts of families and found that if one takes account of child care and babysitting costs, lone parents--particularly working lone parents, which is the group that we are talking about here--face higher costs than two-parent families with children. It is obvious: in a two-parent family, one parent can, if necessary, be at home looking after the children at no financial cost while the other parent goes out to work. That is not an option for lone parents, so it is common sense that lone parents face additional costs in going to work when compared with two-parent families.
<P>
Beyond that, the Policy Studies Institute, which is regularly commissioned by the Department of Social Security to undertake research, has started to come to the view that lone parents incur additional costs--that was not always its view. As the briefing note prepared for all hon. Members by the Library points out, it is starting to change its views after a period of extensive research on lone parenthood.
<P>
The 1985 Green Paper of the Department of Health and Social Security, as it then was, said that the purpose of retaining one-parent benefit was to reflect the additional costs faced by lone parents. The Department itself thus recognised that there is a case to be answered.
<P>
The Government have commissioned research from many experts, one of whom is Professor Jonathan Bradshaw of the University of York, an acknowledged expert on lone parenthood. Professor Bradshaw's briefing says that lone parents receive a premium because of the
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``evidence that lone parents have extra costs. The DSS''--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
in arguing to the Social Security Advisory Committee that they do not have extra costs
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``states that there is `no consistent evidence''',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
but Professor Bradshaw says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``In fact there is very considerable empirical evidence''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He cites a 1993 survey by Whiteford and Hicks and a recent study by Dickens, Fry and Pashardes in 1995 which suggest that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``lone parents have extra direct, indirect and time costs as a result of caring for children alone.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In other words, there is a considerable case to be answered. I put it no more strongly than that.
<P>
When the SSAC examined the issue, it said that it was unclear, because there was evidence for and evidence against. That committee, which is independent of all parties and contains many experts, warned the Government not to go ahead until they had looked into the issue in more detail. The Government are ignoring independent advice. What is the point of having a carefully considered and independent assessment of the issue if the Government simply ignore it?
<P>
I hope that you do not mind this digression, Mr. Gale, but I am struck by the parallels with the Louise Woodward case, which has been in the press recently. In that case, the judge came in for a lot of criticism. Here, the Minister is saying, ``The jury's out, but I'm going to make the decision anyway''. That would be even more of a mockery of justice than the Louise Woodward trial. There, the judge overturned the decision of the jury; here, the Minister is deciding while the jury is still out.
<P>
There is a case to be answered. I am not yet convinced that the case is strong enough and I am not sure how far it should be taken, but the Government have not rebutted the evidence and until they do, the benefit should be abolished.
<P>
As for the additional costs of lone parents, the Minister would say, ``If there are any, they are for child care and we've got child care sorted''. That has been the thrust of ministerial statements on the issue. They talk about a national child care strategy and, yes, a certain amount of extra money is going into child care. They also talk about the child care disregard in family credit. When the Chancellor stood up and said that he was raising it from &#163;60 to &#163;100 per week, there were cheers on the Government benches. I tabled a question asking how many people would benefit from that disregard. The answer is 2,000 at present. That is three per constituency. I can probably name the three lone parents in my constituency who benefit from that policy. Let us suppose for a moment that it is a great triumph--suppose the number of lone parents in work doubles.--That would mean that 4,000 lone parents would benefit. That disregard does not offer a serious answer to the fact that lone parents face extra costs through child care.
<P>
There is an even stronger case for preserving one-parent benefit. It relates to the thrust of the Government's welfare-to-work policy. One-parent benefit plays a key role in encouraging lone parents and giving them the financial incentive to take work. The cut in this benefit is of most damage to working lone parents--for lone parents on income support, it comes off their income support and they do not bother to claim it. It is a reward for taking a job, and the Government are going to take it away. That, coupled with the cuts in means-tested benefits for lone parents, will make it even harsher on those who take low-paid jobs.
<P>
I have a feeling that when the Minister speaks, he may refer to the statement that lone parents who take work are &#163;50 a week better off, on average, than those who are on benefits. The Under-Secretary has, to his great credit, always been very careful with his words on this point. When he addressed the Committee that examined lone-parents means-tested benefits, he explained very precisely what the &#163;50 a week figure is about. It takes working lone parents on family credit and compares their hypothetical income out of work.
<P>
But not all the Minister's ministerial colleagues have been so assiduous. Even if one were to attribute to them the best possible motives, it would be fair to say that the repeated use of the &#163;50 a week figure has been interpreted by commentators in a highly misleading way. However carefully it may have been expressed by Ministers--and I give credit to the Minister for his care--the impression being given by the use of this figure is that if lone parents take a job they will get &#163;50 a week more on average. Therefore, if a benefit worth &#163;6 a week is scrapped, what does it matter, because lone parents will still be &#163;44 a week better off.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
As the Minister knows, that is not true. Lone parents who have got work and receive family credit are a sub-group. They are not typical of the lone parents who are on benefit--the sort of people at whom the welfare-to-work package is aimed. In particular, they typically have lower child care costs. Indeed, their child care costs are often zero, which is how they manage to get a job. They typically have lower travel-to-work costs--which is why it is easier for them to get a job--and higher and more predicatable maintenance income. Each of those factors may not be true of many lone parents on income support. Therefore, to imply that the Government's policy will lead to lone parents getting jobs that make them &#163;50 a week better off is highly misleading. I am sure that the Minister would not dream of doing that, but I hope that when he and his colleagues use that figure in the future, it will not be as an argument for cutting benefits from lone parents.
<P>
The case for preserving one-parent benefit consists of a different set of arguments from the case that we discussed last week for preserving means-tested benefits for lone parents. Then we discussed poverty. Obviously, poverty is a relevant issue for parents in work. But given that we are focusing specifically on one-parent benefit, there is a case to be answered on costs. The Government have not answered it and independent advisers say that it needs to be answered before the Government move on. In opposition, current Ministers argued that abolishing one-parent benefit would be wholly contrary to any idea of welfare to work. There is a very strong case for retaining the benefit unless a much more coherent argument can be put for its abolition. I therefore repeat my party's consistent opposition to clause 68.

<P>

<B>Mr. Burns:</B> This is, in many ways, a return of the debate that we had in another Standing Committee last Wednesday which considered the other half of the equation. When we discussed the other side of the two-pronged policy, we got very few answers from the Minister to any of our questions. I wonder whether we will be any more successful today in seeking answers to the straightforward questions that we keep putting to the Minister.
<P>
As I said in last week's Committee on Wednesday, this is a debate that the Government desperately did not want to have. The reaction at the end of that Committee was deeply upsetting and unpleasant for Members of Parliament to witness. I hope that it does not occur again today.
<P>
In that context, it would be helpful if the Minister were prepared to answer a series of questions that we put to him last Wednesday that are equally applicable in this debate on the child benefit side of the equation designed to cut benefits to lone parents. Again, I put those questions to the Minister and I hope that this time we are more successful in getting answers.
<P>
As the Minister is aware, the debate concerns the policy that my right hon. Friend the Member for Hitchin and Harpenden (Mr. Lilley) and my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke) foreshadowed this time last year in the last Conservative Budget. We are a consistent Opposition so we have no problems with that policy. As my comments unfold, we will see that the Government have performed a U-turn of staggering proportions since the general election which we believe is a gross example of hypocrisy. I do not use that word lightly but my colleagues and I believe that before the general election, every special interest group in the country and the media were led to believe on a number of occasions--to which I will refer during my speech--that a Labour Government would not support the policy that my right hon. Friend the Member for Hitchin and Harpenden sought to introduce and that if they were elected, they would not implement it.
<P>
The background is that my right hon. Friend the Member for Hitchin and Harpenden set about removing positive discrimination in favour of lone parents in the benefits system. We believe that that system gave and will give--until these changes fully come into force in the next few months--more favourable treatment to lone parents than to married couples. As hon. Members are aware, lone parents are currently eligible for extra child benefit, and extra help through the lone parent premium that we discussed last week and through income support, jobseeker's allowance, housing benefit and council tax benefit to which two-parent families are not entitled. Today we are discussing the extra money that lone parents receive in child benefit which two-parent families do not receive. That, again discriminates against couples.
<P>
We have long been in favour of redressing that balance so that the benefits system puts an end to that discrimination. I personally doubt whether the Under-Secretary agrees in principle with the measure before us today or can say that it commands the full support of his parliamentary colleagues. The hon. Member for Northavon has already mentioned early-day motion 333 and public opposition to the measure has been voiced by the hon. Members for Maryhill, for Preston, for Brent, East (Mr. Livingstone) and for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington (Ms Abbott). I should be interested to hear the Minister's response to those points which I raised on Wednesday, and which I repeat in the context of this debate on child benefit.
<P>
It is also noticeable that the Secretary of State, for so long the self-appointed champion of single mothers, does not believe in the measure and cannot bring herself to argue for it, in principle or in practice. Rather than reel off a series of silly soundbites, she has sent her junior Ministers here to do her bidding. We do not hear her, when she is pinned down, responding directily to the question of why she has changed her mind on the issue in the six months since the general election. I suspect that the Chancellor of the Exchequer has been pressing her to make the change as a Treasury-run move to gain money from the social security budget as part of public spending and tax policies.
<P>
I remember that in 1990 the Secretary of State co-wrote with the hon. Member for Leicester, West (Ms Hewitt) a paper called ``The Family Way'' for that modernisers' think-tank, the Institute for Public Policy and Research. That document contains some very interesting quotes from the Secretary of State.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> On the question of the social security budget, will the hon. Gentleman accept that the amount of money at issue had already been removed from the budget before the general election?
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> On the question of the budget--which I will return to during my speech--the bottom line is that the new deal for lone parents is receiving about &#163;200 million from the Treasury. That money is from a variety of sources, including, I think, the windfall tax. The two measures relating to lone parents will save &#163;400 million, resulting in a saving to the Treasury of &#163;200 million.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman confirm that the &#163;400 million had been removed from the budget?
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> If the Minister is saying that if we had carried out the policy that we had said we would, and that there were savings of &#163;400 million, then the answer is yes. However, the money that the Treasury will be putting into the new deal for lone parents is &#163;200 million, and it will result in a net overall saving for the Treasury of &#163;200 million. If the Minister wishes to return to this matter in his remarks, I will wait until that point.
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> If I may help my hon. Friend to clarify his point, it is not correct that the tax on the privatised utilities will raise some &#163;3 billion over the course of this Parliament, and if the Minister is saying that choices have to be made, then money has been diverted from that particular source.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It is an interesting point, but it does not have anything to do with this debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burns:</B> To return to the ``The Family Way'', the Secretary of State wrote in that document that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``A more efficient means for raising the living standards of parents and children on welfare is a substantial increase in the lone parents' premium''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>That is exactly the opposite of what she proposes in this clause, and in the regulations that we discussed last week. It is interesting to note that the first thing that the Secretary of State proposed in office was to cut the very benefit that she previously believed should be increased to improve the quality of life for lone-parent families.
<P>
The Secretary of State's attachment to her views had not receded six years after the publication of ``The Family Way'', when she was confronted with plans to equalise the lone-parent and two-parent benefits. That simple and overdue change to the system was fiercely attacked by the right hon. Lady when it was proposed by her predecessor at the Department of Social Security, my right hon. Friend the Member for Hitchin and Harpenden. The right hon. Lady told the House:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Secretary of State says that he is cutting benefits to lone mothers because they are at an advantage compared with married couples. The truth is that they are at a disadvantage. Perhaps he does not realise that when people move from being a couple to being a lone mother, they become worse, not better, off.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>Those were the current Secretary of State's words almost 12 months ago. She also told the House that the measure that my right hon. Friend the Member for Hitchin and Harpenden was introducing would have a negative impact on the family. She stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Secretary of State said in his press statement that the cut in benefits to lone mothers is part of his approach of being fairer to families, but it is not fair to the families of women who bring up children on their own. They will be worse off. If that is what he thinks is a family policy, he does not understand how families work.''--[Official Report, 28 November 1996; Vol. 286, c. 501.]
<P>
</UL></FONT>Those were the words of the current Secretary of State. If it is her opinion that the measure is both anti-family and pro-poverty, why is she introducing it?
<P>
Perhaps the Minister will be able to enlighten the Committee on that point. Does the Secretary of State now think differently? Does she think that it is a pro-family and anti-poverty measure? Alternatively, does she, in her heart of hearts, hold the view that she took when she was in opposition and seeking votes for the Labour party from as many people as possible? I hope that the Minister will clarify that when he speaks later in the debate.
<P>
