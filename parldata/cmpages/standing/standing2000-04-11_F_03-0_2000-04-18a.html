<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I wish to announce that, to be selected for debates, amendments must be tabled two sitting days before they are to be debated. Because the House is not returning from the Easter break until a Tuesday rather than the more usual Monday, the arrangement whereby amendments tabled right up to 4.30 pm on the Friday of the recess can be selected for debate on the next Tuesday do not apply. Members should thus be alerted to the need to table amendments before 4.30 pm on the Thursday to be capable of being selected for Tuesday 2 May. It may help members of the Committee to bear that in mind to save there being any confusion over the issue.
<P>
It gives me great pleasure to be co-Chairman of the Committee. I am sure that it will be a delight for us over the coming weeks to get to know each other more, and to do justice to the Bill.
<H4><center>Schedule 1</center></H4>
<H4><center>Learning and Skills Council for England</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. James Clappison </B>(Hertsmere): I beg to move amendment No. 68 page 59, line 28, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(4) Wherever practicable, delegation should be in writing.
<P>
(5) No such delegation shall be held to derogate from the responsibilities of the council or its members.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I welcome you to the Committee, Mr. Hancock. It will be a great pleasure to serve under your chairmanship.
<P>
We come now to the delegation of authority from the Learning and Skills Council. Schedule 1 sets up the council's structure, its chief executive and the terms and conditions of those who serve on it. Paragraph 7 deals with the delegation of functions under which the Learning and Skills Council may authorise the chairman or the chief executive to exercise its functions.
<P>
The amendment reflects the fact that that delegation of authority may be important in all cases; indeed, it may be very important in some cases. We believe that it would be sensible to seek the greatest possible certainty about what is being delegated and to whom. The Committee will be aware that questions are often asked about whether authority has been granted properly or whether it has been acceded to by those to whom it has been granted. To avoid such questions arising for the Learning and Skills Council, it would desirable to have the greatest certainty possible. One way in which to achieve that would be to set out in writing the delegation of functions. We cannot see any reason why the council should not be prepared to put it in writing, when making the important decision of delegating authority.
<P>
The amendment recognises, however, that it may not always be practicable for the delegation of functions to be writing, but it would generally be desirable. It would remove many difficulties that may result from questions arising about the delegation of authority. It would be a sensible and practical step. It is often taken in similar circumstances, and it is often a requirement when authority is being delegated. It makes common sense for the delegation of authority to be in writing whenever possible.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment (Mr. Malcolm Wicks):</B> Good morning, Mr. Hancock, and welcome to the Chair. We look forward to working with you in the coming weeks. I should explain that the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment, my hon. Friend the Member for North Swindon (Mr. Wills), who would have dealt with some of the amendments, is unwell. He will join us as soon as possible, perhaps later in the week.
<P>
Amendment No. 68 would require the council, chair and chief executive to record in writing, whenever practicable, any delegations made under the provision. It also suggests that delegation should not alter the council's accountability for its responsibilities. I welcome the amendment's intention of promoting good practice. The hon. Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison) described it as common sense, of which we are always in favour. I hope that that attitude spreads among other Opposition parties.
<P>
The amendment perhaps seeks reassurance that the council, chair and chief executive will take full responsibility for their functions and will not, for example, casually delegate duties to staff who may not have the appropriate tools or experience to carry them out effectively. It also seeks assurance that the council will not abdicate its responsibilities through inappropriate use of delegation.
<P>
I am happy to reassure the hon. Gentleman that we would expect delegation of functions by the LSC to be properly recorded in writing whenever practicable. That is good management practice. However, the amendment is unnecessary. The LSC's management statement and financial memorandum, which will be agreed with the Department for Education and Employment as part of the normal relations between a Department and a non-departmental public body, will set out agreed arrangements for the LSC's internal management and control, among other things. It will include the financial regime in which the LSC will operate, which will involve financial authority and delegation.
<P>
One of the council's early priorities will be to determine, within the framework that it has agreed with the Department, the level of management delegation that will apply within the LSC, and in what circumstances it will apply. It is only right that decisions taken should be recorded in appropriate documentation. I can therefore assure the hon. Member for Hertsmere that we will convey to the LSC our expectation that the details should be documented, and that the management statement should reflect that. As I hope he would agree, legislation is not the best medium for enshrining good business and management practice.
<P>
The amendment also seeks to underline the fact that delegation cannot be a way for the council to abdicate its responsibilities. I assure hon. Members that the current provision relates only to the exercising of functions, not to the accountability or responsibility for them. The council is and will remain accountable for all its responsibilities set out in the Bill, whether it exercises them directly or delegates them.
<P>
We do not feel that anything will be gained by including the amendment in the Bill. Given the assurances that I have provided, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will feel able to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I have listened carefully to the response made by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment, the hon. Member for Croydon, North (Mr. Wicks). The debate has been short but worth while, and has served to promote good practice. I am pleased that the Minister has given us those assurances, which take matters a step forward. I am tempted to say that this is a victory for common sense, and also tempted to say that this the first of many, but I shall not go too far down that road this morning. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdraw.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Boswell </B>(Daventry): I beg to move amendment No. 9, in page 60, line 14, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(9) Notwithstanding the declaration of specific interests in connection with the proceedings of the Council as required by this paragraph, members of the Council shall within three months of their appointment furnish such details of their interests as the Council may specify.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I also welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Hancock, for what I think will be an absorbing Committee. I hope that there will be a good deal of common sense on both sides of the Committee in how we act to tie down the sector, especially the new council, so that it can do its job as effectively as possible. I express our condolences to the Minister for the indisposition of the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment, the hon. Member for North Swindon, which I hope shall soon be repaired. I am sure that the Minister will step admirably into the breach on the clauses for which his hon. Friend was briefed.
<P>
The amendment, which follows that moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere, is another relatively gentle introduction to the morning. It seeks to enshrine good practice and ensure that the council conducts itself to the highest modern standards. In the eight years since the enactment of the Further and Higher Education Act 1992, developments have centred around the initiative of my right hon. Friend the Member for Huntingdon (Mr. Major), who got Nolan to examine our procedures. A series of recommendations flowed from that investigation across wide areas of public administration. It is important to ensure not only that members of public bodies—and, latterly, of the House—declare their interests, as they have long had to do, but that anything that could be seen as relevant to membership or activity on behalf of a non-departmental public body should be declared for all to see.
<P>
There is a good deal in the schedule on the declaration of a specific interest and, if necessary, withdrawal from consideration if there is a direct and immediate interest. There is nothing about having to declare the wider range of business interests that might be seen to bear on a person's membership of the council. In accordance with Nolan principles, all such bodies, including the Further Education Funding Council, have for several years had provision for a register to declare interests at large, and without prejudice to the issue under discussion. If the council discusses an issue in which someone has a direct interest, that individual is obliged to declare it and, if necessary, seek dispensation from the Secretary of State who would consider the matter.
<P>
All we seek in this probing amendment is to get the Minister's assurance that a general register of interests should be available. It does not derogate from the intention of the schedule that specific interests should be declarable as and when appropriate, but reinforces what the Minister called good practice. I look forward to his response.

<P>

<B>Mr. Peter Brooke </B>(Cities of London and Westminster): I rise partly to welcome you, Mr. Hancock, before we are too advanced into the sitting to do so. One of the pleasures of your chairing our proceedings is that it is reassuring for someone as old as me to share the Committee room with an hon. Member who first entered the House in 1983 and who therefore has a similar longevity.
<P>
I shall be brief. I reinforce the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell). In a world in which we are, sadly, required to be more and more correct, and when members of Select Committees are required to declare any interests relevant to the area of its work to the Clerk, we should err on the side of safety and caution in setting out matters so that nobody can thereafter say, ``Oh, I didn't know that I had to reveal that.'' Interests are important, as the events of the past decade have shown, and if we are to legislate on them, we should do so properly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> As the hon. Member for Daventry said, this is a probing amendment. I welcome his introduction to it, and the contribution from the right hon. Gentleman for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Brooke). The Government made it clear, when the issues were considered in another place, that members of the LSC should register their interests and disclose them when the council discusses relevant matters. That is why paragraph 8 of the schedule sets down a statutory duty on members' interests. We agree wholeheartedly with the intention behind this probing amendment. However, the Government's intentions, which apply to all non-departmental public bodies, are that the national council's requirements in respect of disclosure of interests should be reflected in the code of conduct for LSC members. The code will be drawn up having regard to the guidance in the code of best practice for board members of public bodies—produced by HM Treasury—and to the guidance on appointments to public bodies produced by the Office of the Commissioner for Public Bodies.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Can the Minister clarify that similar arrangements will apply to local learning and skills councils? There may be greater scope for local debate about the proprieties or otherwise in that context.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> I can confirm that. For this and other purposes, the learning and skills councils should be regarded as one public body.
<P>
We expect the LSC code of conduct to be in place when the members are appointed. It will form part of the terms and conditions of appointment to the council. We share the hon. Gentleman's concern, but it is more appropriate to deal with it through the code of conduct. Detailed issues such as rules, disclosures and special cases are better dealt with through a code of conduct than through the heavy hand of primary legislation. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will, on reflection, withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am grateful to the Minister, who has given us almost all the assurances that we seek. It is interesting to note that he, in effect, identified the local learning and skills councils as branch offices of the national Learning and Skills Council because they are all covered by one code. However, I shall not stir that particular pot at this stage of debate. I may have misinterpreted his remarks, and that may not have been the Minister's intention.
<P>
My right hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster eloquently drew attention to the process of openness and transparency. There remains concern about providing the best possible understanding of the codes that bite. I understand that the Treasury already issues guidance for that purpose. The Minister referred to the availability of a model at the time of appointment. It will doubtless be sent to members of the Committee for greater clarity. It would be helpful if as much new information about the specific code could be circulated or made public in an appropriate form.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks indicated assent.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I notice that the Minister is nodding—at least regarding the principle, if not the detail. He might wish to lodge a copy in the Library. We have a common purpose in Committee to be as straight and open as possible and to ensure that everything is above board. The Minister's response was consonant with that, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 69, in page 60, line 16, after `and', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`may, with the consent of the Council,'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment relates to paragraph 9, which deals with the way in which the Learning and Skills Council conducts its business, particularly with regard to the Secretary of State's representative. Subparagraph (1) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A representative of the Secretary of State is entitled to attend and take part in any deliberations (but not in decisions) at meetings of the Council.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This important amendment would require the Secretary of State's representative to obtain the council's consent before taking part in its deliberations. It provides for an element of good manners, but the issue goes wider in addressing the character of the Learning and Skills Council itself. The amendment would make it clear that the Secretary of State's representative must receive the consent of the members before he takes part in the council's deliberations. The requirement to obtain such consent would suggest the council's integrity and its ability to regulate it own affairs.
<P>
One might imagine that it would be rare indeed for the council to withhold such consent. However, it should be obtained in the first place to reflect, as I said, the council's ability to regulate its own proceedings. That will send out an important signal about the council's character. We have already debated the centralised nature of the structure and the position occupied by the Secretary of State at the top of that structure. We have debated how power is devolved in a centralist manner, and some of us have pointed out that both the Learning and Skills Council and local learning and skills councils are going to be run on a highly centralised basis.
<P>
The Minister should think long and hard about that issue. He should view the amendment as providing a means of rebutting the suggestion that the entire structure is under the thumb of the Secretary of State.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> My hon. Friend used the words ``in the first place'' a few moments ago. Under the amendment, does he envisage the Secretary of State's representative receiving a blanket authority to have the right to speak as and when he wishes, perhaps by some such phrase as ``by leave of the council''? Or does he envisage the representative needing approval, if not on every occasion, at least at every meeting at which he speaks?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> My right hon. Friend makes an extremely good point. It would be most appropriate for permission to be sought case by case, but I emphasise that we do not envisage the Learning and Skills Council wanting to withhold consent very often. It remains an important right to be able to withhold it, should the council wish to do so. Before the Secretary of State's representative plunges into discussion of a particular subject, he should first seek the permission of the council.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hilary Benn </B>(Leeds, Central): I am listening carefully to the hon. Gentleman's argument and trying to imagine the circumstances in which the amendment would be necessary. It would help the Committee if he could explain the precise circumstances in which he expects the council to refuse consent to the Secretary of State's representative.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I made it plain that in most cases the council would freely give its consent. There might be circumstances, however, in which the council wishes to withhold it. They might be rare, but such circumstances could nevertheless occur.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> May I conduct a three-way dialogue? My hon. Friend is a lawyer and I am not. However, under clause 2, the council is under a duty to provide proper education for young persons and is unconstrained by the obligation to take a view on available resources—as provided under clause 3. Under those circumstances, the council might feel that it had not received enough money from the Government and was unable to do a proper job. It might then wish to make a clear and unfettered statement about its inability to discharge its functions. Is that the sort of example that my hon. Friend envisages?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> My hon. Friend makes a good point. There is also the question of the ability of the council to withhold its consent. What does it say about the council when it does not even have the ability to regulate its own affairs by deciding whether the Secretary of State's representative can take part? As I said, that sends an important signal about the council's character. Will the Minister provide a constructive and common-sense response?
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> A common-sense response is forthcoming. As we heard, the amendment could restrict the ability of the Secretary of State's observers to speak at meetings of the Learning and Skills Council, and require them to ask for permission before they can contribute. It is therefore very much a Corporal Jones amendment, because the Secretary of State's representative would follow that much-loved character in ``Dad's Army'' in having to say, ``Permission to speak, sir'' before he could even wish the chairman of the council a good Christmas.
<P>
The amendment may have started off late one evening, as a good idea; in practical terms it would be foolish to adopt it, however. It is normal practice for a sponsoring Department to nominate an official to attend meetings of a non-departmental public body's governing body as an observer, and to contribute to discussions. That observer would not, however, participate in decision making—that is the distinction. The role is an important one that, in our experience, has worked well with many other non-departmental public bodies and has been the source of invaluable interaction. The previous Government adopted the same formulation for the Further Education Funding Council in the Further and Higher Education Act 1992. That council and, we believe, that practice have worked well, and we see no reason to change.
<P>
I was struck by the fact that the hon. Member for Hertsmere did not draw on any practices of the Further Education Funding Council or any similar body to demonstrate why his amendment was crucial, and why the measure introduced by the previous Conservative Government was wrong. His silence was indicative. The arrangement has helped to cement the relationship between council members and the Department, has provided a forum for the early exchange of ideas and plans and has proved helpful to both sides in ensuring a fuller understanding of priorities. That will be significant in the case of the Learning and Skills Council, given the broad canvas that it has for post-16 learning.
<P>
It is right and proper and essential that the Secretary of State's representative should attend meetings to observe, to inform and to contribute to discussions. The Learning and Skills Council is not some loosely knit advisory body in which the Department has some vague interest, but a body responsible for a crucial area of policy and for £6 billion of public money. It is essential for the smooth running of the body, therefore, for there to be a close working relationship between itself, the Secretary of State and the Department. Allowing the Secretary of State's representative to participate in discussions but not in decisions strikes the right balance. Not allowing that representative to speak without prior leave would be unwieldy, and would take us far from the type of relationship that we want, which is one of open dialogue but with the council clearly accountable for its own decisions. I hope that the hon. Gentleman feels able to withdraw his amendment after that explanation.

<P>

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I must confess that I am not as happy with the Minister's response as I was with the one that he gave to amendment No. 68. He is making heavy weather of the matter, and rushing to the barricades. The BBC gives us plenty of opportunities to refresh our recollection of ``Dad's Army'', although I am not one of those who regularly take advantage of that. I seem to recollect that every time Corporal Jones asked for permission to speak he was given it, although whether he made good sense or not is another matter. The eventual representative of the Secretary of State on the council might not welcome the comparison between himself and Corporal Jones.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell rose—</B><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We are not going down the ``Dad's Army'' road, are we?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> No, Mr. Hancock, we are not going to discuss the entire programme. However, I hope that my hon. Friend also remembers that Corporal Jones was fond of saying, ``They don't like it up 'em.'' That may have some application to the Minister.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I do not think that I can follow that. The Minister's response rested too much on the presumption that the council would withhold permission from the representative to speak, whereas my amendment is proposed on the basis that, in nearly every case, the council would wish him to do so. If the representative had to seek such leave to speak, it would not only be good manners but reflect the integrity of the council and its ability to regulate its own proceedings.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> The Further Education Funding Council.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I was about to deal with that. It is not the Minister's best point. The FEFC is a different body with different and additional responsibilities, and is part of a different structure, the centralised nature of which has been the subject of many comments from outside bodies.
<P>
The amendment provides the Minister with an opportunity to give the council the integrity and ability to regulate its own proceedings and rebut the assumption that has been made in many quarters. The Minister has decided, for reasons that he knows best, not to avail himself of that opportunity, and to leave the representative with an unfettered ability to speak, even though he is not a member of the council. In many comparable situations, a properly constituted body corporate of integrity would be able to regulate its own proceedings to the extent of preventing non-members from speaking should it wish to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I rise in respect of an earlier intervention by the hon. Member for Leeds, Central (Mr. Benn), who asked my hon. Friend for an example. When I was chairman of the National Advisory Body for Public Sector Higher Education, there was one occasion when there was a major conflict between an official and local authority members of the body. It was a very nasty episode. I shut the official up and said that it would be better to have a period of peace and quiet, because it was clear that we were moving rapidly towards disaster. I am not sure whether I had the authority to shut the official up, but he did shut up, and we got through a difficult moment. Such cases arise, and there is virtue in having reserve powers if necessary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> My right hon. Friend, who speaks with the benefit of experience, underlines the prudence of giving the body the ability to regulate its own proceedings, as a precautionary measure. From time to time, exceptional circumstances will arise.
<P>
I am disappointed with the Minister's response.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> Although I shall ask the hon. Gentleman to consider withdrawing the amendment, I do not want to be unhelpful. Clearly, when the Secretary of State's observer is appointed to the council, advice and guidance—not necessarily written—will be issued to the observer. It would be appropriate if the Hansard report of this discussion were appended to a letter or note.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> That improves matters somewhat. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 70, in page 60, line 42, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`having regard wherever possible to the general practice of the educational institutions for which it is responsible in relation to accounting years.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment is designed not to alter the course of history but to enable the Committee to have a short discussion on good accounting practices. The background to the amendment is that, as a direct consequence of the unifying of the funding streams—of which Ministers say that they are proud—the further education sector will no longer be simple and straightforward. Instead, a great complexity of provision, of various kinds, will be carried out by different bodies.
<P>
It is clearly important, as far as possible, to have everyone singing from the same hymn sheet and accounting in the same basic way, and, ideally, at the same time. That may be a practical impossibility, and the different institutions involved may not be able to account at the same time. The Learning and Skills Council is likely to use Government financial years, as it is required under the schedule to remit its accounts by the end of August.
<P>
It would be useful if the Minister could, in response to the anxieties to which the amendment relates, explain how the accounting system will work. How, for example, will the Learning and Skills Council make payments on account? How will the accounts of the various institutions supported by the council or its local councils reflect payments in progress or work in progress if accounting years differ?
<P>
We are unlikely to achieve absolute consistency and uniformity in the sector. Although it would probably be desirable, it may be possible only at the expense of other practical considerations. It would be useful if the Minister could tell us what is in his mind on the matter and reassure us that the systems involved will be as clear as possible so that both the council and the taxpayer, who will fund the council and the various constituent institutions, will know where they stand and how the money is being spent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Phil Willis </B>(Harrogate and Knaresborough): I welcome you to your place, Mr. Hancock. It is well deserved.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Somewhat belatedly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> A little belatedly, I accept. I did not want to get involved in the references to ``Dad's Army'', and I am glad that we have moved off that subject. I am sure that the observer will be delighted to know what great matters of state we discuss in this Committee, especially when millions of people are dying elsewhere and the Conservative party is suggesting introducing detention centres for some of the poorest people.
<P>
Moving swiftly on, I rise on a matter of clarification. One of the problems that has bedevilled the further education sector is the plethora of different auditing systems that it has had to employ in order to take money from various organisations, including not only the FEFC but local authorities, training and enterprise councils and, in particular and increasingly, European economic and social funds. Will money from European funds or funds that are not based in the UK go to the Learning and Skills Council or directly to institutions?
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I am glad that I got my welcome to you in early, Mr. Hancock, given your rebuke to the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough (Mr. Willis).
<P>
I served longer on the Budget Council of the European Union as a British Minister than anyone since 1972, and one of the massive inconveniences of the Union—I do not suggest that anyone can do anything about it—is that the EU uses calendar years, whereas member states, including our own, use different dates. It was constantly necessary to compare apples with pears.
<P>
Secondly, I am profoundly relieved that over the 23 years that I have been in the House local authority and health authority boundaries have gradually been equated, which has greatly simplified our affairs.
<P>
Thirdly, Parliamentary Secretaries are rarely able to alter the course of events: their contribution is general rather than particular. However, when I served in it, the Department providing reinforcement to the Minister in this Committee put to me a proposition to fund, at a cost that ran into seven figures, the preparatory work for polytechnics, as they then were, to have a recruitment system similar to that of the Universities Central Council on Admissions. I remember the proposal reaching me at about two o'clock in the morning, in the way that red boxes do, and writing on it, ``Yes, I am perfectly happy to authorise this, provided that the computer system used is compatible with UCCA, in case someone other than me, at a later date, has the idea of putting the two systems together.''
<P>
I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry on bringing forward the amendment. We have an opportunity when, in Dean Acheson's phrase, we are in at the beginning, to make as good a fist of the systems as we can. I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> We have had enough of Corporal Jones. I promise that there will no other references to BBC comedies, of whatever vintage, given that we will be serving under your chairmanship for more than half an hour, Mr. Hancock. Moving on rather rapidly, and obviously, to amendment No. 70, I should say that paragraph 14 of schedule 1 relates to the accounts of the LSC. It has nothing to do with the accounts of the educational institutions. That said, I appreciate the concern expressed by right hon. and hon. Members. I am happy to reassure them that the creation of the LSC will not require education and training providers to alter whatever period constitutes the basis of an accounting year in their accounts.
<P>
The further education sector can continue to run its accounting year from August to July. The FEFC will continue to plan and fund FE colleges on an academic-year basis. There need be no change to the accounting years for school sixth forms when the LSC starts to fund local education authorities for their sixth form provision. In any event, schools and LEAs already operate on the same April to March financial cycle as proposed for the LSC. As we move to a single funding body the Government are keen to make a smooth transition in which the continuity of provision for learners is maintained. That means the minimum disruption for existing providers that are funded by the LSC.
<P>
We do not intend that the establishment of the LSC will lead to a bureaucratic burden on schools or unnecessary interference in the management of independent providers and colleges. I hear the remarks of the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough. It would be for institutions to decide, if they so wished, to rationalise or change their accounting years. We suggest no such requirement. We are anxious to have continuity and no disruption.

<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am grateful to the Minister. He is trying to respond to the debate constructively. He referred to schools and the fact that their accounting years were obviously the same as local education authorities and therefore different from further education and the FEFC. However, under the new arrangements, when they are funded by the LSC, the funds will come through the LEA. In other words, the accountancy interface between the school and the funding body will be through the LEA, not by direct funding. Can the Minister clarify that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> I can clarify it by confirming that that will be the case. Once I have studied the remarks of the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough about European funding, I may write to him with further details, but the LSC will not of itself change the European social fund accounting year. We are about to consult on proposals to bring the ESF and mainstream funding together. I will study his remarks to see whether any further information can be provided. I hope, given those assurances, that the hon. Member for Daventry will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am grateful to the Minister. Essentially, he said that he will bend over backwards not to cause disruption to existing systems. That is important. The converse is that it is relatively difficult to amend additional systems or, as my right hon. Friend says, to get in at the beginning and try to tidy it up. The Minister has adopted a conservative approach. On balance, that is the right one, but I hope that he will actively look for opportunities to tidy this up wherever possible and encourage various institutions to do so too. I hope that he will also look out for any anomalies that will arise in respect of European funding or of work in progress and how that can be expressed in accounts. The Learning and Skills Council will want to give clear advice to the institutions that it funds.
<P>
In the spirit of the debate, which has been useful in clarifying the issues, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That this schedule be the First schedule to the Bill.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> It is the proper job of the Opposition to probe the council's operations and to seek assurances about them, and the amendments have enabled us to do that. We have received some useful assurances from the Minister; I shall not waste the Committee's time by going on about it and my remarks will be brief.
<P>
We are more leery of the Minister's response to the operating rules and the understanding between the Secretary of State and the council. We are anxious that the council will function as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Department, which cannot take its own decisions or show the nominated departmental officer the door in the case of a disagreement—which, as my right hon. Friend said, could happen. However, the temper of the debate has suggested that the Minister is alive to the tensions that may arise. The more that he can do to establish the identity and the independent validity of the council, its responsibility and its decision-making powers, and the more that he seeks to appoint people of independent worth who can bring their own skills to the council, the better and happier we shall be. That also applies to the issue of people with a political affiliation, although that was not the main substance of the debate. We need not return to such matters; the debate has been a useful exploratory exercise.
<P>
Although there is no amendment on the subject, I want briefly to mention the question of Crown status in sub-paragraph 15 of the schedule, which is broadly equivalent to the proposal in the Further and Higher Education Act 1992.
<P>
We tabled an amendment, which was not selected, about compulsory purchase, because we did not want the council, especially in complicated issues such as a dispute about the ownership of property with a training and enterprise council to be able to use the cudgel of a public authority's powers to buy out the other party. It would be helpful if the Minister could say a word about how Crown status operates and whether it has ever given rise to problems.
<P>
Subject to those remarks and to the Minister's response, I do not intend to divide the Committee on the schedule.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> We have had a short but useful debate on schedule 1. I ask the Minister to clarify a matter that was raised many times in the other place and on Second Reading and which will be raised in the Committee—the £50 million of savings that the Secretary of State said would accrue from the changes to the legislation. What will happen under TUPE—the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) regulations—to the existing employees of the training and enterprise councils and of the FEFC and especially to their chief executives and senior management?
<P>
The Minister made it clear, in clause 1 and in his response now to the point made by the hon. Member for Daventry about the independent worth of people joining the Learning and Skills Council and the local councils, that he is looking for new blood and that many people will be let go. I understand that TUPE covers everybody involved with an existing TEC or with the FEFC in a transfer of undertaking to the new organisations. Is the Minister saying that the bodies are not existing organisations and that there is no transfer of undertaking? I understood that a transfer of undertaking was exactly what would take place. If that is so, who will pay the redundancy costs? Will they be attributed to the outgoing body, and therefore not be a charge on the Learning and Skills Council? Have those costs been estimated? Fifty million pounds is a small sum—less than 1 per cent. of the £6 billion budget for the new organisations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am sympathetic to the hon. Gentleman's point. Does he recall that when I asked Ministers about the TUPE status about two months ago, their answers could charitably be described only as opaque? It is entirely proper that Ministers give a clear undertaking to the Committee and, of course, to employees.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman's comments, and I have read those answers. People are genuinely concerned, and it does not matter whether we feel that they have done a brilliant, good or poor job. We have a Labour Government, so we must receive an assurance that we will not turf all those people on to the scrap heap.
<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Allan </B>(Sheffield, Hallam): Is my hon. Friend concerned about the possible division of functions? Some individuals may be transferred to other organisations such as the Small Business Service, rather than the LSCs, and there is concern in the training and enterprise councils about how that will happen. It could be complex for staff to divide functions and do a bit of both, and that applies particularly to people such as chief executives.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for raising that issue, because it relates to the assurance that I am trying to obtain. The Bill does not allow us to explore that, so we must take the present opportunity. I appreciate that the Under-Secretary, the hon. Member for North Swindon is fully prepared for my questions, and I am sure that he anticipates them with great excitement. I would be satisfied with a written response. From where will the saving of £50 million come? How will the redundancy costs be paid? What is the estimate of those costs? How will the Government handle such a big personnel issue for people in TECs and the FEFC?
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> A flourish of new and important issues has been raised, and I will do my best to deal with them towards the end of my remarks. The hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough implied that there was no opportunity to explore the TUPE issues, but I am advised that clause 84 might offer such an opportunity.
<P>
The schedule relates to national council provisions for appointing members, employing staff—including the chief executive—and delegating functions. We have sought to reassure hon. Members that the chief executive will always be a council member, without adjustment of the number of places on the council. We have also reiterated our pledge that all appointments will be made on merit, having regard to the Nolan principles.
<P>
We made it clear today that the Secretary of State will not be required to approve the terms and conditions for each staff member. However, he will want to satisfy himself that the terms and conditions applied across the LSC are appropriate to public sector employment and reflect the Government's wider policies. That is a long-standing provision that successive Governments have applied to non-departmental public bodies. NDPBs are an important part of the machinery of government and it must be right that, while they should have the flexibility to determine the staff terms and conditions to meet their needs, such terms and conditions should be subject to the Government's approval. After all, we are dealing with public money.
<P>
We, too, share the concerns that the Learning and Skills Council, as a newly established non-departmental public body, should have regard to best practice. That is why we attach considerable importance to a code of conduct for members of the council. The council will draw on the code of best practice for board members of public bodies and on the guidance on appointments to public bodies published by the Office for the Commissioner for Public Appointments.
<P>
Crown status reflects the fact that employees will not be civil servants with the usual terms and conditions, as under the Further Education Funding Council. Such status works well. I assure the hon. Member for Daventry that there will be no power of compulsory purchase in relation to private bodies.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> If the Minister looks at part V of the Bill, he will see that clauses 84, 85 and 86 deal with the dissolution of the FEFC in England and Wales, not the dissolution of TECs, which is also a major issue.

<P>

<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> Clause 87 is helpful in that respect. I apologise for my arithmetical error if I have misinformed the Committee.
<P>
We intend to take a positive approach to the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 1981, consistent with the Cabinet Office guidance on staff transfers in the public sector. We shall expect the LSC to follow that guidance. However, it is important that we make it clear that, given the complexity of the structure of TECs to which reference was made earlier, a simple national formula will not be appropriate. As the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Allan) said, given their current functions, some staff of TECs may wish to transfer to the Small Business Service while others may want to transfer to the Employment Service. There is diversity among TECs throughout the country, which is what makes the matter so complex. Decisions can be taken only on a TEC-by-TEC basis. We set out our approach in some detail in the statement that we sent to all TECs on 31 March. I shall be happy to make copies of the statement available to members of the Committee, if they would like to see it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Yes, please.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> I promise to send copies of the statement to all members of the Committee. If we have the opportunity to return to such matters under clause 87, we can consider them in greater detail then.
<P>
We estimate that savings on costs will be £50 million a year. They will come partly from the Department's own expenditure and partly because there will be fewer learning and skills councils than TECs and we expect that there will be significant savings on bureaucracy in that respect.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I had not spotted clause 84 as a clause to which we might return at a later date. I thought that you would rule me out of order, Mr. Hancock, if I made paving remarks about the clause, but it has now entered our agenda. I cannot recall whether the Minister circulated to other members of the Committee the helpful letter regarding the outstanding points from the Second Reading debate that I found on my desk after the first sitting of our Committee. The letter made reference, with other matters, to the figure of £50 million. I am grateful that the document on TECs will be circulated to the rest of the Committee. Although there will be am opportunity to debate TECs under clause 87, some doubt still surrounds the issue, and if it can be clarified before we reach that clause, so much the better.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> It would be helpful if the statement were circulated to all members of the Committee with, if the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster does not mind, the letter that he received.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> This group of amendments takes us from the particular to the general. The amendments raise many important issues that go to the heart of the Government's intentions on the operation of the Bill. I shall deal briefly with the four amendments in my name and leave the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough to speak on the Liberal Democrats' two amendments, with which I have considerable sympathy.
<P>
Amendment No. 71 would delete ``proper'' and, with amendment No. 72, remove the measure for different provision for people over 19. In other words, it would give all adult late learners the same status. Amendment No. 73 is consequential on amendment No. 71 and tidies it up. Amendment No. 74 introduces a more substantive point on the quality of education to be provided. Before speaking on those amendments, it would be remiss not to welcome the arrival of my hon. Friend the Member for Altrincham and Sale, West (Mr. Brady), whose family has suffered shot and shell, through a childhood complaint that is now cleared up. I am sure that his absence has enabled him to study the Bill in even greater detail and to make a more measured contribution.
<P>
Somewhere in the bounds of public administration, in the Department for Education and Employment or elsewhere, there is a noun factory—I meant an adjective factory, because the Government prefer adjectives; such slips happen occasionally—where people find terms of art that can be attached to words such as ``education'', which are then enshrined in statute, last for a number of years and are eventually changed by subsequent legislation under one Government or another. Although I did not participate in the Committee that considered the Further and Higher Education Act 1992, a predecessor of the Minister's—and of mine in my former ministerial capacity—was driven to bringing a dictionary into the Committee to explain what he meant by ``suitable'' and ``adequate'' in regard to the provision of education for young persons aged 16 to 19 and adults respectively. I suspect that the Minister has, with his advisers, gone through a similar process in defining ``proper'' and ``reasonable''. The fact that ``reasonable'' is used for the second grade of education provided by the LSC for adults over 19, and that it is heard constantly, even by my non-lawyer ears, in the legal process of discussion about public facilities, and the fact that the growth of administrative law makes that provision suable over, suggest that the Government are running out of adjectives and that there will not be too many more left. The word ``reasonable'' is rather old hat, in lay terms, and ``proper'' creates difficulties in comparison with the lapidary words ``suitable'' and ``adequate'', because the opposite of proper is improper, and I am not sure what am improper provision of education would be.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I do not know whether I can assist my hon. Friend or the Committee, but he might like to cast his eyes over subsection (2), which says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Facilities are proper if they are—
<P>
(a) of a quantity sufficient to meet the reasonable needs of individuals and
<P>
(b) of a quality adequate to meet those needs.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The words ``reasonable'' and ``adequate'' have been thrown in as well.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> It is probably germane at this point to remind the Minister, if I have not already done so, of the admirable publication ``The Judge Over Your Shoulder'', written by the former senior legal adviser to his Department. That document—which rarely left my desk—binds Ministers to put it more constructively, advises them on how they must conduct themselves to avoid the perils of judicial review by acting reasonably at all times. I suppose that when Ministers do not want to answer questions, they reply by saying that they have to be reasonable all the time.
<P>
In a moment, I shall discuss the clause in relation to the real world, but I am reflecting on the fact that the words that we have been discussing are terms of art. Before we go any further, I will give the Minister one real-world consolation: I do not recall from my time as a Minister ever having to be briefed on the difference between the words ``suitability'' and ``adequacy.'' I also do not remember ever waking up in the middle of the night in a cold sweat wondering what the difference was. The issue did not normally arise. I cannot remember it ever being a central issue of the political discussion in all the time that the Further and Higher Education Act 1992 has been current, except perhaps in relation to some regional concerns expressed recently about the provision of further education in the east midlands. We had a recent exchange about that by way of parliamentary question and answer. I have no legal view about whether that was satisfactory, but it reminds Ministers that there is an underpinning series of concepts.
<P>
I will make some legal points about the amendments and ask the Minister to expand on the education issues. Clauses 2 and 3 create the legal duties on the Learning and Skills Council in respect of what I will call in shorthand young learners and adult learners respectively. The mysterious legal terms of art and adjectives under discussion are attached to them.
<P>
There is an interesting text of the discussion in another place on the matter. It was clear, as the National Institute of Adult Continuing Education pointed out in their notes on the Lords Committee stage, that Ministers were reading carefully from a brief, bearing in mind the doctrine of Pepper v. Hart. The words were carefully chosen, and the Minister responded carefully in debate, establishing the difference.
<P>
The amendments apply mainly to clause 2, although if accepted, clause 3 would coalesce with clause 2. With the clauses, we are creating or continuing two tiers. There is a stronger duty on the council to provide, and an absolute entitlement for young people to receive, further education after the compulsory years. There is a weaker duty in relation to adults. That is driven by the specific reference in clause 3 to the council's deciding whether facilities are reasonable by taking account of its own resources. If the council does not have enough money to fund adult education, it need not do so, or it need not worry about that as much as it would worry about young people's years of entitlement. That could create real difficulties.
<P>
By way of tuning the Minister up for the debate, I mentioned in earlier exchanges a situation in which the council might feel that it did not have enough money to deliver the education that it hoped. It would then have to prioritise, and put more money towards young people and less towards adults. Young people have an entitlement—there is a duty to provide for them—but the council might still feel that it did not have enough money. If that happened, it would in effect be in dispute with the Secretary of State. There would be a clash between its duty to fulfil the provision of proper education for young people and its lack of resources to do so. We have such discussions in the public sector from time to time, as the Minister would be idle to forget.
<P>
Even assuming that the nuclear option was not to happen, there would still be concern about adult education. If I have explained the logic of the two parallel provisions correctly, the adult provision must be a concertina arrangement whereby resources could be squeezed if they were insufficient, and would be squeezed differentially in relation to provisions for adult education because there would be a stronger duty to provide education for young people. The Minister must explain how that might operate in practice.
<P>
I have said a little about the legal duty. I am conscious that, in another place, Lord Bach sought to explain the distinction and said that it was intentional. He pointed out:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>There is an entitlement at the ages of 16 to 19, but no government could enter an absolute guarantee to adults in the same way.—[Official Report, House of Lords, 8 February 2000; Vol. 609, c. 602.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He went on to say that no Government should pretend that resources were unlimited. I do not think that anyone is asking the Minister to do that. It would be tedious to repeat Lord Bach's remarks, but he said that there was an objective test imparted by the word ``proper'' in clause 2
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>of a quantity sufficient to meet the reasonable needs of individuals, and . . . of a quality adequate to meet those needs,<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
as my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere has already helpfully pointed out.
<P>
The Government understand that there is a legal distinction, and it would be helpful if the Minister would say more about whether my understanding of it as a lay person is broadly correct. Then, I hope that we can have something of a real-world debate about the allocation of resources. I understand and sympathise if the Minister is saying, and I think that he must be, that young people's compulsory years come first and adults come second. However, I have two major concerns One is enshrined in amendment No. 74, in which we seek to impose the power to bring in
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>sufficient resources of high quality . . . to meet the needs of individuals.
<P>
</UL></FONT>The Minister and the Government aspire to high standards. As I said earlier, they love adjectives and delight in referring to ``the best possible'' provisions in ``the best of all possible worlds''—``Candide'' has nothing on them. However, when it comes to framing a legal duty, it seems that ``adequate'' and ``reasonable'' are more appropriate. Subsection (2)(a) refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a quantity sufficient to meet the reasonable needs of individuals<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and subsection (2)(b) to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a quality adequate to meet those needs.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is a pretty feeble test, and we wish to stiffen it by demanding ``high quality'', with the inference that Ministers should think hard before settling for second best. For young people, will the quality be good enough and will the quantity be adequate and convenient?
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
There is a sub-set of issues relating to the provision of education for persons with special educational needs. We shall return to that subject later and I do not intend to elaborate now, but it would be inappropriate not to mention it. The Government have begun to make some helpful assurances in another place, but the Committee should understand that people with special educational needs must have a proper transition from compulsory schooling into further education and subsequent provision.
<P>
As the hon. Member for Hallam pointed out earlier, it is worrying if support is to be granted only for activities that result in a qualification. Some young people with severe learning difficulties may not benefit at all and could be left unprovided for. Many vulnerable young adults who need a great deal of support should receive it at least to the age of 25. Liberal Democrat Members will wish to speak to that issue. I signal only my acceptance in principle of those concerns.
<P>
The provision of education to 25 is a wider issue. Many young people, especially the socially excluded, about whom the Minister expressed concern, may suffer from a cut-off at the age of 19 and may not benefit from the stronger duty. That is a real world issue because it can affect funding and whether fees for courses have to be paid. I am talking about the possibility of building up GNVQ programmes or NVQ units into a portfolio. That could appeal to people who are not quick studiers or who have other commitments—carers, for example. Some people may not be able to gain their qualifications by the age of 19 and may find themselves in an awkward position thereafter.
<P>
The Minister should consider the general duty for 16 to 19-year-olds and the specific concerns about those with special educational needs and young people who may be vulnerable or unable to finish the next stage of their education by the age of 19. The issue of adults then arises. NIACE and others are concerned about the formulation here, which derives from the split made by the 1992 Act—I concede that point before the Minister makes it—because it may not deliver adequate and continuing education for adults.
<P>
There is a Government undertaking to fund adult community learning under the new mechanism, but it is similar to the shaky assurances that we have been given on sixth forms. It implies that if activities are sustained, they will be continued. It would be helpful if the Minister said more about the guarantees for continuing adult education as he effectively takes over the funding, if not the delivery, of adult and community education. It would also be useful if he explained how the funding transfers were to be made.
<P>
Some local authorities have strong adult community provision; others fund at low levels, barely fulfilling their legal duty to do so. Is every penny to be put into one pot, boiled up, issued through the Learning and Skills Council for various local activities and back through the local educational authorities? Will it be done on an input or on a different basis? What is the nature of the undertaking to continue funding?
<P>
All those issues may be superable, but there is continuing concern that adequate support may not be forthcoming to realise the Minister's intentions. I am sure that he will wish to reassure the Committee about that. It is inherent in any split that anxieties could develop about a two-tier system, especially if the funding is tight. Legal duties apply to the two sectors, but it should not be regarded in terms of a first division and a premiership provision—adults in clause 3; young people in clause 2—in any other context. There is concern that adult activities will be displaced and that the assurances about the restructuring of adult and community education are not firm or viable.
<P>
There is a parallel anxiety with respect to young people's education that the new word ``proper'' may not mean too much, especially as the small print boils down to the view that quantity is
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>sufficient to meet the reasonable needs of individuals<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and quality is
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>adequate to meet those needs.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It sounds as if a strong definition is then relaxed, which amounts to a weak assurance for young people. I hope that the Minister will speak to all those issues in the same spirit as the criticism is offered.
<P>
There is a common commitment across the Committee—I do not wish to caricature it or to pretend that it does not exist—to provide the best possible deal for the whole sector. We shall return to issues of sectoral boundaries later.
<P>
As we noted earlier, many of us enjoyed higher education, which understandably has a high profile. Provision for compulsory school years is also a strong political imperative for any Government. There is a danger, however, that the area in the middle—which is vital for competitiveness and for the development of young people, for reskilling and the creation of continuing new opportunities for adults—will not have enough political zip behind it

<P>

<B>Mr. Ken Purchase </B>(Wolverhampton, North-East): I understand that the hon. Gentleman fully supports lifelong learning, as do we all, but under what circumstances would he put the allocation of scarce resources for post-l9 education before that for 16 to 19-year-olds? He should tell us that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am not sure that I should have to specify that precisely. However, I can imagine circumstances in which a socially disaffected young person or an ex-offender, perhaps an adult, who lacks basic skills could merit the investment of more resources over a short period. That could justify more spending per head than for a 16 to 19-year-old young person going to a further education or sixth form college.
<P>
The provision in the Bill contains a built-in discrimination, which it is for Ministers to justify. The Government published Green Paper entitled ``The Learning Age'' and they are committed to lifelong learning. They have reaped the political dividends, so they must explain why the distinction persists. What economic as well as personal contribution will result from the continuance of that distinction? It is an interesting feature of the Committee that Ministers must answer for their proposals and it is right that they should.
<P>
The Minister said that he would love to hold a competition for Britain's oldest adult learner—only persons of 85 years and over might enter. The mother of my right hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster and my mother would be in that category, but both of us would be outclassed by the adult learner whom I met on the first day of the establishment of the further education sector at Hackney community college at the end of March 1993. The youngest learner was 16 years old and the oldest learner was 93 years old. It would be difficult to say that learning by 93-year-olds was unworthy or unnecessary. It is great that it can take place. Taken across the piece of all adult learning, I am not even sure why the Minister said that it was inherently less important than education for younger people. It might depend on the individuals. I gave an example in response to the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, North-East (Mr. Purchase).
<P>
The Minister must explain to the Committee why we need such a distinction. Will he assure us that there will be education of high quality for young people, that there will be adequate continuity for them as they become young adults and that, following the ministerial rhetoric that there will be good provision for adults, such education will be secured under the new arrangements and that it will be better than what exists now throughout the country. It is in that spirit that I tabled the amendments, and I should be grateful for contributions to the debate and for the Minister's response to it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I wish to speak to amendments Nos. 20 and 21 tabled in my name and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough. I must apologise, Mr. Hancock, for not welcoming you to the Chair, given your comments to my hon. Friend. I am sure that I shall be in deep trouble for not having done so. I did not want to delay our chance of reaching the major milestone of clause 2. I accept that we are still on page 1 of the Bill, but at least we have reached that clause, which is a serious step forward. I am only disappointed that the Minister has introduced some teasers for clauses 84 to 87, which at the moment are a distant dream. However, I am sure that we shall have plenty of time in which to prepare for them and the important TUPE issues.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I promise the hon. Gentleman that I shall not intervene again. Does he remember my motto from my days as a Government Whip? Following the famous film of the Arnhem aerial landing ``A Bridge Too Far'', Government Whips always have to remember the dictum about the dangers of a clause too far.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I am not sure how to respond to that intervention, so I shall stick to speaking to the amendments—often a safer approach.
<P>
We are concerned about the boundary at which we move from proper education to reasonable education for those aged 19 to 25 years. From the consumer's perspective, individuals aged 16 to 19 years have a right to demand reasonable education from the Learning and Skills Council. I am talking about reasonable education, in that he or she can ask for A-level vocational courses, but if they want to undertake a scuba diving course in the Bahamas, the LSC will be entitled to turn them down. Within the boundaries of what is deemed to be reasonable, the individual has a right to request such education.
<P>
Under clause 3, the LSC can deny the consumer who is aged more than 19 years the course that he or she wishes to undertake on the grounds that the council does not have sufficient money. Clause 2 is about demand-driven education, while clause 3 covers a cash-limited budget for that education. It is important to consumers whether they will be refused courses by the LSC on the basis that there is insufficient cash, rather than that the courses are not of sufficient merit or that the learners are not sufficiently keen on such courses. We want to move that boundary because individuals in the 19 to 25 group should be able to demand courses by right if they can show that the courses are reasonable, that they want to do them and would benefit from them.
<P>
That group is important. The Government have concentrated on the 160,000 socially excluded 16 to 19-year-olds who are not in employment, training or education, and we agree that they are a priority group. However, our fear is that we will not recover many of them while they are still under 19. The peak age for offending is often 17, as the hon. Member for Daventry mentioned. Young people at that stage are often in a difficult environment and engage in all kinds of behaviour. They are some of the most difficult individuals to bring back into the workplace. It is common for them to recover to a degree when they get past the age of 20. At 22 or 23, they start to settle down, develop a more stable background and become engaged in family activities.
<P>
<H5>12 noon </H5>
</P>
<P>
I have certainly had it reported to me that the probation service deal with 22 and 23-year-olds who are in work and show all the signs of respectability, but have outstanding warrants that they have forgotten about from when they were 17 or 18. Their lives have changed completely from that period. If we are to recover such people and offer them training and education opportunities, openings should be available post-l9. That is often when the most difficult individuals will benefit most.
<P>
That is the basis for the amendments. I know that the issue was debated extensively in another place, and I shall not go through all the arguments that were made there. However, it is worth repeating that the national skills taskforce—the advisory committee set up by Secretary of State—recommended that all people should be entitled, up to their 25th birthday, to take a qualification up to level 3, and my party wants to adopt that policy.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Chaytor (Bury, North):</B> On the very point about entitlement, the hon. Gentleman said that his party wants to adopt that policy, but has not yet done so. By trying to shift the boundary from 19 to 25, is he explicitly calling for an entitlement to free education for all people up to the age of 25? What costings has he done and what would be the implications for the LSC budget? What would be the implications for the provisions of schedule 3, which require the establishment of one LSC committee for youths and one for adults? Does the hon. Gentleman accept that the youth committee would deal with all matters relating to those up to the age of 25?
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> For the hon. Gentleman's information, the process is on-going. We have produced a consultation paper, which will be discussed as a formal policy paper in the autumn at my party's conference, where such policy is decided. The costing process is going on. The party published a fully costed manifesto at the election and will do so again.
<P>
The reports that have been produced on behalf of the Government recommended an entitlement for those up to the age of 25. We must obviously consider the cost, but if we were asked whether we could afford to implement the provisions, the answer should be could we afford not to do so for the future of our economy. The Government have taken a strongly similar line in their rhetoric, and I hope that they intend to go as far as they can down that route in the Bill, even though they reserve the right to cash-limit the budgets. It would be nonsense to set up the national skills taskforce and to commission the Kennedy report without intending to do that.
<P>
An underspend of several hundred millions on the new deal is available, and that is one factor that can be brought into play. There are other ways of supporting the provisions. We propose income-contingent loans to the 16 to 24-year-olds as a positive way of enabling them to pay some of their expenses and to take responsibility, as higher education students are expected to do. We would certainly expect employers to offer paid time off for education and training. We are considering a tripartite arrangement to fund individuals in the 16 to 24 age group and, in particular, the 19 to 24 age group. The commitment to fund up to level 3 for all 19–24 year olds is affordable if employers pay and learners contribute, when necessary, through income-contingent loans, and if we release some of the funds that are available for schemes such as the new deal, which have an underspend.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gordon Marsden </B>(Blackpool, South): Has the hon. Gentleman calculated the number of young people between the ages of 19 and 25 who would be affected by this extension?
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I cannot give the hon. Gentleman figures at the moment, but perhaps I could write to him. We have a working group studying these proposals, and we intend to cost them fully. We share the Government's objectives. It is interesting to be challenged on these issues, but we are moving in the same direction. I hope that the Government will indicate that they intend to fund up to level 3 for this age group, and that they are reserving that right at the moment because they do not want the learning and skills councils to be challenged if and when they can fund them for the appropriate level of education. The impression was certainly given in the other place that the Government were seeking to broaden education as far as possible. This is about prioritising and focusing, rather than any lack of will on the Government's part.
<P>
I was hoping that I was throwing seed on fertile ground, given that the Government commissioned the Kennedy report and the national skills taskforce and have received some very authoritative information. Perhaps hon. Members would like to read those reports to get some of the facts and figures on the groups we are talking about. I hope that the Government share our view that this is an aspiration that they hope to meet, or perhaps the idea of focusing on proper facilities for the younger age groups was more of an early pledge than a long-term intention.

<P>

<B>Mr. Chaytor:</B> The second point that I raised concerned the implications for the committee structure of the LSC. Would the hon. Gentleman redefine the responsibilities for the youth committee of the LSC to include all young people up to the age of 25?
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for reminding me of that. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman is probing because he is aware of something that I am not aware of and the amendment is about to be accepted. If that were the case we would revisit the schedule 3 structures. We would be talking about one structure for the younger age group and another for lifelong learning. We would wish to see the committees reorganised in that way. We did not table amendments across the board because we wished to discuss the principle, but clearly if this were accepted we would need to consider a committee for younger people and one for the older age group.
<P>
We want to target the younger age group. We are committed to lifelong learning and we want the level 3 commitment to remain for people who choose to access it. We feel that that is a specific group. We want to reach people who have had a difficult time between 16 and 19 and have failed to access even the enhanced provisions that the Government intend to introduce, and which we support, and those who have left full-time education, have gone into work and have developed greater aspirations later on. Such people are not untypical. Their family circumstances are such that they feel they must earn immediately, and they leave education earlier than they might have wished. When they reach the age of 21 or 22, they regret leaving education and seek a route back in.
<P>
In those circumstances, if we are talking about the skills of the work force as a whole—which is the background to the Bill—leaving such individuals in relatively low skilled employment, when they have the aspiration and the ability to gain additional qualifications, poses some difficulties. The system has generally tended not to assist those who have found their way into work. It has focused on those who are out of work and are coming through other routes. Those who are in work and develop greater aspirations have traditionally found it more difficult to gain access to funded additional education and training. Again we are trying to address their concerns.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will say that the Government have some aspirations in this direction even if he cannot accept the amendments. I return to a point made by the hon. Member for Daventry that is worth putting on the record again. Some students with special educational needs cannot enrol on courses that end in qualifications. There is a school local to me that wanted to keep on some people with moderate learning difficulties in the sixth form, but was unable to do so because it could not enter them on any of the available courses. Those students would have derived great benefit from two additional years in the school environment; to be put into an unemployment zone at the age of 16 was difficult for them. There was no way that they could honestly satisfy the criteria that students must gain a qualification in those two years, but the educational experience and environment would have been of tremendous benefit. I hope that we can make some progress on that area of special needs for the age groups 16 to 19 and 19 to 24.
<P>
<B>Charlotte Atkins </B>(Staffordshire, Moorlands): I believe that it is important that we keep the priority on 16 to 19-year-olds. My constituency falls within the sub-region of north Staffordshire, which has one of the worst staying-on rates in the country. Nationally, 9 per cent. of those aged 16 to 18—that is about l73,000 people—are not in employment, training or education. Whether or not we include the 19 to 25-year olds to whom the hon. Gentleman referred, we still have a huge number of people for whom we need to provide a priority education service.
<P>
The 16 to 18 age group is in most need of support and encouragement, otherwise, like many young people, they might drift into doing nothing. In a place such as north Staffordshire, where many of the local skills such as those employed in the potteries, mines and textile industry are disappearing, it is vitally important that we give that age group new skills for a modern century. We have a specialist technology school that provides IT skills, but we need to do much more. The later clauses of the Bill show that we are giving a lot of support to the 13 to 19 age group by setting up the new youth service, ConneXions, which will give the support needed by young people from a traditional background in which education has not been a top priority.
<P>
If support is concentrated on the 16 to 19-year-olds, it may reap real rewards. Stoke-on-Trent, which is near my constituency, was selected as a pilot for educational maintenance allowances. I hope that those allowances will be extended across the whole of north Staffordshire—I hope that the Minister is listening—because they have been so successful. The figures speak for themselves: Stoke's sixth form college has increased its enrolment of 16-year-olds by 9 per cent. Stoke-on-Trent college, which in the past had many problems because of poor management, has increased its enrolment by 22 per cent, and that of Newcastle-under-Lyme college has risen by 23 per cent.
<P>
We must concentrate resources on the smaller group, because, by extending them to 25-year-olds, we will dilute their impact. We must ensure that 16 to 19 year-olds are our priority, and we must start with them as soon as they leave school, otherwise we might lose them for a generation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Graham Brady </B>(Altrincham and Sale, West): I am pleased to be able to attend the Committee at last, and to find myself under your chairmanship, Mr. Hancock. It has been unusually good timing from my point of view, because I am normally ill during public holidays. I have managed to miss Easter, but I apologise for my absence last week and I will try to make up for that in the coming weeks.
<P>
I shall start with some questions about amendments Nos. 20 and 21, which have been tabled by the hon. Member for Hallam. Making the age group for entitlement to proper education and training provision 16 to 25 rather than 16 to 19 would, given constrained budgets, inevitably reduce provision for the over-25 age group. Is that the hon. Gentleman's intention?
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> That is precisely one of the problems that we face. The greater our success in drawing 16 to 19-year-olds into participation, the less we can offer 19 to 25-year-olds. Wherever the line is drawn, that problem will always exist. A cash-limited and demand-driven budget will always result in such problems.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I fully accept that, and the problem must be tackled head on. It goes to the root of the amendments, which would substantially change the priorities for the allocation of funds between the age groups. As the Liberal Democratic party did not vote against the Finance Bill last night, I presume that we may take it that it would make available the same resources as the Government have in mind. Clearly, therefore, it would be necessary to shift the balance of provision between the age groups.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> Just for the sake of accuracy, I should tell the hon. Gentleman that we declined to support the Conservative amendment to the Finance Bill, but the House did not vote on the Finance Bill itself.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> It is entirely up to the hon. Gentleman and his party how they voted on the Finance Bill and our amendment.
<P>
A wider point about amendments Nos. 20 and 21 relates to many of my anxieties about the Bill as a whole. The amendments take us back to the question whether education and training are the same, or are different sides of the same coin, whether they should be treated in the same way and whether the Bill does so. The explicit exclusion of higher education from the Bill, combined with amendments Nos. 20 and 21, which would increase the age limit, would create an unlevel playing field for those in the age group that typically avails itself more readily of higher education. On entering higher education, they face a set of financial circumstances and a framework of provision that now includes the requirement to contribute to the funding of their studies.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that one of the system's characteristics, at least before the Government introduced tuition fees and abolished the maintenance grant, was a perverse incentive to enter higher education when it might have been in the interest of someone's career development to take a further education course, which was then less generously supported? The balance of advantage between the two routes, at least in financial terms, is now much closer, simply because the Government have withdrawn support for higher education.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> My hon. Friend is right. The amendments would increase that effect and would shift the balance further in the other direction. By taking a further education route, even if it is not the most appropriate, people aged 16 to 25 might gain a significant financial benefit. The amendments might encourage them to take the wrong route of further or higher education. That aspect must be considered.
<P>
The amendments to which my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry spoke raise other important points, and I do not intend to cover again the ground that he so lucidly covered. However, it is appropriate to consider the purpose of the Bill in relation to the provision of education and training. Why are there different emphases? Why should quantity be sufficient to meet reasonable needs, but quality merely adequate to do so?
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Daventry pointed out that the Government rhetoric would lead us to expect the best of all possible outcomes in the best of all possible worlds, but the rhetoric of excellence that we hear so often is not replicated in the Bill. Far from aspiring to excellence, its aspirations are limited to sufficiency and adequacy. That is a cause for concern. The Bill would be greatly improved, as would the provision of education and training for 16 to 19-year-olds and the age group beyond that, if instead of those aspirations it contained some aspiration to excellence. In that context, my hon. Friend's amendments are important. I look forward to hearing the Minister's assurances on that point.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hilary Benn:</B> As a Member new to Committees considering Bills, I sense that it would be remiss if I were not to welcome you as our Chairman, Mr. Hancock. I do so with genuine pleasure as well as a sense of duty, not least because, in my former existence, I played a modest part in some of the policy work that led to the production of the Bill. So I take double pleasure in participating in the debate. The amendments raise some fundamental questions about the nature of the LSC.
<P>
I hesitate to enter the adjectival debate, although I have a natural inclination to resist what I would describe as linguistic inflation. I say to the hon. Member for Daventry that the reference in amendment No. 74 to resources of high quality is an example of such inflation. The hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West said that he wanted references to excellence added. If we are not careful, unless we put ``high quality'' or ``excellent'' into every piece of legislation, people will feel that words without those adjectives attached convey a lesser meaning.
<P>
I am never able to understand what a complete stop is whenever I am about to leave an aircraft—a stop is a stop, not a complete stop. As a Committee, we should be careful about adding excess adjectives.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I entirely agree. The use of ``high quality'' was a bit of tease, because I was merely picking up the constant refrain of Ministers, who always preface their nouns with loaded adjectives. I do not think that it adds in the slightest to the argument, and I have every sympathy with the hon. Gentleman's point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Benn:</B> I am grateful, and I trust that that means that the amendment will be withdrawn in due course.
<P>
All members of the Committee would agree with the forceful point made by the hon. Member for Hallam about the case for lifelong learning. Amendment No. 20 would introduce a cut off at the age of 25, which is a logical flaw. I see, because he is nodding his head, that the hon. Gentleman concedes the point. By focusing on people aged 16 to 19, the Bill seems to indicate that we owe them a particular responsibility. My hon. Friend the Member for Staffordshire, Moorlands (Charlotte Atkins) explained clearly why that is so, and it certainly goes for the young people in my constituency, as I am sure it does in the constituencies of other right hon. and hon. Members. However, the Bill does not relegate learners over the age of 19 or 25 to a lesser status. On the contrary, if the Learning and Skills Council is to succeed in its job, it must engage learners of all ages.
<P>
I echo what my hon. Friend the Minister said at our first sitting. He said that it was a matter of demand rather than supply. I found some of this debate a little difficult to follow because, before we can suffer a crisis of provision we must have an excess of demand. At the moment, we do not have an excess of demand. One of the principal responsibilities of the Learning and Skills Council will be to generate that demand.
<P>
At the risk of prompting rumours about a Lib-Lab coalition, many Committee members will agree that we look forward to the day when all adults can enjoy an entitlement to learning up to level 3. We provide it at level 4 for those able to go to university. We must take it one step at a time.
<P>
Finally, we all understand that resources will always be finite. However, thanks to the Government, they are less finite than they were. Indeed, substantial additional resources have been made available, although I am not sure whether they should be described as adequate, sufficient or even satisfactory. I long for the day when satisfactory takes its proper meaning and is not taken as a passing insult. I have no doubt that the debate about the balance of priorities within the LSC will in due course move from the Committee to the council itself, as it gets on with its work.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I start by resiling immediately from the suggestion made by my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry that the Minister is a reincarnation or spiritual descendant of Dr. Pangloss. However, such is my respect for my hon. Friend that I shall reread ``Candide'' to see if I can detect the slightest similarity between the Minister and the late doctor.
<P>
I enjoyed the Liberal Democrat spokesman's offer to respond in writing to the hon. Member for Blackpool, South (Mr. Marsden). It is 55 years since the Liberals were last in office; it is extremely reassuring to discover that they have not yet forgotten the script.
<P>
I share the views of the hon. Member for Leeds, Central. I enjoyed his reference to stoppage. I shall certainly seek to enrol him in my campaign to ban the word reshuffle from the political vocabulary. When one is playing bridge, one does not say at the end of each hand, ``Shall we reshuffle the cards?'' We simply shuffle them.
<P>
On Second Reading, I referred to the distinction, in the language of the Bill, between the young and those in adult education. I did it in headlines. My hon. Friend the Member for Daventry was much more eloquent.
<P>
Before I say anything else, I must say, as did the hon. Member for Staffordshire, Moorlands, that in everything that we do we must recognise the salience of the young. Our job is simply to clear up certain opaque aspects of later parts of the Bill.
<P>
At the risk of sounding like Nestor, when I served in the Treasury we had a saying that that which could not be measured did not exist. That saying was put to the test some years ago by the Foreign Office, when Mr. Ernest Bevin, who was a large man, was Foreign Secretary. Our embassy in Brussels was concerned that Mr. Bevin might not be able to get through the door between the main spare bedroom and the main spare bathroom. A telegram was sent to London saying, ``Please verify diameter of Secretary of State.'' Those of us who knew and loved the Foreign Office were not wholly surprised that its reply was more literate than numerate. It said, ``Unable to verify diameter, but circumference is 60 inches.''
<P>
I share the views of my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry that we are not looking for an infinitude of resources. On Second Reading, I said that when I was the Minister responsible for adult education, the mere provision of a further quarter of a million pounds would have made a massive difference to what we could do from the centre. Small amounts of money can be significant in these matters.
<P>
I am not suggesting that Sir Winston Churchill's great sentences about adult education should be circulated to Committee members, as I am certain that they are already well known to them. In the days when there was capital punishment, a Latin quotation was set up in the Home Secretary's office, saying, in effect, that to take a man's life requires much thought. It is worth keeping Sir Winston's views in front of all of us at all times.
<P>
The Minister has exercised the Committee with a competition to find the oldest learner in the country. I have a number of candidates. The late, great Raphael Samuel's mother had her first symphony performed at the age of 80. Another elderly lady obtained her first degree at the Open university at the age of 86 and was actively contemplating embarking on a PhD. The Committee will remember that Hobbes—I hasten to say that I mean Thomas rather than Jack—Sophocles and Titian all attained the age of 100, although I acknowledge that they may have passed beyond the scope of adult education classes towards the end of their lives.
<P>
I support my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry because the Government have chosen the words in the Bill in respect of provision for those engaged in adult learning. They must address those words and the remarks made by Opposition Members in this especially significant debate.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Chaytor:</B> Even though it is now two hours since the sitting began, I am pleased to add my congratulations to you, Mr. Hancock, on your efficient chairmanship, under which I am pleased to be serving.
<P>
I have enormous sympathy with the aims of the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Hallam, although I have severe reservations about their practical implications. I am not sure whether the financial or social equity implications have been fully thought through, and I shall follow proceedings in the Liberal Democrat conference this September with great interest to see how the policy on which they are based develops.
<P>
There are difficulties in the fairly arbitrary use of the age of 25 as the cut-off point for what constitutes youth and age. Amendment No. 20 would mean that the 25-year-old son or daughter of a Member of Parliament who wished to do an A-level course would be able to receive tuition for free, but the 26-year-old unemployed person wanting to do an NVQ I would be expected to pay. The arbitrary choice of the age of 25 as the cut-off point for entitlement has a range of equity problems.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> The 25-year cut-off date still exists under clause 3. There are other things that one can do to provide free education to people above the age of 25. We want to move the higher level of provision available to 16 to 19-year-olds up to the 25-year-old level, but we do not want to change what is available after the age of 25 under the Bill as it currently stands.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chaytor:</B> I understand that; I am saying merely that we must consider a range of issues regarding entitlement, the operation of means testing and the importance of different levels of education in strengthening the provision of lifelong learning. I am not sure whether the hon. Gentleman's amendment would deal adequately with those issues.
<P>
There is enormous irony in seeing supporters of the previous Government, who succeeded in making whole regions of the country adult education-free zones, now arguing for the extension of lifelong learning. I welcome their repentance.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman aware that the withdrawal from adult education, about which I share his concern, was mainly conducted by LEAs? It occurred largely in areas where the authorities were controlled by the Labour party at the time. It is quite improper—to coin a phrase—for the hon. Gentleman to suggest that central Government direction drove the authorities away from adult education.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Chaytor:</B> With respect, the withdrawal of adult education was the result of the Further and Higher Education Act 1992, coupled with the previous Government's bizarre attitude to local government finance.
<P>
Leaving that aside, the idea that lifelong learning is taken less seriously because of the prioritisation of 16 to 19-year-olds is absurd. The Government published the Green Paper ``The Learning Age'' two years ago, the White Paper ``Learning to Succeed'' last year and the prospectus on learning and skills councils at the end of last year, quite apart from commissioning a report by the national skills task force and the Kennedy and Fryer reports. Those documents fully illustrate the importance of lifelong learning to the Government's education and economic policies.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> The hon. Gentleman mentioned Chris Humphries' third national skills taskforce report. I presume that he has read it. With which of its recommendations does he disagree? The policy that my hon. Friend the Member for Hallam and I propose in our probing amendment is to deal in legislation with the massive skills gap identified by the third national skills taskforce. The problem does not end at 19. I agree with many of the hon. Gentleman's comments about the previous Government's lamentable programme to address the nation's skills deficit, but with what does he disagree in Chris Humphries' report that prevents him from supporting the amendment?
<P>
<B>Mr. Chaytor:</B> I agree with much of the three taskforce reports that have been published, but it is not the Government's responsibility immediately to implement in legislation the recommendations of every taskforce that they commission. The Government's responsibility is to frame legislation that advances a general policy.
<P>
Entitlement to level 3 up to age 25, which is a specific recommendation in the third national skills taskforce report, would mean that a 25-year-old son or daughter of a Member of Parliament would be entitled to free tuition for an A-level course, but that a 26-year-old son or daughter of an unemployed coal miner would not be entitled to it for an NVQ level 1. That is why I have reservations about enthusiastically implementing each recommendation that is made by a taskforce.
<P>
I reiterate that this Government, more than any other, have put lifelong learning at the heart of their education and economic policies. There can be no doubt about their support for extending opportunity and widening participation in education among all age ranges. My constituency of Bury, North, by contrast with that of my hon. Friend the Member for Staffordshire, Moorlands, has a high staying-on rate among school leavers and a very high level of participation in lifelong learning. The two are not unconnected. Our high level of participation is largely due to a coherent network of 11-to-16 comprehensive schools that feed into two excellent colleges—a Catholic sixth form college and a tertiary college. The advantage of having a coherent network of comprehensive schools is not a benefit that constituents' children across the country share, certainly not in the constituency of the hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West, the majority of whose constituents are deselected at 11.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I regard the lie that is peddled by Labour Members who want to get rid of the selective education system and the grammar schools in my constituency as offensive to those pupils who go to its excellent high schools, one of which is so good that the Secretary of State for Education and Employment has designated it as a beacon school. The lie suggests that those pupils have failed. They attend excellent schools and obtain good results.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chaytor:</B> I am in no position to comment on the quality of individual schools in the hon. Gentleman's constituency. All I am saying is that the huge advantage enjoyed by my constituents' children is due to the excellent system of 11-to-16 comprehensive schools that we have had for the best part of 15 years. They continue to produce better results than those produced in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, Central.
<P>
I want to move on and make the connection between widening participation, the increasing retention of people in the 16 to 19 age range and lifelong learning. The best thing we can do to generate demand for lifelong learning is to promote the desire for knowledge and love of learning among 16 to 19-„year-olds. The more we increase participation rates and the more we raise standards of achievement among 16 to 19-year-olds, the more demand there will be for lifelong learning. The prioritisation of 16 to 19-year-olds within that framework is the best way to strengthen lifelong learning.
<P>
<B>Mr. Marsden:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that the whole thrust of the Liberal Democrats' argument is based on the misconception that the Government are not concerned to establish access for all people, whatever their age? Does he not also agree that the crucial question is priority?
<P>
<B>Mr. Chaytor:</B> I agree completely that priority is crucial. It is naïve to assume that the infinite demand for educational opportunity among all age groups can be dealt with completely by any Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way in a thoughtful speech, but would he not echo the words of the National Association of Teachers in Further and Higher Education, which expressed the following concern:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>There is a grave danger that the education of adults will become secondary and second class, and if and when there is a financial squeeze, adult education will be out in the cold.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Is not that what worries the proponents of adult education about the proposed structure?
<P>
<B>Mr. Chaytor:</B> I am afraid that I would not, on this occasion, echo the words of NATFHE, although it is an eminent organisation. I would draw the Committee's attention to the comments of NIACE, which said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Among the very welcome measures proposed are: the ending of the curriculum distinction between schedule 2 and non-schedule 2 provision . . . a statutory national committee for adult learning . . . a clear remit of the Learning and Skills Council to support a full range of adult continuing education . . . a primary planning role for Local Learning Partnerships . . . recognition of the strategic role of Local Education Authorities . . . potential for national voluntary organisations and residential colleges to apply to the National Council for funding . . . <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and a whole range of other measures that NIACE thought were enormous improvements introduced by the Bill.
<P>
Any Government must have priorities within their overall programme of spending. The key issue is whether the priority given to 16 to 19-year-olds will strengthen the development of lifelong learning in future or weaken it. The evidence from those parts of the country where there are good rates of pupils staying on and high levels of achievement show that the demand for lifelong learning in those areas is enhanced.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I have enormous respect for the hon. Gentleman's commitment to further education and lifelong learning, but he did not quote the objections of NIACE to clause 2.
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As currently drafted, the distinction between clauses 2 and 3 suggests that whilst provision for 16-18 year olds should meet demand and be of the highest possible quality, that for adults should be dependent on the finances available to the Council . . . Given the commitment to widen participation, this is a case of ``never mind the quality, feel the width''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is the point.
<P>
If one examines the social exclusion report ``Bridging the Gap'' and reads about the deprivation of the 170 16 to 19-year-olds to which it refers, the notion that, suddenly, all the problems will be resolved at 19 is inconceivable.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chaytor:</B> We could spend considerable time quoting selected excerpts from the briefing materials with which we have been provided, but I am not sure that that would be terribly productive. I will only reiterate my point—any Government in any policy area must prioritise. If lifelong learning is to be the heart of the Government's policy, the key consideration is the way in which we might strengthen and extend the policy over the years ahead. Developing educational opportunity, primarily among 16 to 19-year-olds, would be the best way to do that because that would result in a self-generating demand for lifelong learning in the future.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> The debate has been useful. Although I shall ask my hon. Friends to resist the amendments and the hon. Member for Daventry to consider withdrawing his, the debate has teased out a central issue. I shall not compete with anyone in quoting ``Candide'', but I note that my son was reading it the other day. I had not realised that it could be a useful resource document—I just put it down to good parenting. I will draw on it if necessary.
<P>
All the amendments deal with the distinction between the LSC's duties in relation to 16 to 19-„year-olds and adults, or in relation to quality for both groups. We have discussed the balance that we must strike, given our ambitious agenda for lifelong learning, between the young, whom we seek to prioritise, and other groups in great need of learning. I welcome the debate although, to some extent, it has been based on a lack of judgment regarding the importance of the young as a group, which we must stress.
<P>
The Government are passionately committed to learning over the lifecycle. Indeed, that will be seen as a distinguishing feature of the Government in years to come. Lifelong learning means what it says. It is about enabling parents to be as effective as possible, about the sure start programme, about nursery education and the priority that we are giving to child care and about what we are doing with regard to basic skills at primary school level through the literacy hour and the numeracy strategy. It is about the entire schools agenda. Many of us recognise that, whatever our particular concerns about the post-16 situation, we stand a far greater chance of achieving our objectives of enabling more of our adults to become successful in life, through their skills, training and employability, if we have in place policies for pre-16 education.
<P>
We are passionate about work force development. We will consider an amendment on the subject later. We are passionate about work-related training and education and about the whole economically active population. We are also concerned about developing proper adult and community education. We feel strongly about adults who lack basic skills and about younger and older citizens who have special difficulties in life, not least when it comes to learning.
<P>
We should consider the balance that we need to strike, and the practical question of where resources should be prioritised. Despite the interesting speech by the hon. Member for Daventry, we do not get far by dwelling too much on the precise meaning of words such as ``sufficient'' and ``adequate''. We were asked whether the test was high—it is very high.
<P>
Much ink has been spilled and many keyboards have been struck over the meaning of those adjectives. In essence, the crucial words in clause 2(2) are:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>to meet the reasonable needs of individuals.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In this day and age, the reasonable needs of 16 to 19-„year-olds „are demanding. To meet those needs, much will be required of the Learning and Skills Council. High quality provision will also be needed. We are giving that clear commitment. It will not help if we spend any more time dancing verbally on the head of a pin about nouns or adjectives or when there is occasionally some confusion between the two.

<P>

<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I appreciate that the Minister said that he did not want to waste any more time on the matter, but I do not believe that it is such a waste of time. Will he make it explicit that the needs that are reasonable for one individual could be entirely different from those that are reasonable for another? That may apply to special educational needs and the needs of those who are perhaps less able, as well as to the highly able young person. I know that, in a former guise, he gained considerable expertise in that area.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> I did so with help from my hon. Friend, if I may refer to him as such, given that we served together on the Select Committee on such issues. Any teacher knows that to enable a young person or an older learner to be adequately, reasonably, sufficiently—whatever words we want to use in common parlance— educated or trained, account must be taken of that individual's particular circumstances, the resource implications of which will vary a great deal, not least for groups with special needs because of physical disabilities, with learning difficulties or with exceptionally high ability. The Select Committee covered that not so many months ago.
<P>
I shall deal first at length with amendments Nos. 71 and 73, because of their importance. They go to the heart of the priority that we have set for dealing with the needs of young people. Although they are not wrecking amendments—that is not the Opposition's intention—they would undermine fundamentally the Government's policy by weakening the LSC's duty. They would remove the entitlement that we intend for young people, requiring that the LSC simply provides facilities, and not ``proper facilities'' as defined under subsection (2). They would remove any requirement on the LSC that the facilities provided must be of an adequate quality, although I imagine that amendment No. 74 is intended to deal with that point.
<P>
We have heard from the hon. Member for Daventry about his desire to address as a priority the needs of disadvantaged young people. I must say to him, however, that if the amendment were accepted, it would undermine the priority that we intend to give to young people and that would be a serious matter. The Committee is faced with a crunch issue. As the hon. Member for Staffordshire, Moorlands explained so well, based on local example, for economic and social reasons the provision is a crucial priority for the Government's overall public policy. At present, one in 11 young people aged 16 to 18—a total of about 170,000 young men and women—are not in the ambit of the system. They are not in education or training, nor are they in work. Although there may be a reasonable explanation for some of those 170,000 being in such a situation, for most there will not be. That statistic alone is devastating and it is one that people understand. It is the key reason why we wish to give priority to that age group.
<P>
The hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough made an important point and suggested that division at the age of 19 under clauses 2 and 3 was arbitrary and unnecessary. He questioned whether there should be any such division. The issue is important. Hon. Members have recognised that the clauses are central to the LSC's operation, and they have been right to subject the clauses to close scrutiny.
<P>
It might help the Committee to consider a short history lesson—I promise that it will be short. I embark on that with some trepidation, because the Committee contains many historians, not least of whom is my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, South, a former editor of History Today. My short dissertation on education history is modest and will not feature in that publication.
<P>
The first real steps towards providing publicly funded education in England were taken in the Forster Act of 1870, which I believe a Liberal Government introduced. It covered elementary education that was neither free nor compulsory, but it started an explosion of publicly funded education from school boards, which supplemented church school education. [Interruption.] The hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough is interrupting and clearly remembers the events well. In 1880, elementary education became compulsory up to the age of 10, and by 1899, that age had become 12. Free education had already arrived for that age group in 1891, although the system remained somewhat ramshackle.
<P>
The first comprehensive education legislation was produced in 1902. It set up education authorities and introduced secondary schools, which were allowed to provide education to children between the ages of 12 and 16. However, it was not until 1907 that schools had to provide even 25 per cent. of places for free, and that the age of transfer became more generally accepted as 11. At that time, the majority of children left learning aged 12.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I thank the Minister, because I did not wish to intervene from a sedentary position. Will he acknowledge that until W.E. Forster's Act, and the 1902 Act, which introduced secondary education of a sort, we were trying to catch up with Germany? We did then what we do now, and what we have done for the past 18 years. Investment in our education system has lagged far behind and forced us to find huge resources to deal with problems such as the skills gap and the 170,000 young people whom the Minister mentioned. We are worried that he will repeat mistakes from history and confine the education system to tackling the skills deficit in 16 to 19-year-olds, rather than developing the adventurous and visionary system that the Prime Minister described.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for his short intervention. He is a distinguished Liberal party historian—many of us are committed to that party's history—and he asks whether the Bismarckian ghost continues to haunt our nation. One could develop that idea into an interesting thesis. Certainly, the Franco-Prussian war of 1870 taught nation states that a nation's medical and educational provision was crucial. Although the lessons from Germany should not be copied word for word, they make a useful backdrop to our deliberations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> The Minister mentioned the Bismarckian ghost. We understand that the 1996 skills audit showed that 30 per cent. of the United Kingdom's work force was qualified to level three, compared with 62 per cent. of Germany's work force, so the idea of catching up with Germany is still relevant. There also remains a gap for 19 to 21-year-olds, of whom 37 per cent. had attained the level that 51 per cent. of Germans had reached.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> Of course there is a gap with many of our major economic partners-cum-competitors. That is why we feel so passionately and why we want to develop the historical argument and make our priorities known. I will continue to do that later—perhaps this afternoon.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I hope that hon. Members will not spend the three and a half hours between now and our next sitting looking at history books so that they can compete on the various dates. I look forward to seeing everyone back here at 4.30 pm.
<P>
It being One o'clock, THE CHAIRMAN adjourned the Committee without Question put, pursuant to the Standing Order.
