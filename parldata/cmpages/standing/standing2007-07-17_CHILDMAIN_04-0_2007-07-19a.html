							<a name="07071992000432"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Work and
Pensions (Mr. James Plaskitt):
						</b> I have, of
course, had time to reflect at length on the contributions made on the
amendment, but have not altered my conclusions. The contributions of
the hon. Members for South-West Bedfordshire, for Rochdale and for
Angus had one thing in common. There is a bit of a misunderstanding on
their part about the chronology in relation to staff numbers in the
agency. Let me try to clear that up for them. As they know, there is an
operational target set by the Department on staffing numbers, which
envisages a 15 per cent. reduction and is designed to take the head
count to 9,547 by March 2008. That date is very important because, as I
understood it, all hon. Members who concentrated on the staffing
reduction seemed to associate it with the introduction of CMEC.
However, as they will see, CMEC picking up the reins and assuming
responsibility for the way that child support evolves will take place
largely after 2008. It is very important to understand that point, but
I will say a little more about the reduction in staffing
levels.</div>
					<a name="07071992000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
important to understand that the head count that we are aiming to
achieve by March 2008 takes the operational numbers, by and large, back
down to their level before the operational improvement plan. That point
is also important in getting the numbers in
context.</div>
					<a name="07071992000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
operational improvement plan, which is now only one year into its
operation, is a concerted attempt to get to grips with some of the
historic operational issues in the CSA. On the basis of its first year,
the plan it is making very good progress and we are therefore pretty
confident that the tough targets that we set will be
achieved.</div>
					<a name="07071992000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many of the
targets are concerned with systemic reform. Once they are achieved and
the historic legacy problems ironed out, the agency should be able to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column110" />Column number: 110</div>continue operating at that much improved level without the additional
staff that were necessary to correct the long-standing problems. The
large backlog of unclear cases is now coming down, there is faster
treatment of new applications and telephony is much
improved.</div>
					<a name="07071992000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that hon. Members understand that the head count numbers that they
have been focusing on lead up to March 2008 and have more to do with
delivering the operational improvement plan than setting staffing
levels in some predictive way for the forthcoming commission. I will
expand a bit more on that
later.</div>
					<a name="07071992000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07071992000433"></a>
							<b class="B">Andrew
Selous</b> (South-West Bedfordshire) (Con): I was particularly
interested in the Minister&#146;s brief reference to the operational
improvement plan because, according to my information, in July 2006 the
agency was collecting 35 per cent. of arrears and that was down to 33
per cent. in September. I do not know if he has more up-to-date
information, but I am nervous about the progress of the operational
improvement
plan.</div>
					<a name="07071992000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07071992000434"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:
						</b> Many indicators apply to the operational
improvement plan and I am not asserting, just one year into it, that
every single one is now moving in the correct direction. The key
priorities in the first year of the plan are resolving what are known
as stuck cases, on which progress is being made; beginning a
substantial reduction in the backlog of uncleared cases, and those are
down substantially; and getting more maintenance payments flowing
through. From memory, I think that I am right in saying that in the
first year of the plan, about 58,000 more children are in receipt of
maintenance than before we embarked on it. Those are very promising
indicators of the plan&#146;s success. There is, of course, much more
to be done with two years of the plan to
go.</div>
					<a name="07071992000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07071992000435"></a>
							<b class="B">Paul
Rowen</b> (Rochdale) (LD): I was listening very carefully to
what the Minister had to say. Given that the amendment would give the
commission the right to set the appropriate staffing level, perhaps he
could tell us what he estimates is an adequate staffing level. Is that
based on the anticipated reduction in case load as a result of the move
to the voluntary payments? We have concerns about how quickly those
voluntary payments, rather than the statutory scheme, will become the
norm.</div>
					<a name="07071992000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07071992000436"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:
						</b> The appropriate level of staffing for the
commission will be down to the commission. That is not just a neat
formulation. I shall say more about that in a moment. Of course the
appropriate level will depend on choices that the commission makes
about how it wants to deliver these services. As the hon. Gentleman
knows, we have published indicative figures of what we expect the
impact on case load to be. That will emerge as we proceed and as the
reforms come into play. The commission, charged as it is with certain
duties, will need to assess the appropriate staffing level to deliver
on the commitments that the Bill will give it. I trust that deals with
the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
point.</div>
					<a name="07071992000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also want to
pick up the operational suggestions made by the hon. Member for
Mid-Bedfordshire. I was concerned about the model she proposed and I am
not at all convinced of its workability. As I understood it 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column111" />Column number: 111</div>she wanted an individual caseworker assigned to each case. I think that
she will accept, on reflection, that that is not achievable or
realistic. Each case does not require constant attention. They require
spasmodic attention. Therefore, any individual caseworker will be
handling any number of cases. We do not know when an individual call
will come asking the agency to deal with a case.</div>
					<a name="07071992000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">We want clients of the agency
to be able to call at times that are appropriate to them, which may be
outside normal working hours. One cannot assume that one given
caseworker will sit waiting for the phone to ring in case there is a
call on that particular case. A number of people will inevitably need
to be able to handle any customer query or issue coming in. The secret
is to have a good back-up system which ensures that any single operator
dealing with a call coming in to the agency can get in front of them in
a timely fashion all the relevant information about a client&#146;s
case. That is the work and investment that is now being made in the IT
system.</div>
					<a name="07071992000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07071992000437"></a>
							<b class="B">Mrs.
Nadine Dorries</b> (Mid-Bedfordshire) (Con): This is a
question of accountability and individual clients knowing who is
responsible for their case and whom they can approach. There are
instances when my constituents&#146; cases require a certain level of
input over a short period, and for them to be handed from one person to
the other every time they ring the call centre is unsatisfactory.
Should not there be one member of staff who takes overall
responsibility for a particular case while that case is ongoing,
accepting that every time clients phone they would not always speak to
that person?</div>
					<a name="07071992000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07071992000438"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:
						</b> I understand where the hon. Lady is coming from,
but I do not think that that is operationally possible. It would be
unhelpful to a client of the agency to be told that the named
individual inside the agency handling their case was Ms A, for example,
because there would inevitably be occasions when they rang up to speak
to Ms A and were told that she was handling someone else&#146;s case,
was not in today and so on. It would create a false impression of what
we were able to do.</div>
					<a name="07071992000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">In my experience as a
constituency MP&#151;I suspect this is backed up by other members of
the Committee&#151;constituents are not so concerned about having one
named individual. Their primary concern is that whenever they make any
contact with the agency their point is dealt with effectively and
efficiently by whomever takes that call. That is the key to a seamless
and continuous service to clients. It is not where the agency has got
to at the moment, as we know. That is why the current investment in the
IT is so
important.</div>
					<a name="07071992000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07071992000439"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Mike Weir</b> (Angus) (SNP): I understand what the Minister is
saying and I appreciate the operational difficulties, but is it not the
case at present that if I take up the case of a constituent and get a
response from the CSA it will give a named person to be passed on to
the constituent, who can then contact that person directly? Thus, the
agency has the facility to do that in some cases, when it has got to
the complaint stage, but it would seem sensible to bring that process
forward, in order to avoid it getting to that
stage.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column112" />Column number: 112</div>
					<a name="07071992000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07071992000440"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:
						</b> The complaints procedure is not the same as the
day-to-day administration process, which is why the two are not
transferable. I am anxious to make progress on the matter, because I
fear that we are straying a little from the
amendment.</div>
					<a name="07071992000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07071992000441"></a>Andrew
Selous:
						</b> I put to the Minister the same point that I put to
the hon. Member for Rochdale this morning. It is that many of the fears
expressed by members of the Committee would be allayed if the Minister
could assure us that a fairly detailed record of what has happened will
appear on the CMEC operator&#146;s computer screen. That would allow
an operator who may be fresh to the case to see what has happened
during the last few calls&#151;what stage the case has
reached&#151;and to pick it up quickly and deal with it. Our
constituents are frustrated by having to explain the whole case from
the beginning every
time.</div>
					<a name="07071992000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07071992000442"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:
						</b> That is what I am saying. That is the ideal
operative state. It is not yet the state that the agency has reached.
Many cases are still proceeding clerically and are still paper-bound.
It is a huge job for the agency to move from its current state to being
able to offer that kind of service. The purpose of the operational
improvement plan is to fix some of the agency&#146;s inherited
problems and to get the process into a fitter state before CMEC assumes
responsibility for it. I hope that hon. Members are assured that the
specific provision in the amendment is not
necessary.</div>
					<a name="07071992000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 2
sets clear objectives for the commission, and it must aim to meet them
when exercising its functions. It also has a duty to act in a way that
is both efficient and effective. That places a requirement on the
commission, working within its allocated funding, to ensure that it has
the capability to deliver, which includes having an appropriate level
of staffing. If the commission did not do that, it would be failing to
meet the legislative requirements placed upon it; it would be failing
to act and failing to pursue its objectives. The appropriate level of
staffing will depend on the operating model and a series of other
decisions still to be made by the
commission.</div>
					<a name="07071992000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
example, if the commission contracts out a significant proportion of
its services, as the Bill enables it to do, the number of direct
employees will be fewer than if it chooses to keep a substantial number
of services in-house. However, the choice of operating model is a
matter for the commission&#151;and, therefore, so is the level of
staffing. The concern that the amendment seeks to address is already
provided for in the Bill. For that reason, I urge the hon. Member for
Rochdale to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

discussed. That is important because the debts are substantial. We need
to ensure that they are taken into account, given that a different
model was suggested in the Henshaw report, whereby CMEC would not deal
with historic
debt.</div>
					<a name="07071992000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second
amendment adds the matter of historic debt to the remit of the annual
report that the commission must present to the Secretary of State.
Again, it is important that a regular report is made to the Secretary
of State and to Parliament, through the Select Committee on Work and
Pensions, to ensure that we know what has happened in that regard,
given the size of the debt. We want to ensure that the historic debt
functions of CMEC are mentioned explicitly in the Bill, and that
accountability for the historic debt is established. That is important
because we do not want historic debt to be overshadowed by the
introduction of the new assessments process and the so-called clean
break. New arrangements do need to be put in place, but there must be
increased concentration on ensuring that the historic debt, which
affects a substantial number of children, is not forgotten or washed
away.</div>

					<a name="07071992000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">A generation of
children is growing up&#151;some of them have already grown
up&#151;without the maintenance that they are owed, because the CSA
failed to take into account proper debt collection and enforcement. I
submit that that is a contributory factor to the high level of child
poverty in this country. We need to understand the nature of the debt
and how much of it 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column114" />Column number: 114</div>can and should be collected. In setting up CMEC, we must work to ensure
that that money will be
collected.</div>
					<a name="07071992000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">The CSA
annual report 2006 refers to at least &#163;1 billion of child
support money that the CSA regards as collectable. I hope that when the
new enforcement powers in the Bill are introduced in 2008, the debt
recovery target&#151;currently &#163;213 million by March
2009&#151;will be reconsidered. It will be intolerable if it is not
made a priority to recover that &#163;1 billion, which should be
being used to give children the start in life that they deserve by
enabling them to be looked after. We seek, through the amendment, to
ensure that the target is even higher than &#163;213 million. I hope
that the Minister will give us an indication as to what he believes
will be collected, given the substantial new powers in the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="07071992000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">I accept that
only a small percentage of the historic debt has been written off,
which we welcome. However, we are concerned that the real reason for
that is that the collection of large sums of money has been quietly
dropped, because it is too difficult or too expensive to pursue. In
England and Wales, for example, debts of &#163;760 million are
currently not being pursued, because they are more than six years old
and therefore cannot be subject to a liability order in the courts. We
need to know what CMEC will do to ensure that more of the money is
collected.</div>
					<a name="07071992000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the
commission decides not to take action to recover the debt, the parent
with care needs to be told that the debt is going to be written off. At
the moment, many constituents who come to us about the fact that the
CSA is not bothering to recover debt have not been told. If a decision
is taken that a debt will not be collected because it is too difficult,
we would like the parent with care to be informed. More than that, if
it can be proved that it is the fault of the CSA or CMEC that the debt
has not been pursued, some form of compensation should be paid to the
parent with care to ensure that account is taken of that non-recovery.
In the evidence-taking session on Tuesday, we heard what people had to
say about the level of child poverty and why it is important that the
money should be paid. If there is to be a write-off, it should come
with compensation paid by
CMEC.</div>
					<a name="07071992000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">The debt
recovery problems that the CSA has encountered are listed in the 2006
NAO report on the agency: inability to list all non-resident parents
who have accrued debt either in the CSCS, the original computer system,
or CS2, the new one; inability to mark as high-risk those cases with a
history of high enforcement action; inability of CSA accounting systems
to identify the debtors with the largest debts or the most persistent
offenders; and the fact that the CSA&#146;s enforcement directorate
dealt with only 19,000 of the 247,000 cases of non-compliance or
partial compliance in the UK, which is only 7 per cent. of the
total.</div>
					<a name="07071992000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although I
welcome a new start and a new organisation with tougher enforcement
powers, we want a commitment that those enforcement powers will be used
to ensure that the children who have been left behind and have not had
the start in life that they were guaranteed get what they deserve.
Considering the CSA&#146;s powers, if debt is written off, it is
CMEC&#146;s responsibility to pay
compensation.</div>

Selous:
						</b> There is very little in the comments of the hon.
Member for Rochdale&#151;indeed, nothing at all&#151;with which I
disagree. There is huge concern about debt among the groups watching
from the outside as we set up CMEC. There is also concern, although I
hope that it is ill-placed, that the Government might seek to move on
from historic debt and focus just on obtaining accurate maintenance
week by week&#151;after all, that is the specific objective of clause
2&#151;without dealing properly with historic debt. It is vital that
we guard against
that.</div>
					<a name="07071992000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">One Parent
Families&#146; brief to all Committee members says that the group is
extremely concerned about the inherited historic debt and feels that
the Bill does not give the issue the attention that it deserves. The
group is right to say so. My information, as I said in my earlier
intervention on the Minister, is that the situation is worsening as we
speak and that debt is growing by &#163;20 million a month, while the
agency is managing to bring in only some &#163;7 million. The total
debt is increasing as we speak by &#163;14 million net a month. If he
can give us more up-to-date figures, I look forward to receiving them.
In July 2006, 35 per cent. of arrears were being collected, and that
percentage decreased in December to 33 per cent. Again, if there is a
more up-to-date figure&#151;I do not suppose that the July 2007
figures are available yet&#151;and the Minister can reassure us, I
should be grateful.</div>
					<a name="07071992000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Rochdale
has cited the NAO&#146;s excellent report of 30 June 2006,
&#147;Child Support Agency: Implementation of the Child Support
Reforms&#148;. I shall not repeat everything he said, but it is a
thorough document. It is alarming to read the relevant information in
detail. On pages 64 and 65, we learn that there is</div>
					<a name="07071992000382"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;no facility to identify that
previous enforcement action has been taken and that the case may
initially represent a higher risk of
non-compliance.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07071992000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">We do
not know whether individual cases have involved debt. We have been told
that debt accumulates not only after the liability has been given, but
while assessments are calculated. There is currently no facility to
identify the largest debtors or the most persistent offenders,
and&#151;this is something that we might come on to later&#151;64
per cent. of cases where a liability order was sought were
inaccurate.</div>
					<a name="07071992000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">Very
serious concerns have been raised on the issue of debt. Why is it so
important to have a really full and accurate report on debt in the
annual report to the Secretary of State in clause 9, which is the
subject of amendment No. 12? There are a number of reasons. Failure to
collect debt is fundamentally unfair to those who pay. It obviously
robs children and parents with care of money that is rightfully theirs,
and it brings the credibility of the agency into disrepute. Good debt
collection, on the other hand, gets the money through to the children
who need it, and sends a very powerful deterrent message to those
thinking of skipping their responsibilities to their children. I have
always said to parents with care who have come to see my in my
constituency surgeries: &#147;Don&#146;t worry. That debt will not
be washed away. It is a lifetime liability, and is there. The
Department will do all that it can to get it back for you.&#148; I
want to be able to go on saying that to my constituents with a fair
degree of reassurance.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column116" />Column number: 116</div>
					<a name="07071992000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">I end briefly with a
constituency story. A lady came to see me, whom I took to see the
Minister himself in days gone by such was the difficulty of her case.
She was owed about &#163;40,000&#151;a considerable sum. She told
me that because maintenance had not been paid week by week, she had had
to raid a small legacy left by her mother for her children in order to
buy shoes for her children for the start of the school term. That is an
individual example of the sort of thing that we are talking about when
the money is not paid. As the hon. Member for Rochdale and I have said,
a generation of children has gone through childhood without that money.
That money needs to be collected to give those children a chance,
perhaps in their 20s or 30s, to get something back that they did not
have when they were younger. There are real concerns, and we definitely
want to see information as a requirement of the Bill in clause
9.</div>
					<a name="07071992000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07071992000448"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:
						</b> There is, of course, no denying that the
situation in respect of debt is one of the big issues and problems
within the agency. It is important to be aware that the debt that has
accumulated within the agency began to do so from day one, at the
absolute start of its operation way back in the 1990s, and it has
continued to grow pretty much remorselessly throughout the life of the
existing agency.</div>
					<a name="07071992000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do
not want to get away from the fact that before we berate the agency for
its shortcomings and its performance on debt, ultimately, the debt has
arisen because of the lack of co-operation of non-resident parents, who
simply have not faced up to their responsibility. We are asking the
agency, and its successor bodies, to do a difficult job, in going after
non-resident parents, some of whom will go to the most extraordinary
lengths to evade their responsibilities. That is ultimately where the
fault of the situation lies. Having said that, of course the agency
needs to perform better in its efforts to collect debt, and we must
ensure that when CMEC comes into operation, it will have all the right
powers at its disposal to continue the essential task of going after
the debt that is owed. Primarily, we want to see the debt chased that
is owed to parents with care, but a chunk of it is owed to the taxpayer
and the Secretary of State.</div>
					<a name="07071992000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">Far from being overlooked, the
issue of debt is very important to us, and I draw the attention of the
hon. Member for Rochdale and that of the Committee to the initiatives
that we have taken in respect of improving debt recovery within the
context of the operational improvement plan. It is early days, as I
have said about other aspects of the plan, but there are already some
promising
signs.</div>
				
					<a name="07071992000395"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2
pm</div>
					<a name="07071992000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
introduced new powers and recruited the assistance of private debt
collection agencies to go after some of the debt that was proving
difficult for the agency to collect. They have only just begun that
work but have already pulled in &#163;3 million of outstanding debt.
Interestingly, merely sending letters to some non-resident parents,
informing them that we were about to pass their debt to a private
collection agency, produced &#163;1 million in payments immediately,
which was a promising start.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column117" />Column number: 117</div>
					<a name="07071992000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have also recently introduced
a new power enabling staff of the agency to collect debt payments over
the phone. While they are in conversation with a non-resident parent
who is non-compliant, they can put the debt payment on the
parent&#146;s debit or credit card. That is an important facility.
The change was quite simple but has proved extremely effective. It has
only just come in, but &#163;7.5 million has already been collected
by that method. Things are already happening to help us go after the
debt.</div>
					<a name="07071992000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">The commission
of course will have a range of new powers to pursue debt and manage it
more effectively. It will acquire powers to negotiate debt settlements,
which in some cases are the quickest and most effective way of
resolving outstanding debt problems, on the understanding that they
will be accepted only with the consent of the non-resident parent. The
commission will also acquire powers to recover arrears from the estates
of deceased non-resident
parents.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07071992000449"></a>Andrew
Selous:
						</b> The Minister may have meant that debt settlements
will be accepted only with the permission of the parent with care, not
that of the non-resident
parent.</div>
					<a name="07071992000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07071992000450"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:
						</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his
correction. The commission will also acquire the power to sell debt
should it wish to do so.</div>
					<a name="07071992000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Gentleman was right to
stress the importance of pursuing historic debt and the message that it
sends to non-resident parents who are not compliant or considering not
complying. He is also right that the commission will need to be able to
demonstrate that it is doing the best possible job of chasing debt. The
only point of disagreement is whether that requirement needs to be
placed in the Bill, as he suggests. I argue that the responsibility on
CMEC to demonstrate what it is doing in respect of debt is an adequate
provision.</div>
					<a name="07071992000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment, although understandable given the legacy of the Child
Support Agency, is not necessary because the Bill already provides for
examination of the commission&#146;s performance on debt. Clause 9
requires the commission to report on its performance across all its
business activities, including action taken on historic debt. It also
specifically requires the commission to report on its performance in
exercising its functions &#147;effectively and efficiently&#148;.
That, too, includes its performance on historic
debt.</div>
					<a name="07071992000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is
all supported by schedule 1, which requires the
commission to have a committee of non-executive board members, which
must act as an audit committee. That will ensure that the
commission&#146;s financial controls are of a sufficiently high
standard. Furthermore, as an Executive non-departmental public body,
the commission must have its annual accounts audited by the Comptroller
and Auditor General, who in turn has a statutory responsibility to
report the results of that audit to Parliament. The accounting and
disclosure requirements of the annual report and details on accounts
for Executive non-departmental bodies are set out in detail in the
financial reporting manual published by the
Treasury.</div>
					<a name="07071992000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I have
outlined, the Bill provides a comprehensive framework
for reporting on the commission&#146;s performance in the
all-important area of debt, so I urge the hon. Member for Rochdale to
withdraw the amendment.</div>

Rowen:
						</b> Once more, there are a number of important points
in this string of amendments that both my party and the Conservative
Front Benchers wish to pursue. The first picks up on the same point
that we were debating just now&#151;the issue of historic debt and
what to do about it. I remind the Minister of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column119" />Column number: 119</div>the evidence on the historic debt position that was given by Janet
Allbeson on Tuesday. She said that it would be a tough job to collect
it, because a lot of historic debt is pretty flaky. As well as
processing new applications, one of the huge exercises that the
transition will entail will be bringing historic debt cases up to date
before a case is transferred. That will involve a lot of extra work. It
gives some indication of the tasks that the commission will face in
development.</div>
					<a name="07071992000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
we have already debated historic debt, I want to focus on amendment No.
29. With your permission, Mr. Chope, I should like to press
it to a vote. Its purpose is one that was referred to in the evidence
on Tuesday. It would ensure that the commission would have regard to
the welfare of any children who are likely to be affected by its
decisions. Much of our debate has been about the effect of the
CSA&#146;s failure to collect maintenance payments on a generation of
children. Given that we are making a new start, it is vital that the
Bill explicitly includes a commitment to ensuring that non-resident
parents pay their whack, so that child poverty is tackled. Things
should not continue to be as they were in the past, which rather
obscured some of the work of the CSA in reducing public expenditure
claims.</div>
					<a name="07071992000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">I know that
the Bill&#146;s provisions will help to reduce child poverty.
However, we need to make it clear that that objective is something that
we wish to pursue, and that we seek to recognise the clear relationship
between child poverty and maintenance. The figures in the Harker report
show that 42 per cent. of children in poverty are children who live in
lone-parent families. Only 32 per cent. of lone parents receive child
maintenance. The Government have so far missed their target of halving
child
poverty.</div>

Members will accept that child poverty has been one of the key factors
affecting the welfare of many of the children concerned, and that is a
direct result of the CSA&#146;s failure to ensure that maintenance
payments are made. One can say that the causes are wider, but child
poverty is clearly an issue and we need to deal with it. The Government
have already missed their target of halving child poverty by 2010, and

						</b> Yes, but as I explained, even if incremental moves
are made towards a target for the future, I do not expect that there
will be a sudden decrease in child poverty in the next three years,
unless something dramatic happens and the Prime Minister suddenly
announces a huge increase in expenditure for that. The fact is that the
number of children living in poverty has increased in the past 12
months, so rather than moving forward on that, the Government are
moving backwards, and that is an important point. It is important that
we are clear about what some of CMEC&#146;s key objectives are, and
that dealing with the welfare of the child, in this case by ensuring
that maintenance is paid, is its prime purpose and should be on the
face of the
Bill.</div>

Minister said, I have just looked through clause 9 and cannot see the
word debt in it, and, of course, it does not appear within clause 2. I
cling to the view that, when push comes to shove, what is on the face
of the Bill will dictate the priorities, aims and objectives of a
Government agency or non-departmental public body, and that will be the
case with CMEC. Those things matter. I heard the Minister&#146;s
reassurances on debt, but I would be more reassured if I could see
those in plain ink in the
Bill.</div>

would not allow me to repeat all of that, Mr. Chope, but I
shall give a brief summary, because we are starting a new organisation

hear the Minister&#146;s colleague in the other place say that.
However, I cling to the view that unless there is a core, operational
shift in the CSA&#146;s culture in respect of how it will treat
separated families in the round, CMEC will not achieve the financial
objectives that we want it to achieve. There is a human side to what it

Australia again, as I went there in the last Parliament with the Select

separated parents, because it has the clear, simple view that where
such support is safe and appropriate&#151;those are vital

of emotional support and in the lack of time that parents give to
one-to-one investment in their children, which can be every bit as
damaging as the lack of money provided week by week. I will not say any

						</b> I had not intended to speak on this group of
amendments, but I have some worries about amendment No. 72, which the
hon. Gentleman has explained. The amendment goes to the heart of CMEC,
and whether CMEC can be both an adviser and an enforcer is something
that we took up in our evidence session. I agree with much of what he
said about the need for advice and support for children outwith
finance, but it worries me to link the two so
closely.</div>

Selous:
						</b> I can reassure the hon. Gentleman. If he has had a
chance to look through the later amendments, he will see that they
reword some clauses in respect of the advice given in clause 5. My
amendments say not that the commission must provide the advice, but
that the advice must be provided&#151;I have turned it from active to
passive. I recognise the issues that the hon. Gentleman is rightly
raising about whether CMEC would be the right body to take such action.
All I am saying is that such important action needs to be taken, but
not necessarily by
CMEC.</div>
					<a name="07071992000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07071992000466"></a>Mr.
Weir:
						</b> I accept the hon. Gentleman&#146;s argument and
agree with him. Before entering the House, I was a solicitor. I dealt
with family law and, even for a solicitor, it is one of the most
difficult areas of law with which to be involved. In Scots law&#151;I
am sure that this is the case in England&#151;finance and other
issues are kept deliberately apart. All too often, a man would say,
&#147;I&#146;m paying for them, so I want to have contact with
them,&#148; whether or not he had any real interest in having contact
with the children. He might suddenly want contact years after the
divorce or separation, when he had finally been caught by the CSA. That
is not necessarily in the best interests of the
children.</div>
					<a name="07071992000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">Alternatively,
the woman might say, &#147;Well, he is not paying for them so I shall
not let him have contact.&#148; Again, that is wrong, because the
child often needs contact with the parent. We must keep such matters
apart. I agree with the hon. Gentleman: if there is a proposal for a
separate organisation to give advice and assistance in other areas, I
am happy to support it, but CMEC is not the way to do it. I asked that
question in the evidence-taking session with Janet Allbeson.</div>
					<a name="07071992000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am concerned about how CMEC
can advise both parties in a break-up, because there is an inherent
conflict of interest. Whether or not the parent with care needs advice
on their rights or what they should be going for, the non-resident
parent also needs advice, but that is not covered properly
here.</div>

							<a name="07071992000467"></a>Andrew
Selous:
						</b> I agree with the hon. Gentleman that there should
not be linkage between maintenance and contact. Some people have called
for that, but I am 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column123" />Column number: 123</div>absolutely not calling for it, because the issues are separate. Contact
is rightly dealt with by the courts, and I do not want to link the two
things. If the hon. Gentleman goes to the front page of the Australian
CSA website, he will see that what I am talking about is right at the
heart of what the Australian CSA does as part of an Australian
Government Department. That site contains signposted information,
support and advice that is not part of the legal system. People can
ignore that if they want to, and it is not forced on anyone. So there
is a model of a CSA that has a much better reputation than ours and it
gives that information. We should be looking at
that.</div>

but I wanted to make that
point.</div>
					<a name="07071992000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">Briefly, on
amendment No. 78 and the use of &#147;appropriate&#148; in relation
to minutes of agreement, I am also concerned that&#151;as I
understood it as we took evidence&#151;it was anticipated that
allowing couples to enter into a minute of agreement would allow a
situation to be addressed where, for example, one party would make over
the house or some other assets in lieu of regular child maintenance.
Just having a template and putting in the appropriate percentage would
undermine that, so we have to be careful. I appreciate that the detail
is not here, because we do not have the regulations, but will the
regulations specify an appropriate allowance to allow that sort of
thing to be done, so that there will not be, as has often been the case
with the CSA, a capital assessment and a capital agreement, perhaps in
lieu of child maintenance, that may subsequently be overturned? That
has caused a great many problems within
couples.</div>

							<a name="07071992000469"></a>Mr.

						</b> We have had an interesting debate on a lengthy
group of amendments.</div>
					<a name="07071992000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall begin with amendment No. 29, tabled by the hon. Member for
Rochdale, who wants us to incorporate a new subsection (4) in clause 2.
Everything that he seeks to achieve&#151;I understand why he wants to
do it&#151;is wholly covered by clause 1, which could not state more
clearly the commission&#146;s overriding objective, namely to
maximise the number of children for whom effective maintenance
arrangements are in place. Surely, that is at the heart of supporting
children&#146;s welfare and addressing the challenge of further
reducing child poverty. The hon. Gentleman&#146;s proposal only
elaborates on something that was already adequately contained in the
clause as drafted, and I am therefore not convinced that it is
necessary.</div>
					<a name="07071992000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn now
to the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire,
who is a great fan of the Australian system because he keeps citing it.
However, that system is unpopular with the Australian public. I do not
think that, in that sense, it claims any greater virtue than our
equally troubled CSA. He will know that, partly as a result of its
unpopularity, it, too, is undergoing massive reform with a view to the
introduction of a new child support system in Australia&#151;funnily
enough in
2008.</div>

points that the hon. Gentleman made about the Australian system, I am
aware that the information sheets to which he has referred are
available on its website&#151;it is possible to download them,
although I could not do it. However, I know what the sheets say: they
provide introductory information about the issues that they
cover&#151;I agree that they cover a copious range of related
issues&#151;and then move on to signpost people towards family
relationship centres, which are not part of the Australian
agency.</div>

					<a name="07071992000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman seeks to load additional areas of responsibility on to CMEC.
That concerns me because we are trying to set up an effective working
child maintenance system, and we know from past experience that that is
a difficult thing to achieve. I am reluctant to load additional
functions on to the organisation when we know that its existing core
function is already difficult. It is not as though the Government are
not trying to do some of the things mentioned in the papers drawn from
the Australian CSA&#146;s website, with which the hon. Gentleman is
familiar. We are seeking to provide exactly that support to families
who are going through difficult times. However, such work is not being
done by the agency or by the Department for Work and Pensions, but by
the Department for Children, Schools and Families. What the hon.
Gentleman wants to happen will come about in any
event.</div>

							<a name="07071992000472"></a>Andrew
Selous:
						</b> I continue to urge the Minister to see that line
of argument not as imposing an extra burden on CMEC, but as something
that will be fundamental in helping it to achieve its objectives in the
Bill. I am relaxed about who provides that and how it works
cross-departmentally. I want it to be made available and out there for
people to use.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07071992000473"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:
						</b> That is the point I am trying to make. If the
hon. Gentleman studies the proposals that are being worked on by
colleagues in the Department for Children, Schools and Families, he
will see the emergence of the kind of support he wants. It is a
cross-Government strategy on family policy. It will cover services that
support families directly and those that deal with family dysfunction
and family breakdown. The aim of the strategy is to ensure that policy
across Government is consistent and works in children&#146;s best
interests. What the hon. Gentleman seeks is there, but is it set out
differently from the Australian
measure.</div>
					<a name="07071992000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 24, 25, 56 and 72 collectively propose two additions to the main
objective. The first requires conditions of support for parents who
meet their financial and emotional responsibilities, and has regard,
too, for the welfare of children. The second, which we touched on in a
previous debate, requires the commission to secure the payment of any
arrears.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column125" />Column number: 125</div>
					<a name="07071992000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill already requires the
commission to support parents who meet their
financial obligations. The existing objective is to maximise the number
of effective arrangements. Those are arrangements that are working,
where money is flowing and in which parents meet their financial
responsibilities. To pursue that objective, clause 5 places a
requirement on the commission to provide parents with the information
and support that they need to put such arrangements in place.</div>
					<a name="07071992000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">The issues of
emotional support and the welfare of the child are less
straightforward, but the legislation will require the commission, like
the agency before it, to have regard to the welfare of the child when
taking discretionary decisions within the statutory maintenance system.
However, we do not want to impose a general requirement on the
commission to take account of the overall welfare of the child, or to
support parents in providing both financial and emotional support. The
commission&#146;s primary objective and role is to ensure that
effective financial arrangements for the support of children are
reached. Other organisations are better placed to deal with emotional
needs, which will vary from case to case and from family to family.
Those will be backed up by the initiatives that are being taken across
Government, as I have already explained. In helping parents to agree
their financial responsibilities, the commission will provide greater
financial stability for the household in which the child lives. That
can only help resolve emotional matters.</div>
					<a name="07071992000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the issues raised in
amendment No. 85 and the importance of the phrase &#147;appropriate
voluntary arrangements&#148;, I can provide complete reassurance to
the Committee that the commission must already take account of the
wishes of one or both parents. The objectives require the commission to
maximise effective maintenance arrangements. The subsidiary objectives
require the commission to encourage and support the making of
appropriate voluntary arrangements. I was relieved to hear the hon.
Member for South-West Bedfordshire say that he did not wish to remove
the word &#147;appropriate&#148;, because it serves a critical
purpose in the clause, as he rightly
acknowledged.</div>
					<a name="07071992000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
words &#147;effective&#148; and &#147;appropriate&#148; are
important. &#147;Effective&#148;, as I have already mentioned,
means an arrangement that works. &#147;Appropriate&#148; means an
arrangement that is suitable to the circumstances of the parents in
question; it is the right type of arrangement, at the right level, and
it is sustainable. If the commission attempted to encourage voluntary
arrangements against the wishes of one or both parents, it would end up
failing to achieve its objectives. The arrangement would be unlikely to
work if it was not what both parents wanted.</div>
					<a name="07071992000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the Committee is concerned
that parents will be forced into unfair voluntary arrangements, I would
like to reassure it that an application can be made to the statutory
maintenance service at any point by either parent. That would override
any existing voluntary arrangement.</div>
					<a name="07071992000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07071992000474"></a>Mr.
Weir:
						</b> I am slightly concerned about that. I accept what
the Minister is saying, but I understood that by allowing voluntary
arrangements, an allowance other than the weekly maintenance would be
paid. Will 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column126" />Column number: 126</div>that not be undermined if either party can take the matter to CMEC after
a voluntary agreement has been entered
into?</div>
					<a name="07071992000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07071992000475"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:
						</b> No. If a voluntary agreement breaks down, there
is clearly a need for referral to the statutory scheme, because
maintenance has ceased to flow and our overriding objective is the
welfare of children. If a voluntary agreement has broken down because
either party is not honouring it&#151;the most likely scenario is
that the non-resident parent ceases to pay maintenance&#151;the only
way to get payment flowing again, which is what is important in the
interests of the child, might be to bring the statutory system to bear
on the
case.</div>
					<a name="07071992000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07071992000476"></a>Mr.
Weir:
						</b> That is not the point. Some couples might decide to
have a clean break and transfer a large capital sum from one to the
other in lieu of weekly or monthly maintenance in a voluntary
agreement. Unless that agreement can be written in stone once the
capital has been transferred, there is a serious problem because one
party may later decide to go to CMEC to ask for maintenance, and
disregard the earlier capital transfer. That was a problem with the CSA
and I understood that the voluntary agreements were designed partly to
get round that problem.</div>
					<a name="07071992000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07071992000477"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:
						</b> The switch to voluntary arrangements has a
number of drivers behind it. Many parents are able to come to a
voluntary arrangement and cheerfully do so. Voluntary arrangements work
well on the whole and often endure better than other arrangements, so
we obviously want to encourage separating couples to make them. The
whole reason for withdrawing the clause 6 obligation is to prevent
parents who are separating from being forced into the statutorily-based
arrangement when the parent with care of the child is on benefits,
because a voluntary arrangement might be within reach. That is
currently denied because of the existence of the clause 6 stipulation,
which needs to go. That will encourage people to move to voluntary
arrangements. I am simply saying that we cannot&#151;nobody
can&#151;prescribe what the nature of the voluntary agreements will
be; by definition, they will be arrived at between the two parties. In
future, if such an agreement breaks down, the parent with care ought to
have recourse to a system to put in place a flow of child maintenance.
In assessing whether that system is likely to be taken up, the content
of previous voluntary agreements will be a factor for
consideration.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07071992000497"></a>Mr.
Weir:
						</b> I should declare an interest at the outset. I am
non-practising solicitor, although I remain a member of the Law Society
of Scotland. When I was working as a solicitor before entering the
House, I dealt with family law. That experience drives me to try to
make procedures for separation relatively simple and quickly
enforceable. Enforceability is vital in any sort of
agreement.</div>
					<a name="07071992000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments are more or less identical, so I shall deal with them
together. They refer to a procedure in Scots law that could be useful
to those who are considering entering a voluntary agreement under the
Bill. I do not know whether such a procedure exists in the law of
England and Wales, so I shall confine my comments to the Scottish
situation. I have raised the issue on several occasions with the
Secretary of State and with his predecessor. I drew encouragement from
Lord McKenzie in our evidence session, when he confirmed that there was
nothing in the Bill to prevent the continued use of minutes of
agreement recorded in the Books of Council and Session. I think that
there is a problem relating to section 4 of the 1991 Act, but that is
the subject of a later
amendment.</div>
					<a name="07071992000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">Members
might recall that, in our evidence-taking session, there was a great
deal of discussion about the use of agreements between the parties.
Although I support the Government&#146;s proposals to allow parents
to enter an agreement between themselves, I am 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column128" />Column number: 128</div>concerned about how it will be done and about the advice and information
that will be given to those entering such agreements. From the
evidence, it seems clear that information will be given via the
internet, by telephone or perhaps in a face-to-face session. I raised
questions about how the agreements will be recorded and monitored, and
I was not particularly reassured by the answers that I received. I
appreciate that we are still waiting for regulations on the exact
nature of the agreements, but the Bill does not state even that any
such agreement should be in writing. I suggest that if they are not
reduced to writing, we will face disaster in
future.</div>
				
					<a name="07071992000398"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.45
pm</div>
					<a name="07071992000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">During a
previous debate, I was somewhat concerned by the
Minister&#146;s comments on minutes of agreement. Many minutes of
agreement may contain an offset of capital against regular income, and
I am not sure that that situation has yet been properly
addressed.</div>
					<a name="07071992000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">In her
evidence, Janet Allbeson noted that minutes of agreement could not be
enforced, but that is not quite the case; under the Scottish system,
they can be enforced. In essence, the system that operates in Scotland
allows any two parties to enter into an agreement, which can then be
recorded in the books of council and session, which is effectively part
of the public registers of Scotland. The original deed is retained by
the register, and an extract is issued with a guarantee that it is a
true copy of the original.</div>
					<a name="07071992000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">The register is typically used
to ensure that important documents are not lost. For instance, the
wills of deceased persons are recorded there. For our purposes,
however, it is often used to record agreements&#151;in particular,
agreements reached by separating or divorcing couples. Such agreements
can cover all aspects of the separation, and not only monetary matters.
For example, they can deal with capital and with access arrangements
for the children and the like.</div>
					<a name="07071992000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">The important additional factor
for present purposes is that, if an agreement includes a statement that
it may be recorded for execution, it will have the same effect as a
court decree. Therefore, if parties enter into an agreement and
register it and either party does not adhere to it, it can be enforced
without the need to obtain a court order&#151;or, for our purposes,
starting afresh by going to CMEC.</div>
					<a name="07071992000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister may remember that
concern was raised on Second Reading that if a voluntary agreement were
to break down the parties might have to go back to stage one by making
an application to CMEC. If they had entered into a registered minute of
agreement, that would not be necessary, as the agreement could be
enforced. Clearly, that will have immense benefits for parents with
care, who will undoubtedly wish to take prompt action if they are not
getting the money that had been promised.</div>
					<a name="07071992000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purpose of the amendments
is simply to make it clear to those who seek advice that there are
procedures other than using only the statutory CMEC procedures or
entering into a voluntary agreement of the type that CMEC suggests.
They can enter into a minute of agreement and register it, which has
the additional benefit that it can be enforced. If CMEC is to have a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column129" />Column number: 129</div>standard minute of agreement, there is nothing to
stop it including a declaration that it may be recorded for
preservation and execution; that would allow the agreements to be
executed without the need to go back to CMEC, or to court, if such
things fall apart.</div>
					<a name="070719110000001"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
note also that the books of council and session are already available
for use in other areas relating to children. I shall cite an example.
Under section 4(1) of the Children (Scotland) Act 1995, unmarried
parents can register an agreement that gives the father parental rights
in respect of the child. Under Scots law, as in England, a mother has
automatic parental rights but a father does not. The agreement is
simple&#151;I have an example&#151;and it can be recorded in the
books. It has binding force and gives parental rights to the
father.</div>
					<div class="hs_Para">There is precedent. The use of
minutes of agreement should at least be considered by CMEC, because if
agreements are to have any life, they must be easily enforced. If
agreements simply delay matters, with applications having to be made to
CMEC and the whole procedure having to be started again, the system
will fail.</div>
					<a name="07071992000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07071992000498"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:
						</b> We are straying again into Scottish law. In
replying to the debate, I shall keep a beady eye on my the
Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, my hon. Friend the
Member for Stirling, in case I stray from the truth.</div>
					<a name="07071992000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am grateful to the hon.
Member for Angus for moving the amendment, as he gives me the
opportunity to highlight the Government&#146;s interest in supporting
parents in agreeing suitable maintenance arrangements for their
children and the part that effective voluntary arrangements play in
that.</div>
					<a name="07071992000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman is concerned about how minutes of agreement, which are
available to parents in Scotland, will fit into the new system of child
maintenance, and it might help if I try to explain that. Minutes of
agreement are voluntary written agreements, entered into by both
parents, usually after they have received legal advice, and registered
in the books of council and session and therefore enforceable. The
equivalent in England and Wales are consent orders&#151;the court
makes an order that reflects a written maintenance agreement between
parents. Again, that is usually done after legal advice has been
given.</div>
					<a name="07071992000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under the
Child Support Act 1991, the minute of agreement or consent order can be
overturned in two contexts. First, if the parent with care claims
income-related benefit, any minute of agreement or consent order that
contains child maintenance is overturned, whether or not the parents
are content with that agreement. Secondly, where parents are not on
benefit, minutes of agreement or consent orders can be overturned after
12 months if one of them&#151;or, in Scotland, a child aged 12 or
more&#151;is not happy with the arrangement and applies to the CSA
for a maintenance calculation.</div>
					<a name="07071992000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill will rightly break the
link with the benefits system, so that consent orders or minutes of
agreement can continue for as long as both parents want them to, with
no interference from the statutory maintenance scheme. To be absolutely
clear, the commission will not overturn any minute of agreement unless
that is expressly desired by one or more of the parties.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column130" />Column number: 130</div>
					<a name="07071992000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 87 would give the
commission an additional subsidiary objective: to advise on existing
ways of creating, registering or enforcing voluntary arrangements,
particularly minutes of agreement in Scotland. Amendment No. 88 would
place a duty on the commission, as part of its information and guidance
function, to give parents information about how to create, register and
enforce such arrangements.</div>
					<a name="07071992000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">The commission&#146;s main
objective, as stated in the draft Bill, will be to maximise the number
of effective maintenance arrangements in place. Effective arrangements
are those that work and that are right for the parents in question. For
some parents, such an arrangement will need to be made through the
statutory scheme. For others, it will be a voluntary arrangement of
some kind&#151;a private agreement, a consent order or a minute of
agreement. Where parents can take responsibility for making their own
maintenance arrangement, we believe that that is the best way forward.
Arrangements reached by agreement can work very well and, where
appropriate, they are often highly successful in delivering maintenance
to children.</div>
					<a name="07071992000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">We want
the arrangements to continue, and it is right that parents should be
made aware of the range of options available to them for arranging
maintenance and receiving general guidance on how to establish such
arrangements. We recognise that there are already systems that allow
parents to make their own maintenance arrangements outside the
statutory maintenance schemes. The amendment proposed by the hon.
Member for Angus refers to one such route&#151;minutes of agreement.
In England and Wales, parents can ask a court to make a written
maintenance agreement in a consent order, although that is usually done
on divorce, when other financial issues have to be settled.</div>
					<a name="07071992000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not clear as to the
purpose of the amendment, although I understand that the hon. Gentleman
has concerns about the position of minutes of agreement under the new
system. I hope that my comments have allayed them. If his purpose is to
ensure that parents will be made aware of the range of options
available to them, I can reassure him that that purpose is already
captured not only by the commission&#146;s main objective to maximise
the number of children with effective maintenance arrangements, but by
the provisions of clause 5, which makes it clear that the commission
must provide information and guidance to parents to help them to secure
effective maintenance arrangements. If that his intention, I hope that
he will agree to withdraw the amendment, as it is not
necessary.</div>
					<a name="07071992000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
if the intention of the amendment is to ensure that the commission
gives detailed information and advice as to how to create, register and
enforce a minute of agreement, I cannot agree that the commission
should be statutorily obliged to provide such a service. Minutes of
agreement and consent orders are not restricted solely to matters of
child maintenance. They may deal with a range of financial issues on
divorce or separation. It would not be right to involve the commission
directly in wider issues of family law, or to require it to provide
detailed guidance on what could be highly technical matters that may
need to take account of a range of financial issues and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column131" />Column number: 131</div>other complex individual circumstances. For that reason, I hope that the
hon. Gentleman will withdraw his
amendment.</div>

available. If that is to be made clear, I beg to ask leave to withdraw

					<a name="07071992000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is the last amendment to clause 2 that we will debate this afternoon.
It brings us back to an issue that was raised by my hon. Friend the
Member for Weston-super-Mare in a number of interventions on the
Secretary of State on Second Reading. I am aware that there are
different views on the subject, but I still think that it merits a
little more debate. My intention in moving the amendment is simply to
ensure that we have a system that
works.</div>
					<a name="07071992000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
does not know, and I do not know, what the take-up for private

is</div>

objective of the CMEC scheme is purely to support that. The whole

we all hope that they will work.</div>
					<a name="07071992000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given all the difficulties that
we debated this morning, if parents with care are to contemplate going
down the voluntary route without the protection of the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column132" />Column number: 132</div>agency for enforcement, they need to have some conviction that the
agreement that they enter into will be worth the paper that it is
written on and will have some weight behind it. I know that the
Minister will respond shortly that a voluntary arrangement is just
that, that it is not the business of CMEC to get involved and that it
has enough on its plate sorting out the historic debt, which we
have debated, and ensuring that the maintenance arrangements that it is
responsible for under subsection 2(b) are working. That is a perfectly

pm</div>
					<a name="07071992000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">My contention,
however, is that if members of the public make their own voluntary
arrangements, which then break down, they will arrive at the door of
CMEC requiring it to do a lot more work than purely
enforcing the agreement. If they come out of a voluntary agreement,
they arrive at CMEC&#146;s door needing advice, information, a
calculation, an assessment and so on, and all of that needs to be set
up. If the voluntary private agreement breaks down, there is a lot of
extra work, which the Minister is trying to discourage&#151;or
certainly not trying to
encourage.</div>
					<a name="07071992000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am trying
to help the Minister to get where he wants to be, with a lot of
voluntary arrangements that work, that people are happy with and that
parents with care have some confidence can endure. His counter-argument
will be that it is not up to CMEC to enforce agreements and parents
have the option of coming into the full statutory scheme. However, that
will create a lot more work than my proposal would, which intends
merely to use the enforcement part of CMEC to oversee voluntary
arrangements.</div>
					<a name="07071992000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want
to get to the place that the Minister wants to get to. I am just not
entirely convinced that the big stick of saying, &#147;If it
doesn&#146;t work, you will be brought kicking and screaming into the
CMEC apparatus,&#148; is necessarily going to be enough. None of us
knows what the reaction of the public will
be.</div>

Hesford:
						</b> If the hon. Gentleman&#146;s scheme comes into
force and the hitherto voluntary agreements come into the CMEC system
for enforcement, such agreements would cease to be voluntary. They
would be coming for enforcement only because they had ceased to be
agreements and had broken down, so how can that
work?</div>

						</b> That is a lawyer&#146;s argument in terms of its
strict divisions. We are lucky to have a number of lawyers on the
Committee and I shall be interested in what they say, but I am one of
those men who do not think that lawyers always have a monopoly of
wisdom on every
subject.</div>
					<a name="07071992000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
creating a Bill and have flexibility: we have blank pieces of paper
that we can fill in. I want to tease out from the
Minister whether it is possible for a residual enforcement power to be
available. The hon. Member for Wirral, West is right that that would
change the nature of the agreement and I accept that it would no longer
be voluntary. However, my proposal does not go all the way to being the
complete bells-and-whistles CMEC arrangement that the Minister is
trying to discourage. It would not be the cause of a lot more work and
expense for CMEC.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column133" />Column number: 133</div>
					<a name="07071992000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that the Minister will
accept the spirit of the amendment. He might not agree with it, but I
am trying to help him to get to the place where he wants to be. There
is a genuine divergence of view out there. If he can convince me that
there is an effective way to do it, I will be happy to withdraw the

							<a name="07071992000518"></a>Paul
Rowen:
						</b> As the previous debate on the amendment of the hon.
Member for Angus shows, there is concern about what will happen if one
of the parents reneges on the agreement when the number of voluntary
agreements increases. We are all seeking assurance from the Minister
that there will not be a situation in which the parent with care is
left waiting for years before their case is resolved, as with some
cases at the moment.</div>
					<a name="07071992000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
come back to the principal concern of the Bill, which is the care and
maintenance of the child. That must be central to everything that we do
and appropriate administrative arrangements must be in place so that if
a voluntary agreement breaks down, it can be speedily resolved. I hope
that the Minister will say to us that if the amendment is withdrawn, he
will come forward with regulations and, as one of the later amendments
seeks to do, set clear time scales to ensure that cases are dealt with
quickly. We have already lost a generation of children who have not had
the care and maintenance that they deserve, and we want to ensure with
CMEC that that does not happen; that it is clearly explained to people
what will happen if a voluntary arrangement breaks down; and that there
are clear targets to ensure that if CMEC&#146;s statutory scheme is
applied, it will be dealt with as a priority, and not be put on the
back burner because CMEC has too big a case load to deal with its
statutory
cases.</div>
					<a name="07071992000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07071992000519"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:
						</b> I reassure hon. Members that the commission must
support parents in achieving the best arrangements for them, in order
to meet the objective of ensuring that the maximum number of effective
maintenance arrangements are in place. We know that for some parents
who have a voluntary arrangement, that is the best possible solution,
particularly in situations where communication between parents is good,
and there is no dispute over the need for continuing support.</div>
					<a name="07071992000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many parents will not fall into
that category at the outset, at least, and they need a legally
enforceable arrangement to ensure that maintenance flows to their
children. In principle, it is important to draw a distinction between
maintenance agreements that parents themselves agree and maintain, and
those that require state involvement. The commission will support
parents in creating voluntary agreements, whenever circumstances make
that appropriate, and will offer them support to maintain those
agreements. We know that there are at least 500,000 voluntary
arrangements already in place, and that both compliance levels and the
amounts of awards are generally higher than where there is recourse to
arrangements made by the state.</div>
					<a name="07071992000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, if a voluntary
arrangement breaks down irretrievably, the best approach is to support
the parents into the statutory scheme to secure an ongoing liability. I
do not think that it would be appropriate 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column134" />Column number: 134</div>or helpful for the commission, in effect, to extend its reach over every
voluntary arrangement in place now, or created in future. I fail to see
how that supports wider Government objectives to encourage parental
responsibility. I also fail to see how it could make the maintenance
system, and the choices therein, comprehensible to many of our more
vulnerable constituents.</div>
					<a name="07071992000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">On a practical level, I also
find it difficult to see how the commission could enforce the arrears,
for example, that arise out of voluntary arrangements. The situation
that the hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire seeks with his
amendment to put CMEC into, is an odd one. Blurring the distinction
between the role of the agency in respect of statutory agreements, and
its powers in relation to those that are voluntary&#151;that is an
important word&#151;would imply that CMEC&#146;s enforcement powers
lie behind arrangements which CMEC has had no part whatever in
determining. It would also be odd&#151;and I think that he would
agree with me if he reflects on it&#151;to put CMEC in a situation
where it has to come in as the enforcer of arrangements which it has no
responsibility for bringing about in the first place. It would have to
attempt to understand and unravel those arrangements in order to apply
enforcement. He would have it doing that in an unlimited number of
cases. It would not be reasonable to expect the commission to be the
enforcer of a huge array of bewilderingly different, and often quite
complex, arrangements.</div>
					<a name="07071992000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although we would like parents
to make voluntary arrangements, with an understanding of what they
would be eligible for under a statutory scheme, parents will be able to
come to their own detailed agreements. Forthcoming qualitative research
shows that parents often agree on an array of payment frequencies and
amounts to fit in with their individual
circumstances.</div>
					<a name="07071992000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
example, the parent may agree that payments need not be made during the
school holidays while the child is staying with the non-resident
parent. Also, arrangements can sometimes be made up of a lower regular
cash payment, which is supplemented by periodical in-kind payments,
such as the payment of utility bills or school uniform
purchases.</div>
					<a name="07071992000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
that type of flexibility can be good for families, it would be
difficult for the commission to apply its enforcement powers reliably
and accurately to any voluntary arrangement of that nature. That is
because it would require the commission to work out what payments had
been made, whether records had been kept and on what basis, and whether
arrears had only accrued because of a major change in circumstances
that the voluntary agreement had not taken account of, but which the
commission would need to. The hon. Gentleman is asking for an
impossible job to be done. On an ongoing basis, it would also be
difficult to vary, review or uprate those types of arrangement. Again,
it would require the commission to invest a huge amount of resource and
effort in working out the basis on which such payments had been agreed.
For those practical reasons alone, I hope that he will ask leave to
withdraw his
amendment.</div>

CMEC&#146;s enforcement will have to be a lot better than the
CSA&#146;s has been. There are massive enforcement clauses, which we
are coming to, but the Minister&#146;s presumption will only work and
there will only be an increase in voluntary arrangements if parents
know that the CMEC scheme has some teeth and will be applied
meaningfully. On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

Commission is accepted, or</div>

the Commission has exercised its power to write off arrears in
accordance with section 41E of the Child Support Act 1991, as inserted
by section 31 of this
Act.&#146;.</div>
					<a name="07071992000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause deals with some of the general functions of the commission. The
amendment seeks to ensure that something is set up and included in the
Bill to deal with payment of compensation where there is a clear case
of maladministration or where, as I mentioned earlier, the commission
has exercised its power to write off arrears, particularly, as has been
mentioned earlier, in the case of past debt.</div>
					<a name="07071992000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">Currently, the CSA, because it
is an arm of the Department for Work and Pensions, uses the
&#147;Guide to financial redress for maladministration&#148;, which
allows financial redress if certain criteria are fulfilled. Given that
CMEC will not be part of the Department, but will be an independent
body, can such a financial redress guide apply? If it will not apply,
what arrangements will the Minister put in place to ensure that clear
criteria are set out to allow, in certain agreed cases, for financial
redress?</div>
					<a name="07071992000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">At the
moment, the system operated in respect of the &#147;Guide to
financial redress for maladministration&#148; is not very good. I
refer the Minister to the independent case examiners&#146; annual
report 2006-07, which stated that
a</div>
					<a name="07071992000388"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;particular problem to
date has been the
Agency&#146;s&#148;&#151;</div>
					<a name="07071992000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">that
is, the
CSA&#146;s&#151;</div>
					<a name="07071992000389"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;failure
to identify the need for financial redress despite acknowledging its
maladministration. During the year, we identified 618 cases where the
question of financial loss or an advance payment of arrears arose.
Disappointingly, over 80% of these had not been considered for
financial redress when the Agency itself looked at the
complaint.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07071992000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is a
damning statement of the CSA&#146;s current operation. We are now
moving to the commission and I hope that the Minister will say that
proper procedures and arrangements will be put in place to ensure that,
when maladministration is demonstrated, a clear mechanism will be set
out whereby a parent can receive the payment in compensation.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column136" />Column number: 136</div>
					<a name="07071992000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister might say that the
second route that will be applied is that of the
parliamentary ombudsman. However, we all know that at present the
recommendations of the parliamentary ombudsman are not binding on the
CSA. They are only recommendations. Of the 618 cases that the case
examiners looked at, the CSA had not even considered the payment of
compensation in 80 per cent. of them. It is important to have a fresh
start. We are saying that the new agency will change what has happened
in the past. We must have an assurance or some mechanism to ensure that
compensation will be paid when maladministration has been
demonstrated.</div>

						</b> I should be grateful for the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s thoughts on how the application of maladministration
under the measure that he is proposing would be different from the
reaction that we have received from the Government to the verdict of
maladministration in respect of occupational pensions. That was a
source of considerable dispute on the Floor of the House yesterday
afternoon.</div>

Rowen:
						</b> As a member of the Public
Administration Committee, we discussed such matters this morning. We
agreed on behalf of all parties to write to all hon. Members to request
that they look clearly at the issue, as the debate demonstrated
yesterday, and at the principle that people have not been given proper
redress. It is important that, as a fresh start, we set out what will
happen. If something goes wrong, we will make it clear to the
commissioners what we expect them to do. Parents and children have a
clear right to expect
that.</div>
					<a name="07071992000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are having a
fresh start. We do not want to go back to the mess that has existed
with the CSA. I hope that the Minister will reassure us and, if he is
not willing to accept the amendment, that he will introduce regulations
that set out the position clearly. He will have to do that anyway,
because CMEC will not be part of the Department for Work and Pensions,
so in a sense the maladministration guide should not apply. We need a
clear statement from him, as do parents, about how maladministration
will be dealt
with.</div>
					<a name="07071992000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07071992000524"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:
						</b> Let me see whether I can reassure the hon.
Gentleman. In a similar way to the scheme that is currently operated by
the Department, the commission will administer a compensation scheme
for cases of maladministration. It will provide recompense when
commission error has an adverse effect on the lives of our customers.
That is standard practice for a non-departmental public body of that
type, and it can be administered by the commission as being incidental
to its functions, without the need for the specific provision that he
seeks.</div>
					<a name="07071992000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07071992000525"></a>Andrew
Selous:
						</b> Will the Minister say whether the payment will be
the level of compensation that the CSA currently pays, which is about
&#163;50 for the inefficient handling of a case? Are we talking about
the same sort of amounts or slightly
higher?</div>
					<a name="07071992000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07071992000526"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:
						</b> As the hon. Gentleman knows,
payments of the sort to which he has referred are made by the existing
agency. There are also special conciliatory payments, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column137" />Column number: 137</div>which can be much higher than that. I envisage that a range of payments
will be available under the existing scheme, but I would not like to
anticipate precisely what levels they will be at. The current scheme
will provide financial redress for maladministration by making payments
to remedy actual financial loss and exceptionally, as I have just said,
consolatory payments to acknowledge the personal impact of an error. It
is for those reasons that one cannot anticipate the levels, which will
often be case
specific.</div>
					<a name="07071992000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">Details of
this compensation scheme will be decided by the commission, albeit
within certain parameters set by the Secretary of State through the
financial memorandum and guidance powers, and subject to usual
Government accounting rules and principles. The commission will
also handle any cases of maladministration that occurred before the
transfer of functions from the Secretary of State to the commission on
behalf of the Secretary of State.</div>
					<a name="07071992000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have decided against seeking
a blanket power to write off debt that may appear to be unrecoverable.
We are, however, seeking a power in clause 31 to write off debt in very
limited, carefully specified circumstances. Those circumstances include
where a parent with care has asked for cessation of recovery of debt
and where it would be unfair or inappropriate to continue seeking the
recovery of debt&#151;for example, where a parent with care and a
non-resident parent are reconciled, and the parent with care requests
that CMEC does not recover the
debt.</div>
					<a name="07071992000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">We also propose
to write off debt where the non-resident parent is deceased and the
debt cannot be recovered from the estate. In most cases, the commission
will act in accordance with the wishes of the parent with care, and
compensation will therefore not be appropriate. Where the commission
accepts that there has been maladministration on a particular case,
compensation would be dealt with through the scheme, as I have just
outlined.</div>
					<a name="07071992000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07071992000527"></a>Paul
Rowen:
						</b> I am grateful to the Minister for that explanation.
Perhaps he will provide us with a note giving us an idea of the range
and how the scheme will
operate.</div>
					<a name="07071992000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07071992000528"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:
						</b> I think that I covered that in
response to an earlier intervention. It is difficult to quantify the
range when, as I have indicated, some of the settlements will be highly
case specific on assessments of injury to the party concerned.
Therefore I will not commit to specifying the payments, which cannot be
exemplified in the way in which the hon. Gentleman
seeks.</div>
					<a name="07071992000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">In conclusion,
the Department already operates a compensation scheme
for maladministration that is accepted by the ombudsman, and the
commission will operate a similar scheme. The commission will also be
responsible for administering complaints and compensation relating to
maladministration that occurred before it came into being. Furthermore,
where the commission uses its new power to write off debt, it will in
most cases be acting in accordance with the wishes of the parent with
care. I hope that that has reassured the hon. Gentleman and that he
will withdraw his amendment.</div>

required to publish a range of information to allow sufficient
scrutiny. The commission, like many other non-departmental public
bodies, such as the pensions regulator, is required to prepare, publish
and lay before Parliament annual reports and accounts each financial
year. The report must cover all the commission&#146;s activities,
but, in addition, we require the inclusion of four other matters:
first, the commission&#146;s strategic direction, including
information on how that direction is kept under review year by year;
secondly, the commission&#146;s objectives and targets, including
information on the steps that are being taken to meet them and the
extent to which they have been met; thirdly, the steps taken to monitor
the commission&#146;s performance in ensuring that its functions are

							<a name="07071992000537"></a>Paul
Rowen:
						</b> The purpose of the amendments is to expand on the
clause. I do not believe that they are controversial. They would make
it clear that there are two means by which child maintenance can be
paid: by voluntary means or by the statutory scheme. Although we
understand why the Government wish to promote the use of the voluntary
scheme&#151;if parents can come to an agreement about child
maintenance that is obviously the preferable means of agreeing a way
forward&#151;there are times when that is not the case. We want the
Bill to give equal weight and substance to the voluntary and the
statutory schemes.</div>
					<a name="07071992000262"></a><div class="hs_Para" style="text-align: left;">Many parents
find it impossible to reach a voluntary agreement because they end up
in very difficult relationships. For example, 35 per cent. of lone
parents experience violence in their relationship and in such
circumstances there is no way in which a voluntary scheme will work. As
we discussed, a voluntary arrangement is suitable only if both parties
agree to it. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column140" />Column number: 140</div>
					</div>
					<a name="07071992000263"></a><div class="hs_Para" style="text-align: left;">The
amendment would ensure that maintenance is promoted and that people are
made aware, through the information systems that will be set up, that
equal weight will be given to the voluntary and to the statutory
scheme. It is important to ensure that a parent in difficult
circumstances who has been subject to domestic violence is fully aware
of their statutory entitlement and of what CMEC can do to ensure that
that entitlement is
delivered.</div>
					<a name="07071992000264"></a><div class="hs_Para" style="text-align: left;">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07071992000538"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:
						</b> As the hon. Gentleman said, the intention behind
the amendment is for the commission to promote the importance of child
maintenance in an even-handed way, as he would see it, and allow
parents themselves to choose whether they prefer a voluntary or a
statutory arrangement. However, I would be extremely loth to lose the
important words &#147;taking responsibility&#148;, which are
clearly enshrined in the Bill as drafted. The amendment appears to be
based on a misunderstanding of what clause 4 intends to
do.</div>
					<a name="07071992000265"></a><div class="hs_Para" style="text-align: left;">The
clause places a duty on the commission to promote awareness among
parents of the importance of taking responsibility for the maintenance
of their children and securing maintenance in whatever way is most
appropriate. It therefore provides the commission with the power to run
campaigns to have a positive influence on both parents, emphasising the
importance of agreeing, establishing and maintaining effective
maintenance arrangements.</div>
					<a name="07071992000266"></a><div class="hs_Para" style="text-align: left;">However, the
clause does not apply only in relation to voluntary maintenance
arrangements. The purpose of the wording that the amendment would
remove is simply to recognise that without compulsion the impetus for
initiating the maintenance arrangement, whether through an application
to the commission or by making a voluntary agreement, will always lie
with at least one of the parents rather than with the state. Any
promotion or awareness-raising activity needs to reflect that. For that
reason, the amendment is superfluous, as the wording of clause 4(b)
does not attempt to distinguish between different types of arrangements
or indicate a preference between them for the purposes of
promotion.</div>
					<a name="07071992000267"></a><div class="hs_Para" style="text-align: left;">In exercising
that function, as with others it is being given, the commission must
aim to realise its overall objectives&#151;in other words, to
maximise the total number of effective maintenance arrangements in
place. To do that, it must encourage and support appropriate voluntary
maintenance arrangements and support the making of applications to the
statutory maintenance service.</div>
					<a name="07071992000268"></a><div class="hs_Para" style="text-align: left;">The commission
has no desire to push people inappropriately into unstable voluntary
maintenance arrangements; indeed, it would be failing if any action led
to that. I understand the motivation behind the amendment, but I hope
that I can reassure the hon. Gentleman that both this function and
others, such as information and guidance, will be exercised on the
basis that parents are best placed to decide what sort of arrangements
suit their children&#146;s needs. The commission&#146;s role is to
encourage them actively to consider the issue, make them aware of the
choices they face and support them through the decision-making process.
I hope that that reassures him and that he will withdraw the
amendment.</div>

Selous:
						</b> This will, I believe, be a relatively brief
debate, as I put my arguments earlier, as persuasively as I could. I
fear that it will again be a case of winning the argument but losing
the vote. I was not successful in persuading the Committee to back
earlier amendments on the subject, and I shall probably be no more
successful with this one.</div>
					<a name="07071992000274"></a><div class="hs_Para" style="text-align: left;">The purpose of
the amendments is to achieve what I set out to do in earlier
ones&#151;to enlarge the scope of the provision to allow
consideration of the welfare of the child not only in financial terms.
I did not expect CMEC to do it, so it was obviously necessary to try to
amend clause 2, but we also need to amend clauses 4 and 5, which is
what amendments Nos. 74 and 77 respectively would do.</div>
					<a name="07071992000275"></a><div class="hs_Para" style="text-align: left;">The Minister may
wheel out his earlier notes and some ink could be saved as he will
probably make the same arguments as he made in the earlier debate. Of
course, his officials may be so wonderful as to give him a fresh set of
arguments for every amendment, even if they are essentially on the same
theme. None the less, I shall not try the Committee&#146;s patience
by saying again what I said earlier. It is on the record. I said it on
Tuesday and again this morning. I have put my case, and I will
doubtless receive the same response.</div>
					<a name="07071992000276"></a><div class="hs_Para" style="text-align: left;">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07071992000543"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:
						</b> Yes, the hon. Gentleman will receive much the
same response. If he trades his previously used words for mine, we can
expedite the Committee&#146;s
proceedings.</div>
					<a name="07071992000277"></a><div class="hs_Para" style="text-align: left;">The
Government of course recognise the central role that parents play in
determining their children&#146;s outcomes and well-being. We know
that the way in which parents continue to engage with each other to
support their children after separation can have a major impact on the
children&#146;s well-being. A low level of conflict between parents
and a good quality relationship with the resident parent can minimise
the negative impacts that separation might otherwise have on a
child&#146;s health, social and educational outcomes.</div>
					<a name="07071992000278"></a><div class="hs_Para" style="text-align: left;">For that reason,
one of the functions of the new information and support service will be
to provide some basic information and to signpost parents to the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column142" />Column number: 142</div>appropriate services that will provide them with the expert help that
they need. That is why we have made provision in clause 5(2) to enable
the commission to provide information in relation to wider separation
issues, when those issues arise as part of discussions about child
maintenance.</div>
					<a name="07071992000279"></a><div class="hs_Para" style="text-align: left;">We want to
ensure that children&#146;s emotional needs are effectively
supported, and we obviously recognise the link between emotional and
material well-being. However, we must ensure that the commission knows
where its expertise lies and that it uses it appropriately. That is
essential if the Government are to realise their objective in
relation to child poverty. Other organisations have expertise on the
emotional aspects of family breakdown, and if parents need such help we
would expect the commission to support them in gaining access to these
services. As I explained, there will also be cross-Government
initiatives to provide support.</div>
					<a name="07071992000280"></a><div class="hs_Para" style="text-align: left;">In summary, I
suggest that the amendments would place a duty on the commission that
goes well beyond its main objective and in a way that is not
appropriate. As before, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw
the amendment.</div>
					<a name="07071992000281"></a><div class="hs_Para" style="text-align: left;">

Selous:
						</b> If my understanding of your helpful guidance this
morning is right, Mr. Chope, the Minister can respond once
more if he seeks to catch your eye. I would therefore like to prolong
the debate slightly, if I may.</div>
					<a name="07071992000282"></a><div class="hs_Para" style="text-align: left;">The first line
of amendment No. 74 uses the word &#147;culture&#148; again. I know
that the Government are keen to change the culture. The Minister talked
about signposting the different organisations that would carry out some
of the provisions suggested in amendments Nos. 74 and 77, but I would
like to hear a little more about the Government&#146;s
cross-departmental plans to change the culture and promote the sense of
parental responsibility, about which he was talking earlier. I think
that the details are still
sketchy.</div>
					<a name="07071992000283"></a><div class="hs_Para" style="text-align: left;">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07071992000545"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:
						</b> I am happy to contribute briefly to this
extension of the debate, although it takes me beyond my
Department&#146;s remit, as it is a cross-Government
programme.</div>
					<a name="07071992000284"></a><div class="hs_Para" style="text-align: left;">The
Government understand the challenges that parents face, and we
recognise the need to give them as much support as possible to help
them deal with those. The hon. Gentleman will know that such work is
already done in family centres and children&#146;s centres that are
being established all over the country and which do extremely valuable
work. They have evolved from Sure Start programmes. I do not know
whether he has had the same experience in his constituency as I have
had in mine, but I have heard from many lone parents that the
programmes have been of incredible value, giving parents a forum in
which to meet and to exchange experiences and information. I know of
many parents in those circumstances who say that they thought that they
were battling with those issues on their own, which is much harder to
do than if they are part of a group sharing a common
experience.</div>
					<a name="07071992000285"></a><div class="hs_Para" style="text-align: left;">The
centres can also signpost parents to many other forms of support that
will help them. Building on that, and extending the initiatives across
many Departments, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column143" />Column number: 143</div>including my own and those for education and social and health services,
will provide many points of access for those presenting a particular
parenting need at any given time. I hope that I have reassured the hon.
Gentleman and that he will support the Government&#146;s initiatives,
as I think that we are trying to achieve the same
outcome&#151;helping parents to meet the tough challenges that their
responsibility can
present.</div>
					<a name="07071992000286"></a><div class="hs_Para" style="text-align: left;">The
particular role of the agency&#151;or CMEC, as it will
become&#151;is to ensure that all our energies and focus go into
tackling what is just one of a series of stresses that arise from
family break-ups. If we can be certain that in reforming child
maintenance we are alleviating one source of pressure and strain on
parents, it will be our contribution to giving the breadth of emotional
support that the hon. Gentleman wishes to see. Our efforts are being
complemented by those of other Departments and non-governmental
organisations.</div>

Selous:
						</b> The clause deals with the provision of information
and guidance, about which we have heard a lot this afternoon. The hon.
Member for Angus said earlier that he did not think that it was
appropriate for CMEC to provide some of the practical advice to parents
on the issues of separation about which I have been talking. I
responded that I agreed with him, and I told him that my hon. Friends
and I had tabled amendments that would address that. That is what
amendments Nos. 75 and 76 would do, in that they would change the
phrases &#147;provide to parents&#148; to &#147;ensure that
parents are provided with&#148; and &#147;may provide
information&#148; to &#147;may ensure that information is
provided&#148;. That is not semantics; I am not just playing
grammatical games. I am making the point that, as the Minister just
said, the important thing is that the information and guidance should
be provided, not that it needs to be provided by CMEC. Indeed, in many
cases, because of the reputation and record of the CSA, it may best not
be provided by
CMEC.</div>
					<a name="07071992000295"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 17
would ensure a cross-governmental approach to the provision of advice,
information and guidance. The Minister has just been talking about that
and now has the chance to put his vote where his words were, so I hope
that he will welcome the amendment warmly and I look forward to
receiving his support. The amendment has the support of a number of
bodies outside the House that are concerned to ensure that the range of
issues that confront separating parents can be dealt with. I hope that
the Minister will look favourably upon it.</div>
					<a name="07071992000296"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is my contention, as I have
said several times this afternoon, that if there is back-up support and
advice in respect of all the issues that separating parents find
themselves dealing with, then it will be easier to accomplish agreement
on issues to do with money. The Minister has told us many times that
that is the prime and overriding objective of CMEC. That was the
reasoning behind the amendments, and I look forward to hearing the
comments of other hon. Members.</div>
					<a name="07071992000297"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07071992000550"></a>Paul
Rowen:
						</b> The clause is one of the most significant and
important parts of the Bill, because much of what it seeks to do is
new. As was seen in the evidence sessions on Tuesday, a range of
information and guidance is going to be provided by web-based,
telephone and face-to-face methods. I hope that that will go a long way
towards ensuring that CMEC gets off to a good start.</div>
					<a name="07071992000298"></a><div class="hs_Para">The difficulty is that the
clause is vague. The amendments, particularly amendment No. 17 and our
similar amendment No. 35, would put flesh on the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column145" />Column number: 145</div>bones of the clause so that it would contain definite
information as to who or what will be responsible. As the Minister
said, the issues will affect more than just one Department; it is a
cross-departmental responsibility, so it is important to make it clear
in the Bill that the relevant Departments will have to understand their
responsibilities to ensure that whatever range of providers is set up,
the people involved will have the information and will know where to
go.</div>
					<a name="07071992000299"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of the things
that can bedevil a new law is a lack of cross-departmental
support. By setting up a skeleton explanation of how that information
and guidance will be produced and who will be responsible for it, we
can ensure that CMEC delivers a step change from what has happened with
current arrangements through the CSA.</div>

Plaskitt:
						</b> I am grateful to hon. Members speaking to the
amendments. We had assumed that the purpose of amendments Nos. 75 and
76 was to place a duty on the commission to contract out its
information and guidance functions, and that is more or less what we
heard. Amendments Nos. 17 and 35 aim to provide the Secretary of State
with the power to make regulations for the commission, enabling it to
work with other Government Departments in delivering services to
separating parents. Amendment No. 17 would provide the commission with
powers to pilot those services.</div>

Selous:
						</b> I want to clarify something that the Minister
said. Amendments Nos. 75 and 76 mean that information and advice could
be provided by bodies other than CMEC, but do not prevent CMEC from
providing it. It would, as an organisation, be able to ensure that
something was
happening.</div>
					<a name="07071992000302"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07071992000553"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:
						</b> I entirely accept that, but the measure pushes
the emphasis towards the possibility of the services being provided
externally. Amendments Nos. 75 and 76 are unnecessary because clause 5,
in conjunction with clause 8, makes it perfectly clear that any
function of the commission, including the information and guidance
function, may be contracted out. We believe that the function could be
delivered successfully through a mix of the private and voluntary
sectors, but it is not yet possible to identify who will provide it,
because the commissioning process has not yet started. We have already
engaged with the voluntary sector and are in the process of undertaking
an assessment of the market capacity to deliver an information and
guidance service from 2008. We hope that that work will help the
commission to make informed decisions about how the information and
guidance service be delivered most effectively.</div>
					<a name="07071992000303"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments Nos. 17 and 35 would
provide the Secretary of State with the power to make regulations for
the commission to work together with other Departments to deliver
services for separating parents. Amendment No. 17 would provide the
commission with the power to pilot those services. These amendments are
also unnecessary because there is no legal barrier to prevent the
commission from working with other Departments or public bodies on any
pilot 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column146" />Column number: 146</div>or national programme. Indeed, we intend to encourage such working.
Clause 7 already provides for the commission to carry out work on
behalf of other Departments as well as other public bodies and vice
versa.</div>
					<a name="07071992000304"></a><div class="hs_Para">I wish to
underline the importance that we attach to the need to work across
narrow departmental areas to support parents more effectively. It is
important because research strongly shows that the majority of
separating parents have an array of issues to resolve&#151;they are
often confused about where they can get the right help and end up
relying solely on family and friends because they cannot access more
informed support. Issues in those circumstances range from maintenance
to housing, debt, contact, domestic violence, benefits and tax credits.
Parents frequently need emotional support as
well.</div>
					<a name="07071992000305"></a><div class="hs_Para">In drafting
clause 5, we have taken that evidence on board. Members of the
Committee will note that subsection (2) allows the commission to
provide information on a range of issues wider than the pure issue of
maintenance, when those issues emerge as part of an overall discussion
with parents. We expect that the commission will use that power to link
people to a range of wider organisations that provide more specialist
support. We fully expect it to provide a wider range of written and
web-based material on separation issues. We have been impressed by the
quality of material available to parents through, for example, the
Australian system that was mentioned earlier. We will look to the
commission, working with the voluntary sector, to provide such
material. On a wider front, the Government have clearly signalled the
importance that they attach to providing parental support through the
creation of the new Department for Children, Schools and Families,
which, as we have discussed, has responsibility for leading family
policy evolution across Government.</div>
					<a name="07071992000306"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of the key pieces of work
that the Department will be taking forward is &#147;Aiming high for
children: supporting families&#148;, by which the Government are
committed to improving information for parents. Resources will be made
available between 2008 and 2011 to improve the quality and
accessibility of information for parents through the &#147;Parent
Know-How&#148; campaign, which will offer a range of communication
channels, including telephone helplines and websites. We will ensure
that the new information and support service is linked to
&#147;Parent Know-How&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07071992000307"></a><div class="hs_Para">Local children&#146;s
information services that are run by local authorities will also direct
parents to the commission when appropriate, because we want parents
seeking help with child maintenance to be directed to the commission
quickly when they first seek help on a related matter. If that work
were to lead, in due course, to a new and substantial cross-Government
initiative, the commission would already have the power to provide
support on maintenance issues as part of a pilot, and clause 7 will
give the commission the power to deliver that pilot in its entirety if
so desired.</div>
					<a name="07071992000308"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
summary, I assure hon. Members that there is already provision in the
Bill to deal with the issues addressed by all four amendments, and on
that basis I urge them to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

Selous:
						</b> We continue our deliberations on clause 5 with
this second group of amendments. Amendment No. 8 would simply make a
number of additional purposes part of the clause. Amendment No. 6 would
ensure that effective maintenance arrangements could be not only set
up, but renewed and taken forward on an ongoing basis throughout the
lifetimes of the children concerned. Amendment No. 7 deals with the
incredibly important issue of arrears, about which we had a debate this
morning, and you will probably prefer us not to go over it again at
length, Mr. Chope. I think that the hon. Member for Rochdale
and I are at one on the importance of that topic and will continue in
Committee and on Report to ensure that that issue does not go beneath
the radar, as will our colleagues in another place. For the benefit of
members of the Committee, I will not repeat the arguments that I made
twice this morning; no doubt, they would not be pleased still to be
hearing my voice in an hour&#146;s time.</div>
					<a name="07071992000403"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4
pm</div>
					<a name="07071992000320"></a><div class="hs_Para">I commend
amendment No. 5, which deals with the information and guidance that is
provided, to the Minister as worthy of his favourable consideration.
His phrase, contained in clause 2, is &#147;appropriate voluntary
maintenance arrangements&#148;. We had a brief debate about that by
virtue of an earlier amendment that I tabled on what
&#147;appropriate&#148; means. The purpose of amendment No. 5 is to
give parents an idea of what they would be getting within the statutory
CMEC scheme. They do not have to be bound by that, but there may, for
instance, be many vulnerable parents with care&#151;largely women and
mothers&#151;who have no idea what they should expect to get. Perhaps
they have been in an abusive relationship or one where their partner
has been overly dominant and they have been cowed into submission and
done what he told them to do, which may be why they want to be shot of
him and are separating. Perhaps the man involved will propose a pretty
rum deal. Would not it be sensible, from the point of view of these
vulnerable women, to give them an idea, saying, &#147;Were you in the
statutory CMEC scheme, which the Minister doesn&#146;t want you to
get into, this is the proportion of your partner&#146;s,
ex-partner&#146;s or husband&#146;s income that you would look to
get&#148;?</div>
				
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column149" />Column number: 149</div>
					<a name="07071992000321"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is a really practical,
sensible idea. I seriously hope that the Minister considers it, if not
now, perhaps later. I commend it to him, his team and officials in the
Department, because it is practical, sensible and meets the need of
vulnerable women who may not have an idea about what they could
reasonably and appropriately expect from their husbands. There is no
requirement on them to make an arrangement that would mirror exactly
what they would get in the scheme. They have the flexibility to match
precise arrangements to their situation in terms of timing, in the way
that the Minister talked about earlier, or they may leave the agreement
on one side when the child goes to stay with the non-resident parent. I
accept all that. However, just as a ball park indicator, this provision
would be useful. It is practical and I commend it to the Minister and
the Committee for their favourable
consideration.</div>

Rowen:
						</b> Again, we are continuing our earlier debate about
what information should be provided and how that should be done. I want
to talk about amendments Nos. 33, 7, 37 and 67. Amendment No. 33 is
similar to amendment No. 6, tabled by the hon. Member for South-West
Bedfordshire, in that we are talking not just about the creation of
child maintenance arrangements, but about whether the important words
&#147;renewal&#148; or &#147;continuation&#148; should be used.
Again, it has to be understood that children grow up, their needs
change and over that period any arrangements that are set in place will
need to change to reflect that. That needs to be reflected in the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="07071992000323"></a><div class="hs_Para">On amendment No.
7, as the hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire said, we are
concerned about what happens to arrears and we want to ensure that when
the new body is set up the commission understands and appreciates that.
That is why it was
tabled.</div>
					<a name="07071992000324"></a><div class="hs_Para">As we heard in
the discussion on Tuesday, there is interest in what sort of
information services CMEC will provide. It was interesting to hear the
Ministers talk about how they have gone about doing that. I welcome the
involvement of the voluntary sector, because that is a positive way
forward.</div>
					<a name="07071992000325"></a><div class="hs_Para">Like the
previous amendment, amendment No. 37 seeks to broaden the measures to
include the provision of information and advice, which traditionally
has not been provided by the CSA. We are attempting to ensure that all
the services that children receive are not delivered in a disjointed,
departmental way.</div>
					<a name="07071992000326"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 35 would set out,
in a similar way to a service level agreement, the information that a
parent using CMEC could expect to get. It comes back to what I said
earlier about setting out responsibilities in the Bill and how they
will be delivered. We hear talk about child care arrangements, housing
and personal finance. The CSA has not necessarily dealt with such
things in the past, but if we are to set up an information and guidance
arrangement, we need to ensure that we make available that level of
provision. It might have been provided by a number of different bodies
in the past, but we are trying to put in place a one-stop-shop system,
which ensures that a parent who is going through a difficult divorce
and dealing with domestic violence gets all the advice to which they
have a right.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column150" />Column number: 150</div>
					<a name="07071992000327"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are not asking for such steps
to be taken right away. We are saying that we must wait until the
commission is set up and the commissioners and the staff are in place.
We want to see a report that sets out the Department&#146;s strategy
to ensure that the available information and guidance are provided
equally throughout the country by a range of appropriate providers. We
want to know the amount of money, broken down by destination, that will
be spent on promoting the information.</div>
					<a name="07071992000328"></a><div class="hs_Para">We also want to know how that
information and advice will be delivered. In the evidence session on
Tuesday, we heard that there is still some concern because, in the
past, too much of it has been delivered by telephone. We want to ensure
that arrangements for face-to-face information provision are in place,
because cases often involve vulnerable people who are at a crisis point
and who need face-to-face contact with someone who understands their
situation and can give broad advice.</div>
					<a name="07071992000329"></a><div class="hs_Para">We want to see specific
strategies in place to ensure that services are available to address a
broad range of matters with which the parent might need assistance.
Those might include employment, means-tested benefits, jobseekers
allowance or issues of gender or ethnicity. With amendment No. 67, we
seek to ensure that the commission has a proper strategy to enable the
system to deliver not only what the CSA has delivered, but a broader,
Government-based agenda, which provides all the information that a
parent in such circumstances has the right to expect. I have no doubt
that the commission will not do all that alone. It will need to come to
arrangements with other Departments and non-governmental bodies. We
want to see a clear strategy that sets out how it will be
delivered.</div>
					<a name="07071992000330"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07071992000559"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:
						</b> I thank hon. Members for their amendments. In
their entirety, they seek to widen the information and guidance
function, or place an additional requirement on the commission to
report on certain key aspects of that function within specified time
scales. I should like to be as helpful as possible with this group of
amendments. In general terms, I believe that they are unnecessary,
however, because clause 5 already covers the issues that hon. Members
are concerned about and the information and support service that we
expect the commission to provide is already being set up to cover such
issues.</div>
					<a name="07071992000331"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before
covering the amendments, I remind the Committee that clause 5 places a
duty on the commission to provide parents with the necessary
information and guidance to help them choose, make and keep effective
maintenance arrangements, therefore supporting our overall objectives.
The clause will enable the commission to develop new services that
provide parents with impartial guidance to help them to make informed
choices about financial arrangements for their children. We expect the
commission to create specific new services to deliver that function,
working with the best private, voluntary and state
providers.</div>
					<a name="07071992000332"></a><div class="hs_Para">We expect
the commission to use three main routes to channel the service: a
national contact centre, a web-based service and face-to-face support.
That will create a service that seeks to engage with the maximum number
of separating parents, encourages parents to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column151" />Column number: 151</div>make an informed choice about their maintenance arrangements and
supports parents in acting on that choice. In doing so it will also
provide follow-up support at the request of parents to review their
existing arrangements, re-establish voluntary agreements or refer
people to the statutory maintenance service, if necessary. We
particularly want to draw low-income families into the new service and
are working with Jobcentre Plus and Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and
Customs to enable the commission to reach people who might not actively
seek help to secure effective maintenance
arrangements.</div>
					<a name="07071992000333"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will
take the amendments in turn. Amendments Nos. 7 and 8
are intended to ensure that the information and guidance function
covers both the setting up of effective maintenance arrangements and
the collection of arrears under the child maintenance scheme. As we
discussed under clause 2, securing ongoing compliance and enforcing
previous debt within the statutory scheme is already required under the
commission&#146;s objectives and as such the amendment is
unnecessary.</div>
					<a name="07071992000334"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should
point out that we would not expect our information and support service
to provide detailed technical information about the various ways the
statutory scheme can enforce maintenance or negotiate debt settlements.
Rather, it would be focused on providing more general information,
namely, that if a parent has doubts about an ex-partner&#146;s
willingness to pay maintenance, an application to the statutory scheme
may be more
appropriate.</div>
					<a name="07071992000335"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 6 and 33 intend to ensure that the commission
provides information and guidance with a view to helping parents
establish voluntary arrangements and supporting their continuation or
renewal. Clause 5 already enables the commission to provide that level
of service. As I mentioned earlier, our policy intention has always
been for the commission to provide that level of
service.</div>
					<a name="07071992000336"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
5 would require for two particular tools to be provided as part of the
information and guidance provided to parents considering voluntary
arrangements: a provisional maintenance assessment, and a standard
maintenance arrangement form. The amendment is unnecessary because we
need the commission to learn from experience and if such tools prove to
be unhelpful to parents in practice, we do not want to place a legal
obligation on the commission to continue providing them. That said, the
evidence that we have at present suggests that they may well be helpful
and we are working on the basis that the commission will provide
standard maintenance arrangement forms from the outset. We also expect
a much larger role for a broad maintenance calculation function to help
parents to initiate negotiations on levels of payment and to address
potential imbalance of power issues. That would be a widening of the
service that we already provide to around 1,000 parents a month through
the CSA&#146;s online
calculator.</div>
					<a name="07071992000337"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 37 and 67 would require the commission to publish reports within
12 months of clause 5 coming into effect detailing a range of issues,
such as the organisations it is contracting to provide telephone and
face-to-face services, its approach to working with hard-to-reach
groups and how it will be provide advice on a range of maintenance and
non-maintenance issues. Again, the amendment is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column152" />Column number: 152</div>unnecessary because the commission, like many non-departmental public
bodies, will be obliged to prepare, publish and lay before Parliament
an annual report each financial year to allow scrutiny of its
activities. That report will cover a range of issues including the
commission&#146;s current and future strategic direction. Such a
report is bound to cover much of the material that the hon. Members
seek to include in the
Bill.</div>
				
					<a name="07071992000404"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.15
pm</div>
					<a name="07071992000338"></a><div class="hs_Para">In addition, to
be helpful, much of the material will be available well before the time
scales implied by the amendments. As my earlier comments made clear, we
have already started to develop detailed designs for the commission to
build on, so that it can deliver the service in late 2008. For example,
with regard to the provision of the information and support service and
its potential funding, the detail surrounding the amount is
commercially sensitive at this time and will not be put in the public
domain before inviting potential providers to tender for provision of
the service. However, since the service is due to be in place
nationally by late 2008, funding levels and successful bidders will be
in the public domain well before the date implied by the
amendment.</div>
					<a name="07071992000339"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also made
our developing strategy clear for proactively identifying, referring
across and supporting parents with care to make maintenance
arrangements in order to realise our statutory objectives and maximise
the impact of such reforms on the alleviation of child
poverty.</div>
					<a name="07071992000340"></a><div class="hs_Para">In summary,
while I do not agree that any of the amendments are necessary, I hope
that those who tabled them recognise that we take the subject matter
seriously and that we are keen to provide as much detail as possible.
The information and support service is a new and critical element of
the overall service that the commission will provide, and we place
great importance on working with it to get the service right for
children and their parents. I therefore hope that the hon. Member for
South-West Bedfordshire will not press his
amendments.</div>
