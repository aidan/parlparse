<P>
<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Question again proposed, That the amendment be 
made.
<P>
<B>The Minister for Local Government and Housing (Ms Hilary Armstrong):</b> Before I continue, I welcome 
you to the Chair, Mr. O`Brien. I have benefited from your 
experience and knowledge in the local government arena 
and from your persistent questions and challenges that 
you have posed to this Government and the previous 
Government on the treatment of local government. I hope 
that we do not provoke you too much so that you wish to 
be on the Floor of the Committee rather than in the Chair. 
I know that you will deal with us fairly and rigorously, 
and that is what we are trying to do with best value.
<P>
All best value authorities will know that over a 
five-year period they will need to reach efficiency and 
quality targets that are determined by the best of their 
peers. They will not be able to meet that challenge if they 
knowingly put potential service providers at a competitive 
disadvantage by treating them unfairly or by putting 
unreasonable obstacles in their way. If they do so, the 
robust system that we are creating of both annual and 
periodic scrutiny by auditors and inspectors will find them 
out. The previous CCT regime often failed to do that, as 
the hon. Member for North Essex (Mr. Jenkin) admitted. 
I took his admittance as recognition that CCT had not 
worked as effectively as the previous Government 
expected it to and that its time had come.
<P>
The amendment seems to suggest that some authorities 
may seek to build extraneous features into contracts that 
will make compliance unduly difficult. I understand that 
concern. It may be related, as the hon. Member for north 
Essex said, to the provisions of clause 17 which will allow 
the Government to provide that specified matters cease 
to be non-commercial considerations for the purposes of 
part II the Local Government Act 1988. But Government 
amendment No. 65 will allow us to issue guidance to best 
value authorities under clause 17 about the manner in 
which they take account of non-commercial matters in the 
exercise of their functions. The guidance will make it 
clear that non-commercial matters will be taken account 
of only in a manner that facilitates and is consistent with 
the achievement of best value. I favour such a permissive 
approach over the more prescriptive one on which the 
amendment is based.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford </B>(Mole Valley): I have listened to 
the Minister with interest, but I know from experience that 
the ingenuity of local government is considerable. The 
variations on a theme that it can achieve are legendary. 
I remain concerned that clause 17 will allow local 
government to slip one past the Government, if the 
Committee will excuse what is almost a rugby phrase. 
Many district auditors and those working on behalf of 
them are also vulnerable to persuasion I mean this in the 
nicest way that what local authorities are doing is fair 
and right. Will the Secretary of State monitor the contacts 
or carry out spot checks on all or some of them to ensure 
that there is agreement about the fact that the law has 
been followed?



<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I should warn the hon. Gentleman that 
those of us who come from the north-east of England, as 
I do, are not familiar with allusions to rugby. Most of us 
who are brought up there think that the ball is wrongly 
shaped.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Curry </B>(Skipton and Ripon): Is not the 
Minister aware that Newcastle has an extremely good 
rugby union team?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I am aware of that. I keep a careful 
eye on anything that comes from Newcastle, especially on 
the chairmen of the football club and the rugby union 
club. Rugby is played in the north-east, but it is not a 
tradition there. It is certainly not a tradition in the state 
education system, although it may be in other parts of the 
education system, a few examples of which have crept 
into the north-east. The hon. Gentleman should use 
allusions that are familiar to football supporters rather 
than rugby supporters.
<P>
I appreciate the hon. Gentleman's comments, but he 
should face the fact that when he was a Minister he and 
the previous Government were not successful in the 
respect that he mentioned. Far too often, the adversarial 
approach meant that the brightest and best were 
encouraged to avoid or to get round the rigid rules of 
CCT. That is why our proposal is driven by a desire to 
examine outcomes, outputs and results, and by a need not 
to be ideological about the manner in which that is done, 
although we are tough about getting the best outcomes for 
local people. That means that any authority that seeks to 
duck and dive will, at the end of the day, be found out 
its behaviour will be clear in the outcomes.
<P>
The amendment would turn around that arrangement 
and return us to an unsatisfactory system in which civil 
servants would have to spend an inordinate length of time 
trying to check individual contracts. Even if one supported 
that approach Labour Members do not one must 
accept that it simply did not work.
<P>
Our approach is the most constructive way forward. It 
creates a general duty of best value which is framed in 
terms that will give best value authorities discretion and 
flexibility in the way that they meet it. Our system is 
backed up by clear standards and targets and it involves 
an effective and transparent system of scrutiny. It puts the 
onus on best value authorities to deliver results.
<P>
We must show that we are not wedded to the old 
mentalities that beset CCT and that we are prepared to 
trust local government and to put the interests of local 
communities above ideology and vested interests. Where 
that can be done, the legal framework will be designed to 
facilitate the situation, and where it cannot be done, I am 
confident that a proper range of options is available to 
tackle the problem. I therefore urge the hon. Member for 
North Essex to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bernard Jenkin </B>(North Essex): I join in 
welcoming you, Mr. O'Brien, to the Committee. you join 
us for what may turn out to be a seminal discussion. 
I thought that we should have a 15-minute conversation 
about the amendment I did not think that there would 
be a great issue about it.
<P>
I was surprised that the Minister expressed surprise at 
my raising the issue of European Community law. That 
exposed two things. First, she had obviously forgotten that 
European Community law applies extensively to the 
contracting relationships of local authorities and, indeed, 
to other relationships that may not be overtly contractual. 
Secondly none of her officials and advisers of whom I 
make no personal criticism drew her attention to the fact 
that the amendment's wording is taken from article 85 of 
the treaty of Rome, which has been around for a bit, and 
that it is germane to the argument.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I was really teasing the hon. 
Gentleman, who, much of the time, has rejected anything 
that has ever come out of Europe. I, therefore, welcome 
the fact that he recognises such documents,
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am sure that that intervention was fully 
in order, and that it is, therefore, in order for me to reply 
to it.
<P>
The Minister is mistaken to say that I have rejected 
everything that has come out of the European Union. I am 
sure that she would not wish to mislead the Committee. 
I have always been in favour of European Union 
membership and the Single European Act. However, I 
have also always believed that we should explain openly 
the obligations contained in the treaties. Clearly, the 
Minister's officials did not discuss them with her, and 
failed to give guidance.
<P>
Even more surprising was her response that the 
amendment is not good policy. The amendment represents 
European Union law as it stands. The Minister shakes her 
head, but will she explain? The relevant articles have what 
is termed direct applicability and direct effect which 
means that our own courts 
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I accept that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> If the Minister accepts that, why is she 
saying that the provisions contained in those articles 
should not be reflected in the Bill at this point? She 
seemed to say that that would be bad policy, and that the 
provisions interfere in some way with her policy of best 
value. I should be delighted if she would explain.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I hesitate to intervene because the hon. 
Gentleman is simply trying, unsuccessfully, to be clever. 
I made it absolutely clear this morning that the whole of 
the Bill will of course be subject to European Community 
law. I also said that the particular way in which the hon. 
Gentleman seeks to amend the clause was not helpful, 
was unnecessary, and would not ensure that we achieve 
our aim.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I have two complaints about the 
Minister's intervention. First, her comment that the 
legislation will, of course, be subject to European 
Community law is, if I may say so, a bit of a cop out. We 
could legislate that the moon is made of blue cheese, but 
we would stiil be subject to European Community law. 
The challenge for UK legislators, which includes us as 
well as her, is to ensure that the provisions of European 
Community law are correctly expressed in domestic law, 
so that we do not mislead local authorities and others into 
pursuing relationships and activities that in fact 
contravene European Community law.
<P>
Let us consider the Conservative Government's 
experience of the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of 
Employment) Regulations 1981. Under challenge from 
the courts and the Minister's friends in the trade unions, 
we had endlessly to reinterpret them. [Interruption.] I 
hear words of assent from the Minister, who seems to be 
saying that it was somehow all our fault. I should point 
out to her, and to her party, that they may be making the 
same mistake.
<P>
The matter goes to the heart of the Bill. The Minister 
should provide an exposition of the European Community 
treaties and the list of directives that have implications for 
the Bill. What is the relationship of these directives with 
this new process called best value? Under competitive 
tendering there was a clear contractor-lessee split or an 
enabler-provider split. There was an independent, 
contractual relationship between a public corporation or 
authority and an economic activity. Clearly the provisions 
of European Community law applying to such contracts 
applied in that case.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Minister says that my amendment would take us 
back to that adversarial position I am paraphrasing 
her but there is no reference in the Bill to contracting 
an open competitive tender. Clearly we regard that as a 
shortcoming. But the Minister's intention may be to blur 
the distinction between state activities and economic 
activities undertaken by private companies and then 
perhaps to get out from underneath  the obligations that 
apply. That will be rather difficult.
<P>
I refer to a useful book that I recommend her to look 
at, "Law and Institutions of the European Union"	, Sixth 
Edition, by D. Lasok. In the chapter "Competition 
practices contrary to article 85"	 there is a section on 
public undertakings, which says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Member States of the Union practise a `mixed economy' in 
which the State participates alongside the private interest."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That clearly applies in the case of best value. It goes on:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the state controls the `public sector' in which it operates through 
public undertakings of different types ... They exhibit, however, a 
common tendency towards monopolies and in that sense enjoy by 
law a `dominant position' which the Union purports to contain 
within the concept of the Common Market."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is referring to activities that may or may not be 
undertaken by the state, which are incorporated in the 
provisions of the Common Market, to which there is a 
specific reference.
<P>
The key case was as early as 1997, the van Ameyde v. 
UCI case, which was heard by the European Court of 
Justice. In that case an employment exchange, which we 
might regard as a purely state activity a jobcentre was 
characterised as an undertaking because
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"finding people jobs is an economic activity; and the fact that such 
an activity is normally entrusted to a public service does not affect 
the economic nature of the activity since it is not always and not 
necessarily carried on by a public body."	<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Virtually any local authority activity, such as emptying 
dustbins, cleaning streets, providing computer services or 
management services, might be termed an economic 
activity and therefore could be included in the provisions 
of the Common Market. There is, therefore necessarily 
a relationship between those who are commissioning the 
services and those who are providing them. Unless we 
make that clear at this stage of the Bill, we care complicit 
in trying to defy the spirit of the European Community 
legislation and trying to blur the distinction.
<P>
We know what one of the major motivations of the 
abolition of competitive tendering is all about and why so 
many local authorities local authorities very much 
dominated by the Minister's party have sought to 
subvert the spirit of competitive tendering and to get 
round its provisions. It is because they want the producer 
interest to be dominant. The spirit of the Common Market 
is to put the consumer and the customer at the heart of 
the process rather than the producer interests.

<P>

<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Jon Owen Jones):</b> As is best value.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I appreciate the sincerely held beliefs of 
the Minister for Local Government and Housing and what 
she has said about putting targets, the customer, the 
council tax payer and performance indicators at the heart 
of the Bill. I hear that it may be a much tougher regime 
in many respects than competitive tendering ever was. 
That is the way in which the hon. Lady is selling it to us 
this afternoon, which suggests that all the extra powers 
given to the Secretary of State in the Bill will be used 
with a vengeance on all those local authorities. I expect 
that there will be vengeance if those local authorities 
continue to embarrass the Minister's party in the way that 
they have.
<P>
If the powers are to be used in such a way, we shall be 
delighted, but it must be clearly set out in the Bill that we 
see the relationships between services and those who have 
an obligation to provide them as contractual. The 
relationships should be open and should be governed by 
the fairness embodied in our amendment.
<P>
I ask the Minister to give us more explanation of the 
sort of legal advice that the Committee needs to make a 
proper judgment about the Bill, because, as she rightly 
says, we are legislating in the framework of a great deal  
of European legislation and European Community case 
law. Unless we are certain that we are legislating securely 
in that framework, I fear that the Bill will suffer from 
many of the problems that we had, for example on the 
transfer of undertakings from the acquired rights directive. 
It is incumbent on the Committee to demand that clear 
and unequivocal advice, and I ask the Minister to give it 
to the Committee now.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The Question is 
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> On a point of order, Mr. O'Brien. I find 
it rather unsatisfactory that we are being asked to decide 
on this matter when the Minister has given a completely 
unsatisfactory response. She has give the Committee no 
idea of how she expects the European Community 
legislation to apply.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> That is not a point of order. It is a 
matter for the Minister. If the Minister does not care to 
respond, I must put the question to the Committee.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(5) For the purposes of this section the Secretary of State shall

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> I, too, welcome you to the 
Committee, Mr. O'Brien. It is intriguing, because the last 
time that you and I faced one another in a Committee, in 
a slightly different atmosphere, you were sitting in the 
seat that I am sitting in and doing your best to tie me in 
knots at every opportunity. In your present rather 
delightful situation you have to sit and smile, benevolently 
I hope, on the proceedings.
<P>
These are probing, almost fishing, amendments to give 
the Minister an opportunity to expand on the thinking 
behind the provision and on the nature of the 
consultation for example, who she will consult, and why 
she will consult in certain ways and in certain areas of the 
community and not in others.
<P>
A sort of early warning was given about all this. One 
thing that I remember from local government I 
understand that it is considerably worse these days is 
that it is statutorily obliged to do a large part of its 
consulting. There is some concern about overkill, a point 
that I touched on during Second Reading. I pointed out 
that while all of us accept that consultation is important 
even vital and has to be succinct, meaningful and have 
genuine purpose, it must not overload the community.
<P>
But, looking at matters from the viewpoint of local 
government, there is a temptation to argue that in this best 
value Bill the Government have gone over the top. I gave 
an example of a London council consulting on its duties, 
saying that as a best value authority it will need to consult 
residents, service users, tenant groups, residents groups, 
businesses, neighbouring councils, the Government Office 
for London, diocesan boards, health authorities, public 
unit companies, the Department of Social Security, 
professional groups and, presumably, somewhere along 
the line, the private sector, if it is appropriate for the 
particular service. The list could be expanded considerably, and I suspect that some local authorities, in doing their duty on the duties, may feel that expansion 
is required.
<P>
However, the beleaguered residents of the London 
borough that I have chosen would also have to be 
consulted by the borough, the police, the fire and civil 
defence authority, the development agency and, after this 
morning, the waste disposal authority, Transport for 
London, and, later, the mayor and the Greater London 
authority and the list probably does not end there. But 
all that is about only the duties; it is not about the quality 
of the services that will be provided. That comes next. 
There is the best value performance plan for each 
financial year, with each plan being published before the 
next financial year. Hence the data will be based on the 
previous financial year, so will effectively be about 
18 months out of date when it eventually hits the decks 
for the public who have been consulted.
<P>
To be realistic, the data has to be detailed and 
voluminous therefore, for most of the public, it is 
impenetrable. As I said on Second Reading, I cannot 
imagine the ordinary resident putting up with it for long. 
Instead of reacting to it, people will file it in one of those 
bins for collection and disposal later. I also said that there 
will, of course, be the odd resident "odd"	 being the 
operative word who will react.
<P>
We talked earlier about easing the load on local 
authorities at the bottom end of the financial scale. My 
right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon 
(Mr. Curry) suggested looking at different ways of 
approaching this, rather than giving a figure. He was 
leading on to the opportunity that exists for the 
Government to change their approach and reduce the load 
on local government. We can consider a reduction here, 
even by amalgamating some consultations to reduce the 
plethora of consultation paper anticipation responses.
<P>
As I understand it, there is already a sign of what I call 
consultation fatigue. It comes principally from the busy 
business world, which is already being loaded with 
consultation documents and papers from local 
government, Uncle Tom Cobbleigh and all, including 
health authorities and so on. Business is not responding, 
so is missing some of the vital points. Companies 
receiving these large documents, which, to be fair they 
would need to receive to examine a service in detail, will 
bin the fifth and sixth when they land on desks because 
they will not have time to examine them.
<P>
What worries me further is that the nature of the 
consultation will allow some local authorities to cover for 
themselves. We have to accept that, at the bottom end of 
the scale there must be a scale of quality, so there must 
be a bottom end the opportunity will arise for local 
authorities to use this intense and overburdening 
consultation to cover up poor quality.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The benchmarking is set up in such a way that there 
will be an inevitable tendency to average down. We will 
have what I call the Oblivon effect. When I first arrived 
in this country Oblivon was a pharmaceutical prescription 
drug that we used for concerned patients. It was a 
beautiful, almost glass-like, soft jube, I think the 
Australians call them, filled with a drug that was supposed 
to calm patients. We used to give it to the patients with a 
large patter; they would swallow it and it would work in 
15 minutes. Pharmaceutically, however, it was useless. It 
did not work and so was withdrawn. If we give residents 
volumes of glossy consultation papers telling them that 
they are getting a wonderful service without testing it, 
they will experience the Oblivon effect. We can see this 
already today.
<P>
The next factor to consider and this goes back to what 
my right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon 
touched on this morning, is the cost. For many local 
authorities, particularly the smaller ones, the cost of this 
consultation exercise right across the board, as a 
proportion of its net revenue budget, could hurt its 
financial budget. The money that will be spent could be 
better spent elsewhere if the consultation was rationalised.
<P>
Can the Minister also explain the thinking behind the 
organisations she is consulting? To give her a tiny 
example, under the duties the local council tax payers are 
consulted. That is right and proper. But, they are 
apparently not consulted about the service they have paid 
for and its quality. I am sure that there is an opportunity 
to combine some of these consultations to reduce the 
process and make it succinct but still meaningful.

<P>

<B>Mr. Curry:</B> I sometimes think that if we are not careful 
everyone will spend so much time consulting that we will 
never get round to doing anything. I am rather sceptical 
about this mania for consultation. But there again, I am 
deeply sceptical about the mania for open government too, 
so I declare myself an unrepentant reactionary before 
anyone accuse me of it.
<P>
I am always anxious to find out what happens. It is all 
very well to have these vague phrases but I always ask 
myself: at 9 o'clock on Monday morning, who does what, 
with what purpose and for how long? These consultations 
cover an enormously general category of people. 
Subsection (2)(d) refers to:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"representatives of persons appearing to the authority to have an 
interest in any area within which the authority carries out functions."	
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is colossally open-ended. How does the authority 
decide who has a legitimate right? Is there a right to be 
consulted. Could a body demand that it be consulted. To 
what extent does it make the selection?
<P>
A number of us sit on Select Committees. We choose 
which witnesses will give oral evidence and which will 
give written evidence. There is no way that we could 
listen to everyone's case if it were given orally. We also 
know that when vast volumes of consultation are received, 
although it may be ploughed through by some poor and 
very junior official, only the baldest summary reaches the 
Executive or ministerial level. I do not know whether 
practices have changed since my time.
<P>
The Minister is about to go through the rate support 
grant settlement. She knows that she is supposed to see 
vast quantities of representations from local authorities 
from all over the country. They used to wheel them 
through in a trolley. Has a trolley been wheeled through 
her office yet to enable her to see the consultations? 
Nobody ever pretended that for every district council the 
Minister would listen in rapt attention to details 
concerning the length of roads or the gritting requirements 
of shire authorities.
<P>
Practical questions pertain here. Who in the local 
authority would the Minister expect to be charged with 
responsibility? If it is to be someone spared from doing 
anything else to do with consultation, it will be at a junior 
level. Who will read it? What does a consultation have to 
be to qualify as a consultation? Could it be an advert in 
the local paper or a questionnaire? In local authorities 
with large ethnic minorities many of the inner London 
authorities or Bradford, for example will consultation be 
carried out in a variety of languages, which will add to 
the cost of the procedure? No one would say that he is 
against consultation a priori, but we must be sure about 
what tasks are to be imposed on the local authority.
<P>
I am tempted, but I will not join my hon. Friend the 
Member for Mole Valley. I recognise that local authorities 
must know what their local people want since many of 
them may have sensible views about achieving it. 
However, I want to ensure that the exercise does not 
become a time-consuming, costly rigmarole which may 
become a bureaucratic imposition with no real substance. 
Nor do I want consultation to become a formality, 
perfunctory in its nature, merely to satisfy the Bill's 
requirements.
<P>
Will the Minister give us an example of what she would 
regard as a legitimate series of consultations, so we could 
gain some sense of feeling about what is required? That 
would be of great benefit to all of us. It would also be 
helpful if she could explain subsection (2)(d). Will she 
also clarify what she means by representatives? I am 
always suspicious of them. The world is full of 
self-appointed representatives who represent nobody but 
themselves yet are often appointed to high offices by the 
Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. James Plaskitt </B>(Warwick and Leamington): I can 
help the right hon. Gentleman. Warwickshire county 
council in my constituency is a pilot authority for best 
value. it has carried out its consultation exercise. It 
involved 60 public, statutory, community and voluntary 
sector organisations; all the council's partner agencies, 
and every household in the county.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> I am interested in that. It was a pilot, but 
will that be extrapolated into all best value processes? We 
should remember that reviews are supposed to be 
continuous. Subsection (1) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"A best value authority must make arrangements to secure 
continuous improvement in the way in which its functions are 
exercised".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I accept that the pilot may have been valuable. In north 
Yorkshire the county is consulting on increasing its 
council tax by an additional 3 per cent. above the 
Government guidelines because of the hopeless 
inadequacy of the settlement. The Minister and I have 
already had an exchange on that and we will doubtless do 
so again.
<P>
I want to know the quality and the width of 
consultation. I want to know its substance. I also caution 
the Minister again to be careful about representatives. As 
I said, the world is full of self-appointed ones, from the 
head of the supporters' club of Newcastle United in dire 
need at the moment to members of the Consumer 
Association. I hope that the Minister will help us on that 
matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Hayes </B>(South Holland and The Deepings): 
I want to speak to the amendments and, in particular, 
about already existing arrangements which oblige 
consultation for some authorities that are going to be 
appointed as best value authorities. I want to deal with the 
police authorities in that respect.
<P>
Under section 36 of the Police Act 1996, the Home 
Secretary has a general duty to exercise his powers
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"in such a manner and to such an extent as appears to him to be best 
calculated to promote the efficiency and effectiveness of the police."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Already, that throws up a concern about conflict or at 
least a sharp contrast between the powers and statutory 
responsibilities of the Home Secretary to provide an 
effective, efficient and appropriate service, and the powers 
that the Bill would confer on the Secretary of State. The 
Minister will no doubt want to comment on that, because 
the contradiction permeates the entire Bill.
<P>
In particular, section 96 of the Police Act 1996, 
replacing section 106 of the Police and Criminal Evidence 
Act 1984, requires each police area to make arrangements
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"for obtaining <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) the views of people in that area about matters concerning the 
policing of the area, and<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) their co-operation with the police in preventing crime in that 
area."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Inevitably, that will overlap significantly with the 
consultation under the Bill. Are we to believe that there 
will be two separate sets of consultation between the 
public and their representatives with respect to the 
policing of an area? Do the proposals in the Bill replace 
the current arrangements? [Interruption.] The Minister 
shakes her head and makes dismissive comments, but the 
position has not been made clear either in the explanatory 
notes or in the Bill.
<P>
In the informed press dealing with police matters 
which I guess the Minister does not read there has been 
some commentary about the problem of a contradiction 
between existing law and the Bill. Some concerns have 
been expressed about pressure on the independence of 
chief constables in dealing with operational matters. It is 
hard to separate best value criteria and appropriate 
performance targets from operational considerations.
<P>
In addition, a problem arises in the potential for 
damage to constabulary independence. You will know, 
Mr. O'Brien, of the extensive library of information that 
exists on the threat of the nationalisation of the police; 
the idea of creating a national police force conforming to 
common standards and centrally managed. I am 
concerned that the Bill, and particularly the additional 
requirement for consultation, takes us towards that, 
duplicates existing good practice in most of the country 
and does nothing for the quality of local policing or the 
morale of our excellent police forces.
<P>
<B>Mr. Owen Paterson </B>(North Shropshire): I should like 
to pursue the sensible comments of my right hon. Friend 
the Member for Skipton and Ripon about amendment 
No. 116. I should like practical examples of how the 
relevant provision will work. In my county of Shropshire 
a consultation process is under way because of the 
miserable local government settlement which has required 
the Liberal-Labour regime to consult around the county 
about whether the council tax should be increased by 
5 per cent., 9.9 per cent. the council's favoured 
solution or 15 per cent. At the first meeting four people 
turned up, one of which had a complaint about the 
council, which he said had dumped gravel on his drive. 
At the next meeting, 25 turned up. I understand that the 
next was slightly better attended, with 30 or 40 people 
present. Is that a satisfactory consultation process? Does 
that show that the people of Shropshire are interested? I 
think that they expect their elected representatives, whom 
they put in power, to make decisions and to present 
themselves at election time.
<P>
I am worried that unless we pass amendment No. 116, 
we shall be demeaning the role of a councillor. What is 
the point of putting oneself up for election, on a platform, 
with a programme and a set position on council tax, and 
then having to run round the county for every contract? 
We have heard from Warwickshire about the consultation 
of 60 organisations and every household. Will that happen 
every time waste disposal is put out to tender, or there is 
a change in the regime of the fire service? It is simply not 
practical and people do not want it.
<P>
We must consider the public. They do not want to be 
consulted and bothered with bits of paper. They will not 
reply. They want responsible councillors to present a 
serious programme at election, and then to implement that 
programme. Councillors with successful programmes will 
be re-elected.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The consultation process undermines the principles of 
local democracy and shows that the Liberal-Labour 
regime is ducking its responsibilities. It is an enormously 
expensive exercise, costing Shropshire £5,000 on its 
council tax. I therefore strongly support amendment
No. 116.

<P>

<B> Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am reminded of a speech delivered by 
the late, lamented Secretary of State for Trade and 
Industry.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman talking about 
his dad, David Jenkin?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> No, I am referring to the right hon. 
Member for Hartlepool (Mr. Mandelson), not ancestors 
and forebears. Some time before his elevation to the 
Cabinet, the right hon. Gentleman made a speech in which 
he said that the era of representative democracy was 
drawing to a close and that we were moving into a new 
period in which democracy would take place through the 
internet, consultations and focus groups.
<P>
The Government ignore the elected representatives of 
the House, as far as they can, and attempt to have a direct 
relationship with the people, calling themselves a people's 
Government. They operate focus groups, which is 
absolutely right, as modern political parties must be 
sensitive to public opinion. However, the Government 
seem to be confused about accountability that bypasses 
the democratically elected representatives of Parliament. 
That is reflected in their abuse of the referendum. They 
are resisting recommendations from the Select Committee 
on Trade and Industry that referendums should be 
regulated.
<P>
We must, therefore, be sceptical about the nature and 
purpose of consultation. Amendment No. 116 is linked to 
amendment Nos. 119 and 122. If consultation is to take 
place, we must be clear what we are consulting on. 
Amendment No. 116 would remove consultation on 
duties, which, as the Minister explained, are absolute. We 
sympathise with her objectives.
<P>
Clause 3(2) raises the matter of
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"how to fulfil the duty"	.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That puts the cart before the horse. Amendment No. 122 
proposes that the Secretary of State consult the authorities 
on their performance targets and objectives. His 
guidance not orders should be issued after 
consultation with those who will have to put it into effect. 
The consultation between best value authorities and others 
should concern the application of guidance. It should 
concern the application of objectives to performance 
criteria, not woolly ideas on applying the broad objectives 
of efficiency, effectiveness and economy. Such 
consultation would be more beneficial for local 
authorities.
<P>
I shall raise a further matter now to save time when we 
come to debate amendment No. 23.
<P>
Under amendment No. 122, proposed new subsection 
(7)(e) of clause 4 would ensure consultation with,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"employees of the best value authority who are or may be affected 
by the arrangements"	.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is ironic that that category is left out of the statutory 
provisions for consultation. I would be interested in the 
Minister's explanation of that. It is unwise to exclude that 
category because of European Community law, and the 
directives on the transfer of undertakings. The original 
directive applied to,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the transfer of an undertaking, business or part of a business to 
another employer as a result of a legal transfer or merger".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In our previous debate, we established that that applies to 
the undertakings that we are discussing.
<P>
The document continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the transferor and the transferee are required to inform the 
representatives of their respective employees of the reasons for the 
transferThe information must be provided and consultations take 
place in good time before the change in the business is effected."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Local authorities that fail to consult their employees will 
be in breach of the directive on undertakings. Yet the Bill 
does not specify that consultations with employees should 
take place.
<P>
The amendments would provide a better consultation 
structure. As my right hon. Friend the Minister for 
Skipton put it, about what will a local authority consult 
if not about ways of achieving the detailed performance 
criteria? Should not the Secretary of State be obliged to 
consult local authorities before setting the criteria? Will 
the criteria simply be imposed on local authorities with 
no obligation to consult? That would be in keeping with 
the Bill. Perhaps it is yet another characteristic of the 
Government that the Minister is reluctant to explain.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> Conservative Members have been 
round the houses. The hon. Member for Mole Valley said 
that the amendments were probing and somewhat mischievous. The clause intends to ensure that local authorities consult the people for whom they are 
responsible their constituents, the public about the 
duty of best value. I enjoyed hearing Conservative 
Members claim that the duty to consult the public was 
outside their comprehension. That shows the difference 
between the Government and the Opposition. The quality 
and value of our public services is enhanced when the 
public believe that they are at the centre of local 
authorities' consideration.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> No, I shall not give way now. I did 
not intervene in Conservative Members' speeches. The 
hon. Gentleman can return to the point when I have 
finished my speech.
<P>
The amendment would remove the requirement in 
clause 3 to consult service users and local taxpayers, and 
replace it with a refined version that would include an 
obligation in clause 4 to consult elected members and 
employees.
<P>
Who should best value authorities consult? Amendment 
No. 122 would add employees of best value authorities to 
the list. Local Government White Papers in England and 
Wales made it equally clear that properly trained and well 
motivated work forces have an important role in best 
value. I accept what the hon. member for Mole Valley 
said about TUPE. Indeed, I referred to that earlier. We 
expect best value pilots to pay proper regard to work 
forces. We also expect statutory guidance on consultation 
to address the manner in which best value authorities 
ensure that staff currently delivering services have an 
opportunity to play an active role in the delivery of best 
value.
<P>
That said, one of the underlying principles of best value 
is the statutory obligation of best value authorities to 
consult those people who use, pay for or are directly 
affected by the services that they provide in other words, 
the general public, the citizenry. Their interests must be 
paramount and outweigh the vested interests of others, 
however important, including those who are employed to 
provide services.
<P>
Amendment No. 122 also suggests that best value 
authorities should consult elected members of the 
authority. That betrays a lack of understanding of what 
consultation is designed to achieve under best value. Both 
the Green and White Papers in England and Wales made 
it clear that consultation is designed to inform the strategic 
choices that authorities make about how and at what level 
they exercise their functions. Those strategic choices 
must, in the first instance, be largely determined by 
members whose role is to give leadership and direction to 
the work of the authority.
<P>
I hope that the hon. Member for North Shropshire 
(Mr. Paterson) heard that explanation. We are enhancing 
local democratic structures, not tearing them down. Given 
that, it seems odd to provide that members who play a 
pivotal role in such strategic decisions should be under an 
obligation to consult. If nothing else, that would add an 
extra layer of unnecessary bureaucracy which we would 
do well to avoid. It would also suggest that hon. Members see the duty of best value as being another technical device. It is not a technical device. Best value is about 
producing a change of culture in authorities which will 
expose them to the public instead of allowing them to 
concentrate their activity in the town or county hall.
<P>
The second issue is to consider the practical effect on 
the legal framework of removing from clause 3 a 
requirement to consult on the general duty of best value, 
as amendment No. 116 would do, and to replace it with 
one placed in the context of performance indicators in 
clause 4, as amendments Nos. 119 and 122 would do. 
There is no doubt in my mind that that would be a 
retrograde step. We have carefully placed the duty of 
consultation in clause 3 to ensure that local people are 
given a voice in the crucial decisions that affect the 
strategic direction of the authority and the way in which 
it goes about fulfilling the duty of best value in broad 
terms. Removing that provision from its current place in 
the Bill might restrict the influence that local people could 
exert over the way in which their local authority went 
about setting its organisational goals. That is hardly 
conducive to local accountability and is at odds with our 
wider aim of bringing authorities closer to the 
communities that they serve.
<P>
I also see little merit in the proposed change to clause 4 
as set out in amendment No. 122. The amendment would 
require authorities to consult in a manner that is consistent 
with the broad provisions of clause 3, albeit with a view 
to ensuring that the approach of setting performance 
indicators is consistent with the requirements of the duty 
of best value. That is satisfactorily achieved in clause 
4(3)(a).
<P>
I circulated yesterday to members of the Committee 
background papers to assist them in their deliberations. 
I appreciate that hon. Members may not have had the 
opportunity fully to go through those, but I invite them to 
consider the report on and summary of a research project 
on public participation.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I draw hon. Members' attention to those parts of the 
report that show that participation is not as Opposition 
Members described it. Consultation now involves much 
more than simply holding public meetings. I often speak 
to councillors and officers in local government, and if 
anyone tries to persuade me that they have consulted 
effectively by holding a public meeting, I say, "well, try 
again."	 I know only too well from my own experience 
that that can be the least effective way to consult.
<P>
The report on the way that local government and local 
services are perceived, which includes research that was 
commissioned by the previous Administration, shows that 
local people want to be more involved and that they want 
to have more and more effective consultation. The 
report helps to identify how more effective consultation 
might be carried out, and it recognises that it is silly for 
central Government to prescribe the nature of 
consultation. Consultation should vary according to the 
nature of the service and to the nature of the locality in which that service is provided. That system is simple and straightforward, and I assure Committee members that we 
are not seeking to be devious or over-bureaucratic.
<P>
The key element that the report establishes is that 
authorities have to take strategic decisions about 
consultation. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Participation methods range from the `cheap and cheerful' to the 
elaborate and expensive. It is always possible to find one that 
matches the issue at hand given the constraints of context and 
budget."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The key challenge is strategic selection.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hayes:</B> The Minister has not yet addressed the 
fundamental question of how the new proposals interface 
with current statutory requirements to consult. She may be 
about to do so, in which case I apologise for intervening. 
I appreciate that many local authorities consult 
voluntarily. I take a slightly different view from one or 
two of my hon. Friends, in that I think that some 
consultation is quite positive. How do the proposals 
interface with existing statutory obligations to consult 
with best value authorities, which are currently obliged to 
go through such a process?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstong:</B> Authorities have to use common sense. 
The Bill does not say, "You must consult in this way on 
that aspect." It simply says, "You must consult."	 A 
statutory consultation might be carried out, and a proper 
view might be reached, but the authority might want to 
do something else. The right hon. Member for Skipton 
and Ripon alluded to the fact that consultation might 
involve a pressure group that did not in any way represent 
the public's view. The report states that if an authority 
consults representatives, it must be sure that they are truly 
representative. We should credit local councils with a bit 
of common sense. That is why we are making the Bill 
more flexible.
<P>
Our proposals will not involve a consultation process 
that is over-prescriptive, over-bureaucratic or, quite 
honestly, useless. Consultation will be effective, and the 
public will know that their contribution is critical to the 
way in which an authority pursues its duties. I urge the 
Opposition to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> I am rather disappointed. The 
Minister has taken the amendments and the thinking 
behind them as a vicious attack. In fact, they are meant to 
be helpful. I recognise that she has given members of the 
Committee the research document, which I have yet to 
receive it is probably waiting for me in my office. We 
have given her an opportunity to expand on the 
Government's thinking, to explain why particular groups 
were chosen and how we can anticipate some local 
authorities taking the wide spectrum of the Bill too far 
through fear of offending its provisions. She has been 
given the opportunity to give a more careful explanation.
<P>
My right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and 
Ripon outlined the skeleton of what local authorities will 
think when they get in at 9 o'clock on a Monday morning 
and are faced with the Act, which they have to get on 
with. They will be bemused and some will deliberately go 
over the top, especially when it comes to the review stage. 
This point is relevant to clauses 3 and 4.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Does my hon. Friend suppose that best 
value will apply to the function of consulting? Unless best 
value is carried out effectively, efficiently and 
economically, it will not fulfil the object of best value.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> Perhaps we should leave the CCT 
legislation in place for that aspect of consultation so that 
it is carried out properly and efficiently by a specialist 
organisation. I must be cautious. I have great admiration 
for more than 90 per cent. of councillors. Far and away 
most councillors and councils be have in the traditional 
spirit of local government, but a few do not. One of our 
concerns about best value is that it should drive the 
standard up, not average it out or average it down.
<P>
The Bill makes it possible, if not likely, that some 
incompetent authorities will find reasons and excuses not 
to raise their standards. For example, many of inner 
London's authorities have similar problems. They are 
required to produce similar services, but have distinctly 
different ways in which they provide them, resulting in 
different qualities and costs. Poorer authorities will use 
the consultation as an opportunity to cover their back, and 
that is not a rugby term.
<P>
We need better clarification so that we can understand 
more fully and I am sure that we will need to return to 
this matter. I am afraid that the aggression of the answer, 
when there was a request for clarification not so much 
for the Committee but for local government was an 
exceptionally poor response.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> We keep having general discussions. 
Will the Minister be specific and get back to the points 
made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton 
and Ripon? Can she cite an example of a consultation that 
she would find satisfactory? She has rubbished dear old 
Shropshire county council's decision to consult through 
public meetings. That is fine we understand that she 
does not like that, but how does she recommend 
consulting in a dispersed rural area with a thin population? 
Can she give a simple, practical example of what she 
would consider to be a satisfactory consultation for a 
waste disposal contract?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I am sorry that the hon. Member for 
Mole Valley thinks that I was aggressive he should see 
me when I am really aggressive. I never want to be 
aggressive, but I do want to be clear. As for the hon. 
Member for North Shropshire, I understand that what is 
going on in Shropshire is not just public meetings but a 
series of other events, including polling by an external 
organisation.
<P>
I am determined not to be drawn into saying what is 
and is not acceptable, because it is not for me to say. The 
issue must be sorted out locally. I am not going to sit in 
Whitehall and judge what every authority in this country 
is doing. Authorities must decide what is acceptable and 
they must meet the strictures of best value. Our advice 
will enable them to choose, on the basis of research, what 
is appropriate in different cases. I am not prepared to say 
what would satisfy me; what is more important is what 
would satisfy local people.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> What is the function of the guidance, then?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I have made it clear that the function 
of the guidance is to show authorities how to proceed. It 
is not intended to dictate what is right or wrong.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> We shall be coming back to the 
matter time and again, and I therefore beg to ask leave to 
withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard </B>(Taunton): I beg to move amendment 
No. 23, in page 3, line 16, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(e) representatives of persons employed directly or indirectly by 
the authority.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. O'Brien. I hope that 
you do not think that Liberal Democrats are usually silent 
for the first hour or so of the Committee. We simply felt 
that we should allow the previous debate to run its course.
<P>
The amendment, with which we will try to deal briefly, 
seeks to include employees in the list of consultees. 
I accept that employees could be included under 
subsection (2) (d), but they do not have to be included.
<P>
Earlier today, the Minister spoke of the importance of 
treating fairly those who deliver the service. However, 
unlike many other people, the clause does not specifically 
require employees to be consulted. Unlike others such as 
those who could use a service but do not, perhaps because 
they are unaware of it or do not need it, employees are a 
clearly identifiable group who are therefore easy to 
consult.
<P>
People on the front line of service delivery often have 
a valuable insight into the service, and can often suggest 
innovative ways of delivering service. Like businesses, 
most local authorities have suggestion boxes employees 
to put forward ideas on how services could be improved 
and money saved.
<P>
The view of the employee is not the only one, and 
perhaps not the most important one, but it should certainly 
be taken into account. The Government appeared to 
recognise that in their Green Paper, although that 
recognition was toned down a bit by the time we got to 
the White Paper. It has now disappeared altogether from 
the Bill. However, the Bill makes frequent mention of 
business, and I am worried that the Government are 
seeking totally to distance themselves from employees in 
future, and get into bed with their friends in business. 
I look forward to the Minister's explanation of why 
employees have been excluded from the list of people that 
authorities will have a duty to consult.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> As you know, Mr. O'Brien, I dealt 
with the matter during our consideration of the previous 
group of amendments, one of which was similar in nature.
<P>
The matter is simple: the duty of best value is to the 
citizen and the public. As I said, we accept that, in 
meeting the duty of best value, an authority should 
properly involve its work force. I do not believe that any 
good company could do so without involving its work 
force. However, as I also said, the primacy of the public 
should not be outweighed by any vested interest, however 
important or central it may be to the delivery of best 
value. The interests of the general public must be 
paramount. For that reason I cannot support the 
amendment.
<P>
We are talking about the duty of best value a duty 
owed by the council, including employees and 
councillors, to the public. Consulting employees in that 
respect places them outside the authority in terms of their 
responsibility to deliver best value. I cannot express 
strongly enough the fact that this duty is owed to the 
public: we cannot and will not move to include others in 
a more primary way.
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> I understand the Minister when she 
says that the primary duty is to the public. The clause lists 
people who pay council tax and people who have an 
interest in the authority's area as those who should be 
consulted. I contend that including employees in that list 
would not raise them above the public but would put them 
among those people who have an interest in delivering the 
best quality and best value services. I cannot understand 
why the Minister is so reluctant to include them I am not 
talking about raising them above the public, only about 
including them.

<P>

<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> We may well continue to disagree 
about this. Many employees will be residents and 
members of other organisations: in those respects they 
will be consulted. We need to be sure that their role as 
employees is a proper one. In order to deliver the duty of 
best value, any authority will have to involve its 
employees more than just consulting them in a real 
way. However, that does not mean that they have to be 
part of the duty that is owed to the public, which 
confuses matters.
<P>
I resist the amendment and ask the hon. Lady to 
withdraw it. As I pointed out this morning, employees 
will play a full part in the delivery without being tagged 
on to the public, which confuses the issue.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I have been listening to the debate with 
interest and believe that the Minister is on strong ground, 
given that the Committee has decided to leave aside the 
consultation on how precisely to fulfil the duty. In one 
respect, it would be wrong to consult employees: the 
exercise is about consulting consumers and council tax 
payers, not about creating a platform for producer 
interests or starting a campaign to keep the DSO in the 
hands of the local authority. If the Minister is serious 
about cracking down on some of the more recalcitrant 
Labour authorities, the power will be useful.
<P>
If the amendment proposed by the hon. Member for 
Taunton (Mrs. Ballard) were about consulting not on how 
to fulfil the duty but on how to satisfy performance 
criteria and how to deliver, we would support it. 
Furthermore, I do not understand how a best value 
authority can have a duty to consult employees who are 
not directly employed by the authority, as though it were 
an employer. The obligation to consult relates to the direct 
employers of such people. Some contractors in this 
country would be pretty annoyed if their employees 
suddenly started being consulted directly by local 
authorities. That would be an interference in their 
responsibilities. We are inclined to support the Minister 
on this issue.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> It goes beyond that. If an authority 
were involved in consultation with a party in a dispute 
between a company and its work force, it would be 
involved in the dispute. Some fascinating legal arguments, 
probably in court, might well work to the disadvantage of 
the local authority.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> That is an interesting scenario and 
possibly a real one. While there was a contractual dispute, 
the employees of the contractor would have an obligation 
of confidentiality to the employer and it would be quite 
wrong for the local authority to have a legal obligation to 
interfere in that contractual relationship between employer 
and employee. We do not want to create a platform for 
producer interest. If the hon. Member for Taunton divides 
the Committee, we will support the Government against 
the amendment.
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> I do not think it is creating a platform 
for producer interests to include employees among those 
who are to be consulted on how an authority is to achieve 
continuous improvement in the exercise of its functions. 
However, in view of the overwhelming numbers and the 
Labour-Tory pact in the Committee at the moment, I beg 
to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

Government new clause 7 Guidance.
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> As well as amendment No. 24, I wish 
to speak to amendments Nos. 25, 26, 86 and 98. These 
are probing amendments which are designed primarily to 
tease out the Government's view of the role of the Local 
Government Association as representative of local 
government in helping them prepare guidance. We believe 
that statutory guidance on consultation should be kept to 
a minimum. We have already had some debate about the 
nature of consultation, the type of consultation that is 
appropriate in different parts of the country or for 
different services or groups of users. I would certainly 
contend that local government in particular areas will 
always know better than central Government what is the 
best form of consultation.
103<P>
As the Minister said earlier, good practice guides have 
already been written on consultation. In common with 
other members of the Committee I was a member of local 
authorities for a number of years. I can remember when 
the local authority of which I was leader first talked about 
extending consultation beyond the standard public 
meeting and considered local referendums for example. 
Conservative councillors would always say, "You were 
elected and you should make decisions. Why pass the 
buck to the public?"	 It took a great deal of argument to 
persuade them that there was anything worthwhile in 
consulting the public and finding out their views in 
between election time.
<P>
We have moved on since those days 10 years ago and 
the LGA, the Local Government Information Unit and 
many others, including myself in a modest way, have 
written useful advice on consultation. One of the tasks of 
the new local government improvement agency will be to 
spread good practice in this area. Before issuing guidance 
on consultation, the LGA as a body that is representative 
of most tiers of local government should be consulted. 
Amendments Nos. 25 and 26 are designed to probe the 
Government on the difference, and this may be a genuine 
lack of understanding of the terminology, between 
persons who appear to represent the authority and persons 
who are representatives of the authority. I should have 
thought that representatives of the authority were elected 
representatives but could persons appearing to represent 
the authority be officers of the authority or some other 
people? I shall be interested to hear the Minister's 
response.
<P>
Amendment No. 98 is a consequential amendment. 
Amendment No. 86 probes why new clause 7 does not 
indicate that the Government should have regard to the 
outcome of the consultation or at least to give reasons 
why they are not taking it on board. The Government will 
probably explain that when they introduce it . This is very 
important. When anyone consults, they build up an 
expectation among those being consulted that they will be 
listened to. Perhaps, unfortunately, the public and others 
equate being listened to with getting their own way. If, as 
a result of the consultation process, they do not get what 
they want, they become cynical, saying, "They didn't 
listen to us in the first place; what was the point of that 
consultation?"	
<P>
When I was in local government I always argued that 
consulting did not necessarily mean that we did what 
people wanted us to do. The same applies with the 
Government, who are now consulting us on our views 
about the Bill. So far, they are not doing anything that we 
want them to do. If people who are consulted are not to 
become cynical and stop bothering to respond, the very 
least they need is to hear why they are not getting what 
they want, and a response to their views during 
consultation. People would be helped by knowing why 
they were not getting a positive response. The amendment 
is a probe to discover whether the Government will 
include in new clause 7 a commitment to reply to the 
consultation and explain why they were responding 
negatively.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bernard Jenkin </B>(North Essex): We also have 
amendments in this group. We understand the motivation 
of the hon. Member for Taunton to place this extra duty 
to consult the Local Government Association. We take 
the view that the Secretary of State should be in constant 
exchange with the LGA; a formal requirement to consult 
should not be necessary. Perhaps the LGA is pursuing a 
rather less adversarial role than before 1 May 1997. We 
welcome that, and assuming that we are in an era of less 
adversarial roles between local and central Government, 
we should like that relationship to continue. But I have 
profound doubts about whether it is necessary to specify 
that in the Bill.
<P>
Our amendments in this group are principally about 
first, transferring in the same way as the Liberal 
Democrats wish to do the issuing of orders to the 
issuing of guidance, which we think [Interruption.] In 
fact, I am talking to the wrong group of amendments. 
I apologise, Mr. O'Brien.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I was quite enjoying that.
<P>
This group of amendments is connected to guidance 
under the best value framework. The amendments 
comprise three main types. Amendments Nos. 24, 25, 26, 
86 and 98 are designed to ensure that the Secretary of 
State consults with the LGA or representatives of local 
government before issuing guidance. The Government's 
amendments remove general provisions setting out the 
Secretary of State's powers to issue guidance to best value 
authorities on the general duty, best value reviews, local 
performance plans and transitional arrangements 
respectively. I thought that the hon. Member for North 
Essex had risen to welcome them. The provisions are then 
consolidated in new clause 7, also a Government 
amendment, which is a new provision that mirrors the 
provisions abolished by amendments Nos. 51, 52, 53, 58 
and 66, and effectively consolidates them into one 
clause which deals with powers to issue guidance in 
respect of all aspects of part I of the Bill.
<P>
The new clause would replace the existing provisions 
of clauses 3(5), 5(8), 6(5), 10(5) and 18(4) although it 
would be drafted in the same terms as them. This would 
enable the Secretary of State to pull together issues 
referring to specific provisions in part I of the Bill such 
as reviews and plans. Subsection (3) of new clause 7 
provides an undertaking by the Secretary of State to 
consult the Audit Commission before issuing guidance 
under clause 10 of the Bill.
<P>
The new clause recognises that local authorities need 
general guidance to be issued in general terms to suggest 
ways in which they might carry out their functions and 
not be restricted by the aspect of best value procedures to 
which they relate.
<P>
The new clause provides the Secretary of State with the 
flexibility to issue guidance when required. I therefore 
urge hon. Members to agree to it. By withdrawing similar 
provisions on guidance in clauses 3, 5, 6, 10 and 18 and 
replacing them with one general power of guidance, we 
have streamlined the Bill's guidance powers and clarified 
the drafting. I hope that all hon. Members will welcome 
this change.
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
We have taken a power of general guidance covering 
all aspects of best value in part I, rather than separate 
powers on different aspects of that process. By doing so, 
we have recognised the way best value authorities 
approach best value in the real world. In many cases, they 
will wish to avoid a fragmented approach when work on 
performance plans is carried out separately from reviews 
and without reference to them. Many of them will aim to 
take an integrated approach, and our guidance must reflect 
this. It must also take account of important cross-cutting 
issues, such as equity sustainability, which we have 
already debated.
<P>
Our guidance addresses all these issues, reflects how 
authorities will act in practice, and improves the drafting 
of the Bill.
<P>
We do not support amendments that require 
consultation with the LGA or representatives of local 
government. Matters of general consultation are 
satisfactorily dealt with in Government new clause 7, 
which provides for consultation with local government 
representatives. I am anxious that we do not name only 
the LGA, which was formed after the election, when a 
number of associations came together. I must tell the hon. 
Member for Taunton that we would be in deep trouble if 
the Bill included the LGA, and not the National 
Association of Local Councils.

<P>

<B>Mr. Curry:</B> Does the Minister agree that it would be a 
good idea for the LGA to subject itself to a best value 
audit to discover whether it needs its interminable number 
of committees?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I will not be tempted down that route.
<P>
I shall resist amendments that constrain the Secretary 
of State's ability to consult with individual authorities or 
groups of authorities. Such amendments are short-sighted, 
given that, in some cases, the Secretary of State will wish 
to issue guidance to such groups, and will, of course, wish 
to consult them about that. Amendments, such as 
amendment No. 86, that would introduce a requirement to 
consider consultation when issuing guidance, are 
unnecessarily bureaucratic.
<P>
The hon. Member fro Taunton asked about the term 
"representatives appearing"	. It refers to the broadest 
category of consultees for whom no obvious route or 
representative emerges. We wished to ensure that the 
Bill's wording would enable organisations to put forward 
people who would not necessarily be democratically 
representative. The hon. Lady asked about having regard 
to the consultation. That is implicit in the Bill's wording, 
which, I am assured by my officials means that account 
must be taken of representations and that failure to do 
so could lead to judicial review. The word "consultation"	 
implies listening and "having regard to"	. Therefore, 
lawyers and drafter believe that the phrase is superfluous. 
I can see that the hon. Member for Taunton wants to 
intervene, but I am anxious to move on.
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> The Minister knows that most local 
authorities are reluctant to undertake a judicial review 
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I know one that is not.
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> Well, there may be one, but most are 
reluctant. I was a member of an authority that had three 
simultaneous judicial reviews, and we regretted that 
bitterly for many reasons. Local authorities would not 
have to consider such a procedure if the Government 
published their response to the consultation. Instead of 
simply confirming that the consultation reports had been 
read, perhaps they could explain to authorities to which 
they were unable to respond positively the reasons for 
that outcome.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I think that we are talking at cross 
purposes. We were discussing local authorities' 
responsibility to consult. Have I got the wrong bit? We 
are now considering the next clause I am sorry.
<P>
The Bill covers the hon. Lady's point. We used the 
normal wording of such measures. I hope that the hon. 
lady realises that we have to respond, and discuss the way 
in which we respond. As the right hon. member for 
Skipton and Ripon said, we shall do that next week in 
response to consultation on the settlement. If we accepted 
the amendment, the Bill would be longer and even more 
complex. We want to avoid that.
<P>
I hope that the hon. Lady will feel able to withdraw the 
amendment and that the Committee will support 
Government amendment No. 51.
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> I shall not press the amendment to a 
vote.
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Sanders:</B> The clause provides for the creation of 
the performance measurement framework, which will 
apply to the duty of best value. It grants the Secretary of 
State a discretionary power to prescribe by order 
performance factors and indicators against which best 
value authorities will be measured. The Secretary of State 
can also set national standards for the performance 
indicators that he or she prescribes. Best value authorities 
will have to meet the relevant standard to discharge the 
duty of best value satisfactorily.
<P>
Clause 4 also gives the Secretary of State discretion 
to specify different performance indicators and standards. 
That seems another unnecessary accumulation of powers. 
People have asked whether the clause has watered down 
considerably the provisions in the White Paper that give 
local authorities more flexibility to reflect local needs. 
The true arbiters of that are local authorities in 
consultation with local people, not the Secretary of State.
<P>
The clause gives the Secretary of State powers to 
specify performance factors and standards. The 
Association of Direct Labour Organisations and the Local 
Government Association are concerned that that is too 
tight. National definition will fail to take account of local 
difference. National targets are bound to reflect the 
priorities of central government, which might be different 
from those of the local community.
<P>
Let us take the example of local authority A, which 
considers 90 per cent. of planning applications in four 
weeks, but only ensures that 80 per cent. of those eligible 
for housing benefit receive their full entitlement. 
Following local consultation with council tax payers and 
other interested parties it is decided to allow the 
planning target to fall to 80 per cent. to ensure that benefit 
entitlement reaches 95 per cent. The Secretary of State 
then sets a national target of 85 per cent. for planning and 
98 per cent. for benefit entitlement. The council will thus 
fail the best value test on both counts and the consultation 
exercise having been undertaken at some expense will 
prove to have been a waste of time. Local choice will 
have been replaced by national diktat.
<P>
The Environment, Transport and Regional Affairs 
Committee report on best value identified another aspect. 
It recognised the tension between the need for a strong 
national framework and a desire for local flexibility and 
innovation. Wil the Minister explain how she intends to 
ensure that performance indicators will be relevant and 
take proper account of differences in local authority 
circumstances? We do not believe that that can be done 
without consultation between local government and other 
bodies. The Environment, Transport and Regional Affairs 
Committee did not believe that that could be done either. 
It recommended full consultation between local 
government, the Audit Commission and the Chartered 
Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy over national 
performance indicators.
<P>
The Government should clarify what performance 
indicators will be used in the best value framework prior 
to legislation. Those should be designed to incorporate 
cost, quality and public expectation and perception 
measures. Amendment No. 75 would remove the 
Secretary of State's powers to specify performance 
indicators and standards by order to allow local authorities 
the flexibility to reflect local needs.

<P>

<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Our amendment No. 117 is in many 
respects similar to Liberal Democrat amendment No. 75. 
It comforted me greatly that the Minister made a similar 
mistake earlier: we can shake hands across the divide over 
that. However, we may be kidding ourselves. I have taken 
legal advice on the legal effect of guidance issued by the 
Secretary of State and of an order, which is obviously 
more specific.
<P>
When a local authority wilfully defies reasonable 
guidance by the Secretary of State we should be aware 
that such guidance could well be used in a court of law 
and become binding. That underlines the problem of the 
Bill's structure which, in respect of the powers it confers 
on the Secretary of State to tell local authorities what to 
do, is difficult to ameliorate. We should be under no 
illusions: that is what the Bill is about.
<P>
Amendment No. 120 deals with subsection (2), which 
allows the Secretary of State to specify different 
performance indicators or standards for different 
functions, different authorities and at different times. This 
is the new aspect of the legislation which people would 
not expect to find from a decentralising Administration. 
It gives the widest possible discretion to the Secretary of 
State to bully some authorities and not others.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I said on Second Reading that this could be an 
invitation to cronyism. The danger of this kind of 
discretion is that authorities will want to keep in with the 
Secretary of State. They will want to keep in with the 
officials reporting to the Secretary of State. The officials 
will make it quite clear to the Secretary of State that they 
have these people taped and that the local authority is 
under control and they are not worried about it. An 
authority that falls out with the officials at the Department 
of the Environment, Transport and the Regions or the 
local government office in the area may find the Secretary 
of State using these powers to apply different criteria to 
different functions and different authorities.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> The history of local government 
is that some local authorities feel paranoid and picked on 
and any legislation that looks in any way subjective upsets 
them. We will see a good version of that on Thursday, as 
we do every year, when every local authority that gets a 
poor standard spending assessment feels that it has been 
picked on and that everything is being regeared for them. 
I am sure that Wandsworth will complain if it feels that 
there is a good reason and I suspect that there just could 
be looking at the way that inner London has been hurt 
on SSAs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> Not enough
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> I am ignoring that aside. 
Subjective appraisal in the legislation is intensely disliked 
by local authorities.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> My hon. Friend's intervention is 
extremely apposite. SSAs are constructed on a religiously 
strict formula. Even then, local authorities feel that the 
formula is adjusted and tweaked in order to favour some 
and not others. [Interruption.] Well, the Government have 
had two Budgets, two local authority settlements and still 
Westminster has one of the lowest council taxes in 
London as does Wandsworth. The twitches from the 
Government Benches on this question show that the scars 
run deep.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> It is scrupulously fair.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Well, we will see. This goes to the heart 
of the issue. In the amplification of performance standards 
and indicators we will see not a scrupulously fair 
application but a pick-and-choose law as the framework 
for the Secretary of State's intervention into the affairs of 
local authorities. It will not just be into each local 
authority but into each function of each local authority 
and at different times.
<P>
Amendment No. 120 removes that discretion by 
deleting subsection (2) and replaces it later in the clause 
with what we think is at least a fairer and more open 
system of applying this kind of pressure to local 
authorities. Direct pressure from the Secretary of State is 
what is being applied to local authorities.
<P>
Amendment No. 123 says that the Secretary of State 
may issue different guidance to different authorities. But 
where he does that he must
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"consult with the authorities concerned" <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
which seems fair and must provide reasons for the 
different guidance and
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"arrange for that guidance to be published."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We are in the era of open government and it would be 
helpful perhaps [Interruption.] Irony never works in 
Parliament, does it? I should say that this Government say 
that we are in the era of open government. It would be 
nice to think that this kind of information will be readily 
available to readily published. Perhaps the Minister could 
respond to that point. We think it particularly important 
that there should be openness in all matters where the 
Secretary of State has such wide discretionary powers.
<P>
Amendment No. 124 expands the problem that the 
Minister singularly failed to cover earlier. I wonder 
whether it will be fruitful to try to have another debate on 
this topic. The amendment lists the major EC laws that 
have considerably influenced the atmosphere surrounding 
contracting for public services between local authorities 
and their contractual providers. I refer the Committee to 
the extracts from the legal text book that I read out earlier. 
Contracts can be deemed to exist between two entities 
owned by a public authority, where a public authority has 
a relationship with what we call a public undertaking.
<P>
We have no idea from the Minister's explanation I 
am genuinely seeking ministerial advice on this 
question how the directives and the regulations that flow 
from them will apply to the best value procedure. We 
think that, for the avoidance of doubt, all these measures 
should be specified in the Bill as applicable and the 
Minister should explain how they are applicable, because, 
whether or not they are in the Bill, they are applicable. It 
is not good enough for the Minister to say "We don't 
need to worry about how it will work, because they are 
applicable. We shall just let the authorities get into their 
judicial reviews"	, which are so loved and hated by the 
hon. Member for Taunton. We should make it clear that 
these issues are extremely important and central to the 
process of best value, unless the Bill is about trying to 
abolish the relationship between contractors and enablers 
that is evident in existing competitive tendering.
<P>
Amendment No. 125 seeks to leave out subsection (4), 
which contains two extraordinarily strong lines of 
legislation. They read:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"In exercising a function a best value authority must meet any 
applicable performance standard specified under subsection (1)(b)."	
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Bill places an absolute, legal obligation to meet 
performance standards. In that respect it is every bit as 
draconian as competitive tendering, and probably more so, 
because competitive tendering applied only to a limited 
number of local authority functions. The obligation to 
meet the performance standards set down by the Secretary 
of State without consultation or explanation, with 
different performance standards for different functions 
and different authorities, applying at different times is 
absolute and legal. That is why we and the Liberal 
Democrats joined on Second Reading to describe the Bill 
as the final nationalisation of local government. The hon. 
Member for Warwick and Leamington (Mr. Plaskitt) 
laughs, but I should like to know when he is going to 
contribute to our discussion. Apart from the hon. Member 
for Northampton, North, who made a distinguished 
contribution, Labour Back Benchers have been silent.
<P>
We are transferring major powers to the Secretary of 
State, and the Minister periodically makes it very clear 
that the Government intend to use those powers to reach 
those local authorities that the previous Government could 
not reach through the CCT procedure.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hayes:</B> With typical generosity, my hon. Friend 
is being rather liberal with the Government. He made a 
comparison with CCT but he omitted to mention the fact 
that that procedure essentially affected the process rather 
than the outcome, whereas the Bill deals with and sets 
the outcome. In that sense, the Bill's provisions are far 
more draconian and centralising than any measure 
introduced by the previous Government. The Bill truly 
involves the nationalisation of local government and, 
incidentally, the nationalisation of police authorities and 
police forces.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> That is a very interesting comment. I do 
not think that even the Secretary of State for Health, for 
example, sets national standards that are legally binding 
on hospital trusts. Obviously, there are legal obligations 
on medical staff 
<P>
<B>Ms Sally Keeble </B>(Northamption, North): The hon. 
Gentleman should examine the health of the nation 
performance targets, which were set by his party when it 
was in government, and compare them with the Bill's aim, 
which is to protect standards for the public. Exactly the 
same issues are involved. When the hon. Gentleman's 
party was in government it did what the Bill proposes to 
do, and I should add that I supported the previous 
Government in their efforts to set health standards.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I may be wrong I stand to be corrected 
if I am but my understanding is that the health of the 
nation targets were targets that the previous Government 
set themselves. I do not think that they involved particular 
outcomes to particular activities in particular hospitals, let 
alone different targets for different hospitals at different 
times, which is the Government's proposal.
<P>
However, the comparison is interesting. Local 
authorities are meant to be independent of local 
government. There is no pretence that the national health 
service is anything other than a single national health 
service, but local authorities are meant to have an 
independent life of their own councillors are meant to 
have brains and to be allowed to use them.
<P>
The Bill suggests that the Government did not mean 
what they said on the election hustings about 
decentralising. It will be left to the Conservative party 
working, perhaps, with other parties, and possibly with 
some Labour Back Bench Committee members to bring 
about the rejuvenation of local government. Local 
government ultimately needs the decentralisation of 
power from the centre, rather than the accrual of more 
and more power at the centre, which the Bill and, in 
particular, the clause will bring about.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hayes:</B> I have been excited to contribute to this 
part of our proceedings [Interruption.] I notice the glee 
with which my comment is greeted by Labour Members.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for North Essex was 
absolutely right to point to the prescriptive nature of the 
clause's provisions. Perhaps the time has come for us to 
set out our stall and to clarify where we stand. I believe 
that there has been a misapprehension. More uniform 
government, which is based around uniform targets, is an 
ambition that is questioned by the vast majority of hon. 
Members on both sides of the House. Surely we want 
diverse local government, which has the ability to 
innovate and to excite its electors so that different 
local authorities and different parties within local 
authorities can differentiate and offer real choices to 
local people. We do not want uniform targets that are set 
by a Secretary of State. I realise that the Minister spent a 
couple of years on Durham city council 
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> No.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hayes:</B> Well, I stand corrected, but that is what it 
says in the Minister's biography.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I served on the county council.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hayes:</B> I beg the Committee's pardon, 
Mr. O'Brien.
<P>
The Secretary of State might have no personal 
experience of local government. These targets, this 
draconian measure, this uniformity and nationalisation are 
a slap in the face for those of us who believe in local 
democracy and the right of local authorities to deliver 
with flair and innovation a particular service appropriate 
to their locality. Labour Members should realise what 
their Government are doing. I do not agree with the 
Government I would not have agreed had the 
Government been Conservative. [Laughter.] I would not 
have agreed with them because I believe that local 
democracy is an important part of our democratic 
infrastructure.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for North Essex was right. 
He spoke with typical generosity and moderation, but I 
wanted to put the issue into sharper focus because it is 
important that the real friends of local government stand 
up and expose the Bill for what it is.
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> It might help the Committee if I 
explain and set out the policy behind the clause which, 
having listened to the two previous contributions, I shall 
try to do with a straight face. I am sure that with your 
long experience in this House, Mr. O'Brien, you will 
appreciate how difficult it is to do that sometimes.
<P>
To deliver best value, authorities will need to establish 
priorities. To do that, they will need to know what others 
think of their performance and how it compares with that 
of other authorities. They will also need to identify where 
improvements are needed. To help authorities achieve 
that, the Government will, as part of best value, introduce 
a new performance framework. Pages 67 to 69 of the 
White Paper, which I circulated to members of the 
Committee yesterday, set out our thinking. Hon. Members 
might also wish to refer to figure 7 on page 65 which 
illustrates the best value performance management 
framework.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> Just a small point. Will the 
Minister recognise that many of us have not received or 
seen those papers? Perhaps she might expand on what is 
in them rather than assuming that we know what they 
contain.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I do not want to test the tolerance of 
either the Chair or the Committee. I appreciate that hon. 
Members may not have received the papers, but I know 
that members of the Committee are thoroughly prepared 
for our proceedings and I am sure that the hon. Gentleman 
has seen the White Paper.
<P>
Performance indicators are a measure of an authority's 
performance. Where appropriate, performance standards 
will set out the minimum acceptable level of service 
provision. Performance targets will set out what level of 
performance the authority needs to achieve within a 
specified time.
<P>
We have been considering three tiers of performance 
indicators. First, a small set of general health indicators 
to show how authorities measure up as democratic 
institutions and service providers. Those should provide a 
snapshot of where authorities stand on a small set of key 
dimensions. Secondly, a relatively small number of 
national indicators, specified by the Government but 
developed in consultation with local government, the 
Audit Commission and others. I expect those indicators to 
be significantly fewer than the 238 currently prescribed 
by the Audit Commission. They will focus as far as 
possible on outcomes rather than inputs and will be 
designed to reflect the national interest in local 
performance. Again, I do not apologise for making the 
national interest explicit. We are attempting to rationalise 
what already exists as well as plug the gaps where 
necessary.
<P>
Before imposing a new requirement on authorities, the 
Government will consult widely with local government, 
the Audit Commission and other interested parties. 
Reference was made to organisations such as CIPFA, 
which would of course, be an interested party in some of 
these indicators. We will hold a series of seminars with 
interested bodies during the spring to discuss performance 
indicators. We will then issue a formal consultation 
document in the summer. Like the Audit Commission, 
which, last summer, consulted a wide range of bodies 
about the publication of its information direction for 1998, 
which specified performance indicators for the financial 
year 1999-2000, we expect to consult a wide range of 
bodies. Indicators cannot and will not be developed in 
isolation.
<P>
Thirdly, the majority of other indicators will be 
developed locally. I expect locally set indicators greatly 
to outweigh national indicators in terms of numbers. 
Authorities will be encouraged to develop their own 
indicators to suit local circumstances.
<P>
The Audit Commission will retain its powers to specify 
indicators under the Audit Commission Act 1998. I would 
expect it to set indicators that will provide contextual data 
that will supplement the national set of indicators. The 
Government will seek to agree a memorandum of 
understanding with the Audit Commission to make the 
respective roles clear.
<P>
In some service areas, the Government will set 
standards, which authorities will be required to meet. 
Some of them may have statutory basis already. An 
example is food standards, where standards are set 
nationally, and authorities are aware that they must meet 
them. An authority that fails to meet a standard will be 
judged to have failed the test to best value for that service.
<P>
<B>Ms Keeble:</B> Perhaps I can, by way of example, produce 
Northamptonshire county council's performance plan. In 
terms of local targets and performance setting, and the 
democratically achieved objectives that I am sure we all 
want local authorities to set, it puts into practice exactly 
the sort of principles that the Minister has described.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> My hon. Friend represents a 
constituency that is within a best value pilot area. We, 
too, are learning by the experience of best value pilots. 
Today, or perhaps it will now be tomorrow, hon. 
Members will be sent an interim report of those pilots, 
which will illustrate some of the lessons that are being 
learnt. That report reached the Department only during the 
past few days.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The Minister mentioned the performance 
standard that the Secretary of State may lay down in 
respect of food. What other standards might be laid down? 
Does the Minister agree that, as framed in the clause, they 
are absolutely binding? Could she also explain whether 
there will be standards on empty council homes, the 
cleanliness of streets or the effectiveness of waste 
disposal? Are they the sort of things for which there will 
be national standards, by which local authorities will be 
bound?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I have made it clear that we will 
consult widely on the matter, and reflect on the findings. 
I shall give an example of an indicator that we are 
considering. We propose to set a date by which authorities 
should ensure that, for five, six and seven-year-olds, class 
sizes do not exceed thirty. However, standards will be set 
for only a small proportion of services, and the 
Government do not intend to impose a large number of 
new standards.
<P>
Clause 4 will allow the Secretary of State to specify 
performance indicators and standards for best value, and 
to do so by order. It will allow him to specify different 
indicators and standards for different authorities, and for 
them to be applied at different times; to aim to promote 
improvements in the way authorities carry out their 
functions, having regard to a combination of economy, 
efficiency and effectiveness and to have regard to the 
views of the Audit Commission in developing those 
indicators and standards.
<P>
The Bill makes it clear that best value will embrace the 
principles of economy, efficiency and effectiveness. The 
performance measurement framework of best value will 
underpin those principles by reporting on five dimensions: 
strategic objectives, cost and efficiency, service delivery 
outcomes, quality and fair access to services. Clause 4 
does not deal with targets, which will be set when 
authorities carry out best value reviews. Targets and all 
functions will be set out in best value performance plans, 
including those for functions where best value reviews 
have not yet been carried out.
<P>
Under clause 5, the Secretary of State will issue 
guidance to authorities, setting out how they should 
conduct those best value reviews, including issues about 
how targets should be set. Auditors will check that the 
targets set are reasonable and consistent, which might help 
the hon. Member for North Essex. In practice, the targets 
will be set by best value authorities. Several factors will 
need to be taken into account, including resources, the 
views of local people and any minimum requirements for 
improvement set out by the Government.
<P>
As mentioned earlier, page 69 of the White Paper 
states, that, as a minimum, the Government will require 
authorities to set indicators specified nationally by the 
Secretary of State; and set targets over five years for 
cost-efficiency and quality, which are consistent with 
what the top 25 per cent. of authorities are achieving. We 
shall set out additional requirements where sensible and 
feasible to do so.
<P>
I have sought to explain why clause 4 is an essential 
part of the best value framework. I should now like to 
move on to the amendments because I was becoming 
fearful

<P>

<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Before the hon. Lady moves on, will she 
give way?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I really should move on to the 
amendments. I am likely to cover some of the issues on 
which the hon. Gentleman wants to intervene.
<P>
This group of amendments would remove a number of 
provisions within the Bill which would allow the 
Secretary of State to make orders in respect of 
performance indicators and standards, best value reviews 
and best value performance plans. Instead, the 
amendments provide only that the Secretary of State 
should issue guidance.
<P>
It is essential that the performance of all best value 
authorities can be measured and compared on the basis of 
a national suite of best value performance indicators that 
properly reflect the national interest. Of course, not all 
indicators and standards will apply to all authorities at the 
same time. But where they do, there should be no 
discretion for authorities to opt in or out of the 
arrangements.
<P>
Hon. Members look perplexed, but it would not be 
sensible or possible to impose a national standard for class 
sizes on shire districts, because shire districts have no 
responsibility for schooling. Hence we must ensure the 
ability to specify different aspects to different groups of 
classes of authority.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am amazed that the Minister has used 
class sizes as an example. In my own county of Essex 
the education settlement is considerably less generous 
than in many other authorities. However, being a 
Conservative-controlled authority at the moment, we end 
up with the Prime Minister denigrating our county in 
the House, regardless of the financial disadvantages.
<P>
It will be within the power of the Secretary of State to 
set a standard for Essex county council to meet its 
obligations yet to take a more benign view of some of 
the worst local authorities in inner London without any 
requirement to provide reason or explanation. It is 
astonishing because the Government were elected on the 
opposite platform of giving power back to local 
authorities. The Minister needs to examine the problems 
that occur as classes reach the limit of 30 pupils. Such 
limits may prevent younger brothers or sisters entering a 
particular school, so that they have to go to another 
school.
<P>
<B>Mr. Graham Allen </B>(Nottingham, North): That happens 
in private schools.
<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am not talking about private schools, 
but about state primary schools. The Government Whip is 
exhibiting old Labour prejudices. He appears to be 
reading a sales manual: I do not know whether that is in 
order. The Minister must justify her draconian powers to 
her colleagues. She has already given the example of class 
sizes. Will she give further examples of standards? What 
is the difference between a performance indicator, a 
standard and a target?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I have learnt that it is not sensible to 
give way to the hon. Gentleman, because he makes a 
speech that does not relate to my comments. All education 
authorities will have the same education standards.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> That is not what the Bill says.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> The clause states precisely what I said 
earlier. The hon. Gentleman is simply trying to score 
political points. I do not blame him for doing so, but local 
government deserves a little more respect.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> No. I have made it clear that I intend 
to proceed.
<P>
It is essential that issues addressed in clause 4 have the 
force of law. Of course, the Government would consult 
widely with local government, the Audit Commission and 
others before imposing a new requirement on best value 
authorities. National performance indicators and standards 
will reflect national priorities. If that is not so, how can 
people judge whether those priorities are being properly 
assessed at a local level?
<P>
<B>Mr. Sanders:</B> Surely it is for electors to determine 
through the ballot box whether a local authority achieves 
the correct level of performance? That level should not be 
imposed by the Secretary of State.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> Education is a national issue: 
14.5 million electors expressed their wish to have class 
sizes of 30 or below for five, six and seven-year-olds. 
My responsibility as a Minister is to ensure that we 
develop a framework for local authorities to deliver the 
achievements that local people voted for. That is in
the national interest. The hon. Member for Torbay
(Mr. Sanders) does not accept that the Government do 
not have any role in the interests of local government, 
but I hold a different opinion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Sanders rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> This is the last time that I am giving 
way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Sanders:</B> A school in a participatory 
neighbourhood may have volunteers ready to become 
classroom assistants and give a lot of one-to-one tuition. 
In another area, where people are not free to volunteer 
their services and where schools cannot deliver the same 
level of education, a limit of 30 pupils to one teacher may 
have to be imposed. However, the school with volunteers 
could have a limit of 35 pupils per class and those pupils 
would receive an equally good education.Why does a 
limit have to be imposed from the top?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> It was a manifesto commitment. 
I remind the Committee that 14.5 million people voted 
for it. In the 1997 general election, my party did better 
than any party this century, and the Conservative party 
did worse than any party this century. Opposition 
Members are asking me to deny specific commitments 
that we gave to the electorate. They know that they are 
on a loser, as 14.5 million people demonstrated.
<P>
In cases where there is a national interest, we have an 
over-arching need for consistency of approach. We have 
therefore opted to provide an approach based on orders, 
precisely to deal with the mischievous points that the hon. 
Member for north Essex made.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I have made it clear that I will not 
give way again.
<P>
We seek to promote a diversity and flexibility of 
approach which reflects local circumstances, and we shall 
do so via the guidance route. We shall issue guidance on 
the form, content, procedures and timing of a best value 
review. There is an over-arching need to ensure that, when 
performance indicators and standards are applied, they are 
applied consistently. Orders are, of course, subject to 
parliamentary scrutiny in a way that guidance is not. For 
these reasons, clause 4(1) should enable the Secretary of 
State to specify indicators and standards via an order, and 
clause 4(2), which provides flexibility in the use of 
the orders, should similarly be retained. I cannot accept 
the amendments, which would serve to undermine one of 
the cornerstones of local government modernisation.



<P>
Amendment No. 92 would remove the powers of the 
Secretary of State to issue guidance on the form, content 
and manner of publication of best value performance 
plans. I have said that, where we seek to promote diversity 
and flexibility of approach that reflects local 
circumstances, we are approaching this via guidance. That 
applies in this case. Appropriate guidance such as good 
practice arising from the work being done by the best 
value pilots will, I am sure, be invaluable in building on 
the effectiveness of performance plans.
<P>
Amendment No. 117 would, additionally, have the 
effect that, in issuing guidance, the Secretary of State 
should aim to improve the way in which best value 
authorities exercise functions, having regard to a 
combination of economy, efficiency and effectiveness. 
The Secretary of State would also be able to issue 
different guidance to different authorities. Both these 
matters are already provided for in subsections (2) and (3) 
of clause 4.
<P>
The thrust of the amendments to clauses 5 and 6 is 
similar. Best value reviews are a key element of the whole 
best value process, providing for review of all functions 
and the setting of targets for improving performance. The 
way in which the reviews are conducted will therefore be 
central to the improvements that are made. Our intention 
is that best value authorities should fundamentally review 
all functions over a period, probably five years. It is 
essential that all best value authorities complete a full 
cycle of reviews for all their functions, in a timely fashion, 
so that targets for improving performance can be set and 
improvements brought about early.
<P>
I recognise that authorities should have some discretion 
in undertaking their own review programme, but there 
will, none the less, be a need to ensure a consistent 
approach on the core requirements for example, the four 
Cs: challenge, compare, consult, compete. It is essential 
that all authorities address certain key elements in 
carrying out reviews and that they genuinely challenge 
the status quo. [Interruption.] Opposition Members do not 
wish us to concentrate on early-years education.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> On point of order, Mr. O'Brien. We are 
trying to have a debate. The Minister makes wild 
accusations about us and we are not allowed to respond.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> That is not a point of order.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> We can be sure that those 
improvements will be achieved across the board, and that 
proper comparisons are made between authorities on a 
common basis, only if the main requirements are 
established by statutory instrument, and not through the 
flexibility of guidance.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hayes:</B> I am grateful to the Minister, who has 
given way often during our proceedings.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> Not to me.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hayes:</B> Not recently
<P>
The Minister made appoint about comparability. Why 
is it necessary to compare local authorities, which serve 
different communities in different parts of the country? 
Local needs differ greatly, and local authorities are 
sensitive to the needs of their electorates. Why do the 
Government worship the false idol of comparability? I 
accept that the Government are not the first to do that 
the trend was probably established after the war but why 
does the measure exacerbate that trend?

<P>

<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> Labour Members find that 
extraordinary because the previous Government 
introduced such practices.
<P>
It is clear that local people want to know whether 
services are more effective in other areas and, if so, how 
their authority will change matters. This morning, the hon. 
Member for Meriden (Mrs. Spelman) said that local 
people often did not have the experience and knowledge 
of how things could be done differently. I want to ensure 
that people have information on which to assess whether 
they are receiving the best from local services.

<B>Mr. Hayes:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> No. I have dealt with the point, and I 
want to move on.
<P>
The importance of local performance plans to the best 
value process and the need for consistency make it 
necessary for some specifications to be established 
through statutory instrument. Consistency is necessary 
because of the close relationship between local 
performance plans and the performance indicator 
framework, which has national and local elements. Local 
performance plans are also related to best value reviews, 
which have national features.
<P>
Key elements of local performance plans need to be 
specified to allow local people to compare the 
performance of their best value authority with that of 
others. We must ensure that local people have enough 
information on which to judge. The best value 
performance plan will be the principal way in which 
authorities are held accountable to local people. We can 
achieve consistency in accountability only if the 
requirements are established by statutory instrument. An 
order would list specific elements that authorities would 
need to include in their plans. Guidance would offer 
flexibility but would not have the same force.
<P>
Clause 4(2) allows different indicators and standards 
for different functions, in different authorities at different 
times. Amendment No. 120 would remove that flexibility, 
so that all indicators and standards would apply to all best 
value authorities simultaneously, or to none. Neither 
option is sensible. Different authorities carry out different 
functions at different times. Indicators and standards will 
often relate to specific functions, and, therefore, they can 
apply only to authorities that carry them out in the period 
that the indicators and standards cover.
<P>
Amendment No. 120 would also remove the flexibility 
to specify standards for the future, and would restrict our 
ability to effect our commitments in the local government 
White Papers to improve local authorities' efficiency 
and quality.
<P>
Amendment No. 124 would require the Secretary of 
State to take account of the various agreed EC
public procurement directives when issuing guidance.
I appreciate that hon. Members want reassurance that 
those directives will continue to apply when best value is 
in place. The directive set out a procurement method 
which contracting authorities must use when letting 
certain categories of contract with a value above a 
specified threshold. The Government wish to see local 
authorities following good procurement practice, which is 
why clause 17 allows for the amendment of section 17 of 
the Local Government Act 1988, which prevents them 
from having regard to certain specified non-commercial 
matters. We will have a full discussion of those provisions 
in due course.
<P>
Let us make it clear that we intend to use the powers 
in the Bill to promote good procurement practice in the 
interest of best value, not to weaken the safeguards against 
abuses of contract compliance. Any change will have to 
be consistent with EC procurement rules and the 
Government's procurement policy. Best value will not 
affect the application of EC public procurement and 
acquired directives in UK law. Of course, the Secretary 
of State and the National Assembly for Wales will have 
regard to all current legislation when he acts under 
clause 4.
<P>
Amendment No. 90 would require best value 
authorities to reflect sustainable development, and, in 
particular, an authority's local agenda 21 strategy in this 
best value performance plan. We have made clear out 
commitment to principles of sustainable development. 
Our White Paper on local government confirmed our 
manifesto commitment to place a new duty on local 
authorities to promote the social, economic and 
environmental well being of their areas.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Caroline Spelman (Meriden):</B> On a point of 
order, Mr. O'Brien. Is it possible to move an 
Adjournment motion?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> We must allow the Minister to finish 
her contribution.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Further to that point of order,
Mr. O'Brien. If it is the Government's intention to extend 
this sitting, it has not been discussed through the usual 
channels. if that is the intention, may we have a motion? 
I understood that the Committee was set to rise at 7 pm.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allen:</B> It may be for the convenience of the 
Committee that we adhere to the sittings motion, which 
suspends the Committee at 7 pm. It may also be for the 
convenience of the Committee to let hon. Members know 
that the Lord President and Leader of the House talked
today about the so-called half-term break, which for the 
House, will be on 17, 18 and 19 February. Hon. Members 
may appreciate it if I move a motion before then to 
suspend our morning and afternoon sitting on the 
Thursday. With your good offices, Mr. O'Brien, I intend 
to do so prior to that date.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am advised that the sittings motion 
does not apply to the end of the afternoon sitting. The 
Government Whip needs to move an Adjournment 
motion.
<P>
Debate adjourned. [Mr. Allen.]
