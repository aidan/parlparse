<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The amendment introduces a debate though I suspect that the Minister will say that there is an implied introduction in the Bill on concepts of non-discrimination. It is notable that the Government have set out many things in the Bill that will take place and a large number of elements of potential discrimination that will not take place under the Bill. [Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I shall take the opportunity provided by that natural break to welcome back the Minister of State, Department of Trade and Industry. We were sorry that he was not able to be with us earlier, particularly because of his reasons. We are pleased that he is back. The Under-Secretary will not take it amiss if I say that she coped well in his absence but is pleased to see him back.
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Department of Trade and Industry (Mr. Ian McCartney):</B> That is why I rushed back.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I could not possibly comment.
<P>
I need not speak at great length on the substance of this matter. The Government have prescribed a single national minimum wage expressed as an hourly rate for a pay reference period. They preclude a number of elements of discrimination in the areas in which that will be paid. Different sectors of employment, different occupations, the size of businesses and persons of different ages are all matters that have been touched on and which may be touched on again.
<P>
When first I read the Bill on my hasty accession to this area of concern [laughter.] I do not know why hon. Gentlemen should laugh; I have taken an interest over the years, but my accession has sharpened it. I was immediately struck by the absence of a general anti-discrimination clause. The Minister for Small Firmswell knows, but I should put it on the record as it would become apparent quickly if I did not, that I am not a lawyer, as she and my hon. Friend the Member for Solihull are. I defer to their greater expertise, as I can go no further than my daughter's Inns of Court law school notes.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> Will my hon. Friend give way?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Not, I hope, on anything other than the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> In response to what my hon. Friend said about not being a lawyer, I should like to share a thought with you very briefly, Mrs. Dunwoody.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Very briefly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> My hon. Friend offers a false disclaimer. Everyone in the Committee is a Member of Parliament and is, in my view, equally well capable of addressing the issue. Some of us just happen to be lawyers, which is probably a disadvantage.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Now that we have established who we all are, I hope that we can get on with the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> That is a splendid idea, Mrs. Dunwoody, and I concur.
<P>
The amendment's purpose is to proscribe discrimination in respect of
"persons of different sexes, ethnic origins or religious faiths."
<P>
That is designed to mirror the provisions of current anti-discrimination legislation. There may be views across the Committee that that legislation is not generically exactly what we should like. If Ministers said that, I should have some sympathy. We may need to return to the effects of that legislation later.
<P>
The amendment would remove any question of discrimination relating to
"persons of different sexes, ethnic origins or religious faiths."
<P>
I am not, of course, suggesting that the Government want to do that. We may have to beat the Government about the head from time to time, but I do not argue that their intentions are offside.
<P>
I suspect and in some ways I rather hope that the Government will argue that the amendment is redundant because the provision is implicit in the Bill and explicit in other pieces of legislation. If they want to include the provision explicitly in the Bill, the amendment is the best way to do so.
<P>
The argument for doing so is clear we do not wish to discriminate on the grounds of gender. I must say but only briefly, Mrs. Dunwoody, bearing in mind your strictures that I have a lively interest in women's rights and in women's employment issues because of the simple fact that I have one wife and three daughters. I therefore live in an 80 per cent. female household. If I did not take an interest in such matters, I should suffer for it. I am pleased that my daughters have set about making serious careers and that concessions have not been made to them. No concession should ever be made to them, and they should never be patronised.
[Mr. Boswell]
<P>
I make substantially the same points in relation to ethnic origin. Members on both sides of the Committee deplore and deprecate any suggestions that individuals should be discriminated against on the grounds of race. If one is choosing an ethnic origin for Boswell one has two options I hope that this will not offend the Minister one can either be a Scottish Boswell or a gipsy. Those in the know assert that the Boswells who are from the midlands gipsy stock are, on the whole marginally, and by a short head the more respectable. My roots are found there, and we all know what happened to gipsies and to the Jews and others in Hitler's Germany. We do not want that world we do not want racial discrimination.
<P>
More complex issues are raised when I say that we do not want discrimination because of a person's religious faith. I do not for a moment think that the Government support such discrimination if they did, I should deeply deprecate that. We must ensure that it does not occur. I suspect that the Government will ensure that it does not by referring to settled and, to be honest, untidy law especially to the Sexual Discrimination Act 1975 and the race Relations Act 1976.
<P>
The situation regarding religious faith is more complicated because British law does not have a general religious anti-discrimination provision. Perhaps we should have but I should incur your strictures, Mrs. Dunwoody, if I were to discuss that matter in more detail. I also believe that discrimination is precluded on the ground of marital status but, again, I suspect that my discussion of that matter might range too widely. I hope that the Minister will respond to that point during this debate.
<P>
The existence of that legislation may be sufficient to secure these provisions; I notice that the Minister for Small Firms is nodding, and we will listen carefully to what she has to say. On the basis that there is no difference of approach among members of the Committee we share the common goal of wanting to remove discrimination from the areas that I have specified I hope that we use the debate to reach a common understanding.
<P>
I should like to touch on some wider issues, especially but not exclusively with regard to sexual discrimination. I expect that all members of the Committee have had representations made to them by the Equal Opportunities Commission. Those representations are important, first for recording concerns that the Commission has reproduced and notified us of, and secondly for giving rise to some reservations about the operation of any anti-discrimination legislation.
<P>
It is arguable, without prejudice to this amendment, that the national minimum wage sets out to be a general provision, which does not discriminate, and which would provide a common rate, for a common period, for all workers. However, the notes made available to us by the EOC especially those that refer to the position of women show that, despite the fact that the Sexual Discrimination Act 1975 is now 22 years old, there are still clear differences in the rates of pay for men and women.
<P>
In concluding that women are especially vulnerable to low pay, the EOC states that almost 10 per cent. of women earn less than œ3 per hour, in comparison to just over 5 per cent. of men. It goes on to say that 29 per cent. of female employees, or 3.1 million women, earn less than œ4 per hour, in comparison to 14 per cent. of male employees, or 1.6 million men. Furthermore, it says that 40 per cent. of female employees earn less than œ4.50 per hour, in comparison to 20 per cent. of male employees.
<P>
It is right that the Committee should consider those facts, for which there may be a variety of explanations. Those facts add up to a refutation of the easy assumption that passing any kind of anti-discrimination legislation solves the problem. I suspect that passing such legislation only begins the process of solving the problem.
<P>
I am familiar with activities in my constituency as, I am sure, are many Committee members to improve the position of women by encouraging them to return to work, to realise their potential, and to bump their heads up against and through glass ceilings. I find such activities perfectly acceptable, but they do not always achieve their ends. I do not expect the Bill, however well-intentioned it is, to remove the problems of sexual discrimination. It may change those problems into different forms: pay structures might change, or unemployment might increase among women, which would be the down side of a national minimum wage.
<P>
Whatever we, or our predecessors, hoped for when the legislation was passed in 1975 I suspect that you, Mrs. Dunwoody, were an hon. Member at that time those hopes have not yet been completely realised. I do not say that in a vicious sense, either in relation to the Government or to its Conservative or Labour predecessors. Removing sexual discrimination is a long process, and there are severe restrictions on the practical operation of legislation that aims to achieve social goals. That is a warning to the Government and to Labour Back Benchers not to invest too much in this Bill or any other Bill of the same kind.
<P>
I invite the Minister to comment on the wider issues of gender differences, and to make any other comments on discrimination that she feels are appropriate. I should also like to ask her about the specific point that is encapsulated in the amendments. I assume that all members of the Committee do not want to discriminate inappropriately, when there is no good reason for discrimination. There is much distress when such discrimination takes place. Why, therefore, is it not necessary to put that in the Bill? May I have her assurance that it is covered by existing legislation?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> I want to speak to amendments Nos. 83 and 84, which are tabled in my name and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Cotter). I shall not detain the Committee long but I wish to add a few remarks that in the main, or even entirely, support the comments made by the hon. Member for Daventry.
<P>
I am sure that the Government do not intend to allow any loopholes that permit any activity that would negate our attempts not only to preserve, but to maintain and to expand equality between genders, races and religions. However, the Equal Opportunities Commission has expressed severe anxieties, to which the hon. Member for Daventry referred.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The use of notes in Committee is perfectly correct, and there will be no argument, in the same way as there is no argument on the Floor of the House. Excessive quoting from briefs will not be accepted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> I shall refrain from doing such a thing.
<P>
It is important to remember what the EOC has said. There is still a 20 per cent. gap between the average wages earned by women and those earned by men. I am anxious that in their pursuit of the Bill the Government take due note of that and do what they should to ensure that there is no loophole and no escape from the duties of employers in removing that gap.
<P>
The EOC has expressed genuine anxieties. Without quoting it at length, it believes that, although the Bill is a good opportunity to advance the case for equal wages, the LPC needs an opportunity to examine the problems that arise from equality in pay between the genders.
<P>
The EOC wants to see the LPC given the opportunity not only to examine the differences that exist between men's pay and women's pay, but to put a mechanism in place that will allow the LPC to continue to monitor the effects and implementation of the minimum wage and to ensure that it is applied in a way that strives to remove the remaining differences in inequalities in pay between men and women. I hope that the Minister will be able to respond favourably and reassuringly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I shall attempt to be brief in adding one or two thoughts to what my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry has already said. I accept the argument that I anticipate we shall hear from the Government that anti-discrimination provisions exist elsewhere, and that it is perhaps not strictly necessary to include them in the Bill.
<P>
I would, however, argue that it is important to put the provision in the Bill to send a clear signal about how anti-discriminatory outcomes will be sought in the application of the minimum wage legislation, especially the making of regulations under the provisions of clause 2.
<P>
There is a growing tendency to look at what I would call probably incorrectly, but I shall be corrected if that is so second-order discrimination. Second-order discrimination is discrimination that arises from the application of differential treatment, for example to different sectors or to different activities. It does so in a way that is not primarily intended to, and does not appear to, discriminate against persons on the grounds of, for example, gender. However, because of the uneven distribution of men and women in the work force, such acts may unintentionally have a second-order, discriminatory effect.
<P>
The Committee has discussed at length the different circumstances of different sectors of industry and employment, the different remuneration patterns that are prevalent in different areas and the different work practices. Those are the factors that I wish to address in considering whether, in making regulations under clause 2, discriminatory results may unintentionally occur. I want to refer back to our discussion earlier today about this matter. We talked at some length about piece work and the way in which the clause will be used to introduce regulations.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We cannot go backwards. We seem to have a little difficulty going forwards, but we certainly cannot go backwards. If the hon. Gentleman would restrict his remarks to the present amendment, I should be grateful.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I thank you, Mrs. Dunwoody. The present amendment, as I understand it, would amend subsection (7), a restrictive subsection that affects the Secretary of State's scope to make regulations under the clause. With your indulgence, Mrs. Dunwoody, I want to refer to the amendment's limiting factor on the Secretary of State's power to make such regulations.
<P>
Home workers piece workers, who carry out work on the basis of remuneration by the piece in the home are overwhelmingly women. Therefore, regulations made under the clause in respect of the treatment of piece work and its application to home workers will undoubtedly have a greater impact on women than on men. I am not suggesting that that would be the intention of such a regulation, but it will be its inevitable effect.
<P>
We also discussed benefits in kind, and I shall certainly not go back over that discussion. Any restriction in the inclusion of benefits in kind in calculating whether the minimum wage has been paid will have a different impact on men and women in the work force, given the much larger number of women who have residential accommodation as a benefit in kind incidental to their employment.
<P>
In assessing the different impact on men and women of any of the regulations made under the clause, we cannot look only at the percentage of men and women in any given employment or area who would be subject to such regulations; we must also look at the marginality of that employment, so that the impact of the minimum wage impositions, the way in which the regulations will affect workers and the likelihood of a threat to their jobs can be discerned.
<P>
I emphasise that work and remuneration patterns vary substantially between men and women, so almost any regulation introduced under the clause will, unintentionally I fully accept, discriminate between them. It would be commendable if the amendment were incorporated into the Bill to emphasise the need for a non-discriminatory outcome in applying the secretary of State's powers under the clause.
<P>
<B>Barbara Follett </B>(Stevenage): I wish to speak against amendments Nos. 17, 83 and 84. Having spent most of my life fighting discrimination on the grounds of gender, race and religion, I was glad to hear that the hon. Members for Daventry and for Eastleigh shared my feeling that this form of discrimination should not be allowed in the Bill and shared my concern that the Bill should not inadvertently discriminate on those grounds. However, as the hon. Member for Daventry expected, the Government reject the amendments because anti-discrimination is covered implicitly in[Barbara Follett]
clause 1. Clause 1 refers to "workers", which, as the word implies, includes everyone, irrespective of gender, race or religion.
<P>
That reference means that we do not need to be worried about anti-discrimination in the Bill. Indeed, anti-discrimination legislation, which the hon. Member for Daventry referred to, is already on the statute book. For women there is section 1 of the Equal Pay Act 1970 and the Sex Discrimination Act 1975.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I hesitate to interrupt the hon. Lady, because she is a new Member and I do not want to cause her difficulty, but I draw the attention of all members of the Committee to the rules on Committee procedure which say very simply:
"The reading of speeches is even less suited to a Standing Committee than to the Chamber".<P>

<P>
That should be taken to heart by all hon. Members contributing to the debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> While I accept that, as the hon. Lady rightly says, clause 1 ties in all workers, or indeed goes even wider than that to include a number of people without contracts of employment, I tabled the amendments because, given that clause 2 specifies a number of anti-discrimination tests and fetters the Government, it was necessary for the Opposition to probe whether there would be additional tests in relation to gender, ethnic origin or religious belief and, if not, why not. I think that there is no difference of substance between us, but there is a difference of legal interpretation, which needs to be explored.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Interventions will be brief.
<P>
<B>Barbara Follett:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman. There is a difference of substance and it is in the definition of "workers", which I believe is a blanket definition covering the groups as well as gender, race and religion. As I said, there are already laws on the statute book that safeguard the rights of such workers.
<P>
The Bill also helps groups implicitly by raising wages among the low paid. Women and the ethnic and religious minorities suffer most from low pay, and I welcome the Bill precisely because it will ensure that those groups have higher wages and are more fairly treated in our society.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I appreciate the spirit in which the hon. Member for Daventry initiated the debate. Again, he is testing us and probing, as he is right to do, to see what our intentions are. I am pleased to see that Opposition Members are keen to ensure equality and universality of treatment under the Bill. I say that I am pleased to see it, because Conservative Members will recall that their party, when in opposition in 1975, abstained on the Sex Discrimination Bill. They also abstained on the Race Relations Bill in 1976. However, it would be churlish to dwell on those matters.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Will the hon. Lady give way?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I would be delighted to give way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Although it is a reasonable debating point, I am somewhat injured by it. I was only 12 when the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 was passed and only 13 when the Race Relations Act 1976 was enacted. It is a little rough to hold it against hon. Members who were too young to cast a vote at the time. I am entirely in sympathy 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I hope that we are not going to get into a debate about ages.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I certainly would not want to do that, Mrs. Dunwoody. As I used to say in a former life, the hon. Gentleman had better be a little bit careful here. He has form. As an ex-member of the Monday Club, which espoused the elimination of that Act and the abolition of the Commission for Racial Equality, he may want to think again.
<P>
<H5>9.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I accept the spirit in which the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Daventry, was moved as I accept the spirit behind the amendments tabled by the hon. Members for Eastleigh and for Weston-Super-Mare. Of course we do not intend to discriminate by sex, race or religion any more than we would intend to discriminate against people who wear glasses or, pertinently, Mrs. Dunwoody, elegant red dresses. There is certainly no intention to do that.
<P>
I hope that would not be the intention of Opposition Members either. It would clearly go against the spirit of earlier legislation such as the Sex Discrimination Act 1976, the Equal Pay Act 1970 and the Race Relations Act 1976. I hope that those assurances will influence Opposition Members.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The Minister said that the amendments would go against the spirit of those Acts. I accept that, but can she give the Committee an absolute assurance that a future Government less congenial to her view, and, indeed, to my view on this matter than the present Government or their predecessor, could not legislate in a discriminatory way? What is puzzling me is why, when we can exclude specifically on the face of the Bill certain kinds of discrimination, we cannot do this. If she is doing it by reference it does not seem sufficient.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I cannot envisage any circumstances when a future Government would want to do that which the hon. Gentleman most fears. I understand where he is coming from. All sorts of Acts are passed by the House, put through by this Government and our predecessor, where such matters are not written on the face of the legislation but the spirit of those Acts is such that we all appreciate their force.
<P>
Reference was also made to the Equal Opportunities Commission. The hon. Members for Eastleigh and for Runnymede and Weybridge asked about the impact on women. I take a completely different view from the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge about the effect of the national minimum wage. It will be positively beneficial to women employees because often it is women who are disproportionately represented in many sectors of industries that traditionally have low rates of pay.
<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry appeared to suggest that the national minimum wage could have an adverse effect on the pay or employment of women. Exactly the same arguments were made by Conservative Members during the passage of the Equal Pay Act 1970 and, if anything, it brought about a slight improvement in the position of women employees.
<P>
Reference has been made to the representations made by the Equal Opportunities Commission. The Low Pay Commission has been asked to consider a range of issues when formulating its recommendations. I know that points have been made by the Equal Opportunities Commission to the Low Pay Commission, and that they will be taken into account during its deliberations. The EOC has a statutory duty to review the application of the Equal Pay Act 1970, and one way in which it fulfils that duty is by monitoring the level of women's earnings. It will also want to monitor the national minimum wage.
<P>
I hope that I have been able to assure the Committee that we have no intention of acting in what might be thought of as a discriminatory manner.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Will the Minister confirm I think I heard her correctly that she said that the EOC will monitor the operation of the national minimum wage as part of its general monitoring of women's pay issues?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I said that the EOC has a statutory duty under the Equal Pay Act 1970 to monitor the level of women's earnings. Clearly, the impact of the national minimum wage will show up as part of that. The EOC will carry out monitoring as part of its existing obligations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I thank the Minister for that clarification. Will she now tell me about the interaction between the EOC and the Low Pay Commission? Depending on what happens in subsequent clauses on the Low Pay Commission, it will be charged with the responsibility of examining the operation of the national minimum wage and low pay in general. It will need to work out a modus operandi with the EOC on women's pay. Will the Minister confirm that?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I do not see the difficulties. I will not be tempted into discussing the Low Pay Commission, because we will discuss that later. Despite my grovelling efforts to ingratiate myself with you, Mrs. Dunwoody, I would not be in your good books if I touched upon it.
<P>
The duty on the EOC will mean that it will, de facto, monitor the impact of the national minimum wage on women's earnings as part of its existing work.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> After those clarifications, I come to more substantive issues.
<P>
The record will show exactly what was said, but the Minister gave the impression that I had implied that the operation of the national minimum would have adverse effects on pay and employment. I shall make my position clear in order to avoid doubt. We are not enamoured of the general concept of the national minimum wage and the Minister accepts that. In so far as it gives a differential benefit to women by enhancing the wages of more of them relative to the population of men, it will be statistically and inevitably true that those women who are currently employed at below whatever the national minimum wage rate will receive a higher rate. If that happens, as my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge pointed out, more women might lose their employment. That was the substance of my remarks.
<P>
I referred to an historical analogy. We now have more than 20 years' experience of equal opportunities, equal pay and sex discrimination legislation. In addition, it is important to remember, with respect to homeworkers, the issue of discrimination by ethnic origin. Half of homeworkers are said to be from ethnic minorities a point that was not well brought out this morning, if at all. In both cases, whatever the aspirations behind the legislation, functionally equal pay has not been established. There is a variety of reasons for that, to do with the patterns of women's employment, with whether women aspire to the heights of employment, whether there are still glass ceilings, or whether historic patterns that have not been overcome are being reflected. However, a difficulty remains.
<P>
As to the Minister's assurances, I am forced to the conclusion that we shall have to press the amendments to a Division. She is anxious to avoid discrimination in relation to age, types of employment, size of firms and other matters that have been specified. I do not see why she must give assurances by analogy and say that no reasonable Government would want to discriminate on the three points in the amendment, without doing so on the face of the Bill. It would not be beyond the wit of man or woman to put that provision in the Bill. It is not there now but the amendments would put it there. In the absence of any change of heart by the Minister on this matter, we shall press the amendment to a Division, to emphasise our commitment to that end.

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 94, in page 2, leave out lines 41 and 42.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, we may take the following amendments:
<P>
No. 24, in page 2, line 42, leave out "26" and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"18 and are receiving training leading to a recognised qualification".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 95, in page 2, line 44, leave out from "any" to the end of the line and insert "class of persons".
<P>
No. 80, in page 2, line 44, leave out from "applies" to "prescribing" in line 1 on page 3.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> We have discussed discrimination at length. The Government have eschewed discrimination for all but one category. They have not said that they will discriminate, but that they might do so, depending on advice, and in circumstances that will be defined later, against young people under the age of 26. That general definition of young people should not excite the Committee or plunge us into a further debate. The question is whether they should receive special treatment such as, for example, exclusion, which is covered later in the clause, giving them a range of rates, as the commission recommended, or taking account of whether they are being trained. Under the clause, discrimination, or, to use a more neutral word, differentiation, is not possible between,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"different areas: different sectors of employment; undertakings of different sizes; or different occupations."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is a re-run of clause 2, except that that provision also includes "different ages."
<P>
Clause 1 provides for a general national minimum wage; clause 2 provides for the calculation of that wage to be set out in regulations; clause 3 provides for the possible exception of young people. Clause 4 has a specific resonance for the Government. I realise that we are not debating that provision, but it is appropriate to examine what I once described as Bill architecture and the logical relationship between the clauses.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> I wish to make it clear that, although I appreciate that it is sometimes difficult when we are discussing amendments to different clauses, it is important to stick firmly to the clause that we are debating. Hon. Members should not discuss parts of the Bill, even in the architectural sense, that are not under consideration.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am obliged for that guidance, Mrs. Dunwoody. I shall confine my remarks to the amendments and clause 3. I shall make a simple point that prefaces all my remarks on the clause. Amendment No. 94 would remove subsection (1), which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"This section applies to persons who have not attained the age of 26."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The effect of leaving that out, combined with any consequent amendments, would be to allow a wider set of exceptions than is set out in the clause. That is what I intended, and I think that the Government will not deny it. The provisions should not be confined to young persons, whether or not they are under training. They would give the Government in the generous way with which the Minister of State is now familiar the option of a series of different exceptions to meet different cases. Such cases are difficult to specify, but the Minister will recall our long and interesting debate on trainees, which included the issue of adult persons who were undergoing training. Hon. Members might wish to draw the Committee's attention to other categories for which a degree of discrimination from the national minimum wage, in its strict, universal form, might be appropriate.
<P>
The difficulty is that the process has started; the Low Pay Commission has been sent out, albeit on a non-statutory basis, to take evidence from real people about what is or is not appropriate. It has done that commendably. However, the conclusions offered by the commission will come up against a set of provisions in the Bill, which appear to be restrictive. The provisions would allow one possible derogation I suppose that is the European term from the Bill: that would provide for young people. They do not allow for any other sensible measure.
<P>
The relevance of clause 4 is that there seems to be a conceptual disagreement which may be merely presentational between both sides of the Committee about whether clause 3 can be revised to embrace a wider set of exceptions. The Minister of State said earlier I hope that he will not feel that I am caricaturing him that we can, if we are so advised, come up with other categories of exception. That is in the notes on clauses in relation to clause 4. However, I cannot see that provision in clause 3. That clause starts with the offending words:
"This section applies to persons who have not attained the age of 26."
<P>
It is difficult to interpret the clause, as it stands, as applying to anyone other than persons under the age of 26; not to persons under the age of 26 and any other persons that the Minister might want to include under the clause. We shall discuss later whether clause 4 frees the Minister from that.
<P>
There are two reasons for the amendment. First, in architecture terms, the clause appears to exclude the Minister from reasonable discretion and, secondly, it fails to meet one of the concerns that has already been forcibly expressed about whether adult trainees should be included in the exceptions. There is not a universal view on the matter; I think that the hon. Member for Eastleigh possibly takes a different view from me. I am not talking about the rate that such trainees might receive, nor about whether special arrangements should be made for them, nor whether they should receive the same rate as younger trainees. Those are issues to which we can return later. As I consider clause 3 on its own we are being enjoined to look at the Bill clause by clause I see that we cannot consider people other than those under the age of 26. That is a defect of the Bill. In terms of procedure, if the proposal is later considered in the context of regulations that a future Secretary of State may lay down, and in another place, where their lordships may become extremely excited about the Henry VIII clauses, for example, it would be difficult to say that subsection (1) is all about people who have not attained the age of 26. However, the Minister cannot say, either in respect of this clause or of subsequent clauses, that although he said that he means only people under the age of 26, what he actually means is people under he age of 26, adult trainees, and possibly one or two very narrow exceptions of people with severe disabilities in care homes. I have tabled an amendment for subsequent consideration on that subject.
<P>
It is an odd situation; the Bill is very restrictive. Clauses 1 and 2 are slightly less restrictive but that is somehow seen as not appropriate to the difficult cases that the Minister might want to cater for, as he acknowledged in earlier debates.
<P>
The Minister clearly takes the view that he will be able to reopen the debate in clause 4. I am much less saguine about that; it would be very difficult for him to reopen a debate on a clause which he had said was restrictive by saying that he did not quite mean what he had said about it previously. Although I appreciate that it is not technically part of the Bill the clause heading is part of the Bill's framework. It states:
"Exclusion of, and modification for, certain classes of person",
<P>
who are immediately defined as being persons under the age of 26.
<P>
The main intention of my head amendment is to clear out the subsection, although that is not all that it would do. I am sure that the Minister would not want to caricature me as saying that we are not interested in providing an exclusion for young persons. However, we are interested in establishing whether the exclusion should be confined to young people or have a wider application. I think that it should; if it is not in the Bill at this point as I modestly suggest that it should be, the chance to include such a suggestion will be lost. It will be very difficult to recover that proposal in the next clause, although I suppose it would be possible, as it has been done in respect of particular categories such as share fishermen. There is a specific exclusion clause later which applies to members of the armed forces, but that is an odd way of proceeding. The proposal would be much better if it were up front in this clause.
<P>
To summarise this amendment, providing for a very limited exclusion but saying that it can be widened in a subsequent clause which has to refer back to this clause would be almost impossible.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will consider the amendment in two ways: first, as an issue of substance, because there are issues of substance to be considered when widening the exclusions I do not want to drive a coach and horses through the Bill but to provide some scope for consideration and secondly, because there is a technical problem in the Bill which may cause the Minister some embarrassment in due course.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I support my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry in pressing the amendments. I emphasise at the outset that it is unrealistic of us at this stage to hope that the Minister will accept our good intentions. No doubt the usual line will be rehearsed about how the amendment is designed to ruin the Bill. The reality is that it is not. The position as far as we are concerned is that there is an illogicality

<P>
Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.
<P>
<H5>10.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
On resuming 
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Before we suspended for the Division, I was explaining that the Government's position is illogical for several reasons. Clause 3 specifies a category of person to whom the national minimum wage shall apply. No other category is specified as this one is. In view of what we have just debated discrimination and the desirability of avoiding it there is no good reason for that.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> In a spirit of deference to you, Mrs. Dunwoody, what is the status of a Standing Committee if a Minister is not present to hear argument? Is that an irregularity, or does the Committee simply proceed?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> As the hon. Gentleman will note, the Minister was undoubtedly waiting outside for his cue.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I must say that my hon. Friend the Member for Solihull is being extremely charitable. He said that the Minister was not present to hear the argument, the inference being that if he were present, he would automatically hear the argument. That seems a matter for legitimate debate. I fear that I am about to be subjected to your strictures, Mrs. Dunwoody.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I fear that you are.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I cannot imagine a more uninviting scenario. I shall take pains to avert it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Very briefly, Mrs. Dunwoody, and aware as ever of your strictures, was not it a remarkable tribute to the skills of my hon. Friend the Member for[Mr. Boswell]
Solihull that he should not only keep his own troops in order but produce the Minister as if out of a hat in order to answer the debate?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> The organisational skills of my hon. Friend the Member for Solihull know no bounds. I must congratulate the Minister on conforming to my hon. Friend's game plan.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Thank you for all of that, but I am sure that we shall come back to the amendment soon.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Yes, indeed, Mrs. Dunwoody. We are coming to the amendment.
<P>
I am delighted to repeat my point as the Minister, for all his powers, is not capable of hearing an argument when he is absent. The Government's position is illogical for several reasons. First, clause 3 refers to a category of person who is to be potentially excluded from the national minimum wage or paid it at a different rate. No reference is made to any other defined category or worker to whom that exemption or any variation will apply. Conservative Members judge that to be illogical, particularly in light of the desirability of non-discrimination, about which we have all agreed. That illogicality is one reason why we want to amend the clause.
<P>
The second reason why the Government's position is illogical is that they seek to persuade the Committee that clause 4 provides for the amendment of the principal feature of clause 3. I am not a lawyer and I say that with some pride so I cannot be certain that my hon. Friend the member for Daventry is right to say that it is not possible to amend clause 3 in clause 4. However, it is at least arguable that it will not be possible

<B>Mr. Hammond rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I hope that we shall not pursue that matter we debated it at great length previously. I know that the hon. Members for Runnymede and Weybridge and for Buckingham know the Standing Orders backwards, and they do not need me to quote the little bit about repetition.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I thank my hon. Friend for giving way, and you, Mrs. Dunwoody, for your advice. I was merely going to suggest that my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry may or may not have correctly interpreted the position with regard to clause 3, and that any additional classes of persons who are included by virtue of clause 4 would appear to be an afterthought. The effect of removing the provision 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I must draw the Committee's attention to the fact that we are debating clause 3, page 2. Although the matter is complicated, it is not as complicated as the hon. Gentleman was making it. I hope that the hon. Member for Buckingham will not pursue the argument about clause 4.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Far be it for me to do so. As you know, Mrs. Dunwoody, I find it difficult even to utter the words "clause 4", let alone to dwell on them for any length of time. I shall confine my remarks to the clause and to the desirability of the amendment. [Interruption.] The Minister is chuntering from a sedentary position, and I am happy to give way to him if he wants to be helpful which would be a breach of tradition.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that it would be in the Government's interests to spend a moment or two considering the amendment? We might find that the Bill is workable or that it has unintended consequences.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Precisely. The possibility of error, which applies as readily to the Government as to the Opposition, means that the Government should reconsider their position.
<P>
Our proposal is manifestly clear we do not want lines 41 and 42 to remain in the Bill. I focus explicitly and concentratedly on those two lines, and I am sure that there will be no protest about my doing so if there were, I should speedily draw my remarks within order. Deleting those two lines would give the Government the discretion to exempt as many categories as they may later decide they wish to exempt, or to subject different categories of worker to a variation in the rate of the national minimum wage.
<P>
In the context, I turn and I am sure that you welcome my doing so with open arms, Mrs. Dunwoody to two categories of persons who might just as reasonably be specified as the category of persons who are under the age of 26. I do not make my point in the abstract. The reference to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"persons who have not attained the age of 26"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
is unjustified, partly because it is somewhat offensive to single them out and partly because there are at least two other categories of persons who could usefully be specified in the clause. No one could accuse me of repetition in this context because the first of the categories has scarcely been mentioned, and the second has received only the briefest mention. [Interruption.] If the hon. Member for Oldham, East and Saddleworth wants to intervene and to subject us to his wisdom, I should be delighted to oblige him.
<P>
The first category is that of family members. I regard the Conservative party as being preoccupied with the interests of family members. I am sure that some Labour Members also feel strongly about family members. I would argue as, I think, would my hon. Friends that it would be perfectly proper for a clause such as clause 3 to refer to family members. It would arguably be more appropriate for it to refer to an exclusion from the national minimum wage for family members employed by other family members, than for it to refer to people under the age of 26. I do not think that any part of the stated or unstated purposes of the Bill is to wreak havoc within families, but the unammended clause 3(1) says:
"This section applies to persons who have not attained the age of 26."<P>

<P>
It does not say that this section applies to persons who work for other persons who are members of their family. I believe that the clause should do so because obliging one family member who is an employer to pay the full national minimum wage to another family member who is an employee could stoke the flames of internal family rows. We would do well to avoid such a distressing phenomenon.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> My hon. Friend has introduced a new and interesting concept into the debate. Before he continues, will he hazard a definition of who would, and who would not, be a family member? If he is to prosecute this case, he should have a fairly precise definition.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> It might be desirable to have a fairly precise definition. I am not the female version of the bovine animal, Mrs. Dunwoody, so I hope that I will be forgiven if I express a preference for my surname to be pronounced as "Bercoe" rather than "Bercow". I intend no discourtesy to you, Mrs. Dunwoody, in making that request.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am grateful for that guidance. I had, in fact, thought that the hon. Gentleman's surname was "Berkoff", so his guidance is helpful. [Laughter.]
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I am most grateful to you, Mrs. Dunwoody, and I am sure that my late father would also be grateful. We are, after all, talking about families.
<P>
My hon. Friend has invited me to propose what might be a narrow definition of "family member". I am not sure how easy a task that might be. Clearly, when referring to the family it is necessary to refer to a variety of different relationships. There are situations in which the father is the employer and the son is the employee, in which the son is the employer and the father is the employee, and in which brothers and sisters, uncles and aunts, nephews and nieces, and first cousins and second cousins not taking account of cousins who are once removed must be included within the definition of "family member". That is a matter for legitimate debate.
<P>
Opposition Members do not want to pass legislation that obliges family members to pay other family members a national minimum wage rate that they might not feel able to afford or I do not wish to be undiplomatic, Mrs. Dunwoody that one family member thinks another family member is not worthy of receiving. As the Bill stands, however, that would be the result.
<P>
I would hazard a guess that the Minister of State has not so much as considered that point. That is not especially sinful; it is one of the virtues of having a vigorous Opposition that, on 10.28 pm on a Tuesday evening, important facts can be drawn to the Minister's attention in the hope that he will adequately take account of them. The family member is one example, which is given as a demonstration of seriousness and good faith, and which could be included in the group of people who are exempted from the provisions of the national minimum wage.
<P>
Another category of person that could usefully be included in that group and that is a good reason for removing the offending and discriminatory lines 41 and 42 would be that of serving members of the armed forces. I confidently predict that another hon. Member sitting on the Committee will respond that the position of serving members of the armed forces is dealt with in a subsequent clause. That, however, would be an unsatisfactory response. I shall not dwell on that future clause, which is several pages on in the Bill, for I know that if I were to do so, the wrath of your good self, Mrs. Dunwoody, would descend on me. I prefer to avoid that ugly fate.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Pronounced "Dunwoody".
<P>
<H5>10.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I apologise. Did I pronounce it otherwise?
<P>
I do not wish to dwell on clause 34. However, we could resolve any problem that might arise later by amending clause 3 to include an additional category of employee, or to provide the power in clause 3 for Ministers to include other categories of persons who will be excluded from the national minimum wage provisions.
<P>
Members of the armed forces are an obviously good example of such a category. On several occasions we have read of the apparent intention to exclude serving members of the armed forces from the Bill's provisions. The Bill does not say that at the moment. In order, therefore, to save ourselves days of baited breath and eager anticipation of what exactly the debate on clause 34 might bring, why do we not provide for it to be dealt with now?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman has been very ingenious, but not ingenious enough. If hon. Members address their comments to exactly what is said in this amendment, we shall get along rather better.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I am grateful for that injunction, which I shall follow.
<P>
As it stands, the clause is discriminatory. There is nothing new about our opposition to it. We said from the outset that we do not see any good reason why the Bill's provisions should single out for special and exclusive consideration a particular category of worker, who has nothing else specific and distinctive to his or her name other than the fact of being under the age of 26.
<P>
We have received no arguments from the Government to support Minister's decision to provide in the Bill for that exemption and potential variations of it but, in terms of specific wording, for no others. It is that that we are entreating Labour Members to do. No doubt the usual imitation of a Trappist monk will be performed, and in response to my exhortations, no Labour Member will dare rise, for fear of falling foul of a message a few seconds later on the pager, ordering him or her not to contribute to this section of the debate.
<P>
We would like the widest possible power for the Minister to exclude categories of worker from the Bill's provisions, or to require under regulation that other categories of worker should enjoy a different level of minimum wage. The Minister is a decent fellow. I understand that he does not always believe that our motives are the best, although they invariably are. He should be grateful to me for attributing

<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Does it not occur to my hon. Friend that within the scope of what is proposed in the[Mr. Boswell]
amendments, it would be open to the Government to introduce different rates of minimum wage that are above those applicable for the national minimum wage for particular categories of especially worthy persons?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> That could certainly be open for the Government to do. It is a source of some angst to Conservative Members that the Government seem to have decided, without the slightest evidence to support their position, that that one category of persons should be named and provided for in the Bill, and that no other category should be named.
<P>
Ministers will almost automatically assume that the variation and I use the word advisedly that we would like the legislation to allow is a downward variation, although it need not automatically be so.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Daventry refers to a point that I have made in the past. I prefer to pay my cleaner œ7 an hour, rather than any level of minimum wage that the Minister has in mind. It would therefore be open for Ministers to provide for higher and for lower rates of minimum wage depending on the perceived attributes of given categories of worker. I see no harm in that.
<P>
The further illogicality in the Government's position is their argument that the Low Pay Commission should consider the facts, study the evidence, take representations, observe the behaviour of the real economy and consider differences in different parts of the country with a view to coming up with a national minimum wage rate. One or two Government Back Benchers have talked about the commission's merits, referring to it as if they felt it impertinent to make any comment at all, still less to submit their own thoughts.
<P>
If the Government's view is that the commission should have such an important role, are not they prepared to allow the possibility that the commission may reach the opinion that several other categories should be exempted from or subjected to a variable rate of the national minimum wage? If Ministers can at least partly anticipate those categories, why not provide for them in the Bill? If they cannot predict the categories but recognise that there may be other categories, why not include an open-ended provision that will allow the Government to decide what to do when they are ready?
<P>
Why the insistence on one category? Why is there no reference to older workers? Or workers from other parts of the country? The Government will say that they have decided without any evidence to support the differential treatment that it is legitimate to discriminate on age grounds, but on no other grounds. The simple truth is that the Government have got into a mess. In what is generally a mere shell of a piece of legislation, they have opted for specificity in an isolated case.
<P>
You, Mrs. Dunwoody, and Government Back Benchers will be relieved to know that I am near my conclusion. The position is ludicrous. We want to get rid of lines 41 and 42 so that when the Bill reaches the statute book and the Minister cannot repeat his boring, unoriginal line that we are trying to destroy the Bill it will be better than it threatens to be now. I rest my case and look forward to hearing the contributions of other hon. Members.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Healey </B>(Wentworth): Let me confound the hon. Member for Buckingham by contributing to the debate, but disappoint him by contesting his amendments. Clause 3 applies to people under 26 and in work. It sets out discretionary powers that concentrate only on young people, either to exempt some categories from minimum wage or to modify the rate to a different level. Those are reserved powers, and I hope that they will remain so. They are in the Bill to let the Government take into account the views of the Low Pay Commission.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> When the hon. Gentleman says that he hopes the powers will remain reserved powers, does he hope that there will be a single national minimum wage for all classes of workers, whatever their age and training status?
<P>
<B>Mr. Healey:</B> The strength of the proposal for a minimum wage lies in its being a single national minimum wage. Clause 3 creates reserved powers that the Secretary of State could use to take account of the views of the Low Pay Commission when it reports specifically on the remit with which it has been charged. That remit includes a request that it should make recommendations on lower rates or exemptions for those aged 16 to 25. The hon. Member for Buckingham described the LPC as an illogicality.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow indicated dissent.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Healey:</B> Oh yes he did. On the contrary, it is a strength. The hon. Gentleman is at variance with the hon. Member for Daventry, who rightly paid tribute to the commission's work.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> The hon. Gentleman made a most considered speech in Committee last week, that we all enjoyed. I hope that his speech today will follow a similar course. I must correct him, and I hope that he will accept it from the recorded proceedings of the Committee. I did not say that the work of the Committee was illogical, with respect. I said that the Government's position was illogical. It is not the same thing at all.
<P>
<B>Mr. Healey:</B> On the contrary, the hon. Gentleman was talking about the interplay between the Low Pay Commission and the Government's proposals in the Bill. When we check the Hansard record together if he wishes to do so he will see that he made that assertion, which is clearly at odds with the more sensible and more accurate comments of the hon. Member for Daventry on the work of the Low Pay Commission, which is doing its job thoroughly and taking its work seriously. It is right that the Government should take its final recommendations into account.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Healey:</B> Let me press on. I have taken three interventions. If the hon. Member wishes to intervene on later points, I shall happily give way.
<P>
The clause gives the Government flexibility within the basic objective of the Bill, which is to establish a national minimum wage.
<P>
We are dealing with two groups of amendments. The first comprises amendments Nos. 94 and 95 in the names of the hon. Members for Daventry and for Solihull. The amendments would broaden the application of the reserve power in clause 3 from the under-26s to all classes of person. I may be new, but I am not naive, and if this is not a wrecking amendment, I do not know what is. What we have here is a re-run of the arguments on previous clauses, which is at odds with the fundamental principle and purpose of the Bill.
<P>
Instead of a universal minimum wage, the amendments would introduce confusion in place of clarity, complexity in place of simplicity and discrimination in place of equity. They would create a patchwork of protection under the minimum wage that would vary according to region, occupation, size of firm, sector of employement and any other factor that one might think of. It would not work, and Opposition Members know that as well as my hon. Friends, which is clearly why they keep pressing the same points. I urge the Committee to reject both the amendments.
<P>
The second group comprises amendments Nos. 24 and 80, the first of which is in the names of the hon. Members for Eastleigh, for Weston-super-Mare and for Galloway and Upper Nithsdale (Mr. Morgan), who I am disappointed not to see in his place. The amendments propose a differential youth or training rate, but limited to those under 18 and
"receiving training leading to a recognised qualification".<P>

<P>
The amendments are a muddle. They mix age with training and trainee status. In my view, they hinder rather than help proper scrutiny of the Bill and debate on the clause and these important issues.
<P>
On training, we had to canter through the issues related to trainee rates and exemptions in part of the 15 hours that we spent on clause 1. The provision could be introduced in clause 4 and that is the proper place to debate it. On age, however, the amendment would tie the Secretary of State to treating as a special case only the group of under-18s receiving training leading to a recognised qualification. He could not include in the clause any other young people under regulations made under clause 4, because clause 4(2)(a) specifically prevents additions on the basis of age.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. As I have specifically said, we are not debating clause 4. I hope that we shall not follow such a line.
<P>
<B>Mr. Healey:</B> Thank you, Mrs. Dunwoody.
<P>
The amendment would pre-empt the work and the conclusions of the Low Pay Commission and prevent the Secretary of State from acting sensibly on the recommendations that the commission has specifically been asked to make.
<P>
<H5>10.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Healey:</B> No, I am just winding up. The hon. Gentleman can make his point later.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman is not giving way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Healey:</B> It makes no sense to restrict the Government's response before the Low Pay Commission reports. The clause provides discretionary powers which may be used in the light of the commission's recommendations. I urge the Committee to reject the amendment.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Before we proceed, I should like to put on the record the fact that the hon. Member for Galloway and Upper Nithsdale has the Adjournment debate on the Floor of the House. He is not present because he is fulfilling his other duties.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I will try not to prolong the debate unnecessarily, but I want to refer to a couple of points which arose from what my hon. Friends said, and also to the Government's choice of provision a particular exemption for those under the age of 26.
<P>
The clause explaining its purpose may pre-empt what the Minister has to say, but I shall do so does two things. Contrary to what the hon. Member for Wentworth (Mr. Healey) said, its limits what would otherwise be a wide discretion under clause 48 to prescribe different classes of people in regulations not to allow the Low Pay Commission to do its work and to give it flexibility and scope, but to prescribe and circumscribe that work.
<P>
Secondly, the clause limits the mechanisms for providing for exemptions or different rates. There is a double negative, however. Even though the commission may not recommend the making of regulations or the exemption of particular classes of person, there is a particular exemption for those under the age of 26. The figure has been chosen for what the Government see as a straightforward reason the new deal can be entered into up to the age of 25 and lasts for 12 months.
<P>
Amendment No. 24, which would delete the reference to those under the age of 26, is desirable on two grounds. First, by so doing it would provide the discretion which Ministers have argued is precisely what the Low Pay Commission needs for taking evidence and presenting conclusions. Secondly, the amendment would remove a curious focus on those people on the new deal.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that the hon. Member for Wentworth appears to be confused? My interpretation of the clause and of its interaction with other parts of the Bill is that, whether or not subsection (1) remains, the clause will not in any way affect Ministers' ability to make classes of people subject to the clause. The amendment merely sends a signal.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Interventions must be exactly that interventions. Hon. Members will have no difficulty in catching my eye, as I am quite vigilant. It would be helpful if they would try to distinguish in their own minds between interventions and speeches.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I am grateful, Mrs. Dunwoody.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> My hon. Friend mentioned the new deal. I should imagine that he and other members of the Committee will have seen an answer given to my hon.[Mr. Boswell]
Friend the Member for Buckingham. It characteristically states:
"New Deal employees will receive the normal rates". [Official Report, 26 January 1998; Vol. 305, c. 63.]<P>

<P>
It goes on to suggest that such employees may be subject to exceptions that the Low Pay Commission is considering. That is another example of the Government's approach to decison making.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend. His example illustrates a point to which I was coming. It shows with force a perversity in the Government's approach to the legislation. The Government propose to establish a new deal. That will introduce a subsidy that will presumably bring people on the new deal to a level of employability that they would not otherwise have achieved, because of the cost of employement. The Government are at the same time making further provision in the Bill to exempt people on the new deal from the general national minimum wage that will apply in the labour market.
<P>
The Government should be satisfied that the new deal is sufficient for that purpose. If they do not think that it is, why do they not introduce the provision simply to make those on the new deal more employable? It seems that the Government are seeking to achieve both purposes. There is no way of understanding whether the Government wish to apply both, and if so to what extent. The labour market could be significantly distorted if both are applied. People on the new deal are cheaper to employ, because they can be paid less, and because that lower wage rate will be subsidised. That combination may have distorting effects.
<P>
That matter brings me to the point that I was coming to when my hon. Friends helpfully intervened. The choice at stake is whether to cover people who are aged up to 25 years and who are on the new deal. That is not the same as covering those who are in training. The new deal hinges not only training, but on participation in the environment task force, or on going into work not necessarily with training under the auspices of the new deal. That is why the age was set at 26. The criteria relate to the previous employment status of the young people involved.
<P>
At the same moment at which the Government are placing an emphasis on young people through the new deal, the number of young people who will be affected is declining dramatically. The initial figure of 250,000 young people has already decreased to 122,000, which I recall as being the latest count. In such circumstances, it seems perverse to fix the clause upon a criterion that is fast changing. This is not a party political point, but an ample argument is already reflected in the decisions being made by the Minister's colleagues, who are shifting the focus of the new deal away from young people under 25 towards those who have been unemployed even though they are unemployed adults for more than six months.
<P>
As that focus shifts, why do not the same criteria apply? If the provision is intended to buttress those who are likely to be adversely affected by the application of the national minimum wage because of an undermining of their employability, and as the new deal is shifting from the under-25s to those who have been unemployed for more than six months, why does not this provision have the flexibility to track the structure of the new deal as the Government pursue that policy? Perhaps the Government have simply written into the Bill the terms of the policy as it applied in June or July, when it was drafted but here we are in January, and although their policy has shifted, the drafting has not shifted with it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I am following my hon. Friend's thesis intently. Does he agree that if the Government followed the trends in the labour market, they would substitute something else for lines 41 and 42? If they choose not to do so, but stick with those lines, they are engaged in naked age discrimination, with nothing other than age to justify their retention.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> My hon. Friend is absolutely right. If the Government pursued my train of argument, lines 41 and 42 would have made reference to a criterion of employability, however, that might have been defined. In the absence of that, my hon. Friend is right. Many people in the labour market who have difficulty obtaining jobs often because of a lack of qualifications, basic skills or job experience might well ask why the argument which led the Government to provide that those on the new deal who are especially unlikely to find work at the national minimum wage rate must be exempted, does not apply a fortiori to them, the longer-term unemployed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that his argument might be summarised by saying that the Government have in this clause elevated a priority albeit an obsolete priority to the status of a principle?
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> My hon. Friend is absolutely right. I do not know whether he was steering me gently towards a summary of my argument, but if he was, he was right to do so.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The Chair is always grateful for any assistance.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> So am I, Mrs. Dunwoody.
<P>
It is clear that nothing in the clause, particularly if it is helped by the amendment, stops the Government making different provision for different people according to their prospective employability. Referring to occupation, sectors or areas does not impinge on that. If we removed the age bar, to which my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham referred, we would leave the Government the option to pursue after the Low Pay Commission's recommendation, as we understand that Ministers are awaiting until then the logic of their own policy through exemptions to the national minimum wage. On that basis, I wonder why Ministers did not embrace an amendment on these lines before.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I should like to treat this group of amendments in two parts, taking amendments Nos. 94 and 80, which form a coherent whole, and then amendments Nos. 24 and 95.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The amendments are as the Chair called them. I said that I would accept assistance, but we should probably stick with the Chair's selection.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I am happy to do so, Mrs. Dunwoody. I was merely making the point that within this group of amendments, which form a coherent whole, amendments No. 24 and 95 between them form an incoherent whole.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Incoherence is not unheard of in the House of Commons.
<P>
<H5>11 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I am grateful for that guidance, Mrs. Dunwoody. Even in the very short time that I have been here, I have noticed that.
<P>
The question that gives rise to amendment No. 94 is why Opposition Members wish to delete lines 41 and 42. There are three reasons why those lines not only add nothing to the force and competence of the Bill, but will detract from Ministers' ability to implement the clause effectively. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham that the amendments would improve the Bill and have been drafted in the full acceptance that the Bill will eventually become law.
<P>
The first reason why these lines would be better eliminated from the Bill is that the proposed age limit of 26 is arbitrary. None of the various international definitions into which, in an increasingly global labour market, our labour market should fit, use 26 as the age limit at which people stop being young workers and become normal, as it were.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> As my hon. Friend refers to the age factor, it occurs to me that as it stands, at least morally, the clause would disallow a number of Members of this House from receiving their existing wage.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Life is very unfair.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I am not sure that I understand my hon. Friend's point. However, the hour is getting late.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Would my hon. Friend care to speculate briefly on the possibililty that the choice of 26 as the age limit is to do with eligibility for London Underground or British Rail reduced fares?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not speculate on that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I will not go down that road, Mrs. Dunwoody, although I must admit that my first thought was that the age limit had something to do with inter-rail passes. That was the last time that I noticed 26 being used as a cut-off point.
<P>
The International Labour Organisation and the European Union define young people for the purposes of employment and education the areas which are affected by the clause as people under 25 rather than under 26. As we are in a single market and as one of its great advantages is having a single labour market, introducing new distortions in national legislation that detract from the single market seems to be a perverse act from a Government who make much of their commitment to greater integration with Europe.
<P>
The second point is that even inside the United Kingdom, 26 is not the cut-off point for student support payments and income-related benefits. Again, 24-year-olds are the oldest group to be eligible for such benefits. Not content with introducing a distortion into the single market on a European basis, the Government are introducing a distortion into the national labour market. That also seems perverse. Their explanation, which is all to do with interaction with the new deal, seems absurdly short term for legislation which is clearly meant to last for many years to come. Governments of all stripes have introduced welfare-to-work schemes or their equivalent.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Does my hon. Friend believe that it also might be counter productive? At the age of 26, young people may not come within the new deal provisions and may also, whatever employer they work for, have to be raised to a national minimum wage rate from a lower rate. That creates a cliff-edge effect for young people when they enter work.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Such a double whammy would be bad for young workers needing training. They may not be especially economically productive nor easily employable.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> My hon. Friend should bear in mind the shift in the rate of non-working benefit such as income support. That is a further disincentive to continuing paid employment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> That is right. Benefits that are not in-work benefits impact on whether people want employment, part-time or full time. Distortions or cliff edges, as my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire said in the system have affected the employability of the low paid for years. The Government's introduction of new distortions goes against the interests of low-paid non-workers, of those who wish to work, or of those in work whom the Bill will render less employable.
<P>
I can understand the Government's rationale in saying that the clause must interact with the new deal programme. However, history shows that some programmes such as this work well and some do not. Unless this is the first such programme to hit the ground in perfect form, in time the Government will want to change it. I am sure that the Government will want to change elements of the new deal. It is not sensible to specify, in a transient piece of make-work programming, an age limit that fits neither with other national limits governing benefits or student support nor with the international limits governing young workers. The age limit of 26 is wrong because it is arbitrary. It is the wrong age to choose.
<P>
My second reason for supporting the amendment is that it is illogical to pick an age limit out of the air. The idea is that the clause would give the Secretary of State some dispensation or power to vary the rigidity of a single minimum wage applicable to all workers across the board. That is what the hon. Member for Wentworth wants, although the Government are not so sure. A skills limit would be more sensible than an age limit.
<P>
It is absurd to say that every person of 22 or 18, or 26, or any age will reach the same level of skill or place on the training curve. Yet the many existing[Mr. Green]
training schemes, all of which are measured, make it possible to state that a worker has attained national vocational qualification level 2, or whatever. There might be a reason to give the Secretary of State reserve powers to vary the provisions, but such variation would be better if it were done according to skill level rather than age. That would be more logical.
<P>
The Minister will know that other countries have training rates and recognise the separate status of trainees. In France, for example, there are separate rates for 17-year-old trainees and for 18-year-old trainees. I hope that the Minister will accept that arbitrary age limits are illogical. There are better ways to give the Secretary of State some reserve powers.
<P>
The third reason for my support of the amendment is that the Bill tilts the balance too far from the recommendations of the Low Pay Commission and gives too much discretion to the Secretary of State. Labour Members have continuously told us that we are not taking the commission seriously enough. The amendment gives the lie to that accusation. The clause allows the Secretary of State to drive a coach and horses through any of the commission's recommendations, not just generally but specifically. If the Government believe that the commission is doing a valuable job, allowing the Secretary of State to ignore it is not a sensible way to proceed, though Conservative Members do not necessarily share the Minister's view about how much discretion should be allowed.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 24 and 80 are Liberal Democrat amendments and, I assume, should be taken as a package. When combined, they are illogical.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It is customary to allow Ministers to reply to amendments, but if the hon. Gentleman insists on doing so I am sure that the Minister would be grateful.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> It will save me doing it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I am trying to probe Liberal Democrat Members have not yet spoken in the debate and tease out what the amendments might mean. When combined, they are illogical. The Secretary of State could prescribe such a low rate under clause 3(2)(b) as to render it inoperative.
<P>
Amendment No. 24 tries to cover people's age and training status simultaneously. I have already argued that training status is a more sensible way of dividing the work force, with some receiving full minimum wage and some a lesser version. Combining the two is likely to lead to many illogicalities and distortions in the labour market. Amendment No. 24 mentions 18-year-olds on training schemes. It would put at a disadvantage 19-year-olds on the same scheme. Many 18 and 19-year-olds reach the same level of attainment and would be equally useful to a prospective employer. Therefore, people who have reached their 19th birthday would, ipso facto, be less employable and, therefore, more likely to be dismissed and replaced by an 18-year-old trainee with about the same level of skill. That cannot be a sensible way forward. I should be interested to hear from Liberal Members; their amendments appear to be a way of rendering a large number of young workers less employable.
<P>
The Secretary of State is being given the wrong kind of discretion. Perhaps the Government believe somewhere at the back of their mind that discretion is needed to mitigate the effects of their policy, but it is based on the wrong type of measurement of workers, by age rather than skills, and takes away from the work of the Low Pay Commission.
<P>
<H5>11.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> Good evening, Mrs. Dunwoody. First, I apologise for my non-attendance earlier. I thank the Committee for its good wishes, which I shall pass on to my family. I also thank my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, who did not once flinch from what was thrown at her over the hours of darkness during daylight in which she had to listen to Conservative Members.
<P>
In all those hours, only one matter which I shall tackle in a moment arose that had not been dealt with already. Conservative Members oppose the national minimum wage, and everything that they say in every debate is predicated on a determination to undermine the Bill and hole it below the waterline. As the hon. Member for Ashford (Mr. Green) was speaking I was almost joining in: he has said the same things in every debate. I could have done the same with the hon. Members for South Cambridgeshire and for Buckingham. The latter hon. Member immatures with each successive clause: his Titanic of a contribution was holed at least four times when he had to be brought back into order.
<P>
Conservative Members in each debate speak about another group of people who should not be covered by the minimum wage. We have heard about how young people and older workers in fact, all workers should be excluded. Now we have heard why family members should be excluded: people going for a job interview will have to take a family tree along with their CVs.
<P>
Conservative Members have offered the Committee some ludicrous propositions, but all they add up to is that Conservatives do not like the national minimum wage: very little of what they have said has required an answer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> The Minister said that the Committee has been repetitive. Does he accept that we had heard the arguments adduced for amendments Nos. 24 and 80 before and that there was no need to go over them again? We are word perfect in them by now.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right. I shall go through the motions so as not to offend the Committee, but there are some things that I must say.
<P>
First, the excellent notes on clauses that we produced seem to have served no purpose. Conservative Members asked many questions about the clause, all of which are answered in part 2 of the notes on clause 3. Paragraph 5 sets out the specific reasons for the inclusion of the clause in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> In a moment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The Minister is not giving way.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> The hon. Members for South Cambridgeshire and for Ashford have developed a neat trick. They give way to the hon. Member for Daventry before they say anything. "Erskine May" should give a ruling about whether hon. Members can do that. I am not challenging the Chair, Mrs. Dunwoody. I was just making the point that I have not been fooled by that tactic yet. I shall give way to the hon. Gentleman at a suitable stage.
<P>
The clause is essentially an empowering measure, with specific focus on young people. It is no more and no less than that. It is important that we have the flexibility and discretion to ensure that when the Low Pay Commission comes forward with any proposals on young people in this category, we can take account of them if we are desirous of accepting them.
<P>
The clause is also about the universality of the Bill. The amendments proposed by the hon. Member for Daventry attack the concept in principle and, as my hon. Friend the Member for Wentworth pointed out, undermine the Bill's universality. The clause is specific to ensure that any recommendations regarding training will mean that young people in different areas do not suffer discrimination just because one young person lives in Cornwall and another lives in Birmingham. If one works in textiles and another in catering, there will be no discrimination because of the sector of employment. If one young person works for a large company and one for a small company, there will be no discrimination because of the size of the company. There will be no discrimination regarding different occupations if one is a chef, say, and another an electrician.
<P>
The proposals are consistent with the concept of the universality of the Bill. That is why it is critical that it should be drafted in this way, giving us the flexibility to ensure that we have an empowering clause regarding any recommendation from the Low Pay Commission.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am trying to follow the Minister's argument carefully. He talked about universality and implied that the amendments seek to derogate from that. He has also said that clause 3 is all about young persons under the age of 26. He did not imply that it can be extended to any other categories. Can he confirm, because that was my technical concern, that clause 3 is tied to young persons under 26 and has no wider application?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I do not want to stray into clause 4. We shall discuss the issues in that clause when we come to debate it. Clause 3 is essentially an empowering clause with a specific focus on young people. That is what the clause is about and the notes on clauses openly set out its purpose. When we come to clause 4, Opposition Members will discuss what they believe the issues to be, and I look forward to that. With their help, we may get there, and sooner rather than later.
<P>
The themes set out by the Opposition are not new. The themes that have been discussed since the debate on the first amendment to the first clause have included general exemption and an attempt to ensure that exemptions will be made regarding size of company, age, sector or region. Those are the themes behind these proposals, and I ask my hon. Friends to resist them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Perhaps the Minister will acknowledge that he was being uncharitable in saying that we were not working from the notes on clauses. I thought that I had made it clear that I was doing just that understanding what the Minister had done regarding the new deal, but suggesting that employability, and the change in focus of the new deal that my hon. Friend the Member for Ashford added, might change the structure of the exemption from the Minister's point of view.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> We had a lengthy and constructive debate earlier on employability, adaptability, the changing nature of the labour market and the role of Government employers and employees. I do not think that we need to go back over that ground. Most members of the Committee have a common approach as to what we need to do. This policy fits within that broad spectrum of issues, including training. That is why 
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Will the Minister give way on that point?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> Let me finish my sentence, please. That is why we have made it clear that it is essential to maintain the clause in its current form. That would allow us the opportunity to hear the Low Pay Commission's specific recommendations on young people.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Of course the Minister is right that we had a full and intelligent debate on employability, but that does not justify his failure to heed now the point that my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire is making. Why should not the criterion of the clause be skills or employability rather than age?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I listened to the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire, but I rejected his view.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> What of his thesis?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> The hon. Gentleman is obviously perplexed about not getting through to me. I doubt that his views will get through to me between now and the end of our proceedings on the Bill [Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I did not hear what the hon. Member for Daventry said, but it was obviously derogatory. I shall ignore it, as I am a better man than to rise to unworthy comments or signs.
<P>
Amendment Nos. 24 and 80 would narrow or remove the outright exemption. We discussed training earlier and found common ground. Narrowing the application of the provision would restrict us, given that the Low Pay Commission is completing a significant programme of evidence taking, much of it concerned with training. We have asked it to make recommendations, and it is therefore critical that the clause stays in its current form so that it can take account of those recommendations.
[Mr. McCartney]
<P>
The principle of training is well taken, as is the principle of ensuring that young people are covered so that whatever happens after the implementation of the minimum wage, they are not used as they have been under previous Administrations simply as skivvy labour with little or no quality training and no opportunity to move into the labour market, remain there and expand their horizons with good employment practices. We agree on that, so we must give the Low Pay Commission the opportunity to consider the evidence.
<P>
Opposition Members said that the evidence from Europe and other countries shows that any construction of the minimum wage must take account of young people. The Government recognise that, and it is clear in the remit that we gave to the Low Pay Commission. Each country comes to its own conclusions from the evidence of its own labour market, and we shall do the same. The clause gives us the opportunity to do that, and I therefore ask hon. Members to reject the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I felt tempted to borrow a concept from Disraeli and preface my remarks with the words "we young people", but it might not be entirely appropriate, for me at least.
<P>
The debate has been useful. As the Minister said, we have covered some of the same ground but perhaps on retilling it, we have found out one or two more things. I sense, however, that there is still reluctance among Labour Members to accept that our approach to the issue is bone fide.
<P>
I speak not only for myself I am used to it; it is my job but for my hon. Friends who have spoken with much knowledge after careful scrutiny of the Bill. It is assumed too readily that when we propose an amendment, it is ipso facto a wrecking amendment and designed to subvert the universality of the Bill. Both the Minister and to some extent the hon. Member for Wentworth were guilty of that assumption. We tabled our amendments which, despite the remarks that I am about to make, we will press to a vote so that we might establish a better, more flexible and more responsive basis for the consideration of exclusions under the clause.
<P>
The hon. Member for Wentworth did not allow me to intervene, but he made interesting remarks about our attitude to the role of the Low Pay Commission and sought to point out a difference between my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham and me. It seems perfectly sensible to say that we do not particularly like the Bill and do not think that it will help in the way that the Government claim that it will, but we acknowledge that a process, including the appointment of the Low Pay Commission, is under way. While we might have reservations about its members, we recognise that the commission has set out to do a job that, in the terms of the Government's mandate to it, is worth while.
<P>
<H5>11.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
However, clause 3 is clearly keyed in to the recommendations of the commission that is expressed in clause 5 so it does not stand alone. Having issues considered would not just be a matter of Ministers waking up and deciding on an arbitrary set of fresh distinctions some of my hon. Friends' ideas would bear scrutiny; they are far from arbitrary and might be more appropriate because they would have been run past the Low Pay Commission and been subject to its recommendations.
<P>
We had an exchange which, perhaps, did not do complete justice to the fact that the Secretary of State would be obliged to explain why a recommendation was not being accepted. There is an involvement between the commission and any exceptions under the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> On a point of clarification, which I think I have had to make before, the recommendations, whatever they are, will be brought to the House for decisions to be made on regulations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I readily concede that. I was not suggesting that the power was exclusive to the Government. That dialogue is interesting and broadly positive, but I pass from that to what we have realised more clearly now than ever before the clause is keyed exclusively to young persons under the age of 26. The exception covers those young people, not other persons.
<P>
We should press the amendment to a vote because the restriction is inappropriate. I shall not give the Committee a precise paradigm of the exceptions that we want we would not have started from here but there might be better ways to help people who are relatively disadvantaged in terms of skills or employability than an arbitrary age criterion.
<P>
The Minister of State is ill-advised to deprive himself of any weapon other than age criterion, although I readily concede that he does not have to use a monolithic rate below 26. Nevertheless, the Government's position has resonance with what my right hon. Friend the Member for Old Bexley and Sidcup (Sir E. Heath), who is not a great participant in Standing Committees these days, once memorably described as one-club golfers. The Minister wants to address a range of issues concerning people for whom an exception might be appropriate. What he has put forward, keyed to a single criterion 
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will put it on the record that the right hon. Member for Old Bexley and Sidcup is in favour of a national minimum wage.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I recall precisely that. Members of the Committee would have been well informed if my right hon. Friend had given us the benefit of his views.
<P>
The Minister's solution whatever else my right hon. Friend the Member for Old Bexley and Sidcup might think, it would not have found favour with him is a one-club solution. It is inflexible and cannot be amended according to the circumstances of the time. The Opposition are offering the Minister an alternative which, through the Low Pay Commission's advice, would give him more flexibility and more headroom. He would be well advised to take the Opposition's advice and accept the amendment. If he does not, I must press it to a division.

<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> On a point of order, Mrs. Dunwoody. Am I right in thinking that the amendments are grouped with others relating to clause 1, and merely reappear now for formal consideration and vote?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Yes, I do not feel the need to explain every bit of formal procedure. I am sure that all hon. Members have read the Standing Orders and there is no need to repeat what they already know. However, the hon. Gentleman is correct the Government amendments were debated earlier, and needed no more than formal agreement.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 3 in page 3, line 2, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(2A) Nothing in this section shall prevent the regulations making provision which treat persons differently in relation to

<P>
No. 73, in clause 4, page 3, line 16, leave out from "ages" to end of line 17.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am sure, Mrs. Dunwoody, that you will have noticed that amendments Nos. 3, 4 and 82 are in my name and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Weston-super-Mare and that they deal with regional variations in the national minimum wage and with different hours and patterns of work. They apply to people under 26 years of age, but that puts me in a quandary.
<P>
The Committee spent many hours debating the philosophical, practical and political principles underlying three amendments that I moved earlier in our proceedings. The arguments advanced on behalf of[The Chairman]
those amendments which apply to these amendments too were fully tested. Our success, or otherwise, in getting the Government to agree is a matter of record, but I am sure that at this stage I have nothing further to add, in support of the three amendments in this group in my name, that will change the Government's view.
<P>
Therefore, Mrs. Dunwoody, I should prefer to listen to the contributions in support of the other amendments the majority in the group. If I may, I shall return later to the amendments in my name.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> If I may say so, Mrs. Dunwoody, the hon. Member for Eastleigh has displayed a realistic approach. Consideration of where the national minimum wage should apply and of whether it should be varied has been very full already. There is no race in tabling the most amendments. When I was in school plays, we used to compete over the number of speeches we had, regardless of length or importance, but that is not a sensible measure of productivity.
<P>
Amendment No. 96 is a little paver, while No. 97 is more substantive. Other amendments rehearse familiar arguments, and my hon. Friends may wish to speak to amendments in their names later.
<P>
Amendment No. 97 proposes exceptions in the regulations, subject to a criterion that the Secretary of State would enact, without which there could be adverse effects in several areas.
<P>
<H5>11.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The more perceptive members of the Committee of whom I suspect there are many and Ministers and their officials will probably have noticed a certain resonance in the nature of the drafting, which proposes taking account of any adverse effects on levels of employment, the rate of inflation, the competitiveness of business in general and small firms in particular, the cost to industry, and the cost to public funds. Allowing for some redrafting licence, those are precisely the terms embodied in the remit letter from the President of the Board of Trade to the chairman of the Low Pay Commission.
<P>
I want to highlight two points. The first is procedural and mechanical, and the second is substantive. First, we do not yet know what the Low Pay Commission will recommend, although we know that it has considered the greater part of the evidence that has been submitted to it. We also know that it waits with continuing anticipation for the Government to submit their evidence. It would have been helpful to have that evidence in Committee to inform our debates.
<P>
When the commission makes up its mind and draws up its recommendations, it is required, in that well-known civil service term, to have regard to several matters. The list is self-evidently sensible and I am not arguing with it. However, from a procedural point of view, let us suppose that the straitjacket that the Government have imposed on themselves and, by extension, on the Low Pay Commission as a result of the Bill's drafting continues to apply, and that therefore the only exceptions give or take one or two minor and specific cases in later clauses that the Government are prepared to entertain are for young people under 26, on which the commission has been invited to make recommendations. If the commission, in having regard to those wider economic issues, came to the view that something else needed to be done, whether that was a special rate for a particular category or a special exemption for, say, trainees of any age I shall not rehearse that argument again the Government would be unable to do anything about it.
<P>
They could say that they were terribly worried about, for example, the problem of adult literacy that is a personal interest of mine and the people who have inadequate basic skills with which to hold down a job in today's world but would argue that, because of the remit letter, while they could think about it and say that it was a problem, they could not find a way through the regulations to tackle it. That is a limiting factor in the Bill, which should be addressed.
<P>
There is one other way in which the Low Pay Commission could deal with such situations, and there is a possibility that it might. You will have heard, Mrs. Dunwoody, as will other hon. Members, of the many problems that have been identified mainly, but not exclusively, by Opposition Members. There have been gentle recriminations suggesting that we are bent on wrecking the Bill by proposing so many exemptions that it would become this is not an argument that the Government have used like a gruy\gere cheese, shot through with exceptions. On the assumption that some of those problems I make no dramatic claims for all of them are points of substance and genuine concern and may well concern the Low Pay Commission, the only way to deal with it, given the Bill's structure, is to go for what might loosely be called a lowest common denominator approach to the establishment of the national minimum wage at its single rate, subject to the young person's exception, whatever that may be. If they did that, the recommendation would be for a very low rate of national minimum wage. Otherwise, there would be problems with one category or another and it would be impossible to produce something that did not give rise to a number of adverse consequences to levels of employment, rate of inflation, competitiveness including small firms cost to industry and cost to public funds. The Government have a dilemma regarding the Bill's structure and its exceptions.
<P>
That is the point of procedure. If the commission does all that work, which it will do as assiduously as it can, and it identifies a problem in the Government's remit letter, how can it make proposals that deliver the goods or meet the problem?
<P>
The second question is that, given that the Government have set out a range of things for the commission to have regard to which are largely real issues in the economy, we need to say that they are all relevant and may give rise to serious economic consequences. Briefly, and not exhaustively, I should like to explore the potential consequences. If the Low Pay Commission is considering them in parallel, I should be delighted. If it wants to listen to what I have to say through the medium of the Official Report, I should be delighted. If the commission's members disregard my opinion because they do not agree with it, that is a matter for them. But matters should be properly considered.
<P>
We deal first with the level of employment. It has been said from the Opposition Benches before, but it should briefly be mentioned again, that raising the price of a commodity, in normal economic theory unless that commodity is an inferior good is likely to reduce the demand for it. Although there are important exceptions, including the fact that the people at stake are human beings a real consideration that is shared by members on both sides of the Committee labour markets do not operate within a different set of laws of economics from the markets for any other commodity or activity, goods or services. So it is likely that if the national minimum wage means anything, and if, as Ministers clearly wish, it raises the supply price of employment, then, ipso facto, demand will go down. There will be fewer people in employment; the level of unemployment will rise.
<P>
The level of that effect is a function of a number of factors. One is a function of the economic variables; there might well be argument as to how much those two are linked. It might also be a function of any compensating factors. The Minister has traditionally set great store by the income effects of higher wages. We demonstrated earlier in the Committee's proceedings that some of those might be lost as a result of price effects. It would clearly be a function of the level of national minimum wage chosen. Indeed, if the Minister and his colleagues had not accepted that concern, they would not have put it into the remit letter to the Low Pay Commission. The Minister has also conceded the point by indicating that the level must be set at a sensible rate, meaning that it should not be too high. If it were, despite the fact that the hon. Gentleman sees income effects as beneficial to low-paid workers, unemployment would go up. It is difficult to argue that it would not; it would clearly depend on the levels chosen.
<P>
I have already spoken of the varying distribution of low pay within broad parameters; I shall not do so again tonight. As soon as the relevant numbers are amended in the way that we discussed in connection with an amendment considered earlier, the target number of people who will be affected will rise rapidly. Ipso facto, the number of people likely to lose their jobs may also increase.
<P>
I shall deal briefly with other matters relating to employment. The legislation will have repercussive effects on the way in which the employment package is structured. My hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire, who may well speak to the amendments, has spoken of those effects.
<P>
I fear that not only an economic macro problem but a series of micro problems may arise. That fear has become increasingly clear to me as the Committee has proceeded. There may be some changes for the better, but I have a nasty feeling that employers, perhaps with good will, will restructure their remuneration packages in a way that may not be to their workers' advantage in the long term.
<P>
I remind the Committee that the amendment seeks to provide a means for the Low Pay Commission to form a view about exceptions involving the relevant criteria, after it has made recommendations to the Secretary of State.
<P>
I have already spoken a little about the rate of inflation. It is self-evident that increasing the cost of employing people would affect prices. That cost will apply to every conceivable business in Britain. Such an effect will depend upon the national minimum wage rate that is recommended and accepted. The Committee does not know what that rate will be. It is difficult to envisage a compensating impact of productivity that would offset or nullify the effect.
<P>
I should guess that within the target range of estimates, another 0.25 per cent. may well be added to the retail prices index. That will be paid by you and me, Mrs. Dunwoody, and by some people who may nominally benefit from the national minimum wage. That should not be accepted lightly, at a time when there are indications that inflation is above target, when consumers have taken substantial hits in terms of prior tax-induced price rises, and when interest rates have risen five times since May. The economy is on the verge of cost pressure. As the Chief Secretary to the Treasury recently warned, Ministers are understandably becoming anxious about pressures on wage rates, and about potential settlements.

<P>

<B>Mr. Green:</B> Has my hon. Friend considered the effect on interest rates of the inflationary cost pressures that would be caused if a rise in the minimum wage were to push through differentials to wider pay claims? With the Bank of England in its new quasi-independent state, the Monetary Policy Committee is designed 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I did not want to interrupt the hon. Gentleman, but I expect a degree of discipline in the Committee. The general debate should be related to the amendment. A general debate on monetary policy is a little too wide.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am mindful of your strictures, Mrs. Dunwoody. The formal answer to my hon. Friend is that I have many times considered the impact of the independence of the Bank of England on monetary policy.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> But not in this Committee.
<P>
<H5>12 midnight</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> But not in this Committee. I entirely endorse what you have said, Mrs Dunwoody.
<P>
There are potential problems. It would be daft if the Low Pay Commission and, indeed, Ministers did not have regard to that.
<P>
We should deal at this point with differentials, because they chime in on the five criteria in the amendment. They will have a micro-economic impact, but there may be a macro impact as well. We are concerned not simply with the first-round effects of the imposition of the minimum wage on low-paid workers, but with what happens thereafter to pay rates. Given a certain poise in pay rates currently, will an inflationary spiral be triggered? I am not sure, but we would be much comforted if the Government came cleaner on their assessment of differential impacts.
[Mr. Boswell]
<P>
The CBI and others have expressed concern on the matter. The Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union was anxious about what would happen to skilled workers where low pay rates were increased and there was clustering just above the minimum wage rate. There would be pressure for its members to raise differentials back to what they were. It is almost inconceivable that there would not be some differential effect.
<P>
When in government, we used a working hypothesis of 50 per cent. restoration of differentials. That may not take place in the first year or so. Those who are familiar with incomes policy will recall that it often took a long time for a springback to occur, but they could be powerful. That is a first-order effect in terms of inflation.
<P>
The intervention of my hon. Friend the Member for Ashford prompts me to discuss the second-round effects caused by the restoration of differentials, which must be of concern. If they are not, the Low Pay Commission does not have to make a recommendation about them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> My hon. Friend may like to know that I have a copy of the speech by the head of employment affairs at the Engineering Employers Federation. He said 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman means his intervention to be brief and is certainly not going to quote from a document.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I was not going to quote, Mrs. Dunwoody; I was going to paraphrase. The representatives of trade unions said that they would seek to maintain differentials.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> That is a helpful comment which leads me on to competitiveness.
<P>
On Second Reading, the President of the Board of Trade spoke with straight face and unflinching gaze about flexilibity. The Government apparently still hold the view that the measure will make us more competitive. For the reasons that I deployed in relation to levels of employment and the case for inflation, I find that difficult to believe at the macro level. It is particularly disturbing at some micro levels.
<P>
As promised, I shall not rehash the regional argument, but I was struck more by the situation in Northern Ireland then by that in any other part of the United Kingdom. Average wage rates are 60 per cent. of those in London and a separate country, the Irish Republic, with a complex and rather sectoralised minimum wage structure, lies across the land frontier. I hope that Ministers and the Low Pay Commission will look carefully at the situation, not least because of the tense political circumstances. We all sympathise with Ministers who are trying to find their way through them. There must be differential repercussions if the national minimum wage is set at a high level.
<P>
That is at the macro level, but I shall turn now to small firms, which studies show will be hit differentially. Small firms tend to pay less, but there may be some compensatory advantages. They may use family labour in the way described in the debate on the previous amendment. They may have a more friendly atmosphere and a more informal working style, with less emphasis on formal qualifications or monitoring than larger enterprises. However, the national minimum wage, and any subsequent change to it, will have a differential effect on small firms.
<P>
The President of the Board of Trade's remit letter to the Low Pay Commission headlines small firms when, in describing the general impact on general business competitiveness, it makes special reference to the small firms sector. Small firms need careful treatment.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> My hon. Friend will remember that earlier I asked the Parliamentary Under-Secretary for her definition of a small firm. What order of magnitude does my hon. Friend have in mind when he talks about small firms?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will be able to give a brief answer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I will indeed: the Low Pay Commission should pay close attention to that question. At a psychological level, a small firm is often one that considers itself to be small. A larger firm with a sophisticated personnel department and a structured policy for employee development may be able, subject to differentials, to take the changes on the chin. It is different for small companies. They may react unwisely, excessively or disproportionately to what they regard as a threat.
<P>
Small firms expand the economy and contribute to employment growth. They must not be forced out of business or into sacking workers because of that perceived threat.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I suspect that my hon. Friends the Members for Daventry and for Solihull are thinking of micro businesses, which will be especially affected. What is the opinion of my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry about the relationship between very small businesses and self-employed people, who are not covered by the national minimum wage?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am self-employed as a partner in a farm. I employ one person, and the dualism between the employer and the employed has been mentioned in earlier debates.
<P>
The problem of competitiveness cannot be unpicked from the problem of the cost to industry. I do not accuse the President of the Board of Trade of being repetitive in her remit, but the problem is somewhat larger. My hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire referred earlier to the Engineering Employers Federation. That organisation's director of employment relations recently expressed concern not just about the national minimum wage but about a series of interacting costs facing businesses, large and small, arising from a number of factors Government decisions, the imposition of the working-time directive, the social chapter, and so forth. The danger is that whatever Ministers' good intentions and I am not challenging their bona fides that will all be loaded on to business. If business takes a downturn, as it is forecast to do in the current year or the next 12 or 18 months, that may be the straw that breaks the camel's back. It may have alarming industrial repercussions. Just when industry is feeling the pinch when it comes to the market, costs and the Government's regulatory requirements, it may also be faced with an additional imposition.
<P>
The Low Pay Commission, which has received extensive submissions, has been asked to consider these proposals and it will do so. I have no problem with that. However, I come back to the import of the amendments. Given the important issues that they raise, the Low Pay Commission does not simply have to consider them but should have the means, if something has to be done about them, for recommending a series of exceptions or other ways of softening the blow to business.
<P>
We are all on the same side in wanting business to be successful. We have no interest in a perverse response to the Government's national minimum wage. We must continue to give warnings about it that is a dualism that we will continue to preserve. However, now that we have provided a flag-up on the concerns, not to have the mechanism for dealing with them makes it more likely that they will prove to be a sad reality.
