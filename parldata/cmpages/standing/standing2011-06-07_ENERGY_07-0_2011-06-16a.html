                  </strong> The amendments, to various clauses, would all
do the same thing: direct attention to what I trust will be a
substantial part of the energy company obligation, which is energy
efficiency improvements for fuel-poor households, and hard-to-treat
properties when the person living in the house is experiencing fuel
poverty. In those circumstances, it is likely that the fuel bill
savings will be insufficient to pay for the full cost of improvements
and so cannot be funded by the green deal alone. The aim of the
amendments is effectively to ensure that when someone, through the ECO,
has what might otherwise have been a green deal makeover to 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 260<a class="bkMark" name="Column260">&#160;</a>
                  </div>their home, the work that is done is bid for in an open and fair way,
and not monopolised by the utility energy
companies.<a class="bkMark" name="11061631000017">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
amendments arise from the worry that, under existing supplier
obligations within certain community energy saving programmes, there
seems to be evidence of a difference in the quotations for CESP
funding, depending on whether the energy supplier carries out the work
in the contract, or the housing association or another party carries
out the work and is then funded through CESP. It can be inferred from
that that some energy suppliers are paying their in-house contractors a
different rate for work that has perhaps not been tendered for
competitively. The ECO will be funded by a levy on all fuel bills, and
such action is not commensurate with that principle. There is not a
level playing field for those who supply improvements under the ECO
scheme. We must put a question mark against the extent to which there
are uncompetitive practices in how the ECO works that could prevent a
healthy market from developing overall for the installation of energy
efficiency
measures.<a class="bkMark" name="11061631000018">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
ECO is essential if the green deal is to work in low-income households,
and when they cannot afford to heat their homes adequately, green deal
improvements will not necessarily just reduce fuel bills, but may
enable the householders to heat their homes adequately—a
different principle from that under the general green deal
arrangements. As people will put a premium on heating their homes
adequately, rather than simply saving money on their fuel bills, they
are likely to have insufficient resources to repay the costs of the
improvements and so will qualify for the
ECO.<a class="bkMark" name="11061631000019">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
amendments will ensure that the best deal is achieved when improvements
are needed and provide transparency and a level playing field. In any
event, as we have heard, it is unlikely that the arrangements would be
the same as those for the straight-up green deal, in relation to
procedures for the assessor and the number of quotes to be obtained,
particularly in the case of a tenant of another organisation. There
should be a level playing field when a first look is taken at the
funding for the arrangements; that would give an assurance that the
mechanisms that might otherwise have been employed—obtaining an
assessment and making sure that it leads to a series of
quotes—are built into the
process.<a class="bkMark" name="11061631000020">&#160;</a>

               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“It
will not, however, fall to the consumer to bring Green Deal finance and
ECO together. We would expect ECO support to be integrated into the
Green Deal framework so that where ECO financial support and Green Deal
finance combine to deliver improvements, the details are arranged

               <p class="tabbed">The
aim of the amendments is to ensure that the ECO is available for any
green deal provider and not monopolised by the big six energy
companies, because a monopoly on the ECO could give the energy
companies a competitive advantage and enable them to outsell other
green deal providers. We want the widest possible range of providers
involved in the green deal, but of course we also want to ensure that
there is value for

difficult and expensive for smaller Green Deal providers to engage and

natural business reasons, an energy company might also be a Green Deal
provider and might have a preference for funding their own internal
Green Deal activity. The company might prefer to provide ECO subsidy to
its own Green Deal transactions, as this would allow it to grow the
Green Deal side of its business and gain market share (at the expense
of other Green Deal providers which had no such access to

amendments.<a class="bkMark" name="11061631000026">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Concern
has been expressed by several organisations that the green deal, as it
stands, relies too heavily on big corporate names, and favours
vertically integrated businesses that will dominate the marketplace
from the outset with a one-stop-shop approach, which could be bad for
the market and consumers if it leads to less
competition.<a class="bkMark" name="11061631000027">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">According
to the consumer advice group, Which?, only one in five of the public
find their energy supplier trustworthy. Research by YouGov for the
Great British Refurb campaign found that 46% of the public trusted
their local authority to deliver a green deal scheme, compared with
just 28% trusting their energy supplier and only 9% trusting DIY firms
or supermarkets. We want consumers, especially those in vulnerable
households, to be able to access their ECO via organisations that they
trust.<a class="bkMark" name="11061631000028">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There
are strong economic reasons for ensuring that small and medium-sized
enterprises have equal access to the green deal market, which we talked
about in an earlier sitting. As we know, the construction sector is
dominated by small firms that have been hit particularly hard by the
recession. Despite some growth, construction activity fell by 4.7%. The
amendments would ensure that those small and medium-sized construction
companies have an equal opportunity to take part in what will be a
fantastic green
scheme.<a class="bkMark" name="11061631000029">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Federation of Small Businesses has highlighted that, under current
proposals, small contractors are already at risk of being excluded from
delivering the work, because there is no finance mechanism to allow
businesses that are not tied to major green deal providers to offer an
alternative service. Energy companies, major retailers and banks could
therefore dominate the market, and the choice of providers available to
consumers could be reduced. The purpose of the amendments is to avoid
that outcome and ensure that there is as wide a market as
possible.<a class="bkMark" name="11061631000030">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Minister last Tuesday made some important points about the green deal
market, and they are worth reiterating in support of the amendments
that we are discussing. He said that he wanted a fully engaged small
and medium-sized enterprise sector, and
added:<a class="bkMark" name="11061631000031">&#160;</a>
               </p>

                  </strong> Good morning, Mr Crausby. With your
permission and for the benefit of the Committee, before I move on to
the amendment, I would like to summarise some of the points from last
week that we have followed up, and which are relevant to today’s
proceedings. We had a very detailed debate on the private rented sector
on Tuesday. As always, I thought it would be helpful if I were to run
through the commitments that I made and the progress that I have made
since the issues were raised by the Committee.<a class="bkMark" name="11061631000035">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Several
Committee members, including my hon. Friend the Member for Wells and
the hon. Member for Brighton, Pavilion, raised a range of important
issues about the role of letting agents. I made a commitment to check
with parliamentary counsel. They have confirmed that a landlord could
not circumvent the prohibition by engaging an estate agent or letting
agent, and that those agents would be acting as the agent of a
particular landlord in those cases, leaving the landlord
liable.<a class="bkMark" name="11061631000036">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">On the
substantive issue of marketing, we have confirmed that we already have
the powers, when making regulations under the Energy Bill provisions,
to include marketing the property. I am not yet in a position to commit
to making such provisions, but we have time ahead of secondary
legislation to look at that matter in more detail, as we discussed. I
assure my hon. Friend the Member for Wells and the hon. Member for
Brighton, Pavilion, that we shall do so seriously. I am happy to
continue to work together as we undertake that
process.<a class="bkMark" name="11061631000037">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">My
hon. Friend the Member for Wells and the hon. Member for Liverpool,
Wavertree, raised the issue of retaliatory evictions. I know that they
feel strongly about it and have taken some time to get well acquainted
with the issue. The Committee will be pleased to hear that I have taken
the opportunity since Tuesday to speak directly to the Housing
Minister, who has confirmed 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 263<a class="bkMark" name="Column263">&#160;</a>
                  </div>that he is happy for us to set up a joint working group to consider that
specific matter and try to garner a new and up-to-date evidence
base. We look forward to establishing that group
and progressing its recommendations over the
summer.<a class="bkMark" name="11061631000038">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As
to enforcement in the private rented sector, the hon. Members for
Brighton, Pavilion, and for Ogmore, and my hon. Friends the Members for
Norwich South and for Wells, will be pleased to hear that I have
already written to the Local Government Association to seek its views,
now that we have amended the Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11061631000039">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I have also
written to the hon. Member for Hyndburn to explain the links between
the minimum standards enforcement and the housing health and safety
rating system. In short, they may be used in combination to ensure that
local authorities have at their disposal the most effective enforcement
mechanisms. For example, local authorities already have rights to enter
properties under the rating system, where there is an immediate threat
to life, to make improvement works and charge the costs to the
landlord. I have written to the hon. Member for Ogmore to explain the
barriers to further extending such powers of entry. I have also written
to the hon. Members for Brighton, Pavilion, and for Hyndburn with more
details on tribunals in respect of the tenant energy efficiency
regulations.<a class="bkMark" name="11061631000040">&#160;</a>

I would like to thank my hon. Friend the Member for Winchester for
suggesting using trade organisations to reach a range of non-domestic
tenants and landlords to raise awareness of the green deal. Acting on
that sensible and creative point, I have written to the Minister with
responsibility for business and enterprise, my hon. Friend the Member
for Hertford and Stortford (Mr Prisk), to follow through with those
suggestions.<a class="bkMark" name="11061631000041">&#160;</a>

                  </span> I am grateful for the
speed with which the Minister has acted on the issues that we raised in
Committee; that has been helpful. However, I have read the letter and I
am still not clear on one thing, which I wonder whether he will
clarify. It is about the role of third parties acting on behalf of
tenants. We have established that third parties will be able to make
green deal requests on behalf of tenants under the provisions. Will
third parties be able to make requests for relevant energy efficiency
improvements, and take a case to the tribunal if necessary? There was
an issue with third parties acting in tribunals, and we had a big
discussion about how complex that could
be.<a class="bkMark" name="11061631000042">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">While
I have the floor, I will add two small further points. Will the
Minister clarify that the request may be made by tenants in privately
rented properties of any energy efficiency standard, rather than just
those falling below the E rating? Will the measure be open to long
leasehold tenants—owner-occupiers in blocks of flats—as
opposed to short-term tenants, to make requests of
freeholders?<a class="bkMark" name="11061631000043">&#160;</a>

do not think that there is a

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Today
we will focus on the detail of the energy company obligation, known as
the ECO. As I set out previously, the ECO will be entirely focused on
the needs of the lower-income and most vulnerable tenants and property
owners, and on hard-to-treat properties. In earlier sittings, hon.
Members across parties have spoken powerfully about the importance of
the twin objectives of helping the vulnerable and reducing emissions to
prevent dangerous climate change. As I have said, we will consult in
the autumn on the scale and reach of the ECO and on the balance of the
twin, and not always mutually exclusive, objectives. I am sure that the
Committee will understand that I cannot prejudge the consultation, but
I am keen to hear more of the Committee’s views and to garner as
much wisdom in the Committee Room as I can. I will certainly listen and
reflect on the
contributions.<a class="bkMark" name="11061631000045">&#160;</a>

                  </span> I would like to follow up on the
compliment made by the hon. Member for Brighton, Pavilion, on the
Minister’s openness and willingness to respond to questions
raised. Is he aware that the hon. Member for Liverpool, Wavertree,
blogged on the Politics for People website last week, saying that she
felt that the Bill was not “up to the task” of delivering
energy efficiency, and that there was a “staggering lack of
detail” in the proposals? The Bill is currently in Committee,
which is about creating a framework, and the Minister has said that he
will introduce legislation. Does he share my sense of disappointment?
The Committee has been working extremely well and co-operatively. Does
he agree that this might be an opportunity for the hon. Lady to

it directly contradicted the comments that the hon. Member for
Liverpool, Wavertree and Opposition Members made in Committee. It was a
slight case of Jack in town and Bunbury in the country, but I realise
that those comments appeal to different audiences. I hope that we will
see a little more consistency in future, but perhaps we should not

                  </strong> I reassure hon. Members that if ECO companies
choose to distribute subsidies in fundamentally anti-competitive ways,
broad powers in the Bill will tackle that. For example, they will be
obliged to deliver their obligation, or a substantive chunk of it, in
particular ways. I assure Committee members that when I was in
opposition, I spent much time talking with stakeholders and thinking
through the nature of the Bill. We have thought about how the new
framework would work, what we wanted behind it, and our aspirations for
it. My hon. Friends and colleagues have worked with me on the
proposition, first in opposition and then in Government. The intention
to have more competition to drive a healthy market has always been at
the forefront of our minds. We have always intended to introduce
measures that not only shatter the idea of the previous
Government’s one-provider monopoly, but get beyond the big six
and way beyond Warm Front and the carbon emissions reduction target
model. This is an ideal opportunity to marry our energy ambitions with
the coalition’s localism and big society agendas.<a class="bkMark" name="11061631000054">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We absolutely
intend to ensure that there is a strong and vibrant local alternative,
but, by definition, we cannot prescribe exactly what that should be.
The local response will be different in different parts of the country
and in different communities. We want to create as much diversity and
choice in local provision as possible through an overarching,
non-prescriptive framework, as well as through underpinning powers that
prevent consolidation into one or two market players, which we saw in
the energy sector as a whole under the previous Government.<a class="bkMark" name="11061631000055">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I am not
persuaded that it would be right to use the powers before there is any
evidence of need. In doing so, we might inadvertently risk putting
costs on to ECO companies for no real benefit. At the same time, I
fully recognise that green deal providers may be looking for assurance
that ECO subsidy will be available on a genuinely and reasonably open
basis. That is why my Department and my officials are actively
exploring with energy companies, local authorities and a plethora of
smaller stakeholders and SMEs the possibility of a mechanism to bring
together energy companies and green deal providers in an open market.
That would not be dissimilar to the ideas to which the hon. Member for
Southampton, Test alluded in his remarks. We are in the same sort of
place. I would be interested to explore further with him, outside of
the Committee, how that might work in practice. I would welcome his
input into our conversations with market participants about creating
this framework and an open market where measures for the ECO subsidy
are traded via a broker or market along the lines that he suggested.
That is exactly what we are thinking.<a class="bkMark" name="11061631000056">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Obviously we
want to ensure that that does not create an additional burden, that it
is not complicated to enter and that it is non-bureaucratic, so that we
do not simply set up a market mechanism for its own sake. If we could
stress-test some of our ideas with the hon. Gentleman, that would be
helpful.<a class="bkMark" name="11061631000057">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> In assistance and sympathy with the hon.
Lady, I will speak briefly on the principle of the amendment, which is
worthy. From the wording of the amendment, I understand that it intends
that ECO funding should be available to properties not in the green
deal plan. We have had a fair bit of debate on that in earlier clauses,
so I will not rehearse that again.<a class="bkMark" name="11061631000064">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The important
principle, which the Minister may address in his response, is whether
it will be possible for ECO funding to be available to those properties
not in the green deal plan. That would extend the ability to be
specifically targeted by ECO resources beyond those properties where
the green deal is willingly taken up, making a significant impact in
particular on those properties that are hit by fuel poverty. I believe
that that is the principle of the amendment, and we have some sympathy
with it. We do not want the scheme to be restricted to those who would
solicit approaches from firms because they are interested in those
properties within the green deal. We want it to be targeted. I think
the Minister sympathises with that idea, too. The ECO should extend to
those properties where a green deal package is neither offered nor
sought, but where ECO funding would deliver significant impact. I am
thinking particularly of communities in his constituency and in mine,
where the ECO could have a major impact. The green deal will be
attractive, but the ECO alone would have a much more significant
impact.<a class="bkMark" name="11061631000065">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">It
is helpful that my hon. Friend has moved her amendment because it
allows me to give her explicit reassurance. The amendment would allow
the Secretary of State to specify that ECO delivery does not have to be
limited to homes that take out the green deal. I am happy to say that
the amendment has no practical effect: although a close interaction
between the schemes is intended, there is absolutely no legal bar to
the ECO being delivered outside the green deal. That may, for example,
be the case in some fuel-poor homes, which could attract 100% ECO
subsidy. I imagine that is what the amendment
anticipates.<a class="bkMark" name="11061631000069">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There
has occasionally been blurring in the minds of some Committee members
in previous debates, but one must be clear about the difference between
a green deal assessment and a green deal plan. Obviously, before any
home accesses the ECO there will need to be a green deal assessment,
which is the umbrella name. In the poorest households, however, the
tenant or householder could, for reasons to which other Members have
alluded, be unable or have declined to take up the offer of the green
deal framework under the golden rule of pay-as-you-save.<a class="bkMark" name="11061631000070">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I cannot
conceive of many cases in which no measure would be worth pursuing
under the green deal, but I can see that some people might be reluctant
to take it on. In such cases it is conceivable that the ECO could be
used for any substantial improvements to the home without a green deal
package, in the conventional sense, being used. I totally reassure my
hon. Friend on that
point.<a class="bkMark" name="11061631000071">&#160;</a>

worst example: a poor parent in a G rated property whose financial
problems preclude them from having a green deal loan, but who has three
young children who do not deserve to be punished. Theirs might be a
hard-to-treat home, which might attract part-ECO, but they would not be
entitled to the green deal element because of the parent’s
lifestyle. Such a situation arises frequently in my constituency. When
young children are involved, how will we help such parents who are
precluded from receiving the green
deal?<a class="bkMark" name="11061631000072">&#160;</a>

prepayment cards will be precluded from receiving the scheme because

detailed response to the issues he raises. I can assure him with regard
to a solution. Is it possible, practical, likely that there will be
cases such as that, where green deal measures, for one reason or
another, are not appropriate or applied, and simply ECO is delivered?

               <p class="tabbed">The
amendment seeks to introduce what might be termed the equivalent golden
rule, as far as ECO and those likely to be in fuel poverty are
concerned. I have to say at the outset that it is flawed. If I really
knew what I was doing, I would have also put a similar amendment into
the next clause relating to electricity markets. However, as Oscar
Wilde said, an idea is not responsible for its disciples. Should the
Minister be minded to take the idea on board—regardless of the
person who proposed it—he will later be able to introduce an
amendment to the relevant clause to complete the
idea.<a class="bkMark" name="11061631000079">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
underlying point of the amendment is that ECO will be a levy that
affects the bills of those who eventually pay for that levy. There are
issues relating to targeted arrangements, particularly for those people
who would otherwise have benefited from the green deal and who, as I
alluded to in relation to a previous amendment, would perhaps seek the
changes, not because they would achieve lower bills under the central
green deal, but because they would achieve a better level of comfort,
thermal efficiency and heating in their homes. Therefore, the real
prospect exists that as a result of those changes, and because of the
imposition of a levy, people who have benefited in such a way could end
up paying higher fuel bills.<a class="bkMark" name="11061631000080">&#160;</a>

would direct a transporter or supplier to organise funding of the
carbon reduction target that is part of ECO in such a way that that
does not occur. There is a variety of ways in which that could be done,
and under the amendment it would be up to the transporter or supplier
to undertake the necessary work. The Committee has previously discussed
whether broader measures, such as rising block tariffs, could be
introduced to spread the load arising from ECO in an equitable way.
There is a serious concern about people who could go into fuel poverty,
because of the imposition of the levy through ECO, to a greater extent
than being taken out of fuel poverty because of actions taken under
ECO.<a class="bkMark" name="11061631000081">&#160;</a>

will accept the principle of the amendment, at least, and incorporate

Members wish to ensure that nobody is put in a situation in which their
investment, either through the green deal finance or their up-front
contribution, exceeds the savings generated by the measures, or in
which the cost of ECO socialised across the whole customer base further
pushes customers into fuel poverty. On the latter point, that is very
unlikely. The CERT programme that we inherited from the previous
Government is far from ideal, which is why we are moving beyond it and
why we have reformed it as far as we could for its extension. It is
rather opaque; it is not nearly as transparent and easily auditable as
ECO will be, but at the moment we estimate that CERT costs about
£1.3 billion a year, which averages out at about £45 per
customer. We do not yet know the final annual size of ECO, but it is in
the range of £1 billion to £2 billion. The
important thing about ECO is that unlike CERT, which, as I have said,
is more opaque and vague, it is a long-term programme, whereas CERT was
initially one year and subsequently three years, and it had a one-year
extension. ECO will be a decade-long programme that will give real
strategic certainty as it rolls out to the energy companies and to
those who are planning programmes predicated on ECO funding being
available.<a class="bkMark" name="11061631000085">&#160;</a>

between 70,000 and 150,000 households would be driven into fuel poverty
as a result of additional charges on domestic bills, but only between

deal measures and a much greater whole-house approach—a much
more ambitious programme of works rolled out at scale—we are
dealing with something quite different. I do not know off the top of my
head what we expect the numbers to be, but we are alive to the
situation. The average combined energy bill is now somewhere between
£1,300 and £1,500 for a family in the UK and many have
significantly higher bills, particularly if they are in inadequate
accommodation. The sum of money that we are talking about is a very
small fraction of the overall cost and we have announced several

from the previous Government a raft of measures such as CERT, which
were simply levied across the consumer base. That is why, despite the
deficit, the Chancellor took the view in his Budget that the renewable
heat incentive, for which the previous Government had prepared, should
not be funded from a levy on fuel bills. There is a limit to which such
levies can be pushed before they become unfair and aggressive. We took
the view that it would be fairer, and consistent with the
coalition’s commitment to fairness, to fund it through general
taxation. Likewise, the carbon capture and storage programme will not
be funded by a levy; £1 billion will be funded from general
taxation. We are alive to the hon. Lady’s wider point, and we
have already taken steps to remove the renewable heat incentive from
the fuel bill and on to general taxation, as well as the
£1 billion carbon capture and storage
programme.<a class="bkMark" name="11061631000089">&#160;</a>

issue of fairness and equity, there is a limit, because of the deficit
and the tight fiscal situation that we inherited, to the amount that we
can shift on to general taxation. We take on board the point, and
particularly the irony, that we cannot have a fuel poverty alleviation
measure that in itself, even if only at the margin, risks tipping some
families into fuel poverty. That is why we will consult on different
options for payment as part of the ECO consultation. One option is to
use a per-kW-hour-usage basis rather than a blanket basis in the same
way as CERT was levied. We are determined, within the boundaries of
what is practicable, and without making it too complicated, to avoid
being regressive, and to avoid the mistakes of the
past.<a class="bkMark" name="11061631000095">&#160;</a>

response about how the ECO will be levied. I would have thought,

ECO is not levied on a blanket basis. The consultation should not
regard that as an option. Levying by kilowatt-hour is an interesting
proposition, and I hope that that might be a centrepiece for such
consultation. It is important, however, to frame the intention of an
equitable outcome in the consultation, so that it does not simply ask
what one would like to do across a range of different thoughts. Rather
there should be a principle that there is no blanket levy, and there
are ways in which that could be avoided. The hon. Member for Wells
mentioned one larger way in which that could be done, and there are
other methods, as the Minister suggested. It is important that the

                  </strong> I want to speak about new clause 39, which is in my
name. It drives at the central point that the ECO simply is not big
enough and is not set within an overall strategy of eradicating fuel
poverty. Not only that, as we heard in the previous debate, unless we
go down one of the roads that the Minister has outlined there is a real
risk, as it stands, that those in fuel poverty could effectively
subsidise the well-off—if those well-off people happen to live
in hard-to-treat
homes.<a class="bkMark" name="11061631000107">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_ParaIndent">The
whole debate comes at a time when, following the ending of the Warm
Front initiative in 2012-13, England will have no publicly funded
energy efficiency programme for the first time since the 1970s. That is
serious when we consider the problem of fuel poverty in this country.
The bottom line is that the ECO is being spread too thinly. It is being
asked to do two different things, which do not necessarily coincide. In
other words, the same pot of money is for both treating the homes of
the fuel-poor and tackling those hard-to-treat properties, and those
two sectors will not always include the same group of people—not
by a long way. I urge the Minister to look again at whether the ECO
could be fully targeted at the fuel-poor and whether, within that,
there could be a special focus on hard-to-treat homes. If looked at in
overall terms, a £2 billion pot is not that much when it comes
to treating the homes of the fuel-poor. Indeed, the Institute for
Public Policy Research has estimated that between £30 billion
and £60 billion are required to overhaul the homes of the
fuel-poor. There is the contrast between that and an ECO pot of between
£1 billion and £2 billion, plus the fact that it will not
necessarily be used only for the
fuel-poor.</p>

over a number of years. None the less, taking the higher

			Column number: 274<a class="bkMark" name="Column274">&#160;</a>
                  </div>figure, there is still quite a difference between £20 billion and
£60 billion and we still do not know how much of that ECO pot
will go to the fuel-poor and how much might be diverted to
hard-to-treat homes, of which a number will certainly belong to people
who are well-off and certainly well-off enough to pay for their own

               <p class="tabbed">The
purpose of my new clause is to help the Minister out by suggesting some
other pots of money that could be tapped in order to supplement the
money in the ECO pot. We should use revenues from the European
Union’s emissions trading system and the carbon floor price
because those would be more progressive and there would be a certain
logic in using the money for those kinds of measures. The new clause
would therefore commit the Secretary of State to make a full assessment
of the case for the use of EU emissions trading revenues, the carbon
floor price and any other funding stream deemed fit to supplement the
ECO in order to promote energy efficiency take-up in low-income
households where the green deal financing mechanism does not stack
up.<a class="bkMark" name="11061631000110">&#160;</a>

European Commission has itself proposed that at least 20% of the
revenues from auctioning of emissions trading permits should be
earmarked for a range of climate or fuel-poverty measures. So this
would fall neatly into that overall European Union strategy. Until now,
the UK Government have not been in favour of the Commission’s
suggestion for hypothecation, arguing that it goes against Treasury
policy. But that is in stark contrast to many other EU states including
Germany, Hungary, Poland and
others.<a class="bkMark" name="11061631000111">&#160;</a>

anything. I hope that the Minister is sympathetic to the new clause
because in view of how limited the pot is at the moment it would be
good to look at ways in which it could be supplemented to tackle things
like fuel poverty. It is a very modest new

to date. Earlier in our deliberations, we talked about the film
“Poor Kids”. I saw it only recently on iPlayer, but I am
sure that all who have seen the programme will agree that we must
redouble our efforts to ensure that young people do not grow up in
atrocious circumstances, which will damage their life chances. The
amendment would give us the opportunity at least to consider other ways
of supplementing the ECO. I therefore hope that the Minister will

               <p class="tabbed">The Minister
said earlier that his Department is consulting on the scale and reach
of ECO, and that it will have the dual purpose of helping fuel-poor
households and hard-to-treat properties, in order to reduce emissions.
However, we want ECO to be targeted exclusively at the fuel poor. ECO
is paid by energy companies; ultimately, however, it is paid by their
customers, including those living in fuel-poor households. It is not
appropriate for the funding to be used by able-to-pay customers who
live in hard- to-treat homes. There would be outrage if people knew
that their ECO levy payments were going to households that could afford
to pay for energy efficiency measures. Many fuel-poor households are
hard to treat; as the Minister said, however, the two factors are not
mutually exclusive. Targeting ECO exclusively at the fuel poor would
therefore assist many in hard-to-treat properties.<a class="bkMark" name="11061631000120">&#160;</a>

later about our concerns as to what will be in the ECO pot. As the hon.
Member for Brighton, Pavilion said, the great concern is that there
will be a gulf between what is in the pot and what is needed to assist
those who live in fuel poverty. We want to ensure that the scheme is
robust, and that it can help as many as possible of those who need
assistance, especially as many energy companies are announcing massive
increases in fuel prices, which are set to escalate as the years
progress.<a class="bkMark" name="11061631000131">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">National
Energy Action estimates that fuel poverty now stands at 5.5 million
households, the highest level for 15 years. Different figures, of
between 4 million and 5.5 million, have been shown for fuel poverty,
but even if the figure were 4 million, that is 4 million households too
many that spend more than 10% of their household income on energy
bills. Urgent action is needed. Last week, a report by the Institute
for Fiscal Studies found that all retired households increased fuel
spending by 7% during cold snaps. The poorest 25% of those households
also cut their food spending by the same proportion. However, the real
tragedy is that things do not have to be that
way.<a class="bkMark" name="11061631000132">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Government’s fuel poverty advisory
group—FPAG—argues that fuel poverty is fundamentally
different from other aspects of poverty and financial inequality. It
differs significantly from general poverty, as appropriate levels of
capital investment can deliver in many cases a permanent and
sustainable solution. In January 2010, 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 277<a class="bkMark" name="Column277">&#160;</a>
                  </div>the Minister of State, Department of Energy and Climate Change, the hon.
Member for Wealden, wrote on the Conservative party
website that<a class="bkMark" name="11061631000133">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“A

               <p class="tabbed">It
is true that the Government have moved quickly, but unfortunately we do
not believe that they have been going in the right direction. They have
been reducing support for the fuel poor rather than increasing it. In
less than a year, the Warm Front scheme that previously provided more
than 2 million homes with 21st century heating has been scaled back. We
have also seen a cut in the winter fuel allowance by up to £100.
The reduction in funding for the Warm Front scheme, which terminates in
2013, is of deep concern, given that heating and insulation
improvements represent the most rational and sustainable approach in
dealing with fuel
poverty.<a class="bkMark" name="11061631000134">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">To
echo a point made by the hon. Member for Brighton, Pavilion, when the
scheme ends, it will be the first time in 30 years that there has not
been a Treasury-funded provision to support those in fuel poverty. It
is therefore essential that the Government ensure that the ECO
programme does all that it can to meet the target of eradicating fuel
poverty by 2016. The Minister and I have had many exchanges across the
Dispatch Box at various DECC questions, and he has made some grand
claims about the green deal and the effect that ECO will have on fuel
poverty. He
said:<a class="bkMark" name="11061631000135">&#160;</a>

target for eliminating fuel poverty, a target that is still more than
four years away. The Government should be doing all in their power to

do so, and that is what ECO could provide if it were adequately

serious questions about how much funding will be made available through
ECO, and whether it will be placed under the DECC levy control

that, if the ONS determines in six months or a few years’ time
that ECO should be placed under DECC’s levy control framework,
it is unlikely that the level of ECO funding available would be above
what is spent currently on CERT and CESP? If that is so, DECC will

               <p class="hs_brev">“the

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Government’s draft ECO document clearly sets out those two key
aims, saying that ECO will be entirely focused on the needs of
lower-income people and those who are most vulnerable, and the
properties that need the next most cost-effective measures that do not
meet the golden rule, such as solid wall insulation. It states that in
view of the scheme’s twin objectives, the powers under the Bill
allow the establishment of two distinct obligations, one of which is
set in terms of carbon emissions reductions, while the other is focused
on reducing the cost of heating. It calls that an affordable warmth
target.<a class="bkMark" name="11061631000145">&#160;</a>

basis that those two aims would not be achieved without ECO funding
extending beyond the fuel poor. However, that may not be the case. The
Minister said on the first day of the Committee’s
proceedings:<a class="bkMark" name="11061631000146">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“Many
of those in fuel poverty live in these houses that are hard to
treat.”<em>––</em>[<em>Official Report, Energy Public

               </div>
               <p>In fact, there are
currently about 1.9 million fuel-poor households living in solid-walled
homes in England alone. The Energy Bill impact assessment estimates, in
its high scenario, that that there will be 670,000 solid-wall
installations by 2016, so there are more than enough hard-to-treat
fuel-poor households to ensure that that estimate is met.<a class="bkMark" name="11061631000147">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Since we are
currently carrying out only between 20,000 and 30,000 solid-wall
installations per year, a limiting factor is likely to be industry
capacity, not the availability of homes. Clearly, there is a real
opportunity to achieve a reduction in fuel poverty and improve a
significant number of hard-to-treat homes at the same time.<a class="bkMark" name="11061631000148">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">On the first
day of Committee debate the Minister also
said:<a class="bkMark" name="11061631000149">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“Ultimately
there will be a finite resource in any given year, and we must ensure
that it is used effectively and that there is both a carbon element and
a social element to it.”<em>––</em>[<em>Official
Report, Energy Public Bill Committee, </em>7 June 2011; c.

               </p>
               <p>The
amendment would be a win-win for the Government, allowing them to
achieve those dual aims. In addition, delivering solid-wall insulation
to fuel-poor households, through a full or high subsidy, is likely to
have a knock-on benefit. The guaranteed take-up of full ECO funding
would be likely to lead to quicker market maturation, and as a result
the price of the measures would fall more
quickly.<a class="bkMark" name="11061631000150">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There
is clearly a need for the Government to provide a significant level of
support to low-income and vulnerable households. The amendment would
ensure that those in the greatest need would be prioritised, so that
they could benefit from the £488 that the Energy Saving Trust
estimates they would save on their fuel bills by upgrading their homes
above an F and G rating. Everyone in our society should have the right
to live in a properly heated home. The Minister said that the proposals
would be a game changer for fuel poverty. That is what the amendment is
designed to be, and on that basis I hope the Minister will accept
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11061631000151">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> As far as levies and imputed taxation are
concerned, I am afraid that the landscape for the Minister’s
ambitions for ECO is even worse than has hitherto been thought. The
problem we start with is that, because ECO is likely to be classified
as imputed tax by the ONS classification committee, it is likely to
come within the Treasury’s proposed cap. I believe the 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 280<a class="bkMark" name="Column280">&#160;</a>
                  </div>sum total in the present spending round is £11.8 billion,
including renewable obligations, feed-in tariffs and the warm home
discount.<a class="bkMark" name="11061631000152">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It
is a matter of some conjecture, and I would say hope, rather than
certainty, on the part of DECC that, should ECO be classified in the
way I have described, the Treasury will kindly add additional room in
the building of its cap to accommodate it, rather than simply saying,
“Within the present spending round DECC will have to find the
money it wishes to put into ECO from the £11.8 billion in the
overall cap.” It would be nice to think—I sincerely hope
this is the case—that there is a document in a safe somewhere
that says, “Yes, for certain, DECC can have extra headroom in
the cap we, the Treasury, have imposed on spending so that the ambition
for, say, £2 billion a year for ECO can be accommodated within
the overall cap,” signed “G.O.” at the bottom. The
cap would then be £17 billion, rather than £11.8 billion,
which would be generous of the Treasury under the circumstances. But
the Treasury is not renowned, and certainly not under present
circumstances, for its generosity in amending its caps in such
cases.<a class="bkMark" name="11061631000153">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There
is a looming problem, to which a solution may exist, with the ambition
of getting the level of the ECO to between £1 billion and
£2 billion, as the Minister describes, within the present
spending round. What is worse is that the present Treasury cap is
generally regarded as including those things that the ONS has already
declared to be within the category of imputed tax, which is not the
case. Only one of the three things that are presently within the
Treasury cap, and therefore in which the ECO might fall, has been
declared by the ONS to be imputed tax and spend; the other
two—FITs and the warm home discount—have unilaterally
been declared by the Treasury, without reference to the ONS, as being
imputed tax. That suggests that, rather than simply waiting for the ONS
classification committee to come along and decide whether something is
imputed tax, the Treasury is taking a far more draconian view. Under
those circumstances, the idea that the Treasury would provide a
generous new ceiling for imputed tax seems worryingly
uncertain.<a class="bkMark" name="11061631000154">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
last problem of Pelion and Ossa is that CERT has now been referred to
the ONS for classification as imputed tax and
spend.<a class="bkMark" name="11061631000155">&#160;</a>
