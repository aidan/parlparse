						<b class="B">
							<a name="07071171000056"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport (Jim
Fitzpatrick):
						</b> It is a pleasure to see you in the Chair
this morning, Mr. Wilshire. Thank you for your kind offer to
help those of us who have not served on a private Member&#146;s Bill
Committee through our proceedings.</div>
					<a name="07071171000010"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thank my
hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Blackley for his kind words. We
support his proposition that the Committee should adjourn. The
Government entirely support the intention behind the Bill. We recognise
that the misuse of off-road vehicles is a great problem in many
constituencies. As well as being the source of considerable antisocial
behaviour, some are so poorly constructed and maintained that it can
endanger their riders. The distress of those who have suffered as a
result of the misuse of such vehicles is fully appreciated, and we want
to deal with the issue. I thank my hon. Friend for bringing the matter
to the attention of the House.</div>
					<a name="07071171000011"></a><div class="hs_Para">On Second
Reading, the Government suggested that an interdepartmental taskforce
be created to identify solutions and, when necessary, to drive forward
any missing powers. I reaffirm that commitment this morning. The
taskforce would consist of the Department for Transport, the Home
Office and the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory
Reform, and it would consider transport, antisocial behaviour and
product safety respectively, at national and European Union level.
Other Departments, such as the Department for Environment, Food and
Rural Affairs and the Department for Communities and Local Government
could be involved, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column8" />Column number: 8</div>looking at the use of open space. So, too, the Department for Culture,
Media and Sport could consider the provision of sporting
facilities.</div>
					<a name="07071171000012"></a><div class="hs_Para">The taskforce
would undertake a root and branch review, considering all the issues,
including the powers currently available, and identify whether further
legislation might be required. Subject to its recommendations, the
Government will implement solutions. We anticipate that the taskforce
will convene in the autumn, with a view to producing an interim report
by Easter 2008.</div>
					<a name="07071171000013"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.
Friend the Member for Manchester, Blackley has devoted considerable
time and effort to the matter. We would therefore welcome his
participation in the work of the taskforce, the mechanics of which have
yet to be determined. This statement commits the Government to setting
up an interdepartmental review, and to recognising its conclusions. I
therefore support my hon. Friend&#146;s
motion.</div>
					<a name="07071171000014"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07071171000057"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Robert Goodwill</b> (Scarborough and Whitby) (Con): I express
some disappointment, Mr. Wilshire, that we will not have the
pleasure of serving under your chairmanship during what could have been
a long Committee stage. However, I express our thanks to the hon.
Member for Manchester, Blackley for putting this important issue on the
public agenda.</div>
					<a name="07071171000015"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister&#146;s statement shows that the Government are taking the
matter seriously. I believe that that it is the correct way forward. As
stated on Second Reading by my hon. Friend the Member for North
Shropshire (Mr. Paterson), the Bill was like using a
sledgehammer to crack a nut, and many law-abiding users of off-road
vehicles would have been brought within the net. That is not to say
that the nut does not need cracking; the problem of mini-motos and
other antisocial uses of such vehicles needs to be
addressed.</div>
					<a name="07071171000016"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
important to note that an interdepartmental approach is being taken.
Where police and local authorities around the country have acted
decisively, we have seen that the problem can be addressed. In
Coventry, the problem seems to have been handled very well. However, I
was in conversation last week with my hon. Friend the Member for
Shipley (Philip Davies), who told me that the police in his
constituency will not chase young people on mini-motos if they are not
wearing helmets, because they might be injured if they fell off. The
interdepartmental taskforce should look at best practice around the
country and decide how that can be disseminated to the authorities in
those parts of the country where the problem has not been
addressed.</div>
					<a name="07071171000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
thank the Minister for keeping me in the loop yesterday, which saved me
a lot of work last night and this morning in preparing to debate the
amendments. In closing, I thank the hon. Member for Manchester,
Blackley, with whom I served on the Transport Committee for 18 months.
You might say that we are both Dunwoody&#146;s children&#151;in
fact, Mr. Wilshire, possibly all three of us
are.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07071171000059"></a>Mr.
Goodwill:
						</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for
all the work that he has put into getting the problem on the
agenda. I know that it is a problem in his part of the world, and I
hope that the taskforce will come up with solutions. I also hope that
there will be some cross-party input, because I know of right hon. and
hon. Members who would very much like to be
involved.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
Alistair Carmichael</b> (Orkney and Shetland) (LD): I, too,
welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Wilshire. Unlike other hon.
Members, I have served on a private Member&#146;s Bill Committee
before, although I have never known it to follow such a procedure as we
are following this morning. You and I, Mr. Wilshire, have
served on many Bill Committees, and I am delighted to see you in your
elevated position today. An expression about poachers and gamekeepers
comes to mind. I would have enjoyed the experience of seeing you in the
Chair very much. However, the solution seems to be eminently sensible
and
workable.</div>
					<a name="07071171000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
commend the Minister for the approach that he has taken. I felt that
there was perhaps a degree of unnecessary antagonism between his
predecessor&#151;the hon. Member for South Thanet (Dr.
Ladyman)&#151;and his Back Benchers on Second Reading. Today&#146;s
solution is not dissimilar to that offered then, but it sounds rather
more substantial and sounds as though there is greater intent behind
it. The hon. Member for Manchester, Blackley has done us a service in
bringing the Bill to the House. He has taken a sensible route today, as
a lot of work would have been needed in Committee had it proceeded. The
course that presents itself to the House and the Committee has a great
deal to recommend
it.</div>
					<a name="07071171000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07071171000061"></a>
							<b class="B">Jim
Dobbin</b> (Heywood and Middleton) (Lab/Co-op): Briefly, I
congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Blackley, who is
a neighbour of mine in Greater Manchester, for the result that he has
achieved and the outcomes that we hope for. I thank the Government for
taking the Bill
seriously.</div>
					<a name="07071171000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman&#146;s constituency and mine are separated by the M60, but
are linked by a number of bridges that cross it. It is not the first
time that I have been called out because of the nuisance caused by
off-road vehicles criss-crossing back and forth over the motorway. It
creates havoc in my community, not just through noise&#151;over a
whole weekend local people cannot get any peace&#151;but by creating
great damage to the environment. Some of that environment is precious
to the local community. I thank my hon. Friend for putting the matter
on the agenda, and I hope that he achieves the outcomes that he
deserves.</div>
					<a name="07071171000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07071171000062"></a>
							<b class="B">Barbara
Keeley</b> (Worsley) (Lab): I, too, would like to add my
congratulations to my hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Blackley,
and I welcome the Minister&#146;s statement this
morning.</div>
					<a name="07071171000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">The salience
of the issue and the strength of feeling about it was exhibited at the
end of last summer when I brought forward a ten-minute Bill on the need
for the registration of off-road bikes, as did my hon. Friends the
Members for South Swindon (Anne Snelgrove) and for Rhondda (Chris
Bryant). Within three or four weeks we had three ten-minute Bills
addressing the nuisance of off-road bikes and the need for more control
through some registration
scheme.</div>
					<a name="07071171000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
first became aware of the problem when a young person lost his life in
an accident in my constituency, when I had been an MP for only a few
weeks. We may find, when we return to our constituencies for the
summer, that the injury to riders and others, as well as the severe
noise nuisance will continue, despite the substantial efforts of the
Greater Manchester police. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column10" />Column number: 10</div>That police force is well represented in the constituencies of hon.
Members here; it has had crackdowns and it has taken a lot of
action.</div>
					<a name="07071171000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
was much debate on Second Reading of one of my hon. Friends&#146;
ten-minute Bills about the fact that the police already have the powers
that they need to control the problem. I think that hon. Members feel
otherwise&#151;they think that the police do not yet have sufficient
powers. I am sure that this summer people will work on the matter
locally with hon. Members, agencies and the police. We need to do
something, and I and other hon. Members who have introduced Bills on
the subject will be happy to give any input that we can to the
process.</div>
					<a name="07071171000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07071171000063"></a>Graham
Stringer:
						</b> I thank hon. Members and the
Minister for their kind words. The hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland
pointed out that although he has served on Committees for a number of
private Members&#146; Bills, he has not seen a Bill go in the
direction or through the procedures that this one has done. It is worth
noting that this is only the second Labour Back Bencher&#146;s
private Member&#146;s Bill since 1997 thatthe Government have not
supported that has had a Second Reading. The other one, the Wild
Mammals (Hunting with Dogs) Bill, had a Second Reading but did not
immediately become law. Whatever hon. Members&#146; views were on
foxhunting, that Bill highlighted the importance of the issue, and
eventually the law was changed.</div>
					<a name="07071171000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am hopeful, given the
Minister&#146;s statement, that the working party will focus on the
issue and find a resolution that enables real resources to be directed
at dealing with a problem that is not resolvable now. For any
particular incident, there is sufficient law, and if a police force
puts sufficient resources into it, that one incident can be dealt with.
Ministers have said that regularly, and I agree with them. However,
what cannot be dealt with at the moment is a large number of offences.
No police force or local authority has the resources, within the
current framework of the law, to deal with the problem. It causes a
nuisance to many people and is a danger to riders and pedestrians all
over the country. I hope that the interim report&#151;I think that
the Minister mentioned next spring&#151;will bring us close to a
conclusion. We need action as quickly as
possible.</div>
					<a name="07071171000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to
thank a number of people who have supported the Bill. Many hon. Members
have put time into it. I pay particular tribute to my hon. Friend the
Member for Worsley who, as she said, introduced a ten-minute Bill and
has spoken eloquently and passionately on the matter a number of times.
I have always accepted that the Bill is imperfectly drafted. Had we had
more time in Committee, it would have been capable of improvement to
the point of getting Royal Assent, but we have run out of
runway&#151;I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Poplar and
Canning Town is the new Aviation Minister&#151;and there simply has
not been time to have that debate.</div>
					<a name="07071171000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">Nevertheless, for their help
with the drafting, I should like to thank the Greater Manchester police
authority, particularly its chair, Councillor Paul Murphy, who has
given a lot of support to this; officers Marie Richardson and Alison
Hannen; and the chief constable of Greater Manchester police, who put a
lot of effort into trying to persuade the Association of Chief Police
Officers to change its position and to take 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column11" />Column number: 11</div>a more sensible view. Locally, I have had support from the <i class="I">Manchester
Evening News</i>, the North Manchester<i class="I"> Guardian</i> which, in the
constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Heywood and Middleton, is
called the &#147;Middleton Guardian&#148;, and the North Manchester
<i class="I">Advertiser. </i>I thank all of them, as well as the <i class="I">Daily Mirror,
</i>which put some column inches at my disposal in support of the
Bill.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column12" />Column number: 12</div>
					<a name="07071171000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am grateful for the
Minister&#146;s statement. I accept it and look forward to receiving
the papers and helping the working party. I therefore ask the Committee
to adjourn on the basis that I will go to the Table of the House and
withdraw the Bill.</div>
					<a name="07071171000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<i class="I">Question put and agreed
to.</i>
