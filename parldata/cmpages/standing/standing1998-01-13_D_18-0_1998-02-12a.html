Question again proposed, That the amendment be made.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that with this we are taking the following amendments: Government amendment No. 261.
<P>
No. 230, in page 31, line 36, at end insert

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Department of Trade and Industry (Mr. Ian McCartney):</B> Good afternoon, Mr. Atkinson. I apologise for having my back to you when you called order, but I am suffering from the loss of jet lag. I was supposed to be making my way to Rome this afternoon. Such was the camaraderie in the Committee, however, that I could not bring myself to leave the company of the hon. Members for Buckingham (Mr. Bercow) and for Solihull (Mr. Taylor). I just had to tell the Italian Government to sort their crisis out themselves and that I would see them next week. I have to be careful; that was a joke. I do not want a diplomatic incident. I had a go at my colleagues at the Department for Education and Employment yesterday, so I will not have a go at my colleagues at the Foreign Office now.
<P>
Before lunch, I gave an explanation of the need for Government amendment No. 261, which I hope was sufficient. I had commenced discussing amendment No. 252 and why we could not ask the Committee to support it.
<P>
The next amendment is amendment No. 230, which would have an odd effect. Although it would not delay the setting of the national minimum wage, it would delay most if not all the enforcement mechanisms for six months. For example, it would delay the right of workers to enforce payment or the appointment of enforcement officers. That is not a wise and sensible way to approach the proper enforcement of the minimum wage, especially because many of those seeking enforcement will have no representation from trade unions or other bodies.
<P>
The amendment would also create a bad precedent because we would have a law that could not be enforced for its first six months. The national minimum wage would exist in effect, but there would be no means to ensure that it was paid. No doubt some employers would pay it in any event; indeed, the majority would probably do so. The law is, however, intended for those who seek to evade the minimum wage. I am not suggesting that the hon. Member for Ashford (Mr. Green) was once again attempting to get on the side of those who do not want to pay the minimum wage. I am sure that he was using the amendment to make points about the enforcement process.
<P>
Amendment No. 251 would likewise not affect the timing of the setting of the rate, but it would affect the timing of its entry into force. It would also affect the enforcement provisions, for example. It could have an even worse effect than amendment No. 230 because it would prevent enforcement for at least a year following the Low Pay Commission's report.
<P>
I hope that I have explained that the amendments are either unnecessarily restrictive or harmful. I emphasise again that the commencement date for the national minimum wage will be set by regulations under clause 1(3). We shall consult on the regulations, and there will be a reasonable interval between the making of the regulations and the entry into force of the minimum wage. I therefore ask my hon. Friends to support Government amendment No. 261 and to oppose the Opposition amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Boswell (Daventry):</B> The Minister was well briefed, and seductive, but fundamentally unconvincing. He made a case in regard to the need for consultation and a period of reflection, and we are prepared to concede him that. On the other hand, we should consider the universality of the application of the minimum wage as the Government have conceived it and the relative coherence of all parts of the Bill--one can not always say that about the Government's Bills. Those considerations make it almost inconceivable that it should be necessary to implement the Bill in more than one stage, other than for spurious and ultra-precautionary reasons.
<P>
With those ringing words, I invite my colleagues to support amendment No. 252.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before the Committee moves on to clause stand part, I should remind hon. Members of my earlier strictures.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Ever mindful of your strictures, Mr. Atkinson, I shall speak briefly about subsection (3), which relates to Northern Ireland.
<P>
I should like to make two introductory points. First, it is perhaps regrettable, although I do not criticise the Committee of Selection, that the Committee does not include a representative of Ulster. I hope that other Members of Parliament will read our deliberations, and that they may wish to participate on Report. All my remarks are subject to that consideration. It is important for the Committee to rehearse very briefly the situation in Northern Ireland.
<P>
My second introductory point is that I am sure that all Opposition Members recognise that whether Northern Ireland is included in the Bill is essentially a political decision. That decision--I say this with respect--will not be taken in the Committee, or even with reference to its discussions. I do not wish to speak at length about that point. No Opposition Member wishes to inflame the sectarian situation in Northern Ireland. I note that the Under-Secretary is nodding in agreement. On the other hand, we would be failing in our duty if we did not flag up briefly one or two aspects of the Northern Irish economy.
<P>
I shall make three points. First, it is clear, in the evidence submitted by the Government to the Low Pay Commission and elsewhere, that Northern Ireland has the lowest wages in the United Kingdom. Of course, those wages do not apply to everyone. The bottom decile is the convenient measure that is used. According to the Government's figures, which are based on the earnings survey, that level is &#163;3.50 an hour, while in Scotland it is &#163;3.67 and in London &#163;4.72. There is a difference of almost &#163;1.25 an hour between Northern Ireland and London. However one looks at the figures, that is a substantial difference.
<P>
I am also conscious of the fact, although it is a separate issue, that next to Northern Ireland, across the land frontier, is the Irish Republic. Although they have some limited industry-based arrangements for minimum wages, the level of earnings there will be generally lower. Perhaps I am obliquely addressing the Low Pay Commission by saying that it needs to have particular regard to the sensitivities of Northern Ireland's employment pattern in setting the rate that it will recommend in due course.
<P>
On the whole, the Northern Irish economy is heavily dependent on agriculture. That is not an alternative argument, but an explanation of the same argument that I have just deployed. Agriculture tends to be a relatively low-paid industry. Therefore, given the difficulties, including those of conducting farming in the security and the climatic situation which tends to apply in the Province, there are particular problems in meeting anything that might be seen as an exaggeratedly high national minimum wage. I remind the Committee again that every penny on the wage has a substantial effect on the numbers of persons who will be covered.
<P>
Finally, whereas the figures are aggregated into a whole Province--Northern Ireland--that is not the whole picture. That includes relatively high-paid Belfast engineering workers--at Shorts, for example--as well as people in country towns and rural areas. There will be some very low typical rates, particularly when one considers other factors such as tourism which, as we are all pleased to see, is popular and flourishing in Northern Ireland, despite the difficulties.
<P>
None of that is intended to subvert what is I am sure a political decision by the Government to include Northern Ireland; it is simply to put down markers regarding difficulties. Given that this is a commencement clause, we invite the Government, on receipt of the advice of the Low Pay Commission, to ponder long and hard before they do anything to damage or even potentially damage the economy of that rather fragile but much beloved part of the United Kingdom.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Lansley </B>(South Cambridgeshire): Having left over this issue from my earlier remarks, I shall, of necessity, be brief. Indeed, my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) made the essential points and I shall simply add one or two points of detail.
<P>
We have not addressed specifically the question of whether the Bill extends to Northern Ireland; it is dealt with in subsection (3). That it should do so heightens some issues. My hon. Friend referred to the lowest decile by pay and compared &#163;3.50 with London, for example, where the figure is &#163;4.72, with the United Kingdom average of &#163;3.50 and with the north-east region's figure of &#163;3.58. On that basis, one might have concluded that the differences between Northern Ireland and the north-east region were not so great when it comes to low pay. But that would be a misleading conclusion. We are slightly hindered in exercising this judgment because the relevant table in the Government's evidence to the Low Pay Commission proceeds to represent those deciles by pay rates in the rest of the country by reference to counties or local government boundaries. However, in Northern Ireland, we are offered only one figure and it is not disaggregated.
<P>
In the north-east, a relatively homogenous region, the variation is between &#163;3.27 and &#163;3.68, whereas in Scotland the variation is between the Shetland islands, for obvious reasons, at &#163;4.39 and Argyll and Bute, where the figure is right down at &#163;3.18. Peripherality is of the essence in those comparisons. That is a key issue relating to Northern Ireland which must be taken into account. Northern Ireland is not necessarily closely correlated with the rest of the United Kingdom in its pay determination, for the reasons given by my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Some of the determinants of pay in Northern Ireland are separate from those relating to the movement of the economy in the rest of the United Kingdom. The most apposite example is the relationship between pay levels in the Irish Republic and in Northern Ireland. The former would be of relatively little account in determining pay levels in the United Kingdom. Exchange rate movements would also have a bearing on that, which will perhaps be greater when the Irish punt becomes part of a single currency.
<P>
Two factors are hidden by the &#163;3.50 figure in the Government's evidence to the Low Pay Commission regarding Northern Ireland. First, there is a considerable variation within Northern Ireland--for example, between the Belfast travel-to-work area and its peripheral areas. The second and most significant factor is the disaggregation within that figure between those in Northern Ireland who are paid on national public sector pay scales and those who are paid on private sector pay scales.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Daventry referred to the agriculture sector pay levels, which are of course determined largely by reference to agricultural wages board figures. He knows that better than I.
<P>
I am sure that it will not have escaped the attention of Labour Members--including, perhaps, the hon. Member for Amber Valley (Judy Mallaber), who, if I recall correctly, knew a great deal about the textiles industry--that there are many textiles workers in Northern Ireland. She will be aware that notwithstanding our debate on the issues of niche marketing, just-in-time delivery and design capability in the textiles industry, which we will not rehearse again, it is an extraordinarily competitive industry. It is not by coincidence and not only by reason of history and tradition that there is a relatively strong textiles manufacturing sector in Northern Ireland, but by reference to the cost base that is achieved there, compared with other parts of the United Kingdom.
<P>
We are rather short of information about the Bill's potential impact on Northern Ireland. That is not to say that it is our job to continue that debate or to seek to arrive at conclusions on it. However, it begs the question of how the Low Pay Commission and, in due course, the Government will reconcile their appropriate intentions, set out in their evidence, to examine the difference in earnings by region and take account of the impact on different local circumstances when recommending a single national rate. That rate will have to apply in Northern Ireland by virtue of the clause. It will be difficult if the predominance of the rest of the United Kingdom in setting that rate diminishes the importance of its impact on the Northern Ireland economy.

<P>

<B>Mr. Philip Hammond (Runnymede and Weybridge)</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I see that my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond) is agitated and has a point to make. I will give way to him.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Given the much lower cost of living in Northern Ireland, would it not be difficult and unfair if the same minimum wage were forced on workers, effectively requiring them to demand a relatively higher standard of living in the competition for jobs?
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> That is an interesting point. I will not dwell on it because that would take us beyond the confines of the debate.
<P>
The Government make the fair point in their evidence that there is by no means a straight-line relationship between the level of earnings in given regions and the cost of living. Some regions have a small discount to London earnings, but a relatively large discount to the London cost of living, so the earnings levels, in terms of purchasing power, are quite high. In Northern Ireland, the cost of living has a substantial discount to London, and that must be taken into account. That begs the question of the relationship between the costs imposed on employers and their need to pay the market rate. The gap between market rate and the rate that they are required to pay may be that much greater and, by extension, might increase costs significantly.
<P>
The Committee has not discussed the matter in detail--it is part of the debate on regional variations--but it is incumbent on the Low Pay Commission to consider carefully the circumstances of Northern Ireland, to disaggregate the public sector from the private and to examine the impact on private sector employment when recommending a national rate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> The clause stand part debate has centred not so much on the clause as on regional policy and Northern Ireland. I can add nothing to what I have said--I have covered all aspects of the clause--but I shall deal with the issue of Northern Ireland which was raised by the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley).
<P>
The LPC visited Northern Ireland--Belfast, Ballymena, Derry and Newry--and took substantial verbal and written evidence from across industry. The commission chairman holds an academic post in Northern Ireland and is a well known economist. Northern Ireland's interests have been taken into account. The Government, like the previous Government, are committed to promoting regional selective assistance objective 1 status for Northern Ireland. The consensus on the Northern Ireland economy continues; we are at one about the promotion of inward investment and the creation of investment opportunities.
<P>
I hope that I have shown that the commission made a great effort to ensure that Northern Ireland was considered during the decision-making process. No one in Northern Ireland--employer and employee organisations or consumer and other groups--would claim that they had not been fully involved.
<P>
I stand to be corrected, but on Second Reading Northern Ireland Members voted for the national minimum wage. There is support for the principle of the Bill. I can honestly say that, in opposition or in government, no one from Northern Ireland has sought an exemption. I ask my colleagues to support the clause.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 53, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> This is a milestone--we are now dealing with new clauses.
<H4><center>New Clause 2</center></H4>
<H4><center>Appeals to the Employment Appeal Tribunal</center></H4>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`. In section 21(1) of the Employment Tribunals Act 1996 (appeal from employment tribunal to Employment Appeal Tribunal on question of law arising under or by virtue of the enactments there specified) after paragraph (f) there shall be inserted--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``(ff) the National Minimum Wage Act 1998, or''.'.--[Mr. Ian McCartney.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Brought up, and read the First time.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, we may take amendment No. 154.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a second time. The relief is rushing through me.
<P>
The new clause provides that appeals on a point of law from proceedings before industrial tribunals under the free-standing provisions of the Bill will go to the employment appeal tribunal. The new clause adds the National Minimum Wage Act 1998 to those Acts in section 21(1) of the Industrial Tribunals Act 1996, which will be renamed as the Employment Tribunals Act by the Employment Rights (Dispute Resolution) Bill. Examples of the free-standing provisions created by the Bill are clause 11, which deals with access to records--an employee right; clause 17, which deals with an appeal against an enforcement notice--an employer issue; clause 20, which deals with an appeal against a penalty notice--another right for employers; and clause 22, which deals with detriment in relation to employee rights.
<P>
Without the new clause, the employment appeal tribunal would have no jurisdiction to hear such appeals and therefore it is important that the Committee supports the new clause.
<P>
Appeals under other employment jurisdictions, for example the Equal Pay Act 1970, the Sex Discrimination Act 1975, the Race Relations Act 1976, The Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992, the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 and the Employment Rights Act 1996, are heard by the employment appeal tribunal. It is a specialist employment court and it is sensible that it should have the jurisdiction to hear the appeals under this Bill. Such appeals can be made only on points of law.
<P>
Amendment No. 154 makes a consequential repeal to section 21(1) of the Employment Tribunals Act 1996, made necessary by the addition of this Bill to the list of Acts in subsection (1) of the 1996 Act. It is a sensible and logical addition, and I commend both the new clause and the amendment to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> We can put the Minister out of his misery by saying that on this occasion, we have no difficulty with the principle of the new clause.
<P>
I think that I am entitled to a moment of jocularity by observing that in the middle of all that small print, the lawyers made an uncharacteristic omission--unless somehow the provision has been transferred from somewhere else--because although there will be an employment tribunals process under the Bill, there was no provision for going to appeal, as there would be in the other Acts that the Minister cited. It is a good thing that we got it sorted out, and we will not cavil about it.
<P>
I have only two substantive points. First, even if our proceedings, which are beginning to move to a close, have been protracted and even if the pettifoggers and pedants have been out on one side or other of the Committee, nevertheless it is necessary to get the law right, and to question Ministers and for them to question their officials about the law's operation, because the best way of stopping appeals to the tribunal on points of law is to have the basic law right and clear, so that appeals will not be necessary.
<P>
Secondly, wherever possible, the legal process of going to the tribunal and then, if necessary, going to an appeal tribunal on a point of law is not the first recourse. The first recourse is disputes resolution or mediation--call it what one will--going, if necessary, to conciliation and trying to get an agreement before the matter escalates to the tribunal stage. As the Minister and others will know, if it gets that far, it is expensive and merely adds to the rancour. It is very much better if the matter is killed at source. However, we have no objection to the new clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> There is nothing to add to that--I concur with what the hon. Gentleman said.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>

<H4><center>New Clause 1</center></H4>
<H4><center>Hourly rate of remuneration (increase)</center></H4>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `. Any hourly rate of remuneration determined by regulations made under section 2(1) above shall, at the end of one year after those regulations were made and annually thereafter, be increased by--<P>

<P>
(b) the percentage rise in the median of full-time hourly earnings during the preceding year,
<P>
</UL></FONT>whichever is the greater.'.--[Mr. Chidgey.]
<P>
Brought up, and read the First time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> I beg to move, that the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
The new clause is clear and prescribes how the national minimum wage, once it has been established, should be reviewed and uprated over time. If we introduce a national minimum wage which is then fixed in tablets of stone, that wage will very soon, through due process and the movement of the economy, have little value in achieving its main objective which we understand is to protect the poorest people on the lowest wages.
<P>
We need some mechanism with which to review uprating of the national minimum wage. There are two routes to follow: we could either introduce a sporadic, almost ad hoc, process of uprating or, as the new clause suggests, we could have an automatic system of uprating which could be operated according to a separate formula. The two that I included in the new clause are the retail price index and the annual rate of inflation.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, there are two diametrically opposed views in the establishment as to whether there should be an automatic system for uprating the national minimum wage. On one side of the fence are the Confederation of British Industry, the Engineering Employers Federation and the Centre for Economic Performance, which are opposed to the principle of regular uprating. On the other side of the fence--again, not surprisingly--are the Transport and General Workers Union, the Low Pay Unit and other bodies which believe that the national minimum wage should keep pace with average earnings. Interestingly, the British Hospitality Association finds itself in a dilemma: it is worried about the possible inflationary effects that indexation of the national minimum wage could have, but it is also worried that regular uprating of the national minimum wage could cause serious economic shocks in its industry.
<P>
I think that the case for regular uprating of the national minimum wage is sound. Members of the Committee will know from their research that in the United States there are no automatic mechanisms for increasing the federal minimum wage. Therefore, any increases that are eventually introduced must be legislated for in their democratic process. That, over the years, has caused many high profile, politically acrimonious debates about the relative merits of keeping a minimum wage at all, which takes up considerable time in the legislative process.
<P>
The value of the national minimum wage in real terms and relative to the general level of earnings will be eroded without an automatic uprating mechanism. It should also be of concern to the Government, whose intentions regarding introducing a national minimum wage are clear and determined, that without some form of automatic uprating the national minimum wage could become a hostage to the fortunes of a future Administration which, given the passage of time and the nature of our parliamentary democracy, could well be hostile to the concept.
<P>
It would be very easy to allow the national minimum wage to become defunct by simply not allowing parliamentary time for the legislation that would be necessary to review it on an ad hoc basis. There is no point in the Committee agonising over the initial level of the national minimum wage, placing bets on what the Low Pay Commission will eventually recommend and spending months scrutinising the Bill as part of the process of introducing legislation if, when we have completed our labours and the Bill completes its passage through Parliament, we leave the level unchanged year on year without reflecting the normal functioning of the economy, generating increases in prices and earnings in a general way on a year-to-year basis.
<P>
The Government may believe that the Low Pay Commission will report on uprating. Perhaps I have not been following the proceedings closely enough, but it is far from clear whether the Low Pay Commission is intended to be a statutory and permanent body. If that is not the Government's intention, then the opportunity for regular review is removed.
<P>
Fundamentally, it should be clear that the national minimum wage should not only be set at a sensible rate, but should benefit from a sensitive system that provides regular uprating of minimum requirements in ongoing legislation.

<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The Committee is grateful to the hon. Member for Eastleigh (Mr. Chidgey) for rising from his sick bed to move the new clause, and Committee members are sorry if he is not as fit as he might be. He is entirely right to raise that issue, even if the Government are likely--I do not read their briefs upside down as some Opposition spokespeople perhaps do--to resist him.
<P>
I ride to the Government's defence like a white knight, as I do often. Last time the Committee voted, it occurred to me that the gap between us was narrowing, especially with the Minister's assistance, albeit inadvertent. I was reminded of a famous statement made at a TUC congress--``We are on our way, brothers''. I shall not speculate on the matter, although the hon. Member for Eastleigh referred to the possibility of a change of Administration occurring at some point. I should put it more strongly. I think that there will be an early change to a Conservative Administration, which will have to review the situation.
<P>
Before that occurs, the Committee should find out what the Government intend to do about their proposals. They are being especially opaque about that. The Ministers should put on record a statement of their intentions, even if they are not their final intentions--the Opposition will of course not hold them to anything that they may say today. We have had difficulty in holding the Government to what they have said even 10 minutes ago. We should like the Government to at least give an indication of where they stand on the important issue of uprating.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman was again right to point to the kick-in between the future of the Low Pay Commission and the question of whether it is to be permanent--if so, how--and the mechanism for setting the national minimum wage. The matter may perhaps more properly be discussed when the Committee considers the schedules. One could put the question bluntly, and ask whether the national minimum wage will continue to be a political football. Another way of putting that would be to ask whether it will remain the exclusive responsibility of Ministers, which is perhaps not quite as derogatory. Conversely, one could ask whether it will be driven by formula, or by the recommendation of a group of independent economists or otherwise. Those questions are serious. The Committee would fail in its duty if it did not address them.
<P>
I am disinclined to accept the new clause, although the hon. Gentleman moved it with such charm, because I think that it would impose a double-headed and rigid formula on matters that may vary over time. Some future Government will decide whether or not the Low Pay Commission continues in statutory form, having regard to the conditions of the time. Those conditions would include what I think statisticians would call the auto-correlative effects of the national minimum wage, its dynamic effects, its impact on differentials, and its more general effects on pay rates.
<P>
The point resonates with a number of debates across the whole business of government. One of them is the debate about pensions uprating--I mentioned earlier, rather derogatorily, that the Government are given to changing their minds. It will be well within the memories of Opposition Members--although some Government Members have, perhaps, expunged it from the record, as they have the half male median earnings test from the national minimum wage--that when in opposition, Government's proposals for pensions uprating were to return to earnings and/or to add an extra fiver a week to the basic state pension. To put it delicately, those have broken down under the pressure of events.
<P>
An earnings test, as proposed by the hon. Member for Eastleigh, is unlikely to be welcome to the Government or coherent with their policy unless they have somehow reassumed their old pledge on the half male median earnings test. It is only if one starts with an earnings basis that one can, even in principle, consider continuing and uprating on such a basis.
<P>
Several points give me cause for concern. The first is that a formula of any kind, whether related to earnings or prices, takes no account of the economic conditions that apply at the time. I am conscious that we had two exchanges on this matter this morning, so I will not dilate. Such conditions include the state of the economy and cost-push wage inflationary pressures. The Chief Secretary to the Treasury is beginning to warn publicly about such pressures and the Bank of England's monetary policy committee is making noises about them, even if it does not agree whether it should put up interest rates.
<P>
There are bound to be effects on differentials, which the Government concede may happen in principle, but we will need to test what happens in practice. There will be external practices connected with competitiveness and pressure will be exerted through the exchange rate or through tactical changes by newly industrialising countries, south-east Asia and others.
<P>
It would be extremely unfortunate if we could paint a scenario where British economic growth was sagging, competitiveness was slipping away and there were pressures on costs, including the cost of the public sector borrowing requirement, and yet a formula was simultaneously moving the economy in the wrong direction to fulfil the terms of this Bill. Future Governments should consider that.
<P>
There is an argument for a political decision by Ministers. That does not have to be politically arbitrary; it may be informed by the work of the Low Pay Commission or another body. There may be other arrangements for taking good advice and forming an objective view. Ministers should not shelter behind a formula because their decisions are important to the economy. The pay of Members of Parliament is another example of how an index-linked formula was used to avoid problems, although that formula never seems to work in practice, for reasons that I will not go into.
<P>
It is alleged that the use of such formulae takes the politicians out of the decision. The minimum wage will directly affect the remuneration of, say, 10 per cent. of the working population, depending on what rate is chosen, but the impact on differentials and costs in the economy will affect all the working population and those who do not work. It will also affect our competitiveness. It is not realistic to isolate those considerations from the political process.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brian Cotter </B>(Weston-super-Mare): The hon. Member for Daventry spoke about the pay of Members of Parliament. One of the reasons for making this proposal is to avoid the situation that arose with Members' pay. That example supports our case because Members' pay was allowed to drift for a long time and then there was a great increase. We want to avoid such instability in industry.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The hon. Gentleman is entitled to his view, but a substantial one-go increase similar to that in the pay of Members of Parliament--&#163;26,000 to &#163;43,000--would produce an economic effect.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cotter</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Just let me explain. I may be anticipating the hon. Gentleman's argument. Given the number of people who are likely to be involved in the national minimim wage, any smaller change, albeit between years, that is linked to a formula will have economic effects. With great respect, the pay of Members of Parliament may have sent a political signal, but that matter, although important, is separate. The economic effect did not matter a row of beans. A grade with which we fitted was found and we were able to proceed on a steady and even basis.
<P>
Any formula is likely to have economic effects. Any Chancellor of the Exchequer, whether Labour or Conservative--I hope that no enemy would wish that job upon me--should be deeply concerned. I understand the enthusiasm of the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Cotter). He is entitled to his view, but means would be found to muck about with or dilute a formula, just as successive Governments have done in relation to the armed forces. That is a reason for our reservations about the armed forces being linked in through their pay review body. There will be a difference of view.
<P>
I want to raise two other points. First, the effects on particular industries are ex post facto. Let us assume, but not claim aggressively, that we are right about the national minimum wage and let the Minister, in his humility, concede that we might be right. We have expressed sincerely and consistently our concerns about the impact effects on particular sectors where current remuneration packages show the economic realities in which the Government are to intervene.
<P>
Down the track, in 18 months or two years, there is bound to be an impact on industries that have been unable to cope with the rate. The only question is, at what level and how big? Compounding that with a formula which makes a bad situation worse--every additional effect would be at the margin--would turn disaster into catastrophe. Even if they will not provide sectoral differentiation rates, the Government should provide a safety net for particular industries.
<P>
The Government should bear in mind the three Hs: hospitality, hairdressing and horticulture. Those industries are low-paid. As we said in relation to commencement, it will be impossible to overcome that quickly. There may be changes--perhaps not ones that the Government want--but it is irrational for them to have no control over the machine and to be unable to repair the unintentional but, in our view, inevitable damage.
<P>
The CBI's argument is worth further discussion. It clearly thinks that there will be administrative difficulties. The hon. Member for Eastleigh has mentioned its views, and it refers to the dangers of bunching pay settlements not only around the basic rate point, but in terms of timing. Everyone will be waiting for the kick-in that comes with the national minimum wage. The CBI notes, reasonably enough, that that is entirely contrary to the tenor of recent pay settlements, which have been much more flexible and differentiated. It is right about that.
<P>
That observation is reinforced by a small point about the National Farmers Union evidence to the Low Pay Commission. It makes the point that the Agricultural Wages Board rate is fixed at the beginning of June every year. If the national minimum wage rate is uprated not every June, but every April--taking the timetable that was mentioned earlier--farmers will be in an awkward situation. Rates will be set one moment, but will have to be altered a couple of months later for certain employees. That is likely to give rise to confusion.
<P>
That is hardly the main point. On this occasion, Conservative Members would like the Government to have more discretion than the Liberal Democrats are prepared to offer them. It is not sensible to rely on a mechanistic formula, and I would not advise my hon. Friends to support one.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I commiserate with the hon. Member for Eastleigh if he has had to get off his sick bed to come here. I cannot claim to have done the same, although my hon. Friend the Member for Ashford and I had a pretty narrow escape at the hands of the Under-Secretary's car on our way here this afternoon. The Minister failed to score a direct hit, and I am pleased to report that we made it to the Committee rather than to St. Thomas'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> It occurs to me that the narrow escape that my hon. Friend has just experienced underlines the unsuitability of Ministers to be in the driving seat.
<P>
Mr. Hammond
<P>
: Sadly, on this occasion, the Minister was not in the driving seat, although I suspect that she was giving encouragement to the driver.
<P>

I was speculating during the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry about the effect of linking the pay of Members of Parliament to the minimum wage by some formula. That could be an interesting subject for debate at another time.
<P>
I am afraid that I have to be a little less gentle than my hon. Friend with the Liberal new clause, which is an obvious bid for popular support. It is irresponsible, especially in the way that it is framed. The annual uprating is to be linked to either inflation--I take that to be the retail price index--or average earnings, whichever is the greater. That would contribute to a wage-price inflation spiral, which would see us heading back to a place that we have been to before and which most of us do not wish to go to again. I cannot support Liberal Members' suggestion that the Government should have an annual uprating imposed on them.
<P>
I would be interested to hear from any Labour Back Bencher who has a view on the advisability of annual uprating, and I would be happy to take an intervention. The Low Pay Unit--I say that loudly in the hope that it will wake up people on the Government Back Benches--is in favour of annual uprating on a fixed formula. Does the hon. Member for Gravesham (Mr. Pond), for example, have anything to say about that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that, in keeping with its usual practice, the Liberal Democrat party is no doubt rushing to tell employees of its support for a mechanism of annual uprating and equally anxious to ensure that it hides its intention from those employers who might in a million years be foolish enough to consider supporting it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> As I said before, I suspect that the new clause is designed to appeal to the greatest number who will not think deeply about its consequences.
<P>
On this occasion, we must argue for the Government to have more discretion rather than less. The minimum wage level will be set on the advice of the Low Pay Commission but, as I am sure the Minister will concede, it is possible that with the benefit of the experience of a year or so of operation it may be thought that the level had been set too high to be sustainable, and a period of erosion of its real value might be required to bring the economy back into balance. Equally, it is possible that the Government might determine that too low a rate had been set, and experience might suggest that the economy could sustain a higher level. To shackle the Government with a rigid formula for annual uprating would be unhelpful in the extreme.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that there may be some merit in erring on the side of caution in the introduction of the national minimum wage, and that to deny the Government the flexibility to do that, with the option subsequently to increase the rate, would be a retrograde step?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I entirely agree with my hon. Friend. I am, of course, not privy to the Government's innermost thoughts, but I suspect that they might intend to err on the side of caution. Indeed, it would be the intention of any sensible Administration to attempt to set a level that would not have a serious negative impact on employment. If the best economic advice one, two or three years later was that the rate could stand some increase, the Government would want to consider that. That is the way in which the system should operate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Damian Green </B>(Ashford): I must point out to my hon. Friend as a matter of caution that in his entirely sensible and lucid economic analysis, he is ignoring the position of the McCartney curve, which suggests that the higher wages are, the more people are employed. Anyone using that analysis would think that setting a rate that was too high in the first instance would probably increase employment.
<P>
Mr. Hammond
<P>
: I thank my hon. Friend for reminding me of that important economic fact. I shall leave members of the Committee to draw their own conclusions about where I stand on that.
<P>
I concede the hon. Member for Eastleigh that there is one clear advantage in having an annual uprating, which is that it would remove the potential for creating a party political Dutch auction over the rate, as I mentioned in an earlier debate. I would certainly not like to see commitments to uprating the minimum wage becoming a standard bung that each party tried to offer the electorate in the run-up to a general election, as we have seen in years gone by over the state pension. That is not constructive.
<P>
That is, however, the only possible advantage that I can see in the new clause. It would have a significant effect on inflation, especially by virtue of its either-or structure--either the rate of inflation or the rate of increase of average full-time hourly earnings would determine the uprating. Given that we are going to have a minimum wage, it is in all our interests to ensure that the mechanism for uprating it is sensible. The best way of handling it is for there to be extensive consultation prior to each uprating and for a significant period of notice to be given of when it is to come into effect, so business has time to adjust and make provision.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I know that my hon. Friend, like me, is interested in pay reference periods. Does he agree that some consideration would have to be given to their interaction with the uprating date? Pay reference periods might already be in progress on that date and some apportionment of the remuneration received before and after the uprating date might need to be made in calculating whether those payments were deficient.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> My hon. Friend is right, although I suspect that that problem would arise whenever the minimum wage rate was changed, whether on an automatic or a discretionary basis. Our biggest concern about such an arrangement is that an annual Government-determined, inflation-driven uprating of the minimum wage will become a benchmark for wage increases across industry. No one will accept an increase less than the increase in the minimum wage which would, on the basis of the new clause, be the greater of either retail price inflation or wage inflation. That will create conditions that will not be conducive to the creation and maintenance of jobs and prosperity in the economy, and we will oppose it.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. John Healey </B>(Wentworth): We are constantly reminded that we fought the campaign as new Labour and we govern as new Labour. New Labour, new ideas and new legal ground, as in the National Minimum Wage Bill. At least, that is what I thought, Mr. Atkinson, until today, when I received in the post an original copy of the Coal Mines (Minimum Wage) Act 1912--rates and rules for the South Yorkshire district. It was sent to me by a constituent, Mr. R. Ditchfield, who lives across the road from us in Wath upon Dearne. He says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``I thought it might be of some interest and possible use should you be involved in debate on the implementation of a minimum wage . . . I was involved in calculating ``MINI'' wages when I started work as a boy at New Stubbin Colliery'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
which is also in the Wentworth constituency.
<P>
I showed this to some officials at lunch time and one of the lawyers on the Bill team held out his hands, his eyes lit up, and he murmered reverentially, ``Ah, precedents.'' [Laughter.] Precedence is useful. The minimum wage was uprated regularly in 1912, but not by a system of increases written into the legislation, as new clause 1 urges us to do.
<P>
I do not wish to push the principle of precedence too far. Unlike this Committee, the legislators of the time accepted exemptions at this stage. The Act provides:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Aged workmen and infirm workmen are not entitled to the minimum rate of wages.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Furthermore, it states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Any man who through his own default fails to do a fair day's work, or to work his place to the best advantage . . . shall forfeit his right to the benefit of the minimum rate of wages.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There we have it. Some 85 years old, the old, the lame and the lazy were all excluded from the minimum wage.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I merely want to point out that if, as I assume, the hon. Gentleman is quoting from the 1912 Act, those draconian clauses were introduced by a Liberal Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Healey:</B> As I said--
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I wondered if the hon. Gentleman would care to speculate on how those exclusions might affect Members of Parliament.
<P>
<B>Mr. Healey:</B> I will leave that. The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge might want to come in again.
<P>
Unlike this Committee, the legislators of the day accepted a range of rates for the minimum wage as well. Indeed, there were five classes and 15 categories of different rates. The qualified getter--hand or machine--was on 6 shillings and 9 pence per day, while the class 5 boy, at 14 years old, was on 2 shillings per day. So that members of the Committee might make full use of this information in our deliberations this afternoon, I took the trouble of going to the Library and finding a very useful publication which I recommend to hon. Members who may not have come across it. It is entitled: ``Inflation: the Value of the Pound, 1750 to 1996''. In terms of purchasing power parity, those qualified getters earned &#163;1.90 an hour in 1912, and the class 5 14-year-old boys earned 58p.
<P>
To conclude, although I am happy to invoke the 1912 south Yorkshire precedents to urge members of the Committee to reject the new clause, I would urge the Minister, when he sets and uprates the national minimum wage rate, to do a bit better than the authorities did in the mines of south Yorkshire 85 years ago.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Green:</B> I thank the hon. Member for Wentworth (Mr. Healey) for suggesting some ideas for new clauses on Report.
<P>
I rise with more than the usual diffidence because I am an inadequate substitute for the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne (Ms Atherton), whose historic role on the Committee is to rubbish all Liberal Democrat proposals. I feel the lack of her presence and that I should step in, however inadequately, to do her job for her.
<P>
I am particularly pleased to see that the hon. Member for Gravesham has re-entered the Committee. As the hon. Member for Eastleigh carefully noted, the Low Pay Commission is in favour of precisely the type of an annual uprating that is suggested in the new clause. The hon. Member for Gravesham therefore has to battle with his conscience on one side and his career on the other. I am sure that, like me, all members of the Committee are metaphorically on the edge of their seats wondering which way he will jump.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chris Pond </B>(Gravesham): On a point of clarification, how does the hon. Gentleman know that the Low Pay Commission is in favour of such an uprating? I thought that it was not going to report until May.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I apologise. I meant the Low Pay Unit, with which the hon. Gentlman has great contacts. As we know, the Low Pay Commission has not yet reported, partly because the Government were so late in giving it their evidence.
<P>
The main reason for opposing the new clause--I dare say that it will be opposed on both sides of the Committee--is its bad economics. It is bad in various ways, but the principal one is its lack of economic analysis. My hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge noted that it was driven by short-term populism, but it combines that with poor long-term economic analysis. If we are going to go back in history, we could go back a bit further than 1912. We might assume that Mr. Gladstone is rotating in his grave at what his party's economic theory has been reduced to.
<P>
The main problem with the new clause is that it attempts to run economic policy by statute. By and large, that will not work and will lead to overly rigid prescriptions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Perhaps my hon. Friend can confirm this, but it occurs to me that there are certain analogies with the Bank of England Bill, which he and I considered. In that case, the Chancellor of a Labour Government was remitting control of inflation policy solely to an unaccountable and uncontrollable committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> My hon. Friend tempts me, but I can feel twitching from your direction, Mr. Atkinson, so I will decline to take up that point.
<P>
There are more serious objections to the new clause. On a technical level, it does not define which rate of inflation should be used to make the annual increase; a it simply says, ``the rate of inflation'' as if that was a given or a constant. I am sure that the hon. Member for Eastleigh knows as well as anyone that there is any number of rates. Does he mean retail price inflation or wholesale price inflation? Does he mean input or output prices within wholesale price inflation? Does he mean RPI minus X or the GDP deflator? There are almost as many definitions of inflation as there are economists. Simply saying ``the rate of inflation'' would make the clause technically deficient, quite apart from its economic deficiencies.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that, in practice--although the hon. Member for Eastleigh did not make this clear--subsection (b) would be the operative provision? That would certainly be true of most of the years of which I have had any experience.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> That has certainly been true of the past 18 years, when the economy was so well run that by and large, earnings outran inflation. After a few years of this Government, however, I suspect that people will find that earnings stop outrunning it as they have done under previous Governments.
<P>
One can remember previous Labour Governments altering benefit changes precisely so that they went up in line with earnings, because that was a lower rate of increase. I hestitate ever to contradict my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire, but he has been so suffused with joy by the economic performance of the past 18 years that he has forgotten his economic history. It can happen that paragraph (a) of the new clause is higher than (b), if I can put it that way. Anyway, it has been known to happen under Labour Governments before, and I daresay it will do so again.
<P>
A longer term objection to the new clause is that it would accept an inflationary society. Indeed, the hon. Member for Eastleigh made that point explicitly when he spoke to it. I think that he said that the value of the minimum wage would be eroded quickly by the normal course of events. That is an extremely damaging idea of how the economy should be run.
<P>
Our economy is now running at a much lower inflation rate than it has done previously and, indeed, the experience is being replicated in other European countries. To try to reinstitute in our legislation a provision that accepts reasonably high inflation rates as the normal course of events would be a self-fulfilling prophecy and would be extremely damaging, not just to society's economic performance but to its fabric.
<P>
The idea reminds me of nothing so much as the scala mobile in Italy, whereby everything used to be increased automatically. I understand that the Minister was meant to be in Rome today, so I apologise for intruding on private grief--he may well feel that being in Italy is a more attractive proposition than being in Committee all afternoon.
<P>
The scals mobile's acceptance of inflation led to a two-tier economy. The unofficial Italian economy boomed away, because it had nothing to do with official regulation, and the official economy stagnated. The result of that stagnation was that everyone tried to do things unofficially, by the back door. It led to widespread corruption, which caused the collapse of the previous republic, fortunately to be replaced by a different and better kind of democracy. That was an extremely serious political development, an important part of which came from shoulder-shrugging acceptance that inflation was the normal course of events and that the world should therefore be organised around that fact. It was bad for Italy and it would be extremely bad for Britain.
<P>
Not only would it be bad economics, but it would be bad politics. It is inconceivable that a Government of any flavour would leave a provision as automatic as this on the statute book, because it would tie their hands too much. I suspect that that kind of increase would be automatically included, but that it would have to be approved by the Government of the day. One does not have to be unduly cynical to suspect that in the early years of a Parliament, a Government might decide to resist the logic of an inflation-related increase, while in that Parliament's later years, they would be less inclined to do so.
<P>
We would see precisely the economy-wide problems that Governments face with, for instance, public sector pay awards. It is notable that we are in the first year of a Parliament and the Government have decided to phase the public sector pay award. It is clear that they would be less likely to betray public sector workers in the way that they have this year if an election was on the horizon. The situation is difficult enough in the public sector--to some degree, it is unavoidable--but it is avoidable in the private sector, and we should try to avoid it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Has my hon. Friend considered the situation, not unprecedented in the acts of previous Labour Governments, where the formula proposed in this new clause would kick in, but the Secretary of State would lay regulations to implement it and invite Back Benches to nullify them as the only way of getting around the monster that he had created for himself?
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Indeed, my hon. Friend makes an extremely good point. I suspect that that would be one of the practical effects of putting the new clause on the statute book.
<P>
My third and final point is that an automatic system such as this would make it much more likely that the minimum wage would feed straight through into differentials, that all collective bargaining would take it as a pay reference point, and that any increase would be put in across the board, across sectors and across companies, regardless of their economic performance. I hope that even the Government now recognise the benefits of the reforms of the 1980s. That kind of all-embracing collective bargaining, which is based purely on the rate of inflation, is economically damaging, and leads to less prosperity and less job creation.
<P>
The new clause would be a very bad addition to the Bill for all those reasons and I invite my hon. Friends and Government Members to reject it.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Cotter:</B> Fortunately, I have not had to rise from my sick bed, but as I have been saying to my hon. Friend the Member for Eastleigh, it is unfair to attack the poor Liberal Democrats, who are stepping into the breach. We have one chap who is sick, and one who was very recently sick, and who was in his sick bed last week. Notwithstanding that, I should like to stand by our proposal. Our case has to some extent been made by one or two of the comments of hon. Members.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Eastleigh and I are backed by a number of people who are anxious about the issue. We believe that a straightforward and open system should apply to the uprating of the national minimum wage. That is not unreasonable. If such a system does not exist, the national minimum wage could lose its relevance, with a trouble-free system, there would be trouble-free uprating. Without such a system, the national minimum wage could erode gradually, over some years. I hope that the Government will share that anxiety.
<P>
I see that the Low Pay Commission has been asked to consider the issue, ``to conduct periodic reviews'' and to recommend future levels. The term ``periodic reviews'' is unclear. One of the Liberal Democrats' main arguments is that annual reviews should occur. The hon. Member for Buckingham, who is not present, suggested that the Liberal Democrats might be anxious about support from business. The Conservative party has enormous concerns about business support. No sensible business is against regular increases in rates of pay. Businesses accept that principle; such increases happen all the time.

<B>Mr. Phil Woolas </B>(Oldham, East and Saddleworth): Given the absence of my hon. Friend the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne, I shall take up the cudgel. Would the proposed formula apply equally to proposed regional and sectoral variations? In other words, would the formula cut across the different rates that the Liberal Democrats have proposed in the past?
<P>
<B>Mr. Cotter:</B> I do not think that it would be unreasonable for the proposal to operate in that way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that we would then have to calculate regional and sectoral inflation rates to which the rate of increase would be tied? Presumably, we would have nine or 10 different regions and many sectors of industry, each of which would have a different inflation rate and, therefore, a different minimum wage increase. Does he think that that would be practical?
<P>
<B>Mr. Cotter:</B> I do not accept that we would be able to act on that basis. Minimum wage increases would have to be based on a national inflation rate.
<P>
I was disappointed by the Government's submission to the Low Pay Commission because it did not deal with uprating. I had hoped that the Government might have declared their view on uprating to the commission.
<P>
On the issue of what happens overseas, my hon. Friend the Member for Eastleigh mentioned the United States, where the lack of any clear system means that the minimum wage has been unsatisfactory and there have been many problems. On the other hand, France is able to operate a regular system, although it is different from the one that we are discussing. The French system is revised annually and protects against inflation so that the people have a share of the nation's economic growth. There are examples throughout the world of systems in which an annual revision works very well.
<P>
I support what the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge said about us not wanting to have a bun fight, because trying to avoid that is at the core of our discussions.
<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry replied to my point, which I probably did not make terribly well, about the great leap in the pay of Members of Parliament, which is what we are trying to avoid. I do not want to be hijacked into having such rises in the national minimum wage; on the contrary, regular increases would avoid having to take such large steps.
<P>
In conclusion, I hope that the Government will seriously consider our proposals in new clause 1 and the points I made regarding annual uprating.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I call the Minister.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I will allow the hon. Gentleman to speak first.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I am doubly grateful to the Minister, and in recognition of his generosity in allowing me to make a few remarks before he winds up, I will try to be as brief as possible.
<P>
The new clause and the arguments in support of it are pretty weak, but the debate on it, for which we should be grateful to Liberal Democrat Members, is important. David Yeandle, the head of employment affairs at the Engineering Employment Federation, made a speech about the national minimum wage, which he called ``A Step into the Unknown'' and in which he said, referring to uprating, that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``in many ways this is perhaps one of the most important aspects of the introduction of a National Minimum Wage and yet, until recently, there has been little discussion about this.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Indeed, that is true even within the confines of our deliberations in Committee.
<P>
Uprating is important because the impact of the national minimum wage on pay levels in the first instance is of great significance, but we have not explored the impact that it might have on industrial relations more generally. That is a second order of impacts on not only the costs of business but the manner in which the whole of business conducts its affairs.
<P>
Engineering employers are a case in point. The industry has moved over the years towards a position where the first consideration which is increasingly recognised on both sides of industry--if I may use that rather hackneyed term--is relative competitiveness. Keith Joseph was fond of emphasising unit labour costs when I worked for him at the Department of Industry. In most industries, year-on-year reductions in unit labour costs are often the prime consideration of the employees' pay negotiators as much as of the employers'.
<P>
The second consideration is the financial position of the company. Comparability and price inflation come after that. In business there is often tension between those factors of competitiveness and the company's financial position. In recent years they have rightly tended to win out over the broader consideration of the going rate.
<P>
Uprating the minimum wage could obscure--or, in the worst case, reverse--recent changes such as the engineering industry's abandonment in 1989 of nationally agreed minimum rates of pay. Businesses think that automatic uprating of the minimum wage by way of the Bill or the year-on-year procedure involving the Government and the Low Pay Commission would risk reintroducing the concept of the going rate or a benchmark percentage pay increase. That unhappy consideration is separate from the one-off impact on pay scales of the introduction of the national minimum wage. It will have widespread adverse implications.
<P>
As the hon. Member for Eastleigh said, that leads us to the American system of ad hoc decisions. We shall discuss the constitution and future work of the Low Pay Commission later. The Bill should not provide for automatic uprating of the minimum wage. Ad hoc increases or reductions should, as my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge said, be taken on economic, not political grounds, and on best advice. Ministers have used the Low Pay Commission in the first instance and I hope that they will continue to take advice should the rate change. The smallest possible adverse impact on pay bargaining in industry is desirable. I hope that the Committee will reject the new clause and that the Minister is against automaticity in uprating.
<P>
There is a further technical problem with the new clause. My hon. Friend the Member for Ashford referred to the difficulties associated with inflation rates. Significant difficulties are also associated with an average earnings figure. The national minimum wage will impact substantially on the rate of change in average earnings in the first year in which it applies. The average will be false.
<P>
There is a continuing problem. One-off changes in inflation or in earnings in any one year would feed through into subsequent uprating if the Government, perhaps because of automaticity in the relationship between the two, built changes in inflation and average earnings from previous years into one year's change in the national minimum wage rate. Those previous years's changes could have been due to factors quite unrelated to the prevailing economic circumstances when the national minimum wage was subsequently changed.
<P>
For all those reasons, I hope that the Minister will set his face against automaticity in upratings and in this instance--as will clearly happen in many other instances--rest on economic advice and the best available evidence, as presented to him by the Low Pay Commission.
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> It has been an interesting debate; without sounding trite, all hon. Members' contributions showed that they had thought carefully about the intellectual argument.
<P>
I was rather surprised at the hon. Member for Eastleigh. In previous debates, he advocated a rather incautious approach to ruling out the Bill, in that he proposed regional and sectoral rates, including different rates for regions that are next door to each other. At one point we calculated that there could be about 120 different wage rates.
<P>
In taking on the intellectual argument for regional and sectoral rates while advocating a rigid national formula for uprating all those rates at one specific annual point in the economic cycle, the Liberal Democrats are trying to deliver something to a range of constituencies, which it is not possible to do. One must be intellectually honest about the way in which one wants to proceed with a minimum wage, then set out and argue the case for it, be prepared to discuss it with partners in the processes and come to a conclusion, as we have done. If not, one gives the impression of supporting the national minimum wage while saying to various sectors, ``It is not for you. You have a special interest, so we will have a special rate for you and exclude you from the national minimum wage.'' One then looks to one's regional political bases and says, ``Yes, we are in favour of a national minimum wage, but there are special circumstances in my constituency, so it can be excluded on the basis of a special deal and a sectoral rate.''
<P>
What one ends up with is not so much a policy as expediency to cover one's tracks. The Liberals have not been prepared, intellectually, to take on the issue of why it is important to get rid of poverty pay in Britain and to tackle the economic forces that are at work. They have not been prepared to persuade those who might totally oppose it in principle--or who might be sceptical about introducing it on a national basis--of the economic and social case for a national minimum wage. The Liberals do not have a rock on which to stand, so they flounder about. The new clause is a classic example of not having the intellectual guts to stand by a policy and argue for it practically, openly and effectively.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> In his usual style--[Interruption.] It is interesting that while Back-Bench Labour Members are prepared to contribute from a sedentary position, not one of them was prepared to raise their voice in the interests of maintaining fair wages for the poorest paid during this debate.
<P>
The Minister puts his case in his usual eloquent way. He must know, however, that he made it on a false premise and used a false interpretation of my contributions to the debates over the past three or four weeks.
<P>
Time and again I have emphasised my concerns about the regional variations between London and the south-east and the rest of the country. The Minister chose to interpret that as differentiating regions that happen to be beside each other; I have never discussed the difference that it would make between regions with economies whose performance is lower than the national average. I have continually harped--perhaps until other hon. Members' have become bored--on the difficulties of setting a national minimum wage which will raise the poorest people in the south-east and London out of poverty, at the same time as not damaging or causing instability in the economies of the other regions. It is the Minister's interpretation that is built on a false premise, not mine. I must ask the Minister to get away from such histrionics--

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I must advise the hon. Gentleman that he has made a long intervention. He will have an opportunity to discuss the matter in more detail later.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I thank the hon. Member for Eastleigh for that secondary speech, which was most interesting, but I think that he protests too much. I accept that the hon. Gentleman is in favour of a minimum wage. Some policies are so worth fighting and arguing for that one has to stand one's ground and persuade others of their merits.
<P>
The Government decided to use an approach involving not a rigid formula but the Low Pay Commission. The minimum wage will work only if three elements are in place. First, the partners have to have ownership of the process and they must feel involved. Why exclude from the process of negotiating the only fixed wage in the economy those who will pay it--namely, the employers? That does not make social, economic or intellectual sense. Partnership involves ensuring that when the minimum wage is established the process will have been in the ownership of the partners who are involved.
<P>
Secondly, the partners, in taking ownership, have to be able to come to a conclusion about the minimum wage that is based on economic factors. That is why, when the Government set up the Low Pay Commission, the terms of reference contained recommendations about the starting rate; and they suggested that a range of economic factors, which were set out, should be taken into account.
<P>
We put the intellectual case for that argument before the election. We persuaded the business community that establishing a basic floor in the labour market was a process worth being involved in. Ownership of the policy means that the Government and the partners have the capacity to consider the impact of the minimum wage. The evidence submitted to the Low Pay Commission has been criticised. I gave a commitment in our first sitting that the Government wanted the LPC to be an independent body, to base its conclusions on the evidence that it receives and to keep within the Government's terms of reference. The Government's evidence was couched in neutral terms to give the LPC that freedom. Having made such a commitment, the Opposition should not criticise us or the process. It is critical that we do not establish the minimum wage by a rigid formula. We have gone through that proposal, and we shall never return to it. It is vital that the process should involve partnership and ownership.
<P>
The third necessary element is the fact that this is the first time in a complex modern industrial economy that a minimum wage has been established across the economy. The American model was established in the 1920s and 1930s as part of a reconstruction of American society, following an agreement between the Democrats and the industrialists. If one wants to create consumers, one has to pay them to be consumers. That brought about the minimum wage strategy that was used in the United States. The Japanese and European models came out of the second world war and the need for the allies to develop structures for societies that had abandoned fascism, adopted a modern, democratic structure and needed to be brought together. The model associated with the reconstruction of the Japanese and European economies involved various wage structures.
<P>
We have never disguised the fact that our task is complex and difficult, but we believe that it is needed on economic and social grounds, and that it will tackle the overwhelming problem of low pay in the United Kingdom economy. The LPC's model provides flexibility and gets rid of rigidity, which we must avoid.
<P>
Clause 8 places the LPC on a statutory basis. Clause 6 allows the Secretary of State to refer matters to it at any time. Once the minimum wage is achieved, we will bed it down. We must ensure that its application is non-disruptive. When the minimum wage is in place, we will consider its implications and whether the process is successful. The owners--the partners--should feel that the process of introducing it is done in such a way it will be successful. They need to be able to consider aspects of the social and economic impact of the minimum wage.
<P>
We have chosen this model. We fought the election on it and persuaded trade unions, community groups and employers to accept a Low Pay Commission. It is interesting to note that the establishment of a Low Pay Commission has been an outstanding success. All the social partners understood our intellectual argument about why the LPC was the model for a minimum wage.
<P>
I understand why the hon. Member for Eastleigh is pursuing the matter. Let us be clear. The Government do not intend to introduce a minimum wage only to end up back where we started, with much poverty pay. The minimum wage must be considered in the context of other Government policies on the economy. It must move forward on the basis of a range of issues, including clear economic analyses and circumstances, and changes to the benefits system. The ownership of the process must remain with the social partners and the Government.
<P>
I hope that explanation of the intellectual rigour behind the process makes it clear that we do not intend to abandon low-paid workers once we have established a minimum wage. The honest approach must be to ensure that the minimum wage is bedded down and that the process evolves so that we can tackle low pay in the economy and the complex reasons for it. We must be aware of its relationship with a range of factors in the economy, including the benefits system. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will decide to withdraw his motion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> I feel this has been a fruitful debate. It has revealed a little more of what Government have in mind about the relationship between the LPC and the national minimum wage. I am grateful to have received that clarification. I can put the Minister's mind at rest because I do not want to press the motion to a Division at this stage.
<P>
The Minister's clarification of the intellectual approach that he and the Government have to the minimum wage raised questions about the future role of the LPC. The Minister's response to new clause 1 made it clear that for the LPC to be effective--to provide the economic rigour and maintain the partnership that he so eloquently described--it would have to be a permanent independent statutory body which would be with us for all time. Although I am happy to withdraw the motion, I look forward with great interest to our debate on the role of the LPC. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.
<P>
Motion and clause, by leave, withdrawn.
<H4><center>New Clause 4</center></H4>
<H4><center>Exclusions (family businesses)</center></H4>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``.--A person employed by a family member as part of a family business does not qualify for the national minimum wage in respect of that employment.''.--[Mr. Hammond.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Brought up, and read the First time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a second time.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following: New clause 5--Therapy workers--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``.--A person whose employment is primarily undertaken for the purpose of therapy and whose employer is a non-profit-making organisation does not qualify for the national minimum wage in respect of that employment.''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
New clause 8--Workers resident in registered homes--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``.--A person who is a worker and resides in a registered home, who if remunerated at the level of the national minimum wage, would be unlikely to secure further employment and whose remuneration is confined to the level of personal allowance available to a worker so resident at public expense without any deduction, shall be excluded from the provisions of this Act.''.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Hammond:</B> This gives us an opportunity to canter for a final time over some ground that we have covered before. New clause 4 deals with the position of family members employed in a business, and new clauses 5 and 8 deal with those who are either engaged in work as part of therapy or who live in a residential institution in which they work.
<P>
Far be it from me, Mr. Atkinson, to question the grouping of the clauses in any way, but I suspect that we may find ourselves in a situation in which the Minister is rejecting outright the concepts behind new clause 4 but is at least sympathetic--judging by remarks that he made in earlier debates--to the reasoning that lies behind new clauses 5 and 8. I am mindful that the Minister assured us on other occasions that he would look at the position of the disabled.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. If I may interrupt the hon. Gentleman, the Minister said that if he so wished, the hon. Gentleman could request that any one of those new clauses should be put to the vote separately and independently of the group.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I thank you for that, Mr. Atkinson. Clearly, we want to hear the Minister's response to this short debate.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
New clause 4 deals with family members employed in a business and proposes the exclusion of such people from the scope of the minimum wage. It is principally small firms that this would affect, and our contention is that it would be inappropriate to inject the force of the law into family relationships in a small business. The most extreme example of what I have in mind--and of what my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham had in mind when he tabled the amendment--would be a small retail business that has a single employee who is the wife or husband of the employer.
<P>
There will also be many instances, especially in ethnic minority communities, of members of an extended family working together in a business. In such cases, remuneration might take a complex form: the family might live together and share accommodation costs, which would not make it easy to determine whether the minimum wage had been paid. The Minister must know in his heart of hearts that the Bill is almost entirely irrelevant to such a situation, except in extreme circumstances such as a family dispute or family breakdown, in which this type of law should play no part. It would be impossible to determine whether a husband was paying his wife the minimum wage or whether payments in kind such as bed and board had been made available. Payments in kind would have to be taken into account in computing whether the minimum wage had been paid. If uncle, aunt, granny and cousins were living in the same house, it would be impossible to determine how many hours each of them was working.
<P>
To include this class of employees within the Bill's scope would be inviting employers and employees in such situations to ignore the law, to falsify records and to say whatever they liked. There would be no way of bringing them to book, and turning a blind eye to that would bring this law in particular and the law in general into disrepute.
<P>
Clause 14(2) already provides that officers would not require a person to give information that would have the effect of incriminating the person giving the information or the spouse of the person giving the information. That would preclude the Bill's provisions from operating effectively in situations in which a husband and wife were in an employer-employee relationship. The employment of close family members in a small business is a special class of employment and is simply not amenable to the imposition of legal constraints. Such constraints would not work in such a context and it would probably not be right to attempt to make them work.
<P>
New clauses 5 and 8 have not been tabled with the intention of disadvantaging disabled people or of depriving them of the rights that they share with other citizens. They have been proposed because as technology develops and as more and more workplace transactions are conducted electronically, there is the prospect that prejudice will be eliminated. More and more people will be working with others whose race, creed, gender, skin colour or disability will be genuinely hidden from them because those people will be electronic entities. They will have an electronic existence at the other end of a telecommunications link.
<P>
The reality is, however, that many disabled people will be less productive in their work because of their disability. Under those circumstances, it is right that society should compensate them, through state benefits or other forms of assistance. That will enable them to price themselves back into the labour market, by charging a competitive rate for their work. They will be competitive with an able-bodied person. That is an admirable objective, and one that I hope that the Minister will not attempt to misrepresent. It can only benefit disabled people and I hope that the Minister will accept the good intentions of Conservative Members and give due consideration to the principles behind the new clauses, which we have aired one final time in this marathon Committee.

<P>

<B>Gillian Merron </B>(Lincoln): This is not a new canter, as the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge has suggested, but an old, sluggish run around a long block, with an out-of-condition argument. We have heard it all before. The new clauses would undermine the Bill; they propose further exclusions. The Opposition have still not got the message. They are still attempting to dodge and weave on fundamental points.
<P>
I repeat that this is a minimum wage Bill. There will be a national minimum wage. It will be applied widely, policed effectively and understood clearly. There is no mistake about that.
<P>
Perhaps Opposition Members hope that new clause 4 will mark the advent of new Conservatism. I think not. New clause 4 is tough on fair pay and tough on the causes of fair pay. The clause refers to family members. It does not matter whether they are second cousins, sisters, in-laws, or spouses. What matters is whether a worker has a contract. That is a defining question in the Bill and it always will be.
<P>
New clause 5 refers to therapeutic work for non-profit-making organisations. We do not want to risk the automatic exclusion of those who need therapeutic work, for whatever reason. The Minister has already assured the Committee that the Low Pay Commission will issue recommendations on the complex subject of therapeutic activities and earnings. It is right and proper to await the commission's thoughtful and evidence-based recommendations, rather than to risk disadvantaging those who have a disability.I have similar views on new clause 8. The wording of the clause--which is all that we have to go on--is open to a wide range of interpretations. Are resident workers employed staff, or those who are cared for? Does the reference to a personal allowance mean the personal expenses allowance or a therapeutic earnings allowance? None of that is clear, and it will create many problems of interpretation.
<P>
The three new clauses attempt to frustrate the scope of the national minimum wage and open up gaps through which workers and wages will fall. The Committee should not allow that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am sorry that the hon. Member for Lincoln (Gillian Merron), who has a strong commitment to the Bill, is still at this late hour disinclined to accept our bona fides in the matter. Even if it has not always been the case, my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge moved with even more than his customary grace, sensitivity and modesty in tabling the new clauses.
<P>
The new clause is not an attempt to subvert the Bill. It at least gives us an opportunity, although possibly not in the form that we would wish, to pause for a moment on some of the implications of what is proposed and to try to avoid any adverse consequences. My hon. Friends can put the points on family employment better than I could. Indeed we have not rehearsed this matter as fully as we might have done earlier in our consideration of the Bill.
<P>
I cite as an example my own family and those I know in related and extended parts of the family, who do not have the same business as myself. Family arrangements are often flexible. As the hon. Member for Lincoln said there may be an element of contract--I shall return to that, in a moment--but a wide variety of arrangements are embraced by members of a family and seem appropriate in the circumstances of the time.
<P>
I remember an agricultural employment case involving my uncle and my cousins--my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire will be interested in this because of his wish to harmonise matters. There was a row with a tax inspector about whether they were entitled to certain allowances against their income tax as a result of their remuneration package. I cannot imagine what the details were as it was all of 35 years ago. My uncle awaited the deliberations of the general commissioners in the corridor with the then Inspector of Taxes, whom he happened to know quite well. I remember only the punchline, when he said to the inspector, ``If you carry on like this, you will risk losing some of your best customers.'' He was objecting to the attempt by a public authority to intervene in what he saw as a perfectly reasonable family arrangement.
<P>
More serious than that anecdote are two points. One is that the obligation to keep records of employment exists, whether or not the details of the family arrangement are properly recorded in them. A failure to keep records is potentially an offence. An insensitive inspector who stumbles into such a situation may have taken against those involved because they have disagreed with the process. That may lead to an eventual prosecution and I regret that.
<P>
The second and perhaps more serious point, to which the hon. Member for Lincoln did not do justice, relates to what one might loosely call the dynamic effects of the Bill. There are different patterns of family arrangements, and particularly in relation to younger, more vulnerable or less central members of the family, such as nieces or nephews, the employment relationship must might be the right one. The alternative may be to move into a partnership arrangement, which particularly if a person were self-employed, would imply an element of risk-sharing. My hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge has often said, eloquently, that he is concerned about the impact of such changes: people may be forced into self-employment when it is not the wise thing to do.
<P>
On therapy--
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Before my hon. Friend moves off families, will he observe that, if there were not specific exclusion by virtue of new clause 4, there would none the less, be scope for Ministers to propose an exemption for family members, however defined under clause 3, by using the powers in clause 4, which is not constrained, as some other options are.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> That is exactly the point, and it is right to record it.
<P>
I am anxious to motor on. I have only a little to say about therapy, because my hon. Friend made the points adequately. Indeed, his new clause is not materially different from mine in how it addresses the problem. I am sorry that I fell slightly foul of the hon. Member for Lincoln about my intentions.
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I do not intend to subvert the general purposes of the Bill, nor to reimport general considerations of disability discrimination by another means. We are concerned with narrow situations, which may need defining rather more precisely, and on which it is entirely proper that the Low Pay Commission should report, as the Minister suggested. I think particularly of the small minority of workers with a disability whose ability to work economically is entirely compromised by a national minimum wage.
<P>
We shall have the opportunity during our final sitting to discuss the agricultural wages order. In my researches into the matter, I asked the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food how many agricultural workers are currently covered by the provisions of the agricultural wages order. The written answer of 20 January--a holding answer was given on 19 January but the Ministry took another day to give the full answer--was that about 170,000 are covered in England and Wales. I also asked how disabled or had a disability and was told:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``It is not known how many have a disability.''--[Official Report, 20 January 1998; Vol. 304, c. 497.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I then asked how many incapacity permits under the order are currently in force.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> Will my hon. Friend give way? [Interruption.] I was going to say something, but I have lost my train of thought.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> It was, as ever, a helpful intervention.
<P>
The Agricultural Wages Act 1948 does not define disability but defines an incapacitated worker as person who
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``is so affected by any physical injury or mental deficiency, or infirmity due to age or any other cause, that he is incapable of earning''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the agricultural minimum rate. Those, of course, were Labour words. A small minority of workers with a disability will either not work at all, even if the work was good for their condition, or some derogation will have to be found. I say no more; I rest my case.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> I will try to deal with the matter as quickly and adequately as I can. One of the new clauses is completely out of order and deserves to be booted into touch. It is a clear attempt to undermine the Bill. New clauses 5 and 8 are worthy of consideration.
<P>
We debated the matter on 27 January and I can add nothing to what appears in Hansard. New clause 4 is another attempt to try to use an exemption to undermine the capacity of individuals to gain access to the minimum wage. It is not right that people should not be paid the minimum wage because they are employed by their uncle, sister, father, mother, daughter, cousin, second cousin, or third cousin twice removed.
<P>
If one goes into a pub and is served by a landlord's daughter, one does not expect the pump that she uses to provide free ale simply because she is not covered by the minimum wage regulations. One would not go to a hairdresser and pay &#163;16 for a short back and sides, but get it for nothing if the owner's daughter was cutting it because she was not being paid the minimum wage.
<P>
It is economic nonsense, and I ask my hon. Friends to resist the proposals. They are flippant. They are trying to substitute a pay spine for a family tree. There is no economic or social reason why we should support new clause 4. I ask my hon. Friends to resist that and new clauses 5 and 8.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> We were not entirely happy with the Minister's response, but we may return to the matter on Report if we can find a way of doing so. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.
<P>
Motion and clause, by leave, withdrawn.
