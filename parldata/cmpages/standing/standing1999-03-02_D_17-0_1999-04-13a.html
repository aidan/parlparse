<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies </B>(Grantham and Stamford): On a point of order, Mr. Malins. It is important for hon. Members to be clear about the hours that the Committee will sit on Thursday. We have all received a card stating that the Committee will sit on Thursday 15th April at 10 am and 4.30 pm. Is that a misprint for 1430 hours or is the Committee to sit at 4.30 pm&#151;the old time, not the new Labour revised Thursday time?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I understand that an error has been spotted. The correct position is set out on the new card that has been issued today. The Committee will sit at 10 am and 2.30 pm on Thursday.
<P>
<B>Mr. Eric Pickles </B>(Brentwood and Ongar): I was speaking to the amendments&#151;[Interruption.] When I was vice-chairman of the Conservative party, I helped to organise the national conference programme. One great problem was organising the timing of speeches in conjunction with ``Playschool''. We always had great trouble with my right hon. Friends the Members for Henley (Mr. Heseltine) and for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer), whose speeches were always running into ``Playschool'', as a result of which the nation was denied their fine words. That happened at the last electioneering period, too.
<P>
I have explained how our amendments relate to the Bill, but I shall refer now to proposed subsection (6) on convenience and the points raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Chingford and Woodford Green (Mr. Duncan Smith) on Second Reading. I want to give the Government the opportunity to allay his fears about what he felt was an all-out, drop-out clause for administration purposes under which people were not brought forward for interview. I firmly recall the Secretary of State saying on Second Reading that the idea was for someone to get an interview within two to three days&#151;something that we would generally support.
<P>
The Bill outlines several reasons why it would not be appropriate for someone to be brought forward for interview. Given the robust and straightforward points that the Minister made earlier about everyone reaching his or her full potential, I expect that robustness to be followed through at the weakest link. If, however, my hon. Friend the Member for Chingford and Woodford Green is right, an officer faced with a great burden of people to see would simply tick them off and deny them the opportunity that the Minister believes is so desirable for them to achieve. It would be good if the Minister would deal with that in his response.
<P>
The amendments relate strongly to compulsion and it is right to return to a matter that was discussed this morning. It is wholly relevant to the amendments and concerns lone parents. I received a ticking off from the Minister who said that I was wrong to suggest that there was no element of compulsion for lone parents. I was surprised, and not a little hurt, because I thought that I had received an assurance that lone parents would be free from compulsion. That assurance was given by the Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment, the hon. Member for Barking (Ms Hodge), in a letter dated 9 February, from which I shall quote later.
<P>
Earlier in our deliberations, we heard how the Treasury did not know what the Department of Social Security was doing. There seems to be some rivalry between Departments, but we are discussing a cross-departmental matter. I could understand confusion between Ministers in the DSS and Ministers in the Department of Education and Employment, but there seems to be confusion between the Minister for Employment, Welfare to Work and Equal Opportunities and the Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment. She wrote to me barely two months ago clarifying some points on compulsion for lone parents. The letter states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``there are no proposals to introduce compulsion into the New Deal for Lone Parents. My letter did reflect Government policy which has not changed''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
She went on to talk about the single work-focused gateways and how they will be piloted in 12 areas. She said that benefit claimants would be invited to the interview to meet their personal adviser, who would offer assistance on how certain barriers to work might be overcome, which is all very interesting and extremely laudable, but she then says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``There is no intention to compel lone parents to participate in the New Deal for Lone Parents or take up work.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Minister for Employment, Welfare to Work and Equal Opportunities (Mr. Andrew Smith) indicated assent.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> The Minister cannot nod away happily. He must explain the position. He said this morning that he would not compel lone parents to go to work, but that he wanted only that they come for an interview. He said that that was not unreasonable, and to tell the truth, I agree with him. But that is not what the Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment says. Her letter states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``There is no intention to compel lone parents to participate.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am not misleading the Committee and I certainly do not want to paint the Minister into a corner. He has done that himself&#151;more than adequately. Just in case I did not get the message, the Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment told me twice on the first page of her letter that there was no compulsion. In her final paragraph, she stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``I must reiterate that there is no intention to introduce compulsion for lone parents.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is pretty straightforward. To attend an interview is to participate. I cannot see how it can be regarded in any other way. The confusion between Government Departments must be sorted out now. The hon. Member for Newbury (Mr. Rendel) talked graphically about threats to withdraw benefit. We firmly believe that people who do not participate should have their benefits withdrawn. We support the Government in that, which is why we have been so keen for people with disabilities and carers to be exempt from the process, but we believe that we should be tough. The process should be helpful and should bring out the best in people, but we are with the Government 100 per cent., and are serious about getting people&#151;
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Leigh </B>(Gainsborough): This is a serious point. Will my hon. Friend take the opportunity to dissociate the Conservative party from the inhuman practices of states such as Wisconsin, where lone mothers of children as young as 12 weeks old are forced by the state government to go out to work? Will he put pressure on the Government to ensure that that never happens here?
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I am most grateful to my hon. Friend. I gave the Minister an opportunity this morning to do exactly that. That would be quite unsatisfactory. The hon. Member for Croydon, North (Mr. Wicks) raised the matter on Second Reading. I gave the Minister an opportunity this morning&#151;and received my second ticking-off of the morning from you, Mr. Malins, because you thought that I was about to burst into song.
<P>
The Minister did a nice little sidestep: now we see him, now we do not. He said that the point is not relevant, but, as my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh) rightly says, it is relevant to ensuring clear understanding. Given that Ministers are confused about the possible element of compulsion, it is not surprising that the average person outside, who should benefit from the changes, does not know the difference. The Minister is merely playing a word game, a catch-all. The reason for the difference between what the Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment says and what the Minister says is that, despite some consensus about what we want to achieve, at times, confusion about this important issue is at the heart of Government.
<P>
Having said that, amendment Nos. 245, 254, 255 and 258 are purely probing amendments, designed to give the Government an opportunity to say exactly what they mean in relation to compulsion and withdrawal of benefit. The debate offers an opportunity for some clarity, which the Committee deserves, and from which it would benefit. I look forward with great interest to what the Minister has to say and to how he will eat his words of this morning.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Smith:</B> The hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles) made two points. He suggested that the robust approach that he said that he supported for the single work-focused gateway might be diluted by officials&#151;I think that I quote him accurately&#151;``ticking a few people off'', the implication being that people might be nodded through. I assure the Committee that that will not happen. It is not within the terms of the single work-focused gateway that we have designed or within the terms of procedure by which people quite properly exercise their professional responsibilities. Indeed, it would run into quality control of the single work-focused gateway were anyone to attempt to do that. To return to the point made in the previous debate, when there is good reason to defer the interview, or indeed to waive it in cases of the severest disability, it is right for provision to be made through regulations for that to happen, as specified in the Bill. However, there will be no question of people simply being nodded through in the way that the hon. Gentleman suggests.
<P>
The hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar referred to confusion, but that only confusion is&#151;wilfully&#151;his own. I do not blame him for attempting to make mischief on the issue, but it would be sad if, as a result of his remarks, people outside were misled about what is involved in the single gateway and how it relates to the new deal for lone parents. There is no confusion. The hon. Gentleman confuses the requirement to have an interview for the single work-focused gateway with the provisions of the new deal for lone parents. That became very clear when he quoted the letter from my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment, who said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``There is no intention to compel lone parents to participate in the New Deal.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
There is a clear distinction between requiring people to attend an interview as part of an initial or renewed claim for benefit and requiring them to take part in the options for training, work experience and so on in the new deal programme. There is compulsion on people to take part in the new deal for young people, but there is no compulsion on people to take part in the new deal for lone parents, nor will there be when the single work-focused gateway is in operation. So I trust that that clarifies matters for the benefit of the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar and, indeed, for the public.
<P>
Government amendments Nos. 225 to 228 will improve the provisions that set out the consequences for failing to attend a work-focused interview. The amendments are needed to provide the right incentives to ensure compliance with the requirement to take part in interviews and to ensure that people on benefit receive help as soon as possible.
<P>
The Committee will be aware that the clause contains the requirements to take part in work-focused interviews in three main circumstances. The majority of claimants will be asked to take part in an initial interview at the point of claim. As has been said, an interview at the outset may not be appropriate in a small number of cases and the interview may be deferred until a later date. In addition, further interviews may take place throughout an individual's time on benefit, following the occurrence of certain trigger events that have an impact on a person's employability.
<P>
We are concerned that the clause as drafted fails to provide the right incentives to ensure compliance with the requirement to take part in work-focused interviews. In particular, it would have created an anomaly in that those required to take part in their initial work-focused interview at the point of claim who did not do so would receive no benefit, but those who had that interview deferred would suffer only a reduction in their entitlement.
<P>
Under amendment No. 225, a consistent approach will be achieved for all first interviews, whether or not they are deferred. Thus the claim of someone who fails to take part in a deferred initial interview will be terminated. In those circumstances, benefit will be reinstated only on the receipt of a new claim, for which participation in a work-focused interview will be required.
<P>
That is entirely consistent with the change in culture in the benefits system that we want to achieve through the single gateway. I am pleased about the amount of cross-party support in the Committee for that change. Before I attended the Committee, I addressed a conference for officials, advisers and others from single work-focused gateway pilot schemes. I was pleased to be able to tell them about the degree of bipartisan support in the Committee for what we want to achieve through the single work-focused gateway. That support is important for such a radical reform of the welfare system&#151;the wider the consensus, the better its chance of working successfully.
<P>
I am sure that the staff that I addressed appreciated my communicating to them the support that we have received from Opposition Members. That reinforces from the outset the message that people have a right to state support, but also a responsibility to take reasonable steps to take advantage of the help that they are offered. For that reason, we need to ensure that a stronger incentive is in place to encourage people to attend their initial interview, whether or not it is deferred.
<P>
Once the new routine has been established, we believe that the requirement to attend a work-focused interview will be seen as a normal part of continuing entitlement. The requirement to fill in forms was mentioned in exchanges with the hon. Member for Newbury. That requirement is not seen as a threat, so there is no reason why the requirement to attend an interview, especially such a helpful one, should be seen as a threat.

<P>

<B>Mr. Howard Flight </B>(Arundel and South Downs): What happens to people who have lost entitlement to benefit? One cannot let them starve. Will some other machinery be put in place to act as a temporary support for those who do not go to their interviews, lose all their benefit rights and, as a result, have nothing to live on? One cannot leave things in mid-air, with people being utterly destitute. However, there will be no discipline for people to attend an interview unless they face the threat of real hardship. How will a balance be achieved?
<P>
<B>Mr. Smith:</B> As we discussed earlier, the completion of the interview will be as normal a part of making a claim for benefit as filling in a form is now. Indeed, the new system will be much more customer-friendly than the present rather alienating pillar-to-post system. Every effort will be made to ensure that people complete the procedure successfully and satisfactorily. With wilful non-compliance, however, there comes a point when people must take responsibility for their actions. One reason for reforming the system is that over the years that reciprocity of rights and responsibilities has been lost sight of. We make no apology for redressing that balance.
<P>
In earlier exchanges with the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford (Mr. Davies), I explained that someone in receipt of benefit whose interview is deferred would not face a termination of benefit until there had been three refusals to turn up to interview and until a home visit had been made. Every effort will be made. All that has to be done to obtain access to benefit is to complete an interview. It is hardly an onerous or unreasonable responsibility. I hope that the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs (Mr. Flight), all Opposition Members and the wider public will be reassured by that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> Will lone parents be compelled to go to an interview? If they do not attend an interview, will their benefit be cut? If they will not be compelled to go on to the new deal, surely they do not have to attend an interview?
<P>
<B>Mr. Smith:</B> Lone parents in receipt of benefit will not lose benefit for refusing to attend an interview; the Bill provides for a reduction in benefit. However, new claimants who do not attend the interview will not have completed the procedure of accessing the benefits system and will therefore not receive benefit. All that they have to do to comply with the requirement is take part in, not simply attend, a work-focused interview. I state again what I said earlier. Such people will not be compelled to take part in the new deal for lone parents, nor otherwise to work. Indeed, I offer the reassurance that the hon. Member for Gainsborough sought.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> If the Minister has made it clear somewhere else, I hope that he will excuse my ignorance. However, as he knows, I feel strongly about the matter. I am quite happy that lone mothers whose children are three or four years old and ready to go to nursery school should be required to attend interviews. However, I am worried about the ideas floating over from America, where mothers of very young children are forced in to work. What sort of cut-off point does the Minister have in mind?
<P>
<B>Mr. Smith:</B> It is clear in the Bill, and it has been confirmed by me, that lone parents will not have to work. There is a requirement to turn up for an interview, and we have suggested that an appropriate trigger point for a repeat interview would be when the youngest child had reached the age of five and before the age of 11. However, that is a requirement to turn up for an interview, not to work. As I said, it remains entirely up to the clients to decide how best to discharge their caring responsibilities and their responsibility to provide for their families, development of which is essential. That is a matter for them. We require through this Bill that they turn up to the interview, which, as we have said, will offer a great deal of help. I believe that it will be welcomed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> The Minister has been interesting not only in his response, but generous in giving way several times.
<P>
Would the Minister be prepared to give an undertaking for the lifetime of the next Parliament, if his Government are re-elected, that there will be no change to the requirements with regard to lone parents? He has side-stepped the North Croydon question, and has come some way towards dealing with the question asked by my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough. Is the Minister saying, ``Well, actually we've decided that this is a generational thing and we won't look at it in this or the next Parliament''?
<P>
<B>Mr. Smith:</B> We do not deal with such matters by making ridiculous projections into the next Parliament, in the same way as the Conservative party attempts to get out of its dilemmas over the euro. The Bill is as it is written. I have said what the Government's understanding of its provisions is, and that is the matter on which the Committee is voting and on which we are asking the public to support the idea of the single work-focused gateway, as I am sure they will. No proposals in the Bill go beyond that, and if there were, I would say so.
<P>
I want to get to the remaining Government amendments. Where benefits are already in payment, failure to take part in an interview will result in a reduction in the amount of benefit payable. We believe that that approach provides a suitable incentive to encourage compliance. Amendments Nos. 226 and 227 will make other adjustments to that regime. Amendment No. 226 will clarify that any reduction in benefit will apply only until an individual complies with the requirement to take part in a repeat interview. That is reasonable, as I am sure the Committee will accept.
<P>
Amendment No. 227 will remove the provision in the clause that would have enabled the reduction in benefit to be restored on compliance. It is our intention that any reduction should apply until claimants participate in an interview, at which point they will again be entitled to a normal rate of benefit. Any benefit lost in the interim will not be refundable. We felt on reflection that that struck the correct balance between rights and responsibilities, and that it would be wrong to refund sums that had been withheld due to lack of co-operation. We believed that doing so would dilute the message that we want to send&#151;that people must comply with the requirement to discuss their prospects with a personal adviser throughout the lifetime of their claim.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> As my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar said, the Minister has been most generous in giving way.
<P>
I am still unclear about the format of the interview and the record-keeping that will be involved. We may want to raise the issue on the clause stand part debate. What safeguards is the Minister building into the system to allow people to appeal at the end of the lengthy process of three alleged non-interviews plus a home visit? We are all aware from our surgeries how easy it is for papers to go astray.
<P>
<B>Mr. Smith:</B> One reason why we propose such an exhaustive process before benefit can be terminated is to ensure that it does not happen by accident or maladministration. I assure the hon. Lady that people who are refused benefit will have the opportunity to appeal, whatever the reason that they believe that they have been improperly treated in the process leading to that decision.
<P>
Amendment No. 228, which is consequential on amendments Nos. 225 to 227, clarifies that, where the initial interview is deferred until a later date, benefit can be put in payment, despite the fact that the individual had not yet taken part in an initial interview. Such a provision is clearly necessary in a deferred system.
<P>
In the light of the changes, I reassure Committee members that if someone fails to attend an interview, his or her award will not be summarily terminated; we will make extensive efforts to contact the individual and to make clear the consequences of non-compliance. As I said this morning, we will provide home visits where appropriate and also comprehensive good-cause provision that will give adequate protection to people who are, for reasons beyond their control, unable to attend interviews. Only in the event of a third failure without good cause to attend an appointment would benefit entitlement be stopped. The decision to terminate benefit would in any case carry the right of appeal to an independent tribunal.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Unlike the Opposition amendments, which were largely probing, our amendments will strike the right balance. Amendments Nos. 245, 255 and 256 seek to ensure that failure to take part in initial and triggered interviews should lead to the immediate termination of benefit. However, as I explained earlier, the single gateway is about achieving a culture change in the benefits system. We want to place the clearest incentives to comply in respect of all first interviews. However, we expect that most people, once they have had that first interview, will welcome the amount of support that can be provided and adjust to the new relationship that is required of them as part of the welfare system. Going further and ensuring that people face an immediate loss of benefit for non-compliance, throughout the lifetime of their claim, is therefore likely to be unnecessary and counter-productive.
<P>
Amendment No. 254 also attempts to strengthen the sanctions regime by preventing an individual who has failed to take part in a work-focused interview at the point of claim from making more than one new claim for benefit in the same calendar year. The hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar did not talk about that&#151;
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I was broken off, but I spoke about it before lunch.
<P>
<B>Mr. Smith:</B> The hon. Gentleman got through a lot quickly in the brief period in which he talked; I apologise for having missed it. It is therefore all the more appropriate that I take some time to explain why the amendment is not a good idea.
<P>
An individual who failed to participate in two interviews would not be eligible to claim again until the next calendar year and would be left completely without benefit until that time. That could lead to real financial hardship, with no remedy available to the claimant to relieve it. There is a crucial difference between that and what we are proposing. Under our proposals, the claimant could at any time relieve any threat of hardship by undertaking an interview and legitimately establishing a claim to benefit. The amendment would have perverse effects because the penalty would be completely arbitrary, depending on which point in the calendar year the failure occurred. A second failure in January would lead to a much more severe penalty than a similar failure in December. That cannot be right. The amendment could also prevent someone who failed to participate in a first interview but who subsequently attended a second from claiming another benefit even if he or she became entitled to do so later that year. I shall not dwell further on the point because the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar was probing and we do not need to expose every technical weakness.
<P>
The single gateway and our amendments will provide claimants with a better, more efficient and more integrated service, giving them access to a wide range of advice and support. People have a right to expect help, but in return they have a responsibility to discuss the help that is available. We believe that most claimants will welcome that opportunity.
<P>
I hope that the Committee will agree that our amendments will create the right balance of rights and responsibilities, while being flexible enough to deal with a wide range of clients in different circumstances. I commend them to the Committee.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> The Government and Opposition are not far apart on this, but I am far from persuaded that we should accept Government amendment No. 227, which would remove paragraph (d) at the top of page 46, which reads:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``for restoring to a person in prescribed circumstances the whole or part of the amount by which any relevant benefit has been reduced.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If we accept that amendment, the Benefits Agency, or whoever administers the programme, will have no right to restore benefit that has been lost following a decision to withdraw benefit, perhaps as a consequence of someone repeatedly failing to show up for interview. It is wrong in principle that the Government, the Benefits Agency or any arm of government should not have that opportunity for flexibility&#151;that margin of manoeuvre&#151;at least to use in exceptional circumstances. With the best will in the world, even if no mistakes are made by the Employment Service or Benefits Agency, occasionally a letter may go astray, or someone may call at the wrong address or come back with the answer that so and so refuses to turn up for interview or is wilfully refusing to respond to correspondence when, in fact, that is not the case and the claimant is away legitimately or there is a genuine confusion about the address.
<P>
It is unreasonable for us to suppose that any government or human machine works perfectly. On occasions, mistakes will be made by the Benefits Agency or Employment Service or by the computer&#151;although that is always ultimately traceable to human error. Therefore, it seems sensible to preserve the opportunity to restore the position to what it should be, in the interests of natural justice and the good working of the whole system, so I ask the Minister to think again about amendment No. 227.
<P>
<B>Mr. Smith:</B> I do not agree with the hon. Gentleman for the simple reason that, as originally drafted, the Bill automatically provided that money would be paid to make good a reduction that someone had suffered as a consequence of their own refusal to take part in a work-focused interview. That would be perverse. The amendment is not aimed at dealing with the hon. Gentleman's concern that, because of some mistake or because something has gone astray, someone who was entitled to receive money was mistakenly not paid. In those circumstances, it will be possible for restitution to be made, as I believe is currently possible in the benefits system. So I do not think that the hon. Gentleman's objection is well founded.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> If the Minister can give me the assurance that the Benefits Agency or Employment Service, or whoever administrates these programmes, will have that flexibility&#151;I shall make my intervention a little longer because I want to give the Minister time to read the note that he has just received from his civil servants&#151;and if he can give me not merely a general assurance, but chapter and verse and a reference to where in legislation the power to override the removal of paragraph (d), then I will be satisfied.
<P>
<B>Mr. Smith:</B> Happily, the note confirmed what I had already told the hon. Gentleman. The Bill includes good cause provisions, which we shall debate in relation to later amendments and which cover the sorts of contingencies to which he referred. He says that he has reservations about amendment No. 227, which would provide for restitution of benefit in certain circumstances&#151;not where there has been an administrative mistake and someone has not received a letter, but where someone has chosen not take part in a work-focused interview. On reflection, we believe that it would be wrong automatically to provide for restitution in those circumstances. However, the Bill includes good cause provisions and other means are available to make good mistakes that occur within the social security system, which cover the circumstances that the hon. Gentleman has in mind. I do not want people to be wrongfully deprived of their benefit any more than he does.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I am grateful for that response. We are making some progress, but I should be grateful if the Minister would tell me in which clauses those powers exist. Paragraph (d), which the amendment would remove, refers to the possibility for regulations to provide the power to restore benefit ``in prescribed circumstances''. Those regulations could include circumstances in which an injustice would otherwise be created or in which a mistake has been made&#151;a bona fide mistake by the claimant or the administering agency. Tautology is, after all, a regular feature of English law. I would be much more worried by the fear that the requisite powers and flexibility did not exist in the system than I would by the duplication of powers enabling the adminstrators of the programmes to provide redress to those whose benefit had been withdrawn, in circumstances in which it should have been restored.
<P>
<B>Mr. Smith:</B> To eliminate any remaining doubt in the hon. Gentleman's mind, may I tell him that my eyes went straight to the right subsection of clause 47, even before the note arrived? Subsection 3(e) and (f) will give us the ability to set out in regulations good cause and provisions that will deal precisely with the hon. Gentleman's concerns and render unnecessary his worries about our amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> It is helpful to have the additional assurance as to how those powers, which are openly and vaguely worded in subsection 3(e) and (f), will be used. That resolves the problem and we have no further objection to the Government's amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I have a brief comment. I am grateful to the Minister for being most helpful, especially in the light of the Government's amendments, in tackling most of the points that we have put to him. We wanted a debate on compulsion and I enjoyed listening to the Minister going to great lengths to explain why a probing amendment would not work. I suppose that if people stay up late reading their brief, they have to read it out sometime. We do not mind that, provided that it does not happen too often. These were probing amendments and in that light, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that we will vote on the subsequent amendments that we have been discussing in due course. They will no doubt be moved formally. We now move from amendment No. 245 to amendment No. 246.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> Before I move the amendment, may I make it clear that I do not intend to put amendments Nos. 245, 255 or 256 to the vote? I wished to withdraw not only amendment No. 245, but also the other amendments tabled in the name of my hon. Friends and myself.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> We were principally discussing amendment No. 245, which has been withdrawn. All the other amendments in that group were simply there for the purposes of discussion. The Government amendments will be called formally in due course and, from the indications given, will be moved formally. So far as any other amendments tabled in the name of the hon. Gentleman are concerned, they will not be put to the vote. No further action is necessary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> Thank you, Mr. Malins. I wanted to be clear about that in my own mind.
<P>
I beg to move amendment No. 246, in page 44, line 31, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`; and such regulations shall not have effect unless they have been laid before, and approved by resolution of each House of Parliament.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This amendment refers to affirmative resolutions. That is a familiar track, down which every Opposition plough and we have received silken answers to suggest that amendment is not necessary. During our earlier deliberations, we had a magnificent debate about the possibility of affirmative resolutions. I do not intend to spend long on this matter because the arguments were well made, but I am sure that Labour Members will concede that there is an important difference. We are discussing pilot schemes. It would make a great deal of sense, once Parliament has deliberated on the matter and worked out the best way to proceed, if we decided to consider the regulations by way of an affirmative resolution.
<P>
Whenever we highlight a problem, the Minister tells us not to worry because everything will be sorted out by administrative and managerial systems. I am sure that the schemes will be considered carefully and decent deliberation will take place, but it should be good enough for the House of Commons to decide how well they have worked.
<P>
Let us have an affirmative resolution. By establishing the precedent that pilot schemes should be automatically considered by us, we might become more co-operative. An affirmative resolution would allow the schemes to be given full consideration. After all, I recall the Labour party demanding affirmative resolutions in the House and, before I was a Member of Parliament, on ``Yesterday in Parliament''.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford, who is an experienced and senior Member of Parliament, and you, Mr. Malins, would agree that the Labour party made a great deal of sense. But it is shying away from an opportunity to do what it said it would do.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Rosemary McKenna </B>(Cumbernauld and Kilsyth): Is the hon. Gentleman joining the Scottish Conservatives who last week apologised to the people of Scotland for their conduct over the past 18 years?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We are straying widely from a narrow amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I should have thought from my appearances before the Committee that I am a byword for sackcloth and ashes in my humble rectitude for anything that I did or may do.
<P>
Why is the party that promised radical reassertion of people's rights shying away from doing that? My hon. Friend might see the dark hand of Mr. Alistair Campbell, but I would not agree. I believe that this is about administration and civil servants like Sir Humphrey; it is about radical politicians being held back by their officials. It is time to stand up to them and show who the masters are in this building. Let us have consensus. Let us stretch our hands across the Committee and embrace each other by voting for an affirmative resolution.

<P>

<B>Mr. Andrew Smith:</B> The sackcloth and ashes-clad figure of the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar is a seductive and persuasive image, but I shall not be seduced by his argument. As he said, this is a well-trodden course, and we responded fully to his hon. Friends who made the case in previous debates. We have no need unnecessarily to repeat the same arguments. I understand and support the desire of hon. Members to ensure proper parliamentary scrutiny of the regulations. There will be ample opportunity to pray against them under the negative resolution procedure. That will allow hon. Members to debate them in full. I know that Opposition Members will examine the programme's progress with the same vigilance and care as we promised when we proposed it. That vigilance and the ability to pray against regulations using the negative procedure offer the safeguards that the hon. Gentleman is seeking. To state, as a blanket requirement, that the affirmative resolution procedure should always be used would be a needless waste of parliamentary time. We resist the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> This is terrible. It reminds me of the last page of ``Animal Farm''. We know what the bureaucrats will do. The proposal is terrible.

<P>
The Minister said that we shall subject the measures to careful scrutiny, and we shall do so. However, early in this Session of Parliament, I prayed against a piece of legislation. Two weeks before it went into Committee, I was castigated by the Secretary of State, who said, ``The Tories are praying against the jobseeker's allowance. What a disgrace!'' However, that is the only procedure that is available to us.
<P>
In this context, we cannot always co-operate or work towards a consensus; in our efforts to scrutinise, we also need to consider being divisive. During his lunchtime discussions, I am sure that the Minister said how marvellous it was to have an all-party consensus. However, my hon. Friends and I, or our successors in title, will have to pray against the measures not because we disagree with them but because we want to scrutinise them and to hear the Government's justification for them.
<P>
The Minister should think again. He could have sought a consensus in this context, and we should have obliged him. My hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough is by nature a zealot, but he is full of the need for consensus. To bring a note of divisiveness into the Committee, I shall, regretfully, press the amendment to a vote.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`; and (c) the laying before Parliament of an annual report stating the number of claimants applying for and in receipt of each benefit listed in subsection (2) below during the preceding year.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Although there was considerable disagreement over amendment No. 246, there is no reason why this amendment should not be acceptable. We want the suggestion that the pilot schemes will work to be demonstrated to us. I hope that they will work, and that they do so quickly. One of the best tests, but not the only one, is to find out how many people claim the benefits and how many no longer do so. I tend to agree with the suggestion, which we heard earlier, that we should try to get the best out of people. They should move from benefits into work, participate in society and realise their full potential. As was noted during consideration of amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Newbury, the pilot schemes will impose considerable expense on local authorities. That expense will probably prove to be a price worth paying, but we will need to know whether the schemes are successful. The amendment would provide us with that information.
<P>
During an earlier debate, the Minister referred to the careful way in which interviews will be established and monitored against various criteria. He said that targets will be set and a mission statement made regarding the number of interviews to be conducted. Those interviews should not simply tick off people; they should be subject to quality control to ensure that they get the very best from people. We see such basic management techniques in government at a managerial level and we certainly see them in the private sector. If it is good enough for those who must deliver, it should be good enough for those&#151;the Government&#151;who must take ultimate responsibility for the provision.
<P>
I see no reason why an annual report should not be laid before Parliament. That would be sensible not only in respect of private schemes but in a more general sense. Parliament should take greater responsibility for the monitoring of such schemes, which go beyond the remit of a Select Committee. By their nature, Select Committees are busy animals, although I am sure that they will scrutinise the pilots thoroughly. Nevertheless, a report of such magnitude should be laid before Parliament.
<P>
The Government said that the provision marks a radical departure, and it is certainly a departure as far as pilot schemes are concerned. However, before they can successfully entice me into their Lobby&#151;in this case, I could be seduced&#151;I need to have adequate information on what I am being asked to vote for. I can see no objection to my basic and simple request for an annual report that would examine each category of benefit and show how many people have taken up benefit and how many have left the system. Such information would raise various questions, such as whether people have been forced off benefits or got lost in the system.
<P>
We want to see a smooth transition through the gateway. If the system is a success, I have no doubt that the House will deservedly lionise the Minister and I shall be the first to praise him for his marvellous work. However, unless we are given this basic information, he will not be lionised.
<P>
Parliament has allowed the controlling of legislation to slip through its grasp, and now is the time to reassert its ability to establish whether legislation has proved successful. Spin doctors come and go, but the success of the provision will depend on whether people on benefit manage to find worthwhile jobs. The best way to assess that success is through an annual report submitted to Parliament.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Smith:</B> I agreed with nearly everything that the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles) said, and not merely what he said about lionising me in the future, even though that is a gratifying prospect.
<P>
The amendment is redundant because the information that it requests will be made available. The number of recipients of such benefits is already published on a national basis and it is available to hon. Members from the Library.
<P>
Our proposals go beyond those in the amendment. The single gateway will be subject to a thorough evaluation, which will entail the collection not only of the information sought by the amendment but of a whole range of other information that is crucial in evaluating whether the gateway improves the extent of local labour market participation, whether it provides claimants with a more efficient service and whether it is better tailored to their personal needs.
<P>
Information such as the number of people who obtain jobs in gateway areas and claimant's views on the service that they have received will be collected and published. Data on all the key stages of the new process, including the numbers taking part in the work-focused interviews, the numbers having interviews deferred and the number of referrals to specialist help, will be collected on an on-going basis.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
That goes beyond what the hon. Gentleman and his colleagues seek. Information will be openly available, and the evaluation will be shared. The amendment is unnecessary and unduly restrictive, and I urge the Committee to reject it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> The journey to lionisation starts with a single step, and the Minister may have started that journey. He need only satisfy me on a couple of points, and then we can move on. When does the Minister intend to publish? I do not require the dates&#151;I want to know how publishing dates will be triggered.
<P>
<B>Mr. Smith:</B> Early qualitative findings on non-compulsory pilots will be available internally at the end of 1999, and the two variants&#151;the call centre pilots and the private-voluntary sector pilots&#151;will be available by the summer of 2000. The key information will be made available as soon as possible thereafter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> Would it be right to say that publication will occur in the summer of 2000? Alternatively, will the preliminary findings&#151;which he said would be available at the end of 1999&#151;be published?
<P>
<B>Mr. Smith:</B> I was referring to early qualitative findings, and I mentioned the end of 1999 and the summer of 2000. I said that publication would happen as soon as is feasible thereafter. Quantitative information will also be published as it becomes available. The outcomes of the evaluation will also be made available; final reports on the evaluation will not be available until 2002, as some of the pilots are scheduled to run until then.
<P>
I want to assure the hon. Gentleman, other interested parties and the general public that the information will be openly available as soon as it is possible to provide such information in a reliable form.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> To make this absolutely clear, the Minister is saying that there will be great openness in the way in which the information is published. He will not wait for final conclusions&#151;as information becomes available, it will be produced. He will ensure that parliamentary questions are answered promptly and that information&#151;even when it cannot be provided in complete form&#151;will be provided.

<B>Mr. Smith:</B> My only proviso is that I would not want to publish information that is misleading because it is incomplete. We will publish information as soon as it is possible to do so with reliability. The hon. Gentleman and the general public would not be well served by unreliable information. When information becomes available to us, we shall make it available to others as soon as we can.ChrisMr. Pickles: The hon. Gentleman has satisfied me completely.

<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 78, in page 44, line 31, at end insert&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(1A) A work focus interview for a person receiving or applying for or having applied for incapacity benefit, severe disablement allowance, or disability premia in income support shall only take place once the personal capability assessment provided for in section 56 below has been made.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There is a misprint on the amendment paper. The reference in the amendment to ``section 56'' should, of course, be ``section 50''. My handwriting may have caused the printer to make an understandable error, or it may have arisen elsewhere in the system.
<P>
The amendment is important for disabled people who are confronting the new regime requiring them to attend work-focused interviews. If a work-focused interview takes place before assessment for disability benefit, whether incapacity benefit, severe disability allowance or the disability premia in income support, and if it is not clear whether the disabled person will qualify for one or more of those benefits, the work-focused interview will inevitably take on the character of a dress rehearsal or preliminary examination for the personal capability assessment, albeit that the assessment will, I hope, be carried out by people with a medical background&#151;we shall discuss that later&#151; and the work-focused interview will not. If there is any uncertainty about the claimant's status, he or she will be uneasy and guarded lest anything that is said is taken down and used in evidence against the claim for benefit.
<P>
The purpose of the amendment is to separate the two issues of eligibility for benefit and the work-focused interview. If the person concerned does not attend an interview, there may be subsequent sanctions, but the benefit status of the claimant should be clearly and unambiguously established before the work-focused interview takes place. That goes to the core of an objective that we share with the Government: that there should be a new culture&#151;the Minister likes that word&#151;in which the role of the interviewer is, above all, to be helpful to the applicant. The relationship between the applicant and the interviewer should be not antagonistic but co-operative so that the applicant is relaxed and can be as frank as possible about his or her experience, capabilities, aspirations and so on. That is my perception of how the interviews should be conducted. Otherwise they will be of no use and it would be a mockery to describe them as an advantage or a boost for those who have been excluded, often unjustly and unreasonably, from the world of work. If the benefit status is not established in advance of the work-focused interview, the interview will be regarded as part of the process of deciding eligibility for benefit.
<P>
The Minister may be about to tell me that, in practice, the personal capability assessment will come first and only when people are on the register of the Benefits Agency and receiving benefit will they be called for interview. That is fine, but I shall then ask him further questions and I can anticipate the dialogue that will take up even more of the Committee's time. Why cannot that assurance be written into the Bill? Perhaps the Minister can give us an assurance now, so that it is in Hansard. I have always said that we accept cheques of that kind from the Government.
<P>
We are being positive today under the new Labour Administration and we are very trusting. If the right hon. Gentleman gives us an oral commitment, we can rely on it, but we do not want to leave the point unexplored. The matter is not clear from the Bill, nor from the explanatory notes. A work-focused interview could be conducted before a personal capability assessment has taken place.
<P>
Such assessments must be carried out by doctors, and should then be followed by work-focused interviews. That could mean weeks or even months into the period for which someone claims benefit. It is absurd to suggest that an applicant can go into a benefits office to claim benefit and be given a work-focused interview on the spot by someone who is sitting in front of a computer screen to register the claimant's name and details. That would be a mockery of a work-focused interview, which should be properly prepared and conducted by trained people who have done some homework before meeting applicants. They should have the facts and figures in front of them, as well as the personal capability assessment, which should have been prepared in advance and made available to them. The interviewer would then avoid the risk of proposing all sorts of jobs and activities for the applicant that are inappropriate&#151;and obviously so&#151;when the interviewer reads the personal capability assessment.
<P>
That is our concept of how the system should work. If the Government share that concept, I hope that they will accept the need to include that explicit protection in the Bill, or give us an equivalent oral assurance.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Smith:</B> While I understand why the hon. Gentleman is pressing the point, there is a straightforward difference between us. I cannot give him the assurance that he seeks, nor would it be right to do so.
<P>
In many instances, the personal capability assessment and its outcome will be material to the full range of advice that should be given to someone during an interview, but as we discussed earlier, the personal capability assessment is one of the trigger points for repeat interviews. I acknowledge the force of the hon. Gentleman's argument that that assessment will contain relevant information to inform the judgment of someone's ability. However, that is not always the case. I do not believe that it would be inappropriate for someone to have a work-focused interview in advance of a personal capability assessment.
<P>
The two procedures are related and it is proper for the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford to explore the relationship between clauses 47 adn 50. The personal capability assessment is a medical matter, while the work-focused interview ranges more widely over other barriers to employment, covering such matters as experience, skills, training needs, motivation, and so on. Those matters should be discussed as early as possible&#151;possibly at the outset of the claim&#151;and should not have to await the personal capability assessment, as the amendment suggests. Of course, we recognise the fact that an immediate interview will not be appropriate for many people&#151;perhaps they are recovering from a major operation or suffering from an acute illness. Those factors would of themselves be good reasons to defer the interview.
<P>
It would be unduly mechanistic and prescriptive to state that the groups of claimants listed in the amendment should not have to attend a work-focused interview until a personal capability assessment had been made. In general, the earlier people can avail themselves of the help available through the single work-focused gateway interviews the better.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> I am afraid that that is not a satisfactory response to the points that I have made. All that the Minister has done is tell us what we knew already. Frankly, that is rather platitudinous at this stage. He has told us that the two processes&#151;the personal capability assessment and the work-focused interview&#151;are separate but related. However, the Government refuse to tell us how the processes are related. Without a clear definition of the relationship between them, there will be a muddle. The Government's mind is already muddled&#151;not a promising basis on which to proceed with personal capability assessment and work-focused interview regime.
<P>
The relationship between the two processes should be absolutely clear to everyone in the system. It should be clear to the applicants and, therefore, the public&#151;none of us knows whether, through misfortune or otherwise, he or she may be an applicant&#151;importantly, it should be clear to Benefits Agency and Employment Service officials, staff and, of course, any of their sub-contractors, whether voluntary or from the private sector; and it should be absolutely clear to Parliament.
<P>
I continue to hold the view&#151;indeed, it has been strengthened by the slightly shambolic way in which the Minister has answered my questions&#151;that the relationship between the two processes should be quite clear and that the personal capability assessment should be a prerequisite for a proper work-focused interview. It is absolutely crazy to have a work-focused interview before the capability assessment has been made, especially as public money will be spent on carrying out that assessment.
<P>
A professional assessment of what someone is capable of doing is an essential element in any discussion of what he or she can do, or might think of doing, whether by way of work, training, voluntary activity or whatever. What someone thinks he or she is capable of doing is not enough; sometimes people must be lifted out of the psychological rut into which they have fallen as a result of being left aside by the system that paid them money but took no further interest in them. I thought that the purpose of the proposal was to lift people out of that rut.
<P>
It is important to take a different look at what someone might be capable of doing. The Government keep telling us that the purpose of the personal capability assessment under clause 50 is not just to take a negative look at what someone cannot do, but to take a positive look at what he or she might be able to do. The Government propose to spend public money&#151;doctors do not come cheap&#151;on carrying out personal capability assessments. However, much of the value of doing so&#151;to help someone take a new look at what he or she might be capable of doing&#151;will be thrown away because the work-focused interview will have already taken place.
<P>
Another work-focused interview must take place after the personal capability assessment if new lines of opportunity are opened. The Government will have wasted the taxpayer's money by having two work-focused interviews rather than one, and will have tried the patience of the claimant. If the claimant is disabled the stress of the interview may be greater than for someone with no incapacity or disability.
<P>
The policy is a shambles. I am sorry that we have come to this point&#151;until now, there has been considerable consensus between the Government and Conservative Members on the clause. I am making my points as clearly as I can, but the Government are not prepared to accept them, so I am afraid that we must enshrine our opposition to the Government's lack of clear thinking and lack of a clear sense of what the relationship should be between the two processes by pressing the amendment to a Division.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 248, in page 44, line 41, at end insert `and (h) disability living allowance'.
<P>
My question is straightforward and simple: why is disability living allowance not included in the list?
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Smith:</B> The answer is, because it is not an income replacement benefit.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> Will the Minister elaborate on that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Smith:</B> Yes, I will. The disability living allowance is designed to provide for the additional care and/or mobility needs of people who are sick or disabled. It is not an income replacement benefit, by which I mean that it is not intended as a replacement for earned income. Therefore, neither entitlement to the benefit nor the amount paid is affected by whether the claimant is in work. There is therefore no need for disability living allowance to be included in the list of benefits for which a work-focused interview is compulsory.
<P>
In fact, a proportion of disability living allowance claimants are already in employment, so the services of the single gateway would not be relevant or appropriate for them. The vast majority&#151;more than 90 per cent.&#151;of claimants who are not in work will be required to go through the single gateway and participate in the work-focused interview anyway, because they are claimants of other benefits, primarily incapacity benefit and income support. If they fail to take part in a work-focused interview, any sanction imposed would not affect their disability living allowance payment.
<P>
Very few people of working age are out of work and claiming disability living allowance only. Such claimants could continue to make their claims directly to the regional disability living allowance centre. However, if they want to make a claim via the single gateway, have a personal adviser and attend interviews voluntarily, they can do so. Indeed, I hope that many will take that opportunity. I trust that that explains adequately why disability living allowance is not included in the mandatory list.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> That was very clear and straightforward. I do not regret tabling the amendment, because that explanation was so excellent. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 249, in page 44, line 42, leave out `may' and insert `shall'.
<P>
Again, my question is straightforward, and relates to whether we should use the word ``may'', or whether matters should be made a duty. Regulations made under the clause may make various provisions for securing whether a person will be required to take part in interviews and for matters specified in paragraphs (b) to (f), and may confer powers on various folks. If we are to go through the process of making such regulations, I cannot see why it is necessary to state only that they ``may'' cover such matters. I should have thought it was extremely necessary to put them in. It is important that we should tie the Government and their discretion down. They have laid down the general guidelines. After the word ``shall'' in our amendment, the Bill would say ``in particular'', so it would not rule out additions to the list of provisions. If the list is to be the core, our wording is more satisfying.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Smith:</B> I am surprised at the amendment, which would require further regulations to be made. We have made it clear in our speeches and explanatory notes to the Bill how we propose to operate the provisions. As I understand it, there is a clear convention in legislation that the Secretary of State is normally permitted rather than required to do something, which is why the clause is phrased in that way. I do not see any overriding reasons to go against the convention and in this case place a definitive obligation on the Secretary of State, especially given the need to retain some flexibility to adapt our arrangements if the experience of the pilots requires it. A few moments ago, the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar was advocating precisely that sort of flexibility and responsiveness.
<P>
There is no need to impose an obligation on the Secretary of State. Clearly, we will introduce the regulations necessary to operate the single work-focused gateway consistently with how it is set out in the Bill, with what we have said in the explanatory notes and speeches, and, most importantly, with the way that is necessary to ensure an effective and sensitive service to clients.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Rendel (Newbury):</B> I may have missed something, but it sounded as though the Minister was saying that it he were compelled to make regulations now, he could not make further regulations following the pilot schemes to take account of what had happened in them. Have I misunderstood that? It sounded a bit odd.
<P>
<B>Mr. Smith:</B> The only point that I was making was that, in line with convention, the Bill states that the Secretary of State should be able to introduce regulations. Of course, it would be possible&#151;the amendment is trying to do this&#151;to say that the Secretary of State shall introduce such other regulations as may be necessary. I suggest that it is simpler and more efficient to say that he may introduce the regulations and set out what sort of regulations those would be. The list does not pretend to be exhaustive, so in that sense the point that the hon. Member for Newbury makes is already catered for.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I do not think that the Minister's comments were entirely satisfying, which is unlike him, as he has been straightforward in our debates.
<P>
The regulations in paragraphs (a) to (f) are the barest bones. To miss some of them out could cause injustice and inequality for the person seeking to make the various claims. I see no reason why our amendment is not acceptable. Merely because something has always been done and prescribed for does not mean that it should always be so. The regulations are to protect the rights of individuals. Given the hour and the fact that we are about to come to an important amendment, I would not seek to press the amendment to a division. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 80, in page 45, line 4, at end insert&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) for determining the training to be provided to persons by whom interviews are to be conducted which shall include training in the principles of personnel management and job placement, and in the types and incidence of mental and physical disability and in recent developments in coping with them.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This is the amendment to which I referred earlier, which would provide for proper training for personnel involved in the job-focused interviews. If proper training is not provided and, instead of professional interviewers with a serious approach and commitment to the subject, we have Benefits Agency, local government or Employment Service employees who have been stuffing envelopes, to whom someone says, ``We've got a bit of backlog of interviews, you'd better come and conduct some'', the operation will prove not merely shambolic but a rather cruel charade. We want to avoid that happening if we possibly can. The response that I got from the Minister to amendment No. 78 made me&#151;for the first time&#151;seriously worried about whether a serious attempt will be made to deliver on the rhetoric. As so often, the new Labour rhetoric is rather appealing and we share many of the principles that have been enunciated. We must be persuaded that proper preparation has been undertaken and that people will know what they are doing when they conduct the interviews.
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I think that we have all heard many anecdotal examples of the way in which some of those who staff jobcentres are woefully unaware of aspects of the job market, sending people to firms where the jobs are inappropriate to their qualifications and so forth. All the organisations involved in disability have their own store of rather sad anecdotes of people being asked inappropriate questions. The Royal Association for Disability and Rehabilitation told me a story about someone who had lost his legs in amputation and was asked in the Benefits Agency or the jobcentre whether they would grow again, not out of deliberate cruelty but of complete clumsiness and ignorance.
<P>
It is not true that this Government or the previous Government have always succeeded in recruiting the most switched-on personnel to some of those jobs. It is important that the work-focused interview is a function that will be taken extremely seriously.
<P>
I received through the post, as I think every member of the Committee probably has, a note from the Disability Benefits Consortium stating:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The DBC welcomes this amendment which probes the Government on arrangements for the training of personal advisers.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I have become so envious of Ministers in Committee who read out well-drafted notes that they are provided by their Departments. With your sense and forbearance, Mr. Malins, I am going to enjoy&#151;I may do it only once more in the course of our proceedings&#151;the sensation of reading something out. Therefore, I shall inflict on the Committee what is an extremely good summary of the position. I could not have put it better myself and I am certainly not so well informed on such matters and do not have the range of experience of those who drafted the note. I shall read this for the help of the whole Committee. The note continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Government has expressed the view that interviews will provide a service to claimants as well as fulfil a statutory requirement. The Government's consultation, `Support for Disabled People' . . . expresses the following aim: `Our priority is to forge an entirely new culture which puts work first and is based on a modern, integrated flexible service for all. This means a fundamental shift in the way we support people&#151;away from merely asking ``what money can we pay you?'' to ``how can we help you become more independent?'''''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We thoroughly agree with that piece of new Labour rhetoric.
<P>
The note goes on:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``There has been little detail so far&#151;'' indeed there has, and some of it has been inadequate&#151;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``on the implementation of the personal adviser scheme, the DBC is concerned that the process will either stand or fall on the basis of the quality of training of personal advisers.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
So the DBC thoroughly endorses our concern.
<P>
The note continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Personal advisers will have contact with a large number of claimants. Some claimants such as wheelchair users will have disabilities which are apparent, but others such as those with mental health problems or those suffering from chronic pain or fatigue may be more difficult cases to assess in terms of suitable employment opportunities or benefits. It is vital that all personal adviser interviews are conducted professionally and sensitively. This will require thorough disability awareness training which covers learning disabilities and mental illness as well as physical disabilities. There should be opportunities for on-going training and development of personal advisers. It is not sufficient for advisers to have nothing more than a brief induction session. The DBC would welcome clarification over the Government's view of voluntary sector involvement in the delivery of specialist disability awareness training for personal advisers.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> The DBC wants to ensure that personal advisers are given realistic work targets which will enable them to manage and deliver individualised support to claimants. One of the difficulties with the Benefits Integrity Project was that adjudication officers had target completion rates of 15 cases per day. This did not give staff enough time to make thorough assessments of the information available to them, with disastrous consequences for disabled people. It is essential that personal advisers are able to devote as much or as little time as is needed for interviews. For example, a personal adviser will need more time to complete an interview with a claimant with a learning disability because it may take longer to explain the information and take longer for the claimant to understand complex benefit issues. However the claimant's concentration may be poor over long periods of time and therefore it may be necessary to conduct two short interviews rather than one lengthy one''&#151;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
an extremely good point.
<P>
The DBC continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Personal advisers should be trained to consult the claimant in advance of the interview and make necessary preparations. A claimant with a mental health problem may know that they would find it impossible to assimilate information or even get to an interview early in the day because of the effects of depression or of medication. Personal advisers should be trained to offer claimants flexibility in interview arrangements.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The DBC is beginning to know the Government; it knows that they are a pretty slippery lot and that they will find an excuse to avoid doing things for which a manifestly good case has been made. It refers to possible arguments against the amendment. It suggests that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Government might indicate that training of personal advisers will form part of a wider implementation strategy which will be finalised once the pilot schemes have been completed and have been evaluated.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That means that the DBC expects that the Government will put us off by saying, ``Wait and see what happens after the pilot schemes.''
<P>
I trust that we shall have an opportunity to discuss the pilot schemes when we debate the clause as a whole. There have been endless references to them, but we have not been able to debate them and the Government's publications on the subject contain some contradictory material. I shall not trespass on that point now.
<P>
The DBC has given an expert, experienced analysis of the dangers that might befall the application of work-focused interviews to disabled people. It is important that the advisers are not merely trained to deal with the specifics of different claimants, especially those with particular difficulties of disability or otherwise. It is also important that they are trained in the demand side&#151;the job market&#151;and that they know how it works. That personnel function, which is established in the profession, requires a considerable background and experience.
<P>
It is important that anyone who acts as an adviser is given thorough training in the placement function, in how to conduct interviews, in what the job market is like, in which sectors of activity are producing increasing demand for jobs and on what the prospects are for employing people with disabilities in different industries or different service organisations. Those are serious matters. If the job is done properly, those advisers could have an enormous impact on the lives of the people whom they interview. If it is not done properly it will be, at best, a waste of public money and, at worst, job advisers will damage individuals by giving them the wrong advice and pointing them in the wrong direction. It is all too easy to see how incompetent people who start advising others on how to approach the job market could do a lot of damage. Would you or I feel comfortable, Mr. Malins, if we were told that tomorrow we had to interview a dozen unemployed people, some of whom are single mothers, disabled people, or whatever category they may fall into, who are benefit claimants, and that we have to advise them on what they might do? Every member of the Committee should consider how they would feel. Of course, we would be terrified by that responsibility. We would be extremely concerned about missing some obvious line of approach that professionals would take. Equally, we would be worried about sending people barking up the wrong tree or down the wrong course, which would be equally regrettable.
<P>
It is not a matter that should be taken up by amateurs or a role that should be performed by people who have been reallocated within the Benefits Agency or the Employment Service from other functions in local government&#151;I say that with all due respect to my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar, the former leader of Bradford council. It is a professional job and needs people who have the training and commitment to the function that they are performing and delivering.
<P>
Until now, the Government have given no indication that they are tackling the problem with the seriousness that it requires. They have given us all the Alastair Campbell declarations, but we want the meat. We want to know the details of the work that is being done.
<P>
I watched your face carefully, Mr. Malins, when I referred earlier to a clause stand part debate. It would be enormously helpful if we could have some hint of how your mind is moving on that issue. The Minister may say that he understands the importance of what I am saying, but that it depends on what comes out of the pilots, when the Government will know how best to conduct the interviews and how the whole thing should be organised. I have further follow-up questions in response to those remarks, but I do not know whether I can properly raise them now in relation to training or in the wider context of a clause stand part debate.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am listening to the debates with the greatest interest, but I have not formulated my final view about clause stand part.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tom Levitt </B>(High Peak): I may be lucky enough to catch your eye, Mr. Malins, to expand on this in a few moments. I should like the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford to pay a visit to Sheffield to the disability services department within the Employment Service and suggest to the people involved that the Government are doing nothing to prepare for greater disability awareness. He will find a different answer to the one that he suggests.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I am delighted to hear that, but let us not merely have vague generalisations or anecdotal evidence. We want precise details about the sort of training programmes that the Government have in mind. What subjects will be covered? How long will they take? Who will deliver them? Alternatively, will the Government take on, through subcontracting or otherwise from the voluntary or private sectors, teams of people who are capable of delivering the interviews? If so, where will the interviewers come from? Will there be tests of capability for interviewers? Will there be a professional examination or assessment? What will be the scope for retraining? What arrangements are in place for monitoring the interviews? Will they be done randomly or videoed, so that people can judge whether it is a serious placement interview that will help the individual, or a footling waste of time?
<P>
Will the interview simply be someone checking his computer screen or pages of a form, ticking boxes, and feeling that he has earned his salary by doing only that? That will be not only a waste of public money, but a cruel deception of the public.
<P>
We had better discover now, in the course of our proceedings, what is most likely to emerge. It is up to the Government to persuade us that they have done their homework and planning, and that there is a prospect of work-focused interviews delivering the benefits that have been proclaimed for them. If they can be secured, no one will be more delighted than Conservative Members. I may need to catch your eye later, Mr. Malins, before we have exhausted the debate, because it is an important subject. However, in the hope that we shall receive some concrete answers from the Minister, I shall resume my seat in anticipation.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Levitt:</B> It is a pleasure to agree with the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford whenever I get the opportunity. As an active member of the Future of Europe Trust, and a fellow member of the Standards and Privileges Committee for a year and a half, we have agreed on many occasions. With the one exception to which I have already referred, and one more to which I shall return, which is rather fundamental, not one person in the Room will disagree with what he has just said.
<P>
A high quality of disability awareness training is absolutely essential for personal advisers. I speak as someone who worked as a disability awareness trainer&#151;indeed, I wrote the only book on deaf awareness training&#151;before I came to this place. Leeds city council, for example, spends three days with each of its front-line staff, dealing with deaf awareness training only. That may be slightly over the top in terms of the amount of time required if the same is to apply for blindness, other aspects of disability and learning impairment. Nevertheless, it is symptomatic of the acceptance within the field of disability awareness, in which more and more trainers are active&#151;perhaps working to different standards and for different purposes&#151;that any amount of training will ultimately be a bit of a compromise, but good training is important.
<P>
I do not support the amendment, however. I do not draw the conclusion of the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford that it is necessary, for several reasons. First, it seems to omit six million people with sensory impairments, by referring only to mental and physical disabilities. Secondly, it contains an inherent assumption that such training would not necessarily be provided for already. The Employment Service in Sheffield does an excellent job in that respect. Thirdly, the amendment does not include training of personal advisers in the benefit system. That is not mentioned in the amendment, but surely it is at the heart of the maxim, ``Work for those who can, security for those who cannot''.
<P>
The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford made an important point about the quality of training and testing capability. It is fair to say that, by and large, nationally agreed training standards do not apply in disability awareness training. Work is being done in deaf awareness training, in which national vocational qualifications are now available. I am proud to say that some of my work has helped in the development of those qualifications over the years. However, they are not widely accepted or available as standards and benchmarks for such training. I am sure that my right hon. Friend the Minister will want to tackle that in future. I regard the amendment as slightly flawed and wholly unnecessary in fulfilling the commitments that the Government are making to a high-quality service with a definite purpose and to fulfilling that purpose.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I support my hon. Friend's amendment. The regulations for training should state that a full knowledge of benefit and social security law is required. Advisers also need to know about disability and the job market and they should be familiar with what I call the head hunter role, which involves the placement of people. The Government's proposal will not work unless advisers have the requisite skills and competence.
<P>
The regulations should state that appropriate training is required. The role of a financial adviser in the financial services sector serves as an analogy. Regulations require financial advisers to have skilled training and regular re-training in the area in which they give advice, and their training has to be monitored. If a person does not comply with those requirements, he can be fined and may no longer be employed in his job. Personal advisers will deal with people who really heed help&#151;the many people who go to financial advisers are capable of looking after their own affairs and they go to an adviser simply to pick his brains. Personal advisers should be as professional and competent as advisers in the financial services sector. What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. There is no reason why the state should not be legally required to specify the training, retraining and monitoring that will be required&#151;the private sector does so in the financial services sector.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford rightly said that it is not clear where the advisers will come from. To what extent will arrangements be sub-contracted to the private sector? Will voluntary, state and private bodies be involved? The fact that outside parties will be involved means that contractually it will be necessary to specify in regulations the training that is required. A stated good intention is not good enough, although I do not dispute that there will be a spelendid training organisation in Sheffield. In the private sector, it would be completely unprofessional simply to have a stated good intention.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jonathan Shaw </B>(Chatham and Aylesford): Does the hon. Gentleman agree that one of the difficulties with including requirements for training in the Bill, as the amendment would do, is that there are many local variations between our constituencies? Training will involve establishing what is available locally. To deal with the matter nationally would be an impossible task.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> That is what the regulations will do. The Bill states that there will be regulations about the traning that is needed. It should not go into detail, but there should be a formal requirement in the primary legislation for professional training and retraining. Candidly, in 1999 it is unprofessional to leave the matter to the good intent of the Government. It has long been accepted that it is inadequate to leave such matters to the good intent of the private sector, so why is it adequate in relation to the state sector? I concede that the amendment could be changed&#151;it could be more general or more inclusive&#151;but the principle of specifying in the Bill the training that is required is sound and right.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I agree with everything that has been said. The Government should tell us about the training that is appropriate for personal advisers. I am sure that the Minister will reassure us that everyone will be trained&#151;
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Smith indicated assent.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I am delighted to get that confirmation. Indeed, the advisers at my Employment Service told me how pleased they were with their extra training on the new deal. However, it is abundantly clear that what amounts to almost a list of training requirements needs to be put on the record. We debated an amendment that concentrated on professional job placement training and the broad issues of mental and physical disability. The hon. Member for High Peak (Mr. Levitt) added sensory disabilities to those categories and Opposition Members would agree with him. My hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs added his requirements and I intend to add mine.
<P>
The Minister has not reassured me. I am worried about what may have been a throwaway remark. He mentioned the people friendly nature of the interviews. That is fine. As my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford said, we want people to be relaxed in the interview because that will allow them to do their very best. The Minister implied that it may not be a paper-based interview; it could be computer based. Whatever the format, it needs to be a record-based interview. If there is no agreed record of what was discussed, there will be a great deal of confusion about what was said.
<P>
The hon. Member for Newbury will know from his wife's experience&#151;I certainly know this from my experience of the health service&#151;that only about 5 per cent. of what a doctor tells a patient is registered the first time that it is said. If a claimant who does not have the distress that is caused by mental illness is able to register only 10 per cent. of what he is told the first time, 90 per cent. is not registered. The misunderstandings could be enormous, even on the straight ins and outs of what claimants need to do to obtain further training.
<P>
I should like the Minister to reassure me on the structure and format of the interview and how the theory is working. I realise that a purpose of the pilots is to ensure that all issues are covered. I strongly suggest that there needs to be a record, especially if a dispute goes through the appeal system. The Minister gave the impression that the interview could be used in evidence in an appeal against a decision on benefits or recommendations for training.
<P>
I also want to be clear about the interation between the special advisers and other agencies. I do not have much problem with the Benefits Agency. The two bodies are both arms of central Government and I am sure that a communication system can be worked out, although, given my surgery and post-bag cases, I am not entirely convinced of that. The personal adviser, who may be responsible for liaising between health authorities, new primary care goups and social services on behalf of someone who is mentally ill, could tell a claimant in an interview that it is necessary to provide further services. Where would the responsibility for that recommdation lie? We all know that local authorities are strapped for cash. If the recommendation is that social services should provide something, social services could well have considered this and, in the light of the budget and the Government constraints under which they have to work, decided that they cannot, on the balance of probability, provide it.
<H4><center>[Mr. John McWilliam in the Chair.]</center></H4>
<P>
That will be brought into even starker contrast when the primary care groups that were being debated today have to deal with health care recommendations from the personal advisers. The primary care groups have their overall budgets, and the health authorities are in enough trouble with extra contractual referrals and the consequent overspending, without the primary care groups being called into a system on which they are not yet focused, while they are still trying to work out how it will operate.
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
It is not just a question of a direct relationship with a GP; the primary care group, not the GP, will decide whether it can afford that expenditure. I would like considerably more reasurrance on the level of training, and the degree of responsibility that a personal adviser will have in this area. Will he just say to the claimant, ``I will phone them, and tell them to get in touch with you,'' or will he say that he will contact social services, the primary care group, the GP or whomever, and that they will then get in touch with the claimant? How is that expected to work? I can see enormous confusion arising unless the personal advisers and the organisations with which they have to interact are very well trained.
<P>
That brings me to the level of responsibility that the Government envisage personal advisers assuming. When I worked in the civil service, the level in question was that of an executive officer. I cannot remember what the different levels are now, as we go through grades 1 to 8. It is a bit like trying to remember what year children are in at school; I cannot get past primary 7 and secondary 1 to 6. I cannot, therefore, draw a precise parallel, but we need to know what level of responsibility and remuneration personal advisers will take. If the Government accept our recommendations for the need for training, it will be a very special person who will take on that job. I would not suggest that they will come cheap. What, then, would the budget be? Have the Government set aside sufficient money to ensure that those people will be capable of doing the job properly, and will be properly rewarded? If not, there will be a great shortage and the whole policy will collapse messily and unhappily.
<P>
I would be grateful if I could be reassured on all the points that I have made, but most of those who have spoken so far wish to be reassured that our requests will be met, rather than to embarrass the Government by suggesting that they have no intention of doing so.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> Thank you, Mr. McWilliam, and may I welcome you back to the Committee?
<P>
I am delighted to support the amendment in general terms, especially because the Government have made it clear that they wish the personal adviser system&#151;the single gateway&#151;to work well in favour of the claimant, as well as simply by getting people back to work. If the system is to work well, and if people are to approve of it and support it, and be willing to go for their interviews without the compulsion that the Government seem to wish to avoid as far as possible, the personal advisers will have to be highly skilled, highly trained and very knowledgeable&#151;possibly more so than they are at present in some benefit offices. We have all heard of examples where things have gone badly wrong. We have only to examine what happened in the benefits integrity project and how many mistakes were made when people were reassessed for benefits that they had received previously to realise that it is important that personal advisers are highly skilled and do not make mistakes. Otherwise, the system will lose the respect of claimants and the public.
<P>
Training will be necessary, but one important aspect has not been mentioned. In reply to a recent parliamentary question the Government said that although personal advisers would receive training, it would not be specific to particular client groups. That worried me because the complexity of the benefits system is such that personal advisers will probably need detailed training to enable them to deal with particular client groups.
<P>
The point of the system is that personal advisers will be able to give advice, not just on what the claimant is claiming for, but other benefits, work opportunities, child care opportunities and so on. They will need wide-ranging skills and training. Most claimants will attend one interview with a particular claim for a particular benefit and perhaps have a particular form of disability, which will be known in advance from the form that is completed prior to the interview. It seems sensible that the personal adviser who is allocated to the claimant should have particular skills and training in the area that is likely to be of greatest sensitivity and importance to the claimant.
<P>
It worries me that personal advisers are apparently to be given only generalised training instead of training in specific subjects and benefit areas. I hope that the Government will assure us that the great complexity of the benefits system will be properly taken into account when the training is given.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> It is nice to see you back, Mr. McWilliam, and I hope that you had a pleasant Easter. You have arrived when the Committee is falling over itself to achieve consensus and my contribution will be in that tradition.
<P>
Many hon. Members have concentrated on disability. The amendment is wide ranging and covers the principles of personal management and job placement. I shall refer to that as well as to disabled people. I do not want to mix my metaphors, but personal advisers will be the gatekeepers of the gateway.
<P>
The Government should be warned that their good intentions matter not a jot because the success of the scheme will be determined by how good the personal advisers are. The pilot schemes will provide an opportunity to set out general guidelines on training, but the problem will be more daunting when the programme is implemented nationally. It is in the Government's interests, not necessarily to accept the amendment, but to accept our arguments. If that aspect is wrong, the whole programme will fall like a pack of cards. Getting the best out of people is not easy when they move from one discipline to another because they need experience and, more particularly, training. That will be a hallmark of personal advisers, but everyone is different. I had the opportunity of talking to some when I visited Southend before Christmas and I was impressed by the quality of the people engaged in that work. Most were volunteers&#151;some may have been volunteered&#151;and were highly skilled, keen and committed. I am sure that similar people will be attracted when local pilot schemes are introduced and, later, when the programme is introduced nationally. However, the risk is that quality will be diluted. We can keep the people that we train, to whom the hon. Member for Newbury referred, up to speed and strength by ensuring that they are trained to deal with specific needs.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford referred to the excellent document supplied by the Disability Benefits Consortium. I shall not repeat his arguments, but some indication should be given of the difficulties associated with people with hidden disabilities. It is pretty easy to spot a disabled person who uses a wheelchair or a crutch, or who is blind. As the hon. Member for High Peak said, it is less easy to spot a person who is deaf. Let us consider people with learning difficulties, or who find it difficult to communicate or who are dyslexic. Without specific training, such disabilities are difficult to diagnose or to take into consideration.
<H4><center>[Mr. Humfrey Malins in the Chair]</center></H4>
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham (Mrs. Lait) referred to people with mental health problems, so I shall say no more about that, other than to agree with the points that she made. However, there are other problems, such as the difficulty in distinguishing between a chronic fatigue sufferer and a shirker. Illnesses such as back pain or sciatica are difficult to diagnose or to take into consideration. A constituent of mine who suffers from severe sciatica is being pressured to return to work by her peer group at work, who clearly have little understanding of how painful sciatica can be.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham suggested that each of us might contribute to the process begun by my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford and which was continued by the hon. Member for High Peak. I would like to make such a contribution, based on personal experience and the principles of personnel management and job placement. My hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford referred to the fact that I was leader of Bradford city council some 10 years ago. On the basis of all-party consensus, we made a number of advances in the provision of services tailored to the needs of ethnic minorities. We were full of enthusiasm for our aims, but we came unstuck on matters such as the serving of inappropriate food by dinner ladies and the making of offensive remarks by interviewers.
<P>
With regard to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``the principles of personnel management and job placement''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
to which the amendment refers, we must have a clear idea of the needs of people of various ethnic backgrounds so that such people are put at ease. We must take account of the different ways in which people construct sentences and arrange arguments. In my time on Bradford city council, it was difficult to get across to personnel managers, as they were called in those days, that members of ethnic minorities who were born in Britain do not necessarily think like, act like, or share the same cultural values as their white neighbours who were born here. Getting the best out of people&#151;as the Minister so eloquently said&#151;requires great skill and a lot of training. That is why we are urging the Government, as they start the pilots, to devote more time to training to get it right. All Committee members received briefings from the National Centre for Volunteering, which has expressed concerns about the training, especially with regard to principles of personnel management and job placement. One of those concerns was how volunteers should be treated by the interviewer. The briefing states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Many jobseekers perceive that staff in Jobcentres and Benefit Offices are likely to `hassle' them over their voluntary work and stop their ISA and other benefits. They are not usually perceived as places where volunteering is encouraged.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is not right&#151;people on benefits should be encouraged to do voluntary work. I know from experience in my constituency and my time as a councillor that it provides all sorts of advantages. It increases self-esteem and gets people back into the routine of making a commitment to work&#151;
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman's speech is wide of the subject of debate. I hope that he will confine his remarks to the amendment and, in particular, to the subject of training.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I will indeed, Mr. Malins. The second and third lines of the amendment refer to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``the principles of personnel management and job placement''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am referring to volunteering in the context of those two strands, in relation to which training is often forgotten. The Minister will be aware that the issue was considered at a recent meeting between the Employment Service and the National Centre for Volunteering. It was felt that the Employment Service guidelines lacked clarity and flexibility, which led to inconsistent interpretation of the regulations. That is precisely what we would seek to avoid through conducting pilot schemes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> My hon. Friend might recall that during the Committee proceedings of 30 March, I asked my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford to consider page 75 of the explanatory notes, where the Government say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``an interview may be conducted by a person acting on behalf of the Secretary of State (most commonly an employee of the Benefits Agency, the Employment Service or a private/voluntary sector organisation''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``I am trying to encourage my hon. Friend to ask for further and better particulars''.&#151;[Official Report, Standing Committee D, 30 March 1999; c. 633.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Clearly, the training that will be given to somebody who works for the Benefits Agency and who has a lot more experience of working with members of the public will be different from that given to somebody who works for a private-sector organisation. In the Minister's subsequent summing-up, he did not reply to that point. Will my hon. Friend ask the Minister to comment on that important point?

<P>

<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> It is characteristic of the Minister's contribution to our proceedings, as I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh) will agree, that his response was redundant. I have no doubt that the Minister heard the point and I am sure that he will respond. If local officers become involved in this, as I am sure they will, they will bring with them their particular expertise. They will benefit from training, but also from the experience of those who first trod this path.
<P>
To return to the principles of personnel management and job placement, encouraging people to get involved in volunteering should be an active part of the training. To do that, we need to address the notional earnings rule, whereby benefits can be cut if officials deem that a wage should have been paid but the claimant declares that it has not. That will be a tricky area for the gatekeepers to the single gateway.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Smith:</B> Would the hon. Gentleman abolish that rule?
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> The right hon. Gentleman is getting testy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Smith:</B> Answer!
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I am going to answer, but it is a silly question.
<P>
The rule is fine, but it should be considered in context. The point that the volunteers are making is that, in one part of the country, voluntary work will be acceptable and within Government guidelines, while in another part of the country, the notional earnings rule will be applied inappropriately. There is nothing wrong with the notional earnings rule. Perhaps the Minister needs time to reflect&#151;perhaps he is looking forward to his dinner and will come back refreshed and in a more jolly mood&#151;but it is wrong to apply the notional earnings rule inappropriately.
<P>
Good training will enable one to determine whether the rule has been applied appropriately. That is why the amendment is so necessary. It would prevent people on training courses from asking whether the rule should be abolished because they will know that the rule exists to protect the Exchequer against fraudulent claims. It must not be used inappropriately in circumstances in which someone genuinely volunteers to work, and that is part of the process of getting him or her back into a working environment. That is why training is essential.
<P>
<B>Mr. Smith:</B> We have had a good and long debate on the amendment. The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford began by saying that this was a serious matter that is crucial to the success of the single work-focused gateway. I wholly agree with that. Training is being given serious attention because it is a matter of the highest priority. As we prepare for the pilot studies, a considerable amount of time, attention and resources is being applied to getting that right.
<P>
I thought that the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford was unnecessarily mean about the service that is currently provided by staff at the Benefits Agency, Employment Service and local authorities, especially about disability employment advisers. Of course, in a big, complex operation, insensitive mistakes are occasionally made, but the hon. Gentleman should equally acknowledge the large number of people, including those with severe disabilities, who receive enormous help from disability employment advisers and benefit from the quality of training to which my hon. Friend the Member for High Peak rightly referred. It is important to underline the fact that, crucial though training is, in recruiting people from the Benefits Agency, Employment Service and local authorities to undertake the important work of personnel advice in the single work-focused gateway, in most cases, we are not starting with a blank sheet of paper, with people who have no experience of dealing with such issues. They will already have received some training and, in many cases, will already have acquired invaluable experience. Indeed, it is that sort of experience that has made the personal advisory element of the new deal programme such a success. That is not to underestimate the importance of specific training, which will be provided. I thought that the hon. Gentleman was a little ungenerous in his remarks about what is accomplished by those who work very hard in the system at present.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> Perhaps I was, but my anecdotal experience, based on events in Lincolnshire, is that the more senior grades of people who have been manning the jobcentres for some time are doing an extremely dedicated job. However, sometimes junior employees&#151;this is a training issue&#151;try the patience of employers by sending them inappropriate people.
<P>
The second point that concerned me was that Benefit Agency personnel and local authority personnel have not, up to now, had the role of advising and trying to place people in the job market. Yet, according to the explanatory memorandum, we are now going to ask people who have, up to now, been paying out benefits to claimants to undertake the crucial task of advising on job opportunities. That ought to be a specialised professional task. That is my greatest area of concern.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Smith:</B> Whether they are from such a background and therefore need training in the labour market and in job placement, or whether that is already their area of expertise and they need training in other areas, appropriate training will be provided. We are producing a comprehensive training programme and it is not simply being produced out of nothing. Extensive consultation is taking place with organisations representing different groups of claimants.
<P>
The points that the hon. Gentleman made from his briefing from the Disability Benefits Consortium were beautifully read. It is a great tragedy that we were denied the opportunity under the previous Administration of hearing him read civil service breifings. That was a great mistake and, who knows, some of his former colleagues who lost their seats might not have done so had the hon. Gentleman been jointly there at the helm with others in the previous Administration.
<P>
However, let us leave aside that tragedy. Members of the Disability Benefits Consortium and others are not only welcome but invited to meet the training strand of the single work-focus gateway implementation team, precisely to give advice on the sort of things that they believe should be covered by the traning. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Social Security regularly meets the disability benefits forum, which represents many of the same organisations and provides the opportunity for that kind of dialogue. We also have meetings with groups such as Gingerbread, Scope and Carers National Association to ensure that they can make an input into the training process. The programme of learning and training that is being produced is intended comprehensively to ensure that personal advisers have the necessary balance of skills to deal with a wide range of clients and different circumstances.
<P>
The hon. Member for Newbury referred to a parliamentary question. The answer was given in the context of our saying that training was not confined to particular client groups, whether lone parents, disabled people or whoever. That is because, as far as possible, we prefer a generic or general advisory role, so that we get away from labelling people in advance, sorting them into categories and saying, ``You fall into that category, therefore you will necessarily be interviewed by a particular sort of adviser.'' Instead we prefer to treat people as individuals and to have a general adviser who is equipped to do just that. Of course, the adviser must also be able to link in to and refer the client on to specialist support where appropriate. The advisers will have the training to equip them to do that.
<P>
<B>Mr Mark Oaten (Winchester):</B> Is the Minister saying that each individual personal adviser will receive training in, for example, mental health issues, or that only a certain number will get such training and they will have to be appropriately linked to the person coming for an interview? Will everybody receive training in every aspect of the work?
<P>
<B>Mr. Smith:</B> Training will be provided to ensure that people have a satisfactory level of competence in every aspect of the work. Obviously, if they already have that training and expertise, there would be no need to duplicate it.
<P>
The hon. Member for Beckenham raised an interesting question.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> Before the Minister moves on to deal with the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham, I want him to understand that we are worried that this training might be superficial, inadequate, random, insufficiently thorough and insufficiently professional. Will the right hon. Gentleman deal with those concerns by saying that he will publish his model for the training programmes and, equally importantly, the standards that he intends to apply and the system for monitoring the achievement of those standards? Are there to be tests? Are the interviews to be monitored in some way? What sort of follow-up and oversight procedures does the Minister have in mind? If he can answer those points for the purposes of our consideration at this early stage, we will be satisfied.
<P>
<B>Mr. Smith:</B> In response to the hon. Gentleman's question, we shall certainly make available the programme of training. In accordance with the principle of open government, we shall deposit the relevant documents in the Library.
<P>
<H5>7 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Sitting suspended.
<P>
<H5>8.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
On resuming&#151;
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The Committee will recall that we are debating amendment No. 80 to clause 47.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Smith:</B> You will recall, Mr. Malins, that I was assuring the Committee that the personal adviser guidance will, as part of open government, be available in the House of Commons Library.
<P>
Hon. Members also raised questions about advisers' qualifications. Advisers will work towards NVQ level 3 in guidance, based on competence in work-related activities. With regard to the monitoring of interviews, a point raised by the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford, I assure the Committee that new staff will be accompanied by experienced staff when they start giving interviews, and periodically thereafter. As part of the evaluation, which will include talking to those who have been interviewed, we shall gain further feedback both on the effectiveness of interviews and on particular advisers.
<P>
The hon. Member for Beckenham said that in a previous debate I gave the impression that the interview was not a paper-based exercise or would not be recorded. I was making the point, I think in the context of illiteracy, that it would be a much more user-friendly procedure, because there would be face-to-face contact and people could be helped through anything that they did not understand. I want to correct any erroneous impression that there will not be a record of the interview. A reocrd of the views expressed by the client and the advice given will, apart from anything else, be essential in establishing that the procedures have been properly followed, both to update the client's record and in the event of an appeal.
<P>
The hon. Member for Beckenham also raised the important issue of the grades of the staff engaged in this work. As she and other hon. Members will be aware, three partner organisations will collaborate and deliver the single work-focused gateway&#151;the Employment Service, the Benefits Agency and local authorities. Each has its own banding and grading structure, but they all assess the personal adviser post as broadly equivalent to the executive officer, which will be meaningful to the hon. Lady in the light of her previous civil service experience.
<P>
Personal advisers' salaries will reflect the pay rate for the job within the employing agency. Their position on that scale will depend on how long they have been in the grade, levels of performance in previous years and location, but the salary is expected to range from just over &#163;16,000 to just under &#163;18,000.
<P>
The hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar asked about the benefits of claimants volunteering to enhance their independence, personal development and employability. The Government appreciate the benefits of volunteering. We have encouraged people&#151;for example those in receipt of incapacity benefit&#151;by amending the regulations to enable unlimited voluntary involvement where it was not previously possible. Moreover, we have given advice throughout the Employment Service and in jobcentres about the value of volunteering for jobseeker's allowance. A person on jobseeker's allowance is expected to be available for work and to accept any reasonable job that is offered, but the value of volunteering is well recognised and will be covered in the training.
<P>
We have had a full debate on the amendment and have covered all the relevant aspects of training. As I said at the outset, training is an important feature of the single gateway and will make a crucial contribution to the way in which staff can do their job. Staff constitute the most important resource for success in effecting the single work-focused gateway.
<P>
Training, staff and the conduct of interviews will be of high quality. All advisers will receive the requisite training, which will depend on their needs. They will be equipped to deal sensitively with the requirements of particular groups, and will be able to call on specialist support when that is relevant to the needs of clients.
<P>
We should remember that common sense, basic empathy and the commitment to helping all clients to achieve greater independence, as well as training and formal qualifications, are the most important requirements for personal advisers.
<P>
Between us, the Under-Secretary of State for Social Security, my hon. Friend the Member for Wallasey (Angela Eagle), and I have visited all the pilot schemes. We have met staff, local voluntary organisations, local authorities and others who will help to provide the single work-focused gateway. From those meetings, I have no doubt that there will be commitment, empathy and professionalism in abundance. That will be vital to the success of the initiative.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> The Minister has mentioned pilots in his response to all the amendments that I tabled and to several amendments that my hon. Friends tabled. I shall not be drawn into discussing pilots now because I hope that we can consider them during the debate on clause stand part.
<P>
I am grateful to the Minister. He made it clear that he had taken account of our worries about the provision. We are right to trust the good faith of the Government as they endeavour genuinely to make a success of the new venture of work-based interviews. However much we may regret it, and however temporary their period in office, they are the Government of the day by democratic decision. In two or three years, we want to inherit a successful work-focused interview programme, not a shambles or an obvious gimmick that destroys public confidence. Therefore, it is right to put the best possible face on the Government's statements. We share the same explicit objectives for the clause. That is different from our views on other aspects of the Bill.
<P>
The Minister's response shows that he has considered matters seriously. Earlier, he said that he had made a speech this afternoon to some of his officials in the employment service. He said that he had secured the support in principle of the Opposition through his eloquence in Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Smith:</B> I did not make that claim. I said that the Opposition had had the good sense to acknowledge that the proposals were commendable and had supported them, at least in principle, in the spirit that we have enjoyed in debates on the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> That is the correct way of presenting the matter. I do not mind if the Minister tries to take some personal credit with his officials in his brief period in office.
<P>
I hope that the Minister makes it clear to his officials that our support is conditional, that we have taken down his words about the amendments and that we may use them against him later if some of the undertakings are not satisfactorily fulfilled.
<P>
I hope that my comments do not seem grudging. The general purpose is one that we share and we should give the Labour Government credit for coming forward with this work-focused programme. We genuinely want to contribute to its success and we will do all that we can&#151;by supporting what is right and criticising where criticism is due&#151;to achieve its objectives. On that basis, we should end our debate on training. We are grateful for the assurances and would have liked more specific information on assessment, examination, standards, conducting interviews and follow-up. Nevertheless, what we heard was sufficiently concrete and substantial for me to beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 251, in page 45, line 9, at end insert&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``although a claimant's interview shall always take place within five days of the relevant authority receiving the claim''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take amendment No. 185, in page 45, line 27, at end insert&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``(g) prescribing that, where an interview has not taken place within three days of the initial claim, and unless this is due to unreasonable behaviour by the claimant, full benefit entitlement be paid until such time as the interview has taken place and entitlement can be reassessed.''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I cannot speak for everyone here, but I am as keen as mustard to move on to the stand part debate so I shall be briefer than I otherwise would.
<P>
The amendment is part of what is becoming a sickly, almost cosy drive for consensus, which takes the Secretary of State at his word. I was startled and heartened to hear duing the exchanges between my hon. Friend the Member for Chingford and the Secretary of State that those seeking to go through the gateway should be seen within two to three days. That is marvellous. The right hon. Gentleman may have been over-optimistic but we do not seek to exploit what he said on Second Reading and we are prepared to give him the benefit of another two days' cushion to be even more reasonable. Hence the amendment states that the interview
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``shall always take place within five days of the relevant authority receiving the claim''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I see no reason why that should not be built into the Bill. It is not as tight as the Secretary of State suggested, but it is a goal well worth aiming for.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I am grateful for the opportunity to speak briefly to amendment No. 185 in the name of myself and my hon. Friend the Member for Winchester. If the Government are going to introduce a system of compulsory interviews, it is only fair that they should, in return, promise to ensure that those interviews are held within a stated time&#151;and if they are not, the benefits claimed should be paid.
<P>
People claiming benefit are often at the margins of having enough to live on, so it is important that their benefit is paid as promptly as possible. If the Government believe that it is possible to hold interviews within three days, that should be the maximum time that the State should be allowed to make a decision on benefit.
<P>
It will be tough. Sadly, the Government may not achieve their aims. It looks as if they will not meet that sort of time frame. One need only look at some of the cases thrown up in the January policy bulletin of the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux. It mentioned a case in Tower Hamlets, in which a delay was reported on 25 August 1998, and which was still outstanding this January. It was an attempt to process a claim for a single parent with two children. Heaven knows what was happening to them in that time, but it is worrying to have to wait so long for a claim to be decided.
<P>
In November 1998, a client in Swansea wanted to claim disability living allowance, but was told that the local Benefits Agency office had run out of claim forms. The client's name was put on a waiting list and she was still waiting for a form three weeks' later.
<P>
In my area of Newbury, a man who was separated and who had serious financial problems sought advice from the local citizens advice bureau's money advisory service and applied to the Benefits Agency for income support and housing costs. Three weeks passed before he received any response at all.
<P>
People have to wait not just days, but weeks and even months for benefit claims to be decided. That is not good enough. Although I have no doubt that in many cases benefits are paid much more promptly&#151;thank heavens that they are&#151;people often have to wait far too long. In cases when it is impossible to hold an interview within the three days, they should be paid the benefits without having to wait for the interview.
<P>
<H5>8.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
As the Social Security Advisory Committee said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Where there is an element of compulsion, the system must be able to deliver what it promises.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment would provide a safeguard to ensure that claimants do not suffer because of the inefficiencies of the system. After all, inefficiencies will always exist. When they do, benefits should be paid within a reasonable time.
<P>
I recognise that the Government have said that they will take urgent cases into account, but the amendment would ensure that the Bill contains an undertaking that innocent parties do not suffer as a result of system failures.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Smith:</B> Innocent parties will not suffer, but it is not necessary to make that point in the Bill. We have given the commitment that, whenever possible, interviews will take place within three days of the claim being made. We have every intention of ensuring that that happens. It is a central part of our policy that claimants get a better service through the single work-focused gateway. Clearly, when holding an interview within the time span is not possible for reasons that are unrelated to the claimant, we will ensure that he or she does not lose money as a result. We have taken account of that in the design of the single gateway. We fully accept that it would be wrong for people to be penalised because of administrative difficulties or for no fault of their own.
<P>
However, we need more flexibility than the amendments would allow us. Amendment No. 251 states that an
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``interview shall always take place within five days''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
of a claim being made. That is not right, and I do not think that it fully reflects the intention of the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar. We anticipate that the vast majority of claimants will have their interviews as soon as possible after making the claim, but that will not be appropriate in every instance. There will be cases in which someone's personal circumstances mean that it is appropriate to defer the interview beyond five days. For example, he or she may be acutely ill or a personal adviser may want to waive the requirement to take part in a work-focused interview if, as we have said before, someone is terminally ill.
<P>
We need flexibility, which is why we cannot accept the amendment. It would have the peverse effect of preventing us from having trigger interviews at specified points throughout an individual's time on benefit.
<P>
In addition, there will be cases in which someone makes a claim for benefit to which he is not entitled within the three days that amendment No. 185 suggests. For example, a lone parent who has lost her job but who still receives some salary may make a claim to benefit before her entitlement starts. It would not make sense and I do not think that it is the intention of the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar to require benefit to be paid before people are first entitled to it.
<P>
I hope that the Committee is reassured by what I have said about the Government's intentions on the speed with which work-focused interviews will be arranged and on our determination that no one should suffer loss of benefit through no fault of their own. I hope that the Committee will understand why the amendments would limit the sensible flexibility that we must have to operate the system properly. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not push the amendments to a vote.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> As always, the Minister has been very helpful. He has repeated the Secretary of States's undertaking and his remarks were most robust. Two to three days is a suitable target. The amendment was not intended to restrict flexibility, but, in view of the Minister's robust and straightforward response, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I beg to move the amendment No. 253, in page 45, line 17, after ``interview'', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``by either not attending for the full amount of time required to complete the interview or by not providing full and frank answers to any question reasonably related to that person's benefit claim or that person's search for employment''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This amendment would lay down in legislation a matter to which the Minister alluded earlier, and it would involve elements of compulsion. It is incumbent on Parliament to ensure that appropriate action is taken in relation to a person's loss of a benefit. The withdrawal of benefit should not be arbitrary or highly subjective. It should not result from the fact that an interviewing officer had a bad day, for instance, was unhappy with his wife, had not won the national lottery or was feeling tetchy and glum. The reasons for withdrawal should be clearly laid out in legislation.
<P>
A person should be required to attend an interview for its full length, until it is successfully completed. They should, as the Minister put it, ``participate'' satisfactorily in the interview before losing their benefits. The test of being present at and participating in the interview should be used&#151;it is not enough simply to attend and remain mute. The amendment states that they should also give
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``full and frank answers to any question reasonably related to that person's benefit''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That test, which is wholly reasonable, should be used. It would be unreasonable to go into greater detail. If a person fails to attend and to ``participate'' satisfactorily, the guidelines for the removal of his benefit must be clear. This is a probing amendment, and we shall press it to a vote only if the Minister significantly provokes us. I look forward to his response.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Smith:</B> Without wanting to join what the hon. Gentleman previously called the cloying slide towards consensus, I shall try not to provoke him to press the amendment to a vote. However, the amendment's requirement to provide ``full and frank answers'' would give a field day to lawyers and to those who object to the removal of their benefit because they had not taken part in an interview. That is not a sensible way to define participation.
<P>
We thought seriously about what constitutes taking part in a work-focused interview. We were not satisfied with a requirement that would allow a person to turn up and sit there, refusing to participate, but we did not want a requirement that was susceptible to subjective interpretation, as the amendment is.
<P>
Perhaps it would be helpful if I explained what we expect work-focused interviews to cover. We want them to be proper two-way discussions between the claimant and the personal adviser. Personal advisers will be trained to provide the relevant information and advice to help claimants explore how they can enhance their independence and overcome barriers that prevent their participation in the labour market. In return, claimants will be expected to participate actively in the interview.
<P>
For the vast majority of people, there will be no dispute about that. Claimants will accept that the request is reasonable. However, we all know that a small number of people may want to avoid even this basic requirement. We need clear criteria on whether someone has taken part in an interview. We intend to do that by requiring people to answer factual questions that relate to their prospects of employment and the barriers that they face in returning to the world of work.
<P>
We will state in regulations that a person will be regarded as having taken part in an interview if he attends it at the time and place specified, which may be in his home, and provides the information that is requested. That information will relate to the level of educational qualifications that he has achieved; any work skills that he has acquired and vocational training that he has undertaken; previous work experience; what paid or unpaid work he is undertaking; and the barriers to work that he may face, such as the extent to which a medical condition restricts his ability to work, or whether he has any particular caring responsibilities or child care requirements.
<P>
Our argument is that claimants should provide that amount of information as a minimum to make the interview meaningful and productive. The information is necessary to help us assess employability.
<P>
<B>Mr. Oaten:</B> For the awkward few who refuse to participate in that basic set of five or six questions, what happens next?
<P>
<B>Mr. Smith:</B> If they refuse to provide that information, they will not have taken part in the work-focused interview and will not have properly completed their claim for benefit.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> If I may push the point further, the words are general, but there is an implication that claimants will have to engage in a constructive dialogue on their efforts to find employment. If a druggy turned up three times and said on each occasion that he did not have the slightest intention of finding employment, would he definitely lose his benefit?
<P>
<B>Mr. Smith:</B> He would lose his benefit if there were no extenuating circumstances. The hon. Gentleman mentioned a ``druggy''. It is always possible to imagine someone who is so incapacitated by alcohol or drugs, or who is in such an unstable mental condition, that it would be appropriate to defer that part of the work-focused interview rather than decide that he had refused to participate. Difficult borderline judgments will need to be made.
<P>
The criteria that I have set out are the reasonable amount of information on which one can form a judgment that someone has actively participated in the interview. We need to draw a line between judging the extent of that participation and not unfairly penalising people who may genuinely have difficulty in taking part. I believe that we have drawn the line at a sensible place, which will be set out in more detail in regulations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Oaten:</B> I am concerned about the awkward few who may want to play a silly game during the interview. If an interview is not going well, it is critical that the consequences of not answering the questions are made clear. A claimant should not be told later in a letter that he or she has not complied. If the consequences are made clear during the interview, the claimant may have a change of heart and participate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Smith:</B> Yes, I can give the assurance that it will be made clear in the interview why claimants are expected to answer the questions, but the hon. Gentleman posited the situation of someone playing silly games in the interview. People who play silly games when they are claiming benefit should take the consequences of their actions. That is why the rights that are enshrined in the Bill must be matched by responsibilities.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I entirely agree with the Minister, but it is not simply a matter of someone who is awkward or, as my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs said, a druggy. We are talking about people who go through the motions. The Minister said that my wording of ``full and frank'' would give lawyers a field day. I suspect that his ``constructive dialogue'' may also give lawyers a field day.
<P>
A constituent of mine tried several times to get a caretaker for one of his buildings. People told him, ``The jobcentre sent me. I won't take the job, but unless I come for this interview, they will stop my dole.'' How can we deal with someone like that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Smith:</B> One cannot stop someone going through the motions to comply with the regulations and receive the benefit. Unless there were a thermometer by which we could measure whether people's hearts are really in their applications, that problem is unavoidable. Faced with a choice of where to draw the line, we thought it sensible to draw it at the point where fairly objective and readily accessible information had been communicated. That is why it makes sense to stick with our proposal and not accept the amendment.
<P>
<H5>9 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I have listened to the Minister. My purpose in moving the amendment was to get the Minister to clarify what will constitute a satisfactory interview. He seems to think that constructive dialogue will be sufficient, but I have doubts about that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I was wondering about people who are extremely depressed. What might their attitude be to being asked a series of questions? Will it be easy for interviewers to tell the difference between someone who is trying to play a game and someone who is so depressed that he or she finds it difficult to cope with the interview?
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I entirely agree. That is why it was important for the Committee to spend such a long time debating amendment No. 80. The gatekeepers to the gateway will be remarkable people, and it is up to us to ensure that they do their work satisfactorily. I am 85 per cent. satisfied with the assurance that the Minister has given and, therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 79 in page 45, line 24, after `regulations' insert

<P>

<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Those who deal with job applicants in jobcentres or benefit applicants in benefit offices have, from time to time, to deal with some very awkward customers. On some occasions, they have to be pretty clear and firm with people. We want to encourage the Minister to ensure that his officials are clear and firm with people when that is required.
<P>
As the reaction on the Conservative Benches showed during the previous debate, we are not afraid to support the Government to ensure that the system can be tough, straightforward and firm when it needs to be. The Minister received the only cheer from these Benches for one of the remarks that he made in response to the previous amendment. The other side of the coin is that there are deserving cases that warrant a measure of human sympathy and flexibility. We want to ensure that those qualities are in evidence when necessary and that they are not abused. Equally, we want firmness to be in evidence when required; we do not want it to be abused.
<P>
The purpose of amendment No. 79 is to ensure that certain categories of people will either not be expected to attend an interview or be the benificiaries of flexibility in the timing of the interview. Thus we want the regulations explicitly to take account of such matters as
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``the degree of incapacity, invalidity or physical or mental illness of the person, the recent bereavement of such a person or the illness or incapacity of any child, parent, spouse, partner or other person for whom theperson claiming benefit has care.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Liberal Democrat party shares some of our anxieties, and has tabled an amendment that in many ways is parallel to ours, but which, for reasons that the hon. Member for Newbury will no doubt explain to the Committee in due course, does not cover the issues included in the final phrase of our amendment:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``illness or incapacity of any child, parent, spouse, partner or other person for whom the person claiming benefit has care.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I should like to probe several aspects. The Government are regarded as morally, if not legally, committed to ensuring that the regulations reflect the undertakings in the explanatory memorandum&#151;which I can read out to the Committee if necessary&#151;in respect of two categories of benefit claimant: people who have recently had serious surgery, who would not be suitable immediately for a work-focused interview; and people with terminal illnesses or conditions.
<P>
I should like to probe the Minister briefly on the issue of terminal illness, because in benefit speak, that usually means someone who has been diagnosed as likely to die in the following six months. However, some illnesses are debilitating. As I anticipated in my remarks this morning, earlier this afternoon I was visited by a representative of the Motor Neurone Disease Association. The illness always kills; it has no cure. It is impossible to predict the time that it will take to reach that outcome, which is, sadly, inevitable. I was told that the average time from diagnosis to death is 14 months. It therefore follows that some people will have longer than six months to live, but it does not make sense, and it would be cruel, to drag such people&#151;I am sure that the Government do not intend such a thing to happen&#151;to an interview, even to ship them somewhere in a taxi or an ambulance, or to have someone from the benefit office come to talk to them about the job that they may do. That does not make sense, and it is a ghastly thought.
<P>
We need some precision in the matter. We have prepared an amendment for the Government, which they can adopt wholesale if they want to. If they do not want to, they can at least provide equivalent assurances, which will appear in the text of Hansard, to ensure that such people would be protected, and that the provision would cover not only the two specified examples in the explanatory memorandum, of serious surgery or terminal illness&#151;which I fear in Benefit Agency speak simply means people who are within six months of their medically diagnosed, anticipated death.
<P>
The amendment also seeks to ensure that when summoning people to interview or contemplating doing so, officials consider the recent bereavement of such a person, which speaks for itself, and the incapacity of a child, parent, spouse, partner or other person for whom the person claiming benefit has care. Neither the Bill, the explanatory memorandum or the other accompanying documents contains the suggestion that the Government plan to ensure that that will be considered. If they do, I hope that they will tell us. It is a matter of considering the condition or circumstances not only of the claimant&#151;the potential interviewee&#151;but of the person for whom that claimant has care.
<P>
We can all visualise, from our personal experiences of family, friends and constituents, the circumstances of someone who is extremely poorly being looked after during a crisis&#151;which always happen at the worst possible family moment, such as when people are going on holiday and have to cancel it because of a dreadful crisis, or when someone who is already in a bad way suddenly takes a turn for the worse. It is clear that in a humane system, such a crisis, involving difficulty in leaving a child, elderly relative, husband or wife who is seriously ill in order to attend an interview, should be regarded as a reason for postponing that interview. Obviously, that is not a reason not to have an interview, but it is certainly a factor to be taken into account.
<P>
We want to leave the Bill in such a form that no one can subsequently argue that Parliament did not do its job, that it produced such a rigid structure that bureaucracy was authorised to take inhuman or unjust decisions&#151;or even left people with no option but to say, ``I am awfully sorry, but the text that Parliament has given us says that we ain't got no choice. Even though I would love to do the sensible, reasonable and humane thing, I am not allowed to do so because that is the law.'' We want to be sure that there is no danger of that happening.
<P>
We are talking about an amendment that would guide the framers of the regulations. We want Parliament to be able to scrutinise those regulations, we hope under the affirmative resolution procedure, to ensure that the text of the Bill is fulfilled. If we cannot have that&#151;I hope that we can; I hope that the Government will accept our amendment&#151;a clear assurance from the Minister would be equally effective.
<P>
We seek an eminently practical result. We are not trying to score points. We have no ego invested in the text of the amendment. I am entirely easy as to whether the requirements that we believe should be incorporated in the Bill&#151;or the guidance given to officials when drafting regulations&#151;come in the form of an oral assurance from the Minister or in the form of a textual provision. We want the system to be effective. We want it to be tough when it is needed, but it should be sufficiently flexible and humane not to cause greater injustice than any addition to justice or to human happiness that it brings about; and it should not fatally discredit itself through excessive bureaucratic rigidity.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I wish to speak briefly to amendment No. 145. The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford wondered why our amendment was subtly different from his. I am delighted to be able to tell him that I fully support amendment No. 79, just as I support ours. They are different because they classify differently the reasons for not attending an interview. We wanted to put down the hardest case of all&#151;the one most likely to give people good reason not to attend an interview. Indeed, such a reason might not be obvious to those who call people for interview.
<P>
It is inevitable that some people who are recently bereaved will be called for interview. Even if they are in no fit state to face the interview, they will at least be able to write back to postpone the interview, saying, for instance, ``My husband died yesterday, and I do not feel that I can attend an interview now.'' However, someone who has a mental or physical impairment that makes it difficult for them to communicate may not be able to understand the letter calling them for interview and may not be able to explain why it is inappropriate for them to attend.
<P>
In particularly hard cases, it may be difficult not only for the person to come to the interview but for them to explain why they cannot or should not be expected to attend. We want to press the Government on that most difficult of cases. There is good reason to be especially careful if people have communication difficulties, but I would not want the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford to feel that I was opposing his amendment by speaking to our amendment No. 145.
<P>
<B>Mr. Oaten:</B> I wish to support both amendments, which highlight some critical points relating to why individuals may not be able to attend interviews. I should like to press the Minister on a couple of related points. We have discussed obvious reasons for failure to attend interview, such as bereavement and family illness. My hon. Friend the Member for Newbury rightly referred to communication difficulties. On that point, can the Minister assure us that consideration will be given to the way in which individuals are notified? For example, where an individual who is to be called for interview is known to be blind, will thought be given to the way in which he or she will be invited to attend? That would be one way of ironing out the problem of an individual remaining unaware of the requirement to attend interview. Consideration of the form of communication, the wording used, the size of print used and other related factors could prevent such problems from arising.
<P>
<H5>9.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Will the Minister say whether failure to attend an interview due to a last-minute illness is an excuse on which benefit offices will look sympathetically? In cases involving mental health problems, last-minute illnesses can often occur. Such people may need to telephone on the morning of the interview to say that they are unable to attend, or may even be unable to make that telephone call. I hope that thought will be given to such problems.
<P>
A related point is the need to establish the reason for failure to attend interview by a means other than simply sending a second letter asking why someone failed to attend. Where people fail to attend because they do not understand the letter or cannot read, the sending of a second letter would merely repeat the problem. What plans are there to monitor the reasons&#151;particularly reading difficulties&#151;why individuals fail to attend interviews? With regard to reading difficulties, public transport can present a major problem. The failure to those who live in rural areas to attend interview will, I hope, be looked on sympathetically by benefit offices. I should be interested to hear the Minister's comments on that.
<P>
The most important point relating to this cluster of difficulties concerns decisions on the genuineness of reasons given for failure to attend interview. I can imagine constituents attending my surgery and saying, ``Look, these are the reasons why I failed to attend interview and they are good reasons. Nevertheless, those reasons have been regarded as insufficient and I've been refused benefit. What do I do next? How do I appeal?'' Will the Minister set out the appeal procedure for those who feel that they had strong grounds for failing to attend interview, but which were rejected by the benefit office?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Andrew Smith:</B> Having heard the terms in which the hon. Members for Grantham and Stamford and for Newbury moved their amendments, I do not believe that there is any practical difference between their objectives and ours. We all want people to be treated with decency and humanity. Those who face particularly grave difficulties, whether through illness or otherwise, should be treated with proper sensitivity and I can assure hon. Members that that will happen. However, few if any of the difficulties that have been discussed cannot currently arise. In fact, such difficulties might easily be overlooked under the current system precisely because it provides less personal contact than the single, work-focused gateway will provide.
<P>
There are two dimensions along which sensitivity and responsiveness to clients' needs can be extended. The first is breadth, in terms of the proportion of interviews that can be deferred or the proportion of people who can be exempted from participating in an interview. Secondly, one can ensure that the balance of an interview is aligned to the particular circumstances and needs of the interviewee. In matching those two dimensions, I tend towards making as few exemptions from interview as possible, while ensuring that interviews are conducted in as sensitive a manner as possible. I take that view not least because of the help component that will be integral to the interview. That component will provide extra assistance to people who, under the present system, might otherwise go without it. That said, there will be circumstances, such as terminal illness, in which it will not be appropriate to have an interview, but other circumstances in which it will be.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> Will the Minister assure the Committee that terminal illness will not be narrowly interpreted to mean someone who is within six months of diagnosed and anticipated death?
<P>
<B>Mr. Smith:</B> I shall not attempt to define what is meant by terminal illness. I can assure the hon. Gentleman that it will not be interpreted in an arbitrarily time-limited way, but rather in a sense that genuinely constitutes terminal illness. I shall reflect further on what the hon. Gentleman has said.
<P>
On a more general but important point, the Bill provides for regulations to set out good cause provisions for people who do not attend an interview. They will cover the sorts of circumstances that have been alluded to&#151;a recurrent or sudden illness. I can give the hon. Members for Newbury and for Winchester the assurances that they sought, that the regulations will provide for precisely that sort of thing. We have no interest in penalising people by denying or withdrawing their benefit because, for example, a child has suddenly become ill and they are unable to turn up for an interview.
<P>
From the way in which the amendments have been drafted and, to some extent, in the debate, there is perhaps a little confusion between circumstances in which it is appropriate not to have to take part in an interview and circumstances in which it is appropriate to defer an interview. Clearly, terminal illness is an example of the former and sudden illness is an example of the latter. We would envisage that even the difficult circumstances outlined by the hon. Member for Newbury&#151;in which, due to physical or mental impairment, a claimant does not understand that he or she must attend on a particular day&#151;will be covered by good cause provisions. However, the fact that the person suffers from such an impairment will not exempt him or her from ever having to take part in an interview, although it would be important to ensure that the requirement was properly explained and understood by that person.
<P>
I can also give the hon. Member for Winchester the assurance that he sought: that in cases of blindness or other impairment that impedes communication, there will be appropriate communication to ensure that people understand. I shall say more about that on another occasion, but there will be two stages to the single work-focused gateway. The first stage is registration and orientation, which will replicate a stage that already exists in the process of claiming benefit. That involves getting basic information, such as the person's name, address and circumstances. At that stage, one can start to assess whether and when it would be appropriate to have the work-focused interview. Of course, at that stage, any impairment or needs will be identified and, I assure the Committee, sensitively addressed. In the light of those assurances, and given that we all share some common ground on this issue, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I am grateful for the Minister's comments. As he said, we are not far apart on this issue. Indeed, I believe that we are facing in the same direction. I have one or two small points about terminal illnesses&#151;I have already raised one of them&#151;and the Minister has agreed to think further about that. However, in the light of those assurances and because we want to make a success of the work-focused interview project, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> This is the last of our amendments on clause 47. Our aim is to protect natural justice rather than to raise a substantive issue involving delivery of work-focused interviews, which has been the substance of our debates so far today.
<P>
Amendment No. 83 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Regulations shall be made specifying the maximum period which may elapse between the refusal of benefit and the hearing and determination of an appeal, and will provide, if the appeal has not been heard and determined within such periods, for the applicant to be deemed to have had his case upheld.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There are two substantive points in the amendment. First, there should be some discipline on the state, which is a monopoly provider of a service that anyone who wants benefit must receive&#151;a work-focused interview. If there is an appeal, it should not drag on indefinitely and get lost. There should be some discipline on the Benefits Agency or the Department of Social Security or whoever will be responsible for ensuring that appeals are heard and dealt with in a reasonable time with reasonable dispatch in a businesslike way. Secondly, if there are delays, the appellant should not lose. The only way of imposing discipline on a bureaucracy is to ensure that it loses money unless it carries out specific functions within a certain period. If an appeal is not heard in due time, it is only just that those who are responsible for the timing of the hearing&#151;the state, the Government, the Benefits Agency and the Department of Social Security&#151;should pay and that the individual should be protected.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will accept the amendment in that spirit and that if the appeal is not heard within a required period, the appellant should be deemed to have had his appeal upheld and receive the benefit for which he originally applied.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I support amendment No. 83, not least because it reminds me of 1983, that glorious year when you and I, Mr. Malins, were elected to Parliament with a Conservative majority of 140 seats. We saw what happened at the next election. The previous amendment, No. 79, reminded me of an even more glorious year, 1979, when the greatest Prime Minister in world history&#151;
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Much as I was enjoying the hon. Gentleman's words, he must speak to the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> During our period of office, we tried to ensure that Government was not exempt from the rigours on the private sector to deal with matters expeditiously and I hope that the Government will continue that. We have heard a lot recently about the late payer's campaign and companies that delay paying bills. The Government must be part of that process. We have also heard much about local planning authorities and how they should be dealt with if they are late in dealing with planning applications. Those same principles should apply if the Government are dilatory and appeals are not heard on time. We all know of cases in our years in Parliament of people having to wait for their appeals to be heard. They should be upheld automatically. There is no good reason why the Government should resist the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Andrew Smith:</B> I have enormous sympathy with the spirit of the amendment, but I should explain why I cannot accept it. It is impossible to think through all the implications of registration and the other actions involved. It could have perverse results and be regarded as a general invitation for everyone who had refused to take part in an interview to lodge an appeal in the hope that, because a hearing had not been arranged in time, right to benefit would be granted whether or not the claimant was entitled to it. It is curious to try to include a provision that would uphold an appeal, regardless of the original decision.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> The right hon. Gentleman is in a position to prevent that particular abuse from arising. He is in charge of the system and can ensure that all appeals happen within the requisite time frame, so there should be no danger of people succeeding in receiving benefit in that way. The amendment makes it clear that a claimant would not receive benefit simply by asking for an appeal. Benefit is restored only if the appeal is not heard in time, which is a matter under the Minister's direct control.
<P>
<B>Mr. Smith:</B> As the hon. Gentleman will accept, it would give a perverse incentive to as many people as possible to appeal regardless of the rights or wrongs of the original decision. It is not difficult to imagine circumstances in which the system might be overwhelmed by appeals. That is why I cannot accept the amendment.
<P>
I share the view of Opposition Members that appeals take too long. The judicial, administrative and public sector should be under similar discipline to work within proper deadlines as is required for private or other operators. I accept the logic of the arguments. The hon. Member of Gainsborough was reciting the glorious dates in the now distant&#151;but not that distant&#151;Conservative history, but I could not help thinking that they had 18 years in which to get the appeals system right. We have had nearly two years so far, but we are taking action and hope to reduce delays in the system.
<P>
Appeals take too long, which is why we are reforming the system of decision-making and appeals to provide a first tier disputes arrangement. Its aim is to resolve disputes more quickly, before they become formal appeals and to make changes to the administration of appeals tribunals, to ensure that cases are heard more promptly.
<P>
In line with the spirit behind the amendment, I want to publish the figures on the delays between an appeal being made and the judgment on the appeal. We want to see the trend in improving the performance in the system, which is a matter to which the Government are committed in the interests of effective administration, as well as equity for claimants and those who may have been badly treated in the original decision.
<P>
We are sympathetic to what the amendments are trying to achieve, but it makes no sense to do that in the way proposed in the amendment, so I urge the Committee to resist it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> The Minister has only just scraped over the line in avoiding our pressing the amendment. We might have won had we put it to the vote because we have good arguments for it.
<P>
The Minister started by saying that he shared our point of view, that he was sympathetic and all the rest of it in his usual charming fashion. He then agreed that there should be disciplines on the public sector, which was something for which my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough argued extremely ably. However, he did not say that he would introduce disciplines into the system; he said that he was monitoring the matter and would publish the figures, but he did not suggest any discipline, sanction or positive or negative incentive to ensure that the system worked in a different and more effective fashion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Smith:</B> The hon. Gentleman may not have heard me say that we will publish the information on performance, that we want a clear trend of improvement and that we would exert discipline to improve matters while avoiding the perverse incentive to people to lodge frivolous appeals.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> We do not want a negative incentive. The hon. Gentleman regards publicity as a discipline, which I do not. Publicity is important and information is vital&#151;one cannot take proper decisions in the public or the private sector unless one has the correct informaton and there cannot be effective democracy without open government. I hope that we all agree with that. Publishing is not in itself a discipline. A discipline would be to provide positive incentives to the people who run the appeals system to ensure that they hear the appeals in timely fashion and thus have a bonus at the end of the year. Alternatively, there could be a negative incentive in that their pay would be docked at the end of the year if they did not achieve what was expected.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman did not come up with an alternative discipline; however, he showed that his heart was in the right place. As he said that he would publish the figures, the implication is that he is confident that he can present Parliament with a series of improving figures. It would therefore be churlish to push the amendment to a Division. Once again, we take on board what the Minister said, we register his assurances, and we will monitor performance carefully. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amentment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I have concluded that it would be appropriate to have a clause stand part debate. There are various matters that have not been raised under the many amendments which could properly be discussed in that debate. I urge hon. Members to avoid matters that were discussed in the debates on amendments and to avoid repetition, upon which the Chair will frown.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Smith:</B> We have now had more than seven hours of debate on clause 47. There have been 28 Opposition amendments and at least four Government amendments, and we have already had an extensive debate. I will not prolong matters now as I want to give other Members of the Committee the opportunity to make their points. I shall respond briefly at the end of the debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I support the clause. It is a stick-and-carrot measure: the carrot is that there is the prospect of people's welfare, job-seeking, and difficult personal circumstances being dealt with at a single stop; the stick is a rather more aggressive discipline than I perceived earlier in the Bill. If I understand it correctly, it is not just a matter of turning up for an interview; a person has to persuade his or her consultant that he is making bona fide efforts to find employment. The discipline is that if someone does not turn up three times or clearly has made no efforts, he or she will lose all welfare benefit rights.
<P>
I have two concerns: first, that in practice the measure will be administered too softly, that the system will not be tough enough to see people destitute, and therefore the discipline will not apply where they have made no serious effort to gain employment.
<P>
My second concern is that an awful lot is needed to make this work to the optimum. We have debated training, but I am mindful of the excellent intentions of the Child Support Agency legislation, where no one at the outset disagreed that it was absolutely morally right for parents to be forced to support their children.
<P>
<B>Mr. Shaw:</B> Did the hon. Gentleman say that he wanted to see people destitute?
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Let me finish what I was saying and then I shall return to that.
<P>
Both sides of the House at the time thought that the principles of the CSA were right, yet what was put into practice has been a disaster. The computer system was wrong and many details were not thought through. With this major change being made to the tilt of welfare, the stick could turn out to be too hard or the carrot ineffective. It will not work unless there is the effort, the detail, the training, the staffing and careful handling of these measures.
<P>
The hon. Member for Chatham and Aylesford (Mr. Shaw) questioned the point that I was seeking to make. I am not saying that I want people to be destitute, but the legislation is in effect saying that sadly, if someone does not bother to turn up for interviews and has not shown that he is making an effort to work, the state is prepared to see him destitute and to withdraw all of his benefits. That it what the Bill is all about.
<P>
I am simply making the point that, if when the crunch comes no one is willing to implement that discipline, the whole thing will not stand up. It is based on the stick and carrot. I do not know whether it will turn out to be too harsh or too soft in practice. At least let us be clear that that is what it is about. It is not just a nice cosy gateway; it is a gateway, but with a tough ultimate discipline at the bottom of it. Most of the detailed points have been aired pretty fully. I just express the concern that the Bill should not, like the CSA legislation, end up with sound principles and fair cross-party agreement, which get messed up in their implementation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I should like to follow the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs, who has made an interesting and entirely new point. I support the clause and if I am given an opportunity I would like to vote for it.
<P>
The Select Committee has been studying what has happened in America, where various states, including Wisconsin, have been extremely tough. We hear a lot about Governor Bush and what he has done in Texas, but his policies on social security are far tougher than what we have been talking about. We should bear in mind that that man is considered to be mainstream and may be the next President of the United States, yet he is talking about depriving people entirely of social security. That is extremely tough.
<P>
Many people think that although those states have passed all that legislation, it has remained on the statute books only because the American economy is booming and that as soon as it goes into recession, as it will, and all those destitute people queue up, whatever language is spoken by ambitious politicians in America, they will have to be put back on benefits. In a modern society, can we really have people out on the streets completely destitute? It worries me that we have wrapped ourselves in a cosy blanket of good intentions. We have talked about bringing people in, having a good talk and offering them work. However, we know that many people, for all kinds of reasons, cannot and&#151;if we forget the disabled for a moment&#151;will not work. Do the Government have the political courage to say, out on the street, ``No money, you're going to be wrapped in a blanket''. I am not sure that they have. The Minister may be able to make the Government's intentions clear.

<P>

<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I want to make a few quick points.
<P>
I want to deal with the canard raised by the Minister at the beginning of the debate and during discussion of later amendments&#151;that the filling in of a form is similar to forcing people to come to an interview. If a person does not fill in a form, the state cannot decide what level of benefit should be provided or whether any benefit at all should be provided. If a person does not come to an interview, the state can make the decision but chooses not to do so. The two are therefore different and I hope that we will hear no more about them being the same on Report.
<P>
At the beginning of the debate, we expressed worry about whether the safeguards were adequate to ensure that the clause worked humanely. We are still concerned that all the necessary safeguards are not in place. The Government have produced certain proposals for how the scheme will work and those have relieved some of our concerns. The pilot schemes will be important. We need to see how the scheme will work on the ground and what it will cost. The Government pledged today to make the single gateway sites fully accessible to the disabled and the costs of physical changes to the buildings may cost a great deal more than the Goverment are currently considering spending on the scheme. The training of the advisers will be absolutely critical to making the scheme work properly and will also be costly.
<P>
If the Government are not prepared to provide the necessary resources, they may find that the whole project collapses at a later stage. If the Government decide that it cannot be implemented with the promised safeguards because of excessive cost or other reasons, I hope that they have the courage to accept that the scheme has not worked. They should not repeat the previous Government's mistake with the CSA, which was to push on and try to force the project through when they should have admitted that it was not working and they needed to consider an alternative. If the scheme goes wrong, the Government will gain a lot of respect by admitting that they were wrong.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> I pay tribute to my hon. Friends the Members for Arundel and South Downs and for Gainsborough for their contributions to the debate. Welfare reform consists of striking the right balance between the necessary firmness in dealing with abuse&#151;which should make it absolutely clear that taking taxpayer's money in the form of benefits is not a one-way street and that obligations as well as advantages flow from that&#151;and maintaining a sufficient degree of humanity towards people who genuinely fall on hard times. That is an indispensable part of Conservative Members' conception of civilised society and it is the subject of consensus in present British political life. The excessive reaction against the concept of welfare, which currently exists in the United States of America, is frightening.
<P>
The Government were wrong to target contributory benefits&#151;they should have faced up to the need to reform the means-tested sector. However, the introduction of work-focused interviews is a useful and substantial contribution, which Conservative Members genuinely endorse. It has not been a waste to spend a whole day debating the subject&#151;it is a momentous new development and it would have been wrong if Parliament had not explored it in the round and considered it from as many different angles as could reasonably be conceived. Not only will the public feel that we have given it proper examination, but those who draft the regulations can take account of some of the concerns expressed.
<P>
As the Bill is controversial in so many respects, it is remarkable that the debate has been marked by such a high degree of consensus. As a result, we have pressed to a vote only one of our amendments, No. 78, which dealt with the relationship between the personal and capability assessments and the work-focused interviews, a matter that we can take up further on clause 50. I shall not trespass against your ruling, Mr. Malins, by touching on it again.
<P>
I take the opportunity of this stand part debate to ask the Government one or two questions that should be asked, but which we have not realistically been able to raise on amendments. As soon as I ask the questions, it will be seen why that is the case. First, I should like an assurance from the Minister&#151;I hope that there is no need to go to the lengths of tabling an amendment to elicit it&#151;that where, in subsection (6), regulations provide for the possibility that the Benefits Agency or whichever arm of the state is handling these interviews can waive the requirement for interviews or delay them, there will be no loss to the appellant. In other words, where it is decided, under the regulations, that the obligation to come to the interview is, for whatever reason, to be postponed or waived, in no case will the subsection be used to save the Treasury money by denying people benefit, because it is not their fault if the interview, which must be part of the process, is delayed by a decision of the Government or one of its arms or agencies. I should be grateful for that assurance.
<P>
One matter that has not arisen is whether work-focused benefits might be available to those in work. One can conceive of circumstances in which somebody currently in work might like to have such an interview. If the interviews are successful and are known to be helpful to people, someone who is stuck in a dead-end job or faces the likelihood of redundancy in a few months' time&#151;his employer may be cutting personnel in the light of market developments; we can conceive of many other scenarios&#151;he might welcome the opportunity of an anticipatory work-focused interview. What is the Government's attitude on that?
<P>
Thirdly, we cannot leave this matter, even after a whole day's discussion, without going into pilots. We must know what the blazes is going on, if that is a permissible parliamentary expression. The Government's undertaking was originally in their glossy document ``New ambitions for our country: A New Contract for Welfare'', which says on page 53:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The first pilots will start in six areas in October 1998, with a further six areas added early in 1999.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If the Government had met their own timetable on that, we should be much further advanced than we are. Knowing the results of the pilots would have guided and informed our discussions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Smith:</B> The hon. Gentleman referred to some commitments on dates. I did not recognise those dates.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> May I pass to the Minister my copy of the document? I would like to have it back, because I have annotated it. The Minister can read all the annotations, if he wants to. It says on page 53:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The first pilots will start in six areas in October 1998, with a further six areas added early in 1999.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In contradiction to that, the explanatory notes&#151;I can see that the Minister is as puzzled by it as I was when I read it&#151;say on page 73:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``These new arrangements will be piloted in 12 areas, commencing in June 1999''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am mystified about what is happening with the pilots. Are the Government simply behind schedule? These things happen, even in the best managed organisations. No one can pretend, in the light of the past two years' experience, that new Labour Britain is the best managed of all organisations. Therefore, perhaps it is simply a question of delay, in which case can we be told what has caused the delay and the shift in the timescale? When will the pilots be launched, when will they be completed and when will we be able to draw conclusions, so that the regulations can be based on the experience of the pilots, which is what we were promised in the first place? We must elucidate the whole subject, which has come up on almost every amendment in one form or other.
<P>
I should like the Minister to assure the Committee that the Government will wait until they have drawn lessons from the pilots before they roll out the programme. Immediately after the general election, the Government rushed into pilots for the 18-to-24 programme. The national scheme was launched before anyone could realistically take account of the results of the pilots. It was Alastair Campbellism. The pilots were gimmicks; people were not seriously intended to take account of their conclusions. We shall not support Alastair Campbellism, gimmicks, frauds or facades. We shall support genuine progress and sound policies that have been properly considered.
<P>
We have had a good debate. I seriously suggest to the Minister that trainees for work-focused interviews should be asked to read the Hansard report of today's sitting as part of the training programme. I want the trainees to read the assurances that the Minister gave the Committee. They will then know the exact promises that the Government made. That would be a useful discipline.
<P>
If the Minister takes the task seriously, he will perform an enormously important job, which could affect the lives and happiness of millions of people. There are few more important jobs in government. I know that the Minister does not intend to run the programme as a clever gimmick, and that he does not believe that, if someone performs a few good spin doctoring exercises, it does not matter whether they have substance. I am sure that he is committed to substance. Conservative Members will support him if he does the job properly, but we shall be merciless in reminding him of his assurances and in hounding the Government if they fail to fulfil the important commitments that they made today.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Smith:</B> I shall try to respond to all the points that have been made in the debate. First, I shall deal with the matters on which the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford sought assurances. He asked whether the applicant would suffer any loss if the state requested or required an interview to be postponed. I can assure him that there will be no loss to the applicant.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman also asked whether we would extend the single work-focused gateway to those in work. We do not propose to do that. The priority is to help those who are at risk of dependency on benefit. However, I do not rule out the possibility of the programme's extension in future. As the hon. Gentleman suggested, we may be creating a personal advisory service that is relevant to those who feel threatened by the prospect of redundancy.
<P>
There is a clear difference between the new deal for young people and the single work-focused gateway. The schemes that we have discussed today are genuine pilot schemes, which we shall evaluate closely and from which we shall learn lessons. We did not claim that the pathfinder areas in the new deal for young people were pilots. We made it clear that there was no opportunity to change the design fundamentally between the pathfinder stage and the national roll-out. However, the pathfinder stage provided an opportunity to test the systems. It did that effectively.
<P>
In the hon. Gentleman's reference to timings, he confused the pilots. Those that began in October 1998, and others that started early in 1999, apply to the new deal for disabled people. Those pilots are on course. We recently rolled out the extra help that we shall make available.
<P>
Four pilots for the single work-focused gateway start on 20 June. The other eight&#151;four on the call centre variant and four on private and voluntary sector involvement&#151;begin in November. They are scheduled to run until 2002. We shall evaluate them closely as they develop. We have not made a commitment to roll out nationally, or to wait until 2002 before deciding to do that. The decision will depend on whether the pilots work satisfactorily.
<P>
I thank all members of the Committee for their support and for the consensus about an important and radical reform of the welfare system. As the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs said, there is an element of stick and carrot about the provision. However, he is wrong to claim that people will lose their benefits if they do not participate in the programme. If those who make an initial claim refuse to take part in an interview, they have not established their claim to benefit. Those who already receive benefit could, at worst. suffer a penalty.
<P>
The clause constitutes a radical reform, which will provide new help to claimants, effect a cultural shift and help us to tackle benefit dependency.
