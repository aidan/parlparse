Jonathan Djanogly</b> (Huntingdon) (Con): On a point of order,
Mr. Bercow. A letter from the Secretary of State dated 13 July about
the proceedings on the Bill has been received. I thought that I might
give the Minister the opportunity to read out that letter. It is
pertinent to our proceedings. If the Minister does not care to do so, I
am happy to do so
myself.</div><a name="06071885000009"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071885000429"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I am not sure that we are in the business of
having letters read out at any stage in the proceedings of the
Committee, unless the contents of the letter are especially appropriate
to the clause before
us.</div><a name="06071885000010"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071885000430"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Further to that point of order,Mr.
Bercow. The Secretary of State sent a letter to the shadow Secretary of
State. It was not sent to me. I do not know why it did not come from
the Minister for Industry and the Regions. It was not even copied to
me. Ten minutes ago the Minister&#146;s office called my office and
demanded a response to a letter that I had not received. The Minister
may wish to put on record, through a point of order, her position on
the
matter.</div><a name="06071885000011"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071885000431"></a>The
Minister for Industry and the Regions (Margaret Hodge):</b>
No.</div><a name="06071885000012"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071885000432"></a>The
Chairman:</b> The right hon. Lady had the opportunity to
respond to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s observations via a point of
order of her own, but the Committee will have noted that she declined
to do so.</div>
<a name="06071885000013"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071885000433"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Further to that point of order,Mr.
Bercow. I thank you for your forbearance, but there is a point to be
made. Basically, the Secretary of State said that if we did not accede
to his request simply to agree to all 350 new clauses, the Government
would withdraw them. Having asked for consolidation for four years, to
receive a petulant, three-day deadline to the Government&#146;s
consolidation proposals from a ministerial team parachuted in two
months ago is, frankly, pathetic.</div>
<a name="06071885000014"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although we wish for
consolidation and we hold to our agreement not to request material
changes to consolidation clauses unless outside parties find key
issues, I wish to place on record once again, in response to the
Secretary of State&#146;s letter, my concern that after eight
years&#146; consultation the Government saw fit to provide us with
some 300 additional clauses to be debated in one day on Report, which
is inadequate for the existing Bill let alone the new
clauses.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column735" />Column number: 736</div><a name="06071885000015"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071885000434"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> Further to that point of order, Mr.
Bercow. We had a discussion on this issue last Thursday. There was an
informal agreement outside the Committee that we would table the
clauses, that we would submit them to the Law Society for its expert
advice, and that the clauses were basically consolidation of other
legislation, with adjustments only to make them compatible with other
parts of the Bill. I invited both Opposition parties to have
discussions with me during the recess if matters of substance arose and
undertook to return to such matters on Report. That is perfectly
proper. We need reassurance from the Opposition parties&#151;we have
had it from the Liberal Democrats; I am sorry if the Tories do not talk
to each other&#151;that the procedure thatwe had agreed
informally would be adhered to appropriately. Otherwise, we cannot go
ahead with consolidation. If I may say so, Mr. Bercow, we are wasting
time that should be spent discussing the other
clauses.</div><a name="06071885000016"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071885000436"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I suggest that given the amount of
business that we have to conduct today and, very likely, also on
Thursday, it would make sense to draw these exchanges to a halt. The
hon. Gentleman&#146;s views have been placed very firmly on the
record. The right hon. Lady has had and has taken the opportunity to
reply. It now makes sense to get on with the business of the Bill. I do
not disregard the significance of what has been said, but it has been
said and there is little purpose in continuing
repetition.</div><a name="06071885000007"></a><h4 class="hs_8ClauseQn">Clause

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071885000437"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> May I say good morning to Committee
members?</div><a name="06071885000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">On Thursday
the Government Whip, the hon. Member for Birmingham, Hall Green (Steve
McCabe) was keen to move on to the takeover part of the Bill. This
morning, I was giving that some thought; could it have been a cynical
attempt to move quickly on to our starred amendments? Surely not, I
thought. Clearly, such appalling Government tactics would have led to a
breakdown of the usual channels and a breach of trust. No, it could not
have been that; he must have been keen to discuss the new role of the
panel. So I think that we should oblige
him.</div><a name="06071885000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">Since
Thursday&#146;s proceedings, a number of concerns about this part of
the Bill have been brought to our attention. Those concerns centre
mainly on the implementation of the European takeover directive. In the
same way, we do not believe that the Government have taken a
proportionate or measured response to the requirements set out by the
Commission.</div> <a name="06071885000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before I
get to the meat of the contentious issues at stake, it will benefit the
Committee to give some thought to the clause dealing with the takeover
panel. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column736" />Column number: 737</div>Richard Murley described the takeover panel as
follows:</div><a name="06071885000299"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Takeover Panel is the regulatory body which publishes and administers
the City Code on Takeovers and Mergers. It is concerned with takeovers
of companies whose shares are held by the public. The Code is designed
to ensure high business standards and fairness to shareholders.
Maintaining fair and orderly markets is crucial to this.</div>
<a name="06071885000300"></a><div class="hs_brev">The commercial merits of
takeovers are not the responsibility of the Panel; these are matters
for the companies concerned and their shareholders. Wider questions of
public interest are the concern of the governmental authorities in the
UK and, in some circumstances, the European Community, through the
Office of Fair Trading, the Competition Commission or the European
Commission.</div> <a name="06071885000301"></a><div class="hs_brev">The panel
was set up in 1968 in response to mounting concern about unfair
practices in the conduct of takeover offers. The composition and powers
of the Panel have evolved over the years as circumstances have changed
and the market place has developed.</div>
<a name="06071885000302"></a><div class="hs_brev">The essential characteristics
of the Panel&#146;s system of takeover regulation are flexibility,
certainty and
speed&#148;.</div><a name="06071885000024"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071885000438"></a>The
Solicitor-General (Mr. Mike O'Brien):</b> On a point of order,
Mr. Bercow. We have had an open discussion on the clause already. We
are now being treated to a handbook on the background to the takeover
panel that seems merely to be a time-wasting exercise. As Chairman, Mr.
Bercow, is there anything that you can do about
that?</div><a name="06071885000025"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071885000439"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I am grateful to the hon. and learned Gentleman
for his point of order, but I am listening attentively to proceedings,
as he would expect&#151;that is my responsibility. My patience is not
unlimited, but no disorder has yet
occurred.</div><a name="06071885000026"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071885000440"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Thank you for that confirmation of your
position, Mr. Bercow.</div>
<a name="06071885000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall
continue:</div><a name="06071885000303"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
essential characteristics of the Panel&#146;s system of takeover
regulation are flexibility, certainty and speed founded upon a
principles-based approach to regulation, enabling the parties to an
offer to know where they stand under the Code in a timely fashion. It
is important to the financial community that these characteristics
should be retained in order to avoid over-rigidity of the rules and the
risk of takeovers becoming delayed by litigation of a tactical nature,
which may frustrate the ability of shareholders to decide the outcome
of an offer.&#148;</div> <a name="06071885000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is
how the takeover code is run. Will the Minister explain how putting it
on a statutory footing and giving it criminal sanctions will retain the
&#147;flexibility, certainty and speed&#148; that make the panel so
effective?</div><a name="06071885000029"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06071885000441"></a><b class="B">James
Brokenshire</b> (Hornchurch) (Con): The point that my hon.
Friend is making about the statutory footing of the panel is important
and significant. Certainly, in previous operations, the strength of the
panel has been its flexibility, and almost the unwritten rule in the
corporate market and the City as a whole was that it should not be
breached&#151;it was almost self-enforcing. Does he believe that
there is a risk that that attitude, and the benefit of the previous
operations of the panel, might be challenged or threatened by putting
it on a significant
footing?</div><a name="06071885000030"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071885000442"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> On paper, there is a risk that that could
happen. From consultations that I have been 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column737" />Column number: 738</div>holding, not only with the panel but with interested parties and various
stakeholders, the feeling is that that will not happen. However, my
hon. Friend makes an important point; there is a possibility that it
might. To that extent, it is important that we investigate the
potential for wrongdoing. Things might be fine today but not
necessarily in a year or 10 or 20 years&#146; time. Hon. Members will
be fully aware that the last time that we looked at companies
legislation in the round was
1985.</div><a name="06071885000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">The code
comprises 10 general principles and 38 rules. However, it can be summed
up in four broad objectives that constitute the underlying purpose of
the panel and the code. Those objectives have remained unchanged
throughout the life of the code.</div>
<a name="06071885000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">The first and most fundamental
objective is to ensure quality of treatment between shareholders,
whether large or small. The second is the need for adequate and timely
information to enable shareholders to decide on the merits of an offer.
The third is the preservation of a fair market in the shares of
companies that are involved in takeovers. The fourth is to prevent the
boards of target companies from taking action that would frustrate an
offer against the wishes of the
shareholders.</div><a name="06071885000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
four broad objectives encapsulate the essential spirit of the code.
They underlie the 10 general principles that form the opening section
of the code. In turn, the general principles are applied in practice
through the 38 rules of the code and the accompanying
notes.</div><a name="06071885000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">The panel
administers the rules governing substantial acquisitions of shares,
which I mentioned to the Minister on Thursday&#151;and to which she
did not come back in her remarks. Those were devised to address the
practice, which developed in the early 1980s, of corporate predators
launching so-called dawn raids to purchase large numbers of shares in a
short period, mainly for major institutional shareholders. The SARs
govern the manner in which stakes of between 15 and 30 per cent. may be
acquired irrespective of takeover offers and require prompt disclosure
at each 1 per cent. step in that band.</div>
<a name="06071885000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">The effect of the SARs is to
slow down the rate at which substantial stakes in companies can be
built up so that boards can comment on such developments if they wish
and all shareholders have a greater chance of disposing of their shares
at any premium price that a significant buyer may be prepared to offer.
However, the SARs do not apply to a purchaser who has announced a
general offer for the company. Any such offer and associated share
purchases will be subject to the full rigour of the code.</div>
<a name="06071885000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">It has been proposed that the
SARs are to be abolished. I would be grateful if the Minister explained
the policy behind that decision. There are a number of rules in the
takeover code, and we need to explore some of them in greater detail as
they go to the heart of what the clause is all
about.</div><a name="06071885000037"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071885000443"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I hear what my hon. Friend says about
individual rules. Clause 642 sets out
that</div><a name="06071885000304"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The Panel
may do anything that it considers necessary or expedient for the
purposes of, or in connection with, its functions.&#148;</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column738" />Column number: 739</div><a name="06071885000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those are described in chapter 1 of part
24. To my mind, one of the strengths of the panel is the statement in
the blue book&#151;and I note that my hon. Friend has not read this
out&#151;that it is not only the letter of the law but the spirit of
the takeover code. Is he afraid that the statutory basis will undermine
the flexible application of the takeover rules, because the spirit of
the code will become rigid and legal and people will have to go through
a more formalistic box-ticking
exercise?</div><a name="06071885000039"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071885000444"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b><b class="B"> </b>My hon. Friend makes an
interesting&#151;a practitioner&#146;s&#151;point. In practice,
the delight of dealing with the panel is its adaptability and lack of
statutory status. That means that matters can be dealt with
efficiently, effectively and on a relatively informal basis. That
works. It is one of those institutions that has evolved its own style,
which is highly regarded not only in this country but around the world.
My hon. Friend is concerned that making the process statutory could
affect the workings of the panel, and that is a possibility in the
medium to long
term.</div>
<a name="06071885000394"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.45
am</div><a name="06071885000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is rare for
panel decisions to be taken to court. Judicial review is possible, but
it rarely occurs in practice, mainly because of the consensual approach
and people&#146;s respect for the institution. That could change, and
more court cases could arise because of the
statutes.</div><a name="06071885000041"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06071885000445"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Quentin Davies</b> (Grantham and Stamford) (Con): Is it not
the case that on every occasion when a panel ruling has been challenged
by the court since the panel came into existence 25 years ago, the
court has upheld the panel&#146;s
judgment?</div><a name="06071885000042"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071885000446"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I did not know that as an absolute fact, but I
knew that it was pretty much the case. I am grateful to my hon. Friend
for advising the Committee of it. It does not surprise
me.</div>
<a name="06071885000043"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06071885000447"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Jones</b> (Clwyd, West) (Con): Does my hon. Friend agree
that there is a further unknown quantity inherent in the proposed
legislation in that a fallback power is vested in the Government to
replace the panel as regulator? We might end up without any takeover
panel at
all.</div><a name="06071885000044"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071885000448"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> My hon. Friend makes a wise observation. To be
honest, he caught me off guard. This could be an issue and we ought to
give more thought to it before consideration on Report. I assure him
that we will consider it
further.</div><a name="06071885000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">I move on to
general concepts. The four broad objectives outlined have been the
basis for the code since it was first published in 1968. The first
version of the code contained 35 rules, and there are now 38. The rule
book is thicker because most of the individual rules are now
accompanied by notes on interpretations and practices established by
cases brought before the panel or the panel executive. It illustrates
how case law has developed the code.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column739" />Column number: 740</div><a name="06071885000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps the best-known rule in
the code is rule 9, which requires the person who acquires 30 per cent.
or more of the voting shares in a company to make a cash offer to all
other shareholders at the highest price paid in the previous 12 months.
That is a classic application of the requirement for equal treatment of
all shareholders. Control of a company cannot be bought by paying a
premium price to the controlling shareholder and leaving the remainder
behind with a new controller. For the code&#146;s purposes, 30 per
cent. of the voting rights is regarded as conferring effective
control.</div><a name="06071885000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">Rule 9 is
important because it provides a fair and proper safeguard for the
interests of shareholders with minority holdings. It is more effective
than the minority protection devices in other jurisdictions, which can
lead to undesirable consequences. For example, it has been argued that
it is because the US system lacks the equivalent of a 30 per cent. rule
that poison pills are needed to help the boards of defending US
companies to negotiate a fair deal for all
shareholders.</div><a name="06071885000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">Rule 11
requires the offer to include a cash alternative whenever an offeror
purchases offeree company shares during an offer period. Before July
1998, the obligation to provide cash was triggered only if 10 per cent.
or more of the voting rights for a particular class of share in an
offeree company had been acquired during the offer period or in
the 12 months preceding its commencement. That long-standing
provision will continue in force alongside the new
requirement.</div><a name="06071885000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">Accordingly,
under rule 11, the cash alternative must be made at the highest price
paid during the offer period or, if more than 10 per cent. has been
acquired, at the highest price paid during the preceding 12
months. The scope of the law has recently been extended to require a
full share offer where an offeror has purchased 10 per cent. or more of
the offeree company&#146;s shares in the three months before
commencement of the offer
period.</div><a name="06071885000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">Rule 16
prohibits deals unfavourable to particular shareholders. Rule 23
requires that shareholders be given sufficient information and advice
to arrive in good time at properly informed decisions regarding the
offer. It is founded on general principle 4 of the code. The rule 23
obligation, which attaches to all information provided to shareholders,
whether it emanates from the offeror or offeree, is reinforced by the
requirements of rule 3, which states that the company must appoint a
competent independent adviser, whose views on the offer must be made
known to all shareholders. As a result, they benefit from the
adviser&#146;s views as well as from the recommendation of the
directors, who may lack experience of takeovers or have vested
interests in the
outcome.</div><a name="06071885000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">Rule 8,
together with other disclosure rules, requires prompt disclosure of
market dealings by all relevant parties. Disclosure is the principal
way in which the panel seeks to preserve a fair market in the shares of
companies subject to bids. Since 1986, when it became apparent that
improved transparency of dealings would be necessary, rule 8.3 has
required daily disclosure of dealings by any holder of 1 per cent. or
more of a class of shares in a company involved in a takeover. Rule 20
requires information given to a preferred offeror by an offeree company
also to be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column740" />Column number: 741</div>given on request to competing offerors. That is an application of the
anti-frustration
principle.</div><a name="06071885000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">An offeree
company is not allowed to give the favoured suitor an unfair advantage
by providing it with information while at the same time depriving a
less favoured rival of the same information, thereby making it more
difficult for the latter to compete and perhaps denying shareholders a
better offer. Will the Solicitor-General confirm that no changes are
planned to those fundamental
rules?</div><a name="06071885000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would also
be helpful to learn what the panel considers is its role and how it is
to be made up. The panel states that it is
a</div><a name="06071885000305"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;regulatory body that
administers the City Code on Takeovers and Mergers. It is concerned
with takeovers of companies whose shares are held by the public. The
Code is designed to ensure high business standards and fairness to
shareholders. Maintaining fair and orderly markets is crucial to this.
The commercial merits of takeovers are not the responsibility of the
Panel; these are matters for the companies concerned and their
shareholders. Wider questions of public interest are the concern of the
governmental authorities in the UK and, in some circumstances, the
European Community, through the Office of Fair Trading, the Competition
Commission or the European
Commission.&#148;</div><a name="06071885000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is the panel&#146;s practice to focus on specific consequences for
shareholders of rule breaches, rather than simply on disciplinary
action, with the aim&#151;this is the point made by my hon. Friend
the Member for Hornchurch (James Brokenshire)&#151;of providing
appropriate redress. If the panel finds that there has been a breach,
it may have recourse to private reprimand, to public censure and to
reporting the offensive conduct to other regulatory authorities, such
as the Department of Trade and Industry or the Financial Services
Authority, as it thinks fit. That is one of the key issues that we will
deal with in every clause in this part of the Bill, and it is behind
what my hon. Friend
said.</div><a name="06071885000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">The panel draws
its membership principally from major financial and business
institutions, which nominate 11 members. That ensures a spread of
expertise in takeovers, securities markets, industry and commerce. The
panel has benefited since its inception from the support of the Bank of
England, and the Governor appoints the chairman, the deputy chairman
and four independent
members.</div><a name="06071885000056"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071885000449"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> My hon. Friend is talking about the rules in
the context of the panel. I note that he has had discussions with the
panel and certain other interest groups. Does he have a feel as to
whether, in the context of this changed regime, the panel will seek to
modify its rules? Will it make them more legalistic as a consequence of
the changes, as happened with the change in status of the stock
exchange rules, which became much more rigid and formulaic compared
with the rules that existed under the Yellow
Book?</div><a name="06071885000057"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071885000450"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> My hon. Friend asks a very important question
and I would be grateful if the Solicitor-General addressed the issue. I
do not believe, from my discussions with the panel and other parties,
that they feel that they are going to switch to a more tick-box,
statutory approach. All parties intend to maintain the current
adaptability. My hon. Friend earlier raised the question whether
putting the panel in statute will, over 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column741" />Column number: 742</div>time, lead to something different. That has yet to be seen, but it is
not my understanding from the interested
parties.</div><a name="06071885000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">The role of
the code committee is to be kept under review. Where appropriate, it
will put forward, consult on and make amendments to the substantive
provisions, such as the general principles and rules of the code and
the rules governing substantive dispositions of shares. I believe that
that is now
abolished.</div><a name="06071885000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">Members of
the code committee are appointed by the panel. There is a right of
appeal from the panel to the appeal committee in certain circumstances,
particularly where the panel finds a breach of the code and proposes to
take disciplinary action. An appeal may also be made in other cases
with the leave of the panel. The chairman of the appeal committee and
his deputy will usually have held high judicial office. The chairman
and deputy chairman are appointed by the Governor of the Bank of
England.</div><a name="06071885000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">One problem
with tying initial statements in the code to the content of the statute
is that the code pads things out and gives more background information.
Will the Solicitor-General confirm the position, even if it is just
that the background information will carry
over?</div><a name="06071885000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">The executive is
headed by the director general, who is usually an investment banker on
secondment. Some of the executive are permanent, which provides an
essential element of continuity. They are joined by lawyers,
accountants, stockbrokers, investment bankers and others on two-year
secondments. It is one of the more prestigious matters for a City firm
to be asked to second some staff to the panel, and secondment is an
important part of the education of a corporate finance lawyer or
accountant.</div>
<a name="06071885000062"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071885000451"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> One strength of secondments is the impact and
influence that they provide for practitioners in the field, who
therefore have greater commercial sense. Clause 642 states, in effect,
that the panel may make arrangements for any of its functions to be
discharged by persons, officers or members of staff. Does my hon.
Friend have any feel as to whether that will have implications for the
structure and nature of the panel and whether there will be an impact
on what I believe to be one of the panel&#146;s
strengths&#151;drawing resources from practitioners, rather than just
creating officiators of rules who do not necessarily have experience,
either before or after their time at the
panel?</div><a name="06071885000063"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071885000452"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> My hon. Friend makes a good point, and I would
be interested to know whether the Solicitor-General has heard any
concern that that might be the implication. I have not heard that that
might be the case and I certainly hope it will not be, in view of the
huge benefit that the City receives from people giving their time to
the panel, as well as the resulting joint experience, continuity and
consensual approach.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column742" />Column number: 743</div><a name="06071885000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">The executive monitors
takeovers, and checks all actions taken and all documents and
announcements issued for compliance with the code. It keeps
aclose watch on dealings in relevant securities and is
available for consultation and for rulings and interpretation before,
during and&#151;when appropriate&#151;after takeovers. The panel
encourages, and in some cases requires, early consultation so that
problems can be avoided. A major part of the executive&#146;s role is
to provide
guidance.</div><a name="06071885000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">The early
consultation provisions are one of the great benefits of the system. I
have no feeling that they will be affected by the workings of the Bill,
but if we became more formulaic and cautious of early discussions, and
became more form filling, that could be detrimental, because a great
advantage of the system is that it is possible to speak to the panel
before something
happens.</div><a name="06071885000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many
inquiries about the possible effects of the code on prospective
transactions need a swift response to allow the potential bidders, once
an offer has been announced, to meet the code&#146;s strict
timetable. The chairman&#146;s statement
says:</div><a name="06071885000306"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Director General&#146;s report describes the progress towards
implementation of the Takeovers Directive. The support shown by the
Government in its Consultative Document for the Panel&#146;s
independence and for a future regime which maintains the speed,
flexibility and certainty of the existing system has been welcome; we
understand that the comments from responding parties also support the
proposed approach. We will be working to ensure that the policy
outlined in the Consultative Document is ultimately adopted in the
legislation.&#148;</div><a name="06071885000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">It proceeds
to discuss the number of bids, saying that there is no sign of the
established pattern changing and
adding:</div><a name="06071885000307"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
number of appeals heard by the Panel from decisions of the Executive
has also remained
low&#148;.</div><a name="06071885000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">There were only
three in the last year. The chairman also says that he believes that
that</div><a name="06071885000308"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;reflects in
particular the relatively low level of hostile or competitive bids in
recent years, as well as the fairly settled nature of a number of the
key provisions in the
Code.&#148;</div><a name="06071885000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
statement
continues:</div><a name="06071885000309"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;However,
the trend towards offers being announced at a preliminary stage has
continued. There has been much comment about the increased incidence of
so-called &#145;virtual bids&#146;. Early announcements of possible
offers are made for a variety of reasons, but a leak, or fears of
leaks, is often a factor. Leaks are a source of great concern to the
Panel and the Executive co-operates with the Financial Services
Authority to facilitate its investigation of possible insider dealing
and other market abuse. Parties may also have other reasons for an
early announcement such as, for example, to allow due diligence to take
place or to allow other issues (such as obtaining clearances and
authorisations) to be
resolved.&#148;</div><a name="06071885000310"></a><div class="hs_brev">In
future the need for parties to negotiate with pension fund trustees and
to fulfil their obligations under the Information and Consultation
Directive will further add to the likelihood of early announcements.
The Code has been developed to cater for the rise in possible offer
announcements, both through the introduction of the &#147;put up or
shut up&#148; provision and through the regulation of statements made
by potential offerors and the regime applicable to
pre-conditions.</div><a name="06071885000311"></a><div class="hs_brev">The
code committee has had a busy year focusing on reform and updating of
the market-related provisions in the Code. In particular, the proposed
reforms of the regime for disclosure of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column743" />Column number: 744</div>interests held through derivatives and options have received much
attention and have been widely welcomed. The proposed changes provide a
good illustration of how the Code is able to keep pace with market
developments, and to ensure that fair and transparent markets are
maintained.&#148;</div><a name="06071885000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">Once again,
I have heard no reason why putting that code and its provisions in
statute will enable it to keep pace with market developments. Has the
Minister considered that
concern?</div><a name="06071885000395"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11
am</div><a name="06071885000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">The statement
continues:</div><a name="06071885000312"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I
am conscious that the Code Committee is only one of a number of
organisations which publishes detailed consultation documents which
have to be considered by industry bodies and others in the market. The
load these bodies bear is significant and I thank them for the care and
professionalism which they bring to their responses. Although the task
is heavy, the responses are highly valued and improve the ultimate
result.</div><a name="06071885000313"></a><div class="hs_brev">An important
part of the panel&#146;s activities involves cooperation with the
FSA. This extends beyond investigating potential instances of insider
dealing to looking into wider issues of market abuse and we have built
a close and constructive working relationship in the period since N2 in
2001. It is a priority for the Panel to ensure that the FSA is fully
informed and supported by the Executive in those areas of bid activity
where the FSA also has responsibilities for enforcement. Considerable
efforts are devoted by the Executive to ensure that this is in fact the
case. Our two organisations also work closely together on the way in
which the range of Directives that come out of Brussels should be
implemented in the field of takeovers. Apart from the Takeovers
Directive itself, each of the Market Abuse, Prospectus and Transparency
Obligations Directives will have implications for the regulation of
takeovers.&#148;</div><a name="06071885000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the
Minister confirm that, from the Government&#146;s point of view, the
co-operation that Peter Scott QC is talking about between the panel and
the FSA is in good working order and does not need a separate
review?</div><a name="06071885000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">The chairman
also said:</div><a name="06071885000314"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It
is the role of the Code Committee to keep the Code and the SARs under
review and to consider, consult on and make amendments as appropriate.
Such amendments might arise from specific experience, from market
developments or from the particular concerns of those operating within
the markets. During this past year, the work of the Committee has been
largely dominated by market developments and the concerns arising from
them.&#148;</div><a name="06071885000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not think
that Government intend to involve themselves in the role of the code
committee or to keep the code under review, but it would be good if the
Minister could confirm that for the
record.</div><a name="06071885000075"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071885000453"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> On that point, I think that the ongoing role
of the panel and how that sits within the regulatory regime is
important. Clause 642(2), in part 24,
states:</div><a name="06071885000315"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Panel may do anything that it considers necessary or
expedient&#148;.</div><a name="06071885000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">I note that
when we come on to further clauses, the issue arises of the definition
of a designated supervisory authority for the purposes of article 4.1
of the takeover directive. How does my hon. Friend envisage those
working together? How will the takeover panel sit in the overall
framework of financial services regulation? How will it be able to
ensure that its rules are complied with in that wider context and
framework?</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column744" />Column number: 745</div><a name="06071885000077"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071885000454"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> That is a tough one. My hon. Friend makes a good
and fair point. The basis of the relationship when one has discussions
with the panel, or anyone else, is one of mutual respect and
collaboration. As to the technical pecking order, I am no financial
services expert, but perhaps the Solicitor-General could put us right
on
that.</div><a name="06071885000078"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071885000455"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> My concern&#151;I am sure that we will come
on to this in greater detail later&#151;is about the criminal
sanctions and who will interpret the rules. While it may be for the
panel to say that the rules mean something, ultimately we are talking
about criminal sanctions and criminal liability, which may involve
other agencies interpreting what those rules
mean.</div><a name="06071885000079"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071885000456"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> That may have been part of the mindset of
putting the panel on to a statutory footing so that ultimately it can
stand up to others and have the clout that perhaps it theoretically did
not have as a non-statutory body. My hon. Friend makes a fair point.
Again, as to the pecking order, that will probably depend on the issue.
I should be interested to hear the Solicitor-General&#146;s views on
that.</div><a name="06071885000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is the
committee&#146;s practice, once it is agreed that something should be
pursued, to delegate preparation of a public consultation paper to the
executive, which consults as appropriate with parties who have a
particular interest or relevant expertise in the subject matter. Once
the committee has approved the PCP, it is published and made available
on the panel&#146;s website. Consultation periods are normally
between six and eight weeks, but may be longer if the subject is
particularly complex. The committee will then reach conclusions taking
account of all responses to the PCP and those conclusions are published
with the final code amendments in a response
statement.</div><a name="06071885000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">On occasion
the Committee may decide, in the light of responses received, to vary
this procedure by consulting further on a particular matter before
publishing a final response statement. Each response statement is also
available on the website. A full list of PCPs and response statements
published during the year can be found on the website. I should be
grateful if the Solicitor-General confirms that he foresees no conflict
between that consultation procedure and the statutory provisions in the
Bill. It is quite an important point because the panel generally
consults very widely on proposed changes to the code and it would be a
matter of concern if that system were affected in any way by the
provisions.</div><a name="06071885000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
committee&#146;s first publication of the year was PCP2004/3, which
addressed a number of market-related issues concerning the treatment of
the code and the SARs of dealing activities of persons during the
course of an offer. In particular it addressed dealings by principal
traders and fund managers and the relaxations of the usual presumptions
of concertedness that would apply when a principal trading or fund
management operation is part of the same group as a party or an adviser
to a party to a code transaction: the application of the disclosure
requirements of rule 8 of the code for certain dealings; the
application of the definitions of &#147;acting in concert&#148; and
&#147;associate&#148; in certain situations; and the procuring by
an offeror or an offeree company of irrevocable commitments and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column745" />Column number: 746</div>letters of content in the making of statements of shareholder
support<i class="I">.</i> A number of other miscellaneous matters relating to
dealing activities were also discussed, including stock borrowing and
lending.</div> <a name="06071885000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">We can see
that the nature of consultation is important and is also very much an
ongoing process. There was also broad support for most of the proposals
in the PCP, but a few proved to be controversial. An executive carried
out further consultation with interested parties in the light of which
the committee made amendments to its original proposals particularly as
regard to presumptions of concertedness. The committee also adopted a
number of other clarifying changes to its proposals in the light of
comments made and published its full response in RS2004/3 in March
2005. The committee delayed the implementation of the code amendments
arising from its consultation by approximately six weeks to give
practitioners time to familiarise themselves with the detailed
technical changes. That shows the adaptability of the panel and the
impact of consultation on rule
changes.</div><a name="06071885000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall give
one more example. In January the committee embarked on the first stage
of a major consultation on dealings in derivatives and options by
parties to an offer, their concert parties and other market
participants, which has been in the news a lot recently. The volume of
such dealings has increased significantly in recent years, and the
executive&#146;s experience in certain cases led the committee to
believe that the rules on substantial acquisitions of shares should be
amended to reflect the change in practice.</div>
<a name="06071885000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">In view of the importance and
complexity of the matter the committee decided to consult, first in
PCP2005/1, on the outline of its proposals. That consultation paper
elicited strongly held views from a number of practitioners and was
followed with further consultation by the executive of the parties
concerned. Taking account of the views expressed, the committee
published in early May 2005 the second stage of the consultation,
PCP2005/2, which included detailed proposals for amendments to the code
on the disclosure of dealings in derivatives and options. It is now
considering responses to a further consultation paper on the impact of
controlling such dealings by parties to an offer and those whose
interests fall into the 30 to 50 per cent. band, which will be
published in due course. There have been three layers of consultation,
which shows how much the panel is prepared to undertake. It has been a
busy year for the panel but, as busy as it is, it undertakes
consultations and as a result has the respect of the City. Will the
Solicitor-General confirm that the application of the statue will not
effect the way in which the panel conducts its
consultations?</div><a name="06071885000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
takeover directive itself is the guts of the provisions and, some would
say, the reason why the changes have been proposed. The executive has
spent a considerable amount of time preparing for the implementation of
the directive. It has worked closely with officials from the Department
of Trade and Industry and is grateful for the constructive approach
that they have taken. The Government published their proposals for the
implementation in a consultative document in January 2005. On the same
day, the panel published an explanatory paper expanding on the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column746" />Column number: 747</div>Government&#146;s proposals. The Government have stated that
implementation will be by primary legislation, and here we are today.
If implemented as proposed, the directive should ensure that the key
benefits of the panel system remain in place. The panel will become a
statutory body and there will need to be a number of adjustments to its
constitution. There will be measures to ensure that the orderly conduct
of bids will not be disrupted by tactical litigation, and the panel
will be given extra powers, although the key features of its sanctions
regime will remain unchanged. Much of our debate will focus on those
extra powers.</div><a name="06071885000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
executive believes that parties to a bid and their advisers will
experience little change in their dealings with it following
implementation of the directive. Practitioners will still be able and
encouraged to consult the executive in advance, and the secondment
system that has served the panel well over the years will remain. The
executive will still be able to interpret the code flexibly to offer
the right solution depending on the circumstances of a case, and it
will still expect to respond quickly to inquiries. Parties unhappy with
a decision of the executive will be able to seek a hearing of the panel
in the same way as they can today. Thus, although the system will have
a statutory framework, the day-to-day impact will be small. It is
important that the Solicitor-General put on record his agreement with
that.</div> <a name="06071885000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the
Solicitor-General also confirm that now the panel is to be put on to a
statutory footing, there will be no change in the essence of its
constitution? It has proved remarkably successful and it would be folly
to tamper with an institution that is not
broken.</div>
<a name="06071885000396"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.15
am</div><a name="06071885000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">Current law on
takeovers and the Government&#146;s proposed changes are set out well
in a briefing note that we have received from the Practical Law
Company. A number of important issues arise from it, and I will ask the
Solicitor-General for his views on certain changes to the law. The
briefing
states:</div><a name="06071885000316"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;From
20 May 2006 when the Directive on Takeovers Bids... was
implemented in the UK, the Panel on Takeovers and Mergers... has
been placed on a statutory footing in relation to takeover offers to
which the Directive applies and Code Rules that have been amended or
adopted due to the requirements of the Directive. The Panel has been
specifically designated as the supervisory authority to carry out
various regulatory functions in relation to takeover offers to which
the Directive
applies.</div><a name="06071885000317"></a><div class="hs_brev">Although
legislation to implement the Directive in relation to takeovers is
contained in Part 24 of the Company Law Reform Bill, as the Bill is not
anticipated to become law until 2007 and the Directive was required to
be implemented into national law by 20 May 2006, interim regulations
were introduced. The Takeovers Directive (Interim Implementation)
Regulations 2006... were introduced to implement the Directive for
an interim period from 20 May 2006 until the enactment of the Bill when
the Regulations will cease to have effect. The Regulations generally
only apply to transactions to which the Directive applies, namely to
takeover offers for companies whose securities are admitted to trading
on a regulated market, which includes the London Stock Exchange but not
AIM.&#148;</div><a name="06071885000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">At the
end of our last sitting, I asked Ministers to elaborate on that and
explain to the Committee whether the regulations, which have been in
place for a couple of months, have worked smoothly and whether 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column747" />Column number: 748</div>any immediate changes have been considered since implementation. To the
extent that provisions of the Bill mirror provisions in the statutory
instrument, clearly we would not want to pass law knowing that
something that had already been implemented was not working. Therefore,
from 20 May 2006 until the enactment of the Bill, there is to be a
two-track regime.</div><a name="06071885000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
briefing
continues:</div><a name="06071885000318"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;For
transactions outside the scope of the Regulations (for example a scheme
of arrangement or a takeover offer for a company whose shares are
admitted to trading on AIM) the Panel and the Code will continue to
operate on a non-statutory basis as they did prior to 20 May
2006.</div> <a name="06071885000319"></a><div class="hs_brev">For offers to
which the Regulations apply (offers for companies whose securities are
admitted to trading on a regulated market) the Panel will have a number
of statutory powers of enforcement in relation to those of the Code
Rules that have been adopted or amended in order to implement the
provisions of the Directive. Such Code Rules will therefore also have
statutory force from 20 May 2006 (but only in relation to offers to
which the Directive applies).</div>
<a name="06071885000320"></a><div class="hs_brev">In practice, however, the Code
remains mandatory for all transactions to which it applies, as there
are a number of sanctions available to ensure compliance including
public censure from the market place and the risk of sanction by the
UKLA or other regulated bodies of which the relevant parties to the
offer are members and which co-operate with the Panel and operate a
mutual exchange of information.</div>
<a name="06071885000321"></a><div class="hs_brev">As a result of the
implementation of the Directive and certain other consultation
procedures by the Code Committee of the Panel prior to 20 May 2006, a
number of changes were required to be made to the Code and a new
edition of the Code (the eighth) has been published and took effect on
20 May 2006... The Code Rules apply to all offers and other
transactions and companies to which the code applies.</div>
<a name="06071885000322"></a><div class="hs_brev">The changes that have been made
to the regime governing takeovers as a result of the implementation of
the Directive are therefore found in two principal places: the
Regulations; the Code, as
amended.</div><a name="06071885000323"></a><div class="hs_brev">Article 11 of
the Directive was introduced with the intention of preventing pre-bid
defences, such as share transfer restrictions, enhanced voting rights
attached to shares, for example multiple voting rights and other
restrictions on voting rights from being put in place, by providing
that once a bid is made public, the offeror will be able to over-ride
(or &#145;break-through&#146;) any of the following
provisions...</div>
<a name="06071885000324"></a><div class="hs_brev">Any restrictions on the
transfer of securities in the target company&#146;s articles of
association; any restrictions on the transfer of securities contained
in any contractual arrangements between the target company and its
shareholders; any restrictions on voting rights contained in the target
company&#146;s articles of association or in contractual arrangements
between the target company and its shareholders.</div>
<a name="06071885000325"></a><div class="hs_brev">In the case of any voting
restrictions, wherever contained, these will not then be valid at any
general meeting held for the purposes of voting on defensive or
frustrating measures regulated by the Directive. Any shares to which
multiple voting rights attach will only have one vote per share at a
general meeting which decides on any frustrating action in connection
with the bid. Where any such special rights are so removed, the
Directive provides that &#145;equitable compensation&#146; should
be paid to the relevant shareholders in respect of their loss of such
rights.</div><a name="06071885000326"></a><div class="hs_brev">On the basis
that these &#145;break-through&#146; provisions caused concern
during the consultation process, the Directive also provides for member
states to elect to opt-out of the arrangements... The UK
Government has decided to opt-out of such arrangements on the basis
that they prefer to leave shareholders of companies to make the
decision as to whether to implement such pre-bid defensive measures
(although such measures have not been commonly adopted by UK
companies). The Directive provides that where a member state elects to
opt out of the &#145;break-through&#146; provisions, it must
nevertheless&#148;&#151;</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071885000457"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> On a point of order,Mr.
Bercow. I realise that the hon. Gentleman is reading from a long,
scripted brief that has been provided by some organisation, the name of
which I am afraid I have forgotten, as it has been so long since he
started reading. At the same time, the brief seems to be about
breakthrough provisions, which we are going to discuss later. Trying to
deal with them during a debate on clause 642 stretches the credulity of
the Committee more than a
little.</div><a name="06071885000093"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071885000458"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I am happy to respond to the point of order from
the Solicitor-General. I have studied the clause carefully. It is
short, but it has broad scope. I am as keen to ensure orderly conduct
in the Committee as he
is.</div><a name="06071885000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">I assure all
members of the Committee that I listen faithfully to everything that is
said. As I said earlier, my patience is not unlimited, but so far the
hon. Member for Huntingdon (Mr. Djanogly) has remained perfectly in
order. I fear that the point of order is in fact a point of
frustration.</div>
<a name="06071885000095"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071885000459"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Thank you, Mr. Bercow. Frustrated as the
Solicitor-General may or may not be, I am grateful for your ruling, and
I simply point the Solicitor-General to clause
642(2):</div><a name="06071885000327"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Panel may do anything that it considers necessary or expedient for the
purposes of, or in connection with, its
functions.&#148;</div><a name="06071885000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is
exactly what I am talking
about.</div><a name="06071885000097"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06071885000460"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Shailesh Vara</b> (North-West Cambridgeshire) (Con): In view
of the comments made by the Solicitor-General, I remind the Committee
of the comments made by the Minister for Industry andthe
Regions, when she wrote to me on 14
June:</div><a name="06071885000328"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I am
conscious that you may have questions of various sorts as the Bill
proceeds. Often these will be points that you will want to raise with
me or my colleagues in Committee and I do not wish in any way to limit
our discussions there.&#148;</div><a name="06071885000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would like to think that all we are doing is taking up the Minister on
her very kind
offer.</div><a name="06071885000099"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071885000461"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> My hon. Friend makes a fair intervention; I had
forgotten about that. It all seems so long ago, but it is an important
point that he makes. I am sure that the Minister would not resile from
her intent, so let us continue on that
basis.</div><a name="06071885000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">Regulations 20
and 21 set out the detail on the procedures to be followed by a UK
company opting in and out of the breakthrough provisions. A company
that wishes to opt into the breakthrough provisions will need to pass a
special resolution. It can do that only if it has met certain specific
conditions. The company must have voting shares admitted to trading on
a regulated market&#151;that is, effectively, the potential offeree
company to which the directive
applies.</div><a name="06071885000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
company&#146;s articles of association must not contain any share
transfer restrictions or restrictions on voting rights, or, if the
company&#146;s articles of association contain any such restrictions,
they must also contain provision for such restrictions to fall away in
the circumstances in which they would be disapplied under the
breakthrough provisions of article 11 of the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column749" />Column number: 750</div>directive. The company&#146;s articles of association must not contain
any other provisions that would be incompatible with article
11.</div><a name="06071885000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">No shares
conferring special rights on the company may be held by any Minister or
any of his nominees or any company that he directly or indirectly
controls. A company may, at a later stage, elect to opt back out of the
breakthrough provisions, in which case it will need to pass a further
special resolution for that purpose. However, a company that has opted
in may not subsequently opt out for a period of one year from the date
on which a copy of the opting-in resolution was forwarded to the
registrar.</div><a name="06071885000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">The panel
must be notified of the passing of a special resolution either opting
in or opting out of the breakthrough provisions. Where the company has
voting shares admitted to trading on a regulated market in a member
state of the European economic area other than the UK, the supervisory
authority designated under the directive in that EEA member state must
also be notified of the passing of the special resolution.</div>
<a name="06071885000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">Notification must be given
within 15 days of the passing of the relevant special resolution or, if
admission to trading on a regulated market in another EEA member state
occurs at a date after that of the relevant special resolution,
notification must be made within 15 days after such an admission
date.</div><a name="06071885000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">Where a takeover
offer is made for a company that has opted into the breakthrough
provisions, a bidder who holds not less than 75 per cent. in value of
all the voting shares in the target company may requisition an
extraordinary general meeting in accordance with the provisions of
section 368 of the Companies Act
1985.</div><a name="06071885000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">The effect of
opting in for a UK company is that any pre-bid defensive measures put
in place will be invalid once the bid is made public. The
Solicitor-General will be pleased to know that I shall leave the matter
there, because, as he correctly said, we will return to it and discuss
it at greater length in due
course.</div><a name="06071885000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">I move on to
directors&#146; reports. Regulations 25 to 28 introduced additional
disclosure requirements relating to directors&#146; reports for a
company in respect of its financial year beginning on or after 20 May
2006 and whose securities carrying voting rights were admitted for
trading on a regulated market at the end ofthe
company&#146;s financial year. The provisions are supplemental to the
requirements relating to directors&#146; reports in section 234ZZA of
the 1985 Act.</div><a name="06071885000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of
the main reasons for the additional requirements is to ensure the
provision of more publicly available information on the
company&#146;s share structure, including any restrictions relating
to the company&#146;s securities, such as restrictions on their
transfer or on voting rights, which might impact on a takeover and
details of agreements that contain change of control provisions that
could be triggered by a takeover
offer.</div><a name="06071885000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">Directors&#146;
reports must cover the following matters: names of the directors for
the relevant financial year; the principal activities of the company
and any subsidiaries during the relevant financial year; and the
amount, if any, that the directors recommend bepaid as a
dividend. Concerns have been raised overthe disclosure of
directors&#146; pay details in bid 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column750" />Column number: 751</div>documentation, and I would be grateful if the Solicitor-General gave us
his views on that.</div><a name="06071885000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
relation to schedule 7 to the 1985 Act, in addition to the matters that
must be included pursuant to section 234ZZA, the directors&#146;
report for those companies whose securities carrying voting rights are
admitted to trading on a regulated market at the end of the
company&#146;s financial year must include the following details: the
structure of the company&#146;s share capital, including particularly
the rights and obligations attaching to the shares or classes of share,
and, where there is more than one class of share, the percentage of the
total share capital represented by each class.</div>
<a name="06071885000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">The following details are
required for company securities of any class that are not admitted to
trading on a regulated market: any restrictions on the transfer of the
company&#146;s securities, including limitations on holding
securities and requirements to obtain the approval of the company or
other shareholders for the transfer of securities; in relation to each
significant securities holder, whether the holding is direct or
indirect, the identity of the holder, and the size and nature of the
holding; where any securities are held that carry special rights
regarding control of the company, details of the identity of the
holder; where the company has an employee share scheme and the shares
to which the scheme relates have rights regarding control of the
company that are not exercisable directly by the employees, details of
how such rights are exercisable; any restrictions on voting rights,
including limitations on voting rights of holders in a given percentage
of numbers of
votes&#151;</div><a name="06071885000112"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071885000462"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> My hon. Friend is stating for the Committee
the clear details of the directive. The regulations, as he rightly
said, relate to companies whose shares are traded on a regulated
market. He identifies the fact that the alternative investment market
is not so regulated. In the current situation, the rules apply
equally&#151;at least they did before May&#151;to all plcs, whether
they are listed on the official list or on the AIM. Does he feel that
the rules he is describing will be applied to AIM companies, albeit
while the panel is wearing its non-statutory hat, given that the
companies will not be caught in that
context?</div><a name="06071885000113"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071885000463"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I think the answer is no, but the
Solicitor-General might comment usefully on this. I would be grateful
to hear his views on that important
point.</div><a name="06071885000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">I had come to
restrictions on voting rights. <i class="I">[Interruption.]</i> The
Solicitor-General is laughing. I am not here to provide free legal
advice, so we shall rely on him
today.</div><a name="06071885000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">The report must
include any limitations on voting rights of holders of a given
percentage of numbers of votes; deadlines for exercising voting rights
and arrangements by which, with the company&#146;s co-operation,
financial rights attached to the securities are held by a person other
than the holder of the securities; any agreements between holders of
securities that are known to the company that might result in
restrictions on the transfer of securities or on voting 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column751" />Column number: 752</div>rights; rules that the company has on the appointment and replacement of
directors or the amendment of the company&#146;s articles of
association; the powers of the company&#146;s directors, including
any powers in relation to the issuing or buying back by the company of
its shares; any significant agreements to which the company is a party
that take effect, alter or terminate on a change of control of the
company following a takeover bid; and the effects of any such
agreements other
than&#151;</div><a name="06071885000397"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.30
am</div><a name="06071885000116"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071885000464"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I have listened very carefully and I
recognise the considerable knowledge that the hon. Gentleman has of
such matters, but I am conscious too of the terms of the clause,
specifically the significance of the role of the panel. It seems to me
that the hon. Gentleman is now straying somewhat wide of the clause,
and I must ask him to focus his remarks specifically on the regulatory
and prescribed functions of the panel.</div>
<a name="06071885000117"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071885000465"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Thank you for that clarification,Mr.
Bercow. On that basis, let me shorten my remarks. My intention is to
provide scope through the clause that sets out what we shall talk
about, what the basic constitution of the panel is and the areas that
will be affected by the provisions.</div>
<a name="06071885000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause will, for instance,
have implications for offers to overseas shareholders and a timetable
for exercising the squeeze-out. You are quite right,Mr.
Bercow, to say that we shall come to those issues in more detail when
we discuss applications to the court. That is important in relation to
the panel because with takeover offers that are subject to the schedule
2 procedure, a dissenting shareholder who has applied to court will
need to show that the offer value is unfair before the court will
require consideration of a higher value to be paid in respect of the
shares to which the application relates.</div>
<a name="06071885000119"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071885000466"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> On a point of order,Mr.
Bercow. Can you clarify something? As I understand it, the hon.
Gentleman has already set out his initial points on clause 642 and, on
the last occasion that the Committee sat, the Government then responded
to those initial concerns. I think we are now dealing with the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s response to the Government, which seems a little
verbose.</div>
<a name="06071885000120"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071885000467"></a>The
Chairman:</b> The subject of verbosity could constitute an
essay in itself, as the Solicitor-General and other members of the
Committee will be only too aware. My concern is not with verbosity or
prolixity, but with the maintenance of good order and fair play. This
is a debate and therefore even if the hon. Member for Huntingdon is
coming back on points that have been raised previously, that is
certainly not in itself out of order, but in
order.</div><a name="06071885000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">At this stage,
I want to emphasise that as the hon. Gentleman develops and, possibly,
concludes his remarks, it is not sufficient merely to animadvert to the
responsibilities of the panel and then to dilate on other matters. He
must focus on the responsibilities of the panel and that, I am sure, is
what he is about to do.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column752" />Column number: 753</div><a name="06071885000122"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071885000468"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I am indeed, Mr. Bercow. I shall move on to
other concerns that we have about the constitution of the panel and its
activities.</div><a name="06071885000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of the
amendments that was recently proposed by the panel code committee will
elaborate on that point&#151;that is, the revised provisions for
details of service contracts of individual board directors and target
companies. The committee argued that requiring the disclosure of
payments to individual directors was in line with current corporate
governance practice. Another proposed change would require a target
company in a unilateral offer to spell out in its first major circular
any known material changes in its financial or trading position since
its last published and audited accounts.</div>
<a name="06071885000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">The code committee said that it
was still waiting on several third-party reviews before finally
deciding whether the lending and borrowing of shares during a takeover
period should be subject to the same disclosure rules as other
dealings. Meanwhile, it wants to amend the code to enshrine the current
stance that such transactions are not normally regarded as dealing. At
the same time, it is proposed that the disposal of voting control over
shares should be considered dealing for disclosure purposes. The
possibility of a target company&#146;s seeking a temporary suspension
of trading in its shares ahead of making an announcement that it had
been approached would be removed under another proposed
change.</div><a name="06071885000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">The committee
said that it was unlikely, in any case, that such a suspension would be
granted. It would be helpful if the Solicitor-General gave us an update
on the position in relation to the concerns that have been
raised.</div> <a name="06071885000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">We believe
that such concerns that will become more pressing now that the takeover
panel is to be put on a statutory footing. One key issue that emanates
from the clause is, as my hon. Friend the Member for Hornchurch said,
the relationship between the panel and the courts. Proceedings of the
panel are, like those of other public administrative bodies, open to
judicial review by the courts. Leave to apply for judicial review has
been sought in very few instances. One is the Datafin case, which
related to rival bids for McCorquodale in December 1986 and in which
the Master of the Rolls, Lord Donaldson, held
that</div><a name="06071885000329"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in the light of the
special nature of the Panel, its functions, the market in which it is
operating, the timescales which are of interest in that market and the
need to safeguard the position of third parties, who may be numbered in
thousands, all of whom are entitled to continue to trade upon an
assumption of the validity of the Panel&#146;s rule and decision,
unless and until they are quashed by the court, I should expect the
relationship between the Panel and the court to be historic rather than
contemporaneous. I should expect the court to allow contemporary
decisions to take their course, considering the complaint and
intervening, if at all, later and in retrospect by declaratory orders
which would enable the Panel not to repeat any error and would relieve
individuals of the disciplinary consequences of any erroneous finding
of breach of the
rules.&#148;</div><a name="06071885000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Guinness case was the subject of a Court of Appeal judgment in July
1988. In that case also, the courts indicated their reluctance to
interfere in the panel&#146;s decisions. Lord Diplock held that there
was a public interest in the panel&#146;s acting to enforce the code 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column753" />Column number: 754</div>and that as no injustice had been done by the panel&#146;s refusal to
adjourn its case against Guinness, there was no case for judicial
review.</div><a name="06071885000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Court of
Appeal&#146;s approach was confirmed in late 1988, when Grand
Metropolitan sought judicial review of the panel&#146;s decision not
to require any remedy for breaches of the code that the panel held had
been committed by Irish Distillers and Pernod Ricard, when the latter
was gathering irrevocable undertakings to support its successful
offer.</div><a name="06071885000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">The High Court
refused to grant Grand Metropolitan an expedited order for the judicial
review hearing on the grounds that the Court of Appeal had made it
plain that such proceedings were not intended to reverse panel
decisions taken in the course of takeovers. As a result, the
proceedings were discontinued. Such judgments demonstrate the
courts&#146; support for the panel and lend authority to its
decisions.</div><a name="06071885000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Court
of Appeal&#146;s decision in the Datafin case underlies the
DTI&#146;s approach on the tactical litigation package proposed as
part of the takeover directive implementation proposals. It is intended
that the implementing legislation should neither undermine nor be
inconsistent with the proposals established in that case. Last
Thursday, I asked the Minister to set out the Government&#146;s
position on that. She did not respond in much detail, so I would be
grateful if the Solicitor-General addressed the matter
further.</div><a name="06071885000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
mentioned the relationship that has existed so far between the panel
and the courts. My other question relates to the European aspect of the
matter. Bob Sherwood has some interesting things to say in an article
in the <i class="I">Financial Times</i>, in which he claims that new measures in
the proposed European takeover directive will be unworkable and act as
a deterrent to bid activity in
Europe.</div><a name="06071885000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">In a damning
attack on the latest draft of the directive, some of the
country&#146;s most prominent merger and acquisition lawyers say that
it will create problems that the European Commission has not even
considered. In a letter to the European Commissioner for the single
market and MEPs, they claim that there are significant technical
problems with some new provisions that, if not addressed, will make the
provisions unworkable in practice, providing a significant deterrent to
takeover activity in Europe as well as interfering with free capital
markets activity.</div><a name="06071885000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
plans, which were unveiled in an effort to complete the directive after
13 years of wrangling, aim to create a level playing field across
Europe. However, the provisions would limit the ability of companies to
thwart bids through privately agreed restrictions on the transfer of
securities and voting rights. Many believe that the changes are an
attempt to placate Germany, where companies feel vulnerable after the
stock market
slide.</div><a name="06071885000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">Germany has
complained that the voting rights of companies in Scandinavia and
France give power to a privileged few and form barriers to takeovers.
Lawyers from the City of London Law Society claim that the moves could
have the opposite effect and that if a directive was introduced with
provisions that had the unintended effect of restricting proper and
lawful activity, takeover activity could be restricted. If groups 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column754" />Column number: 755</div>were able to set aside restrictions on voting rights, problems could be
created for dual-listed companies, for
example.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071885000469"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> My hon. Friend is setting out some rightful
concerns about the effect of the takeover directive on the roles and
functions of the panel and its administration. The panel has developed
its rules over a considerable period, taking account of market effect.
From the article that he has referred to, does he know the
panel&#146;s feelings about the interpretation of those rules and
regulations and the possible impact on the flexibility that has been
the panel&#146;s strength for such a long
period?</div><a name="06071885000136"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071885000470"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> For the most part, the panel probably feels that
events in Europe have gone our way, but not in the totality. This is a
fast-moving field in which European national Governments are reviewing
takeover rules to get the best for their own countries&#151;French
yoghurt manufacturers come to mind. We could be entering a difficult
period for the constitution of the panel in relation to
Europe.</div><a name="06071885000137"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071885000471"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> A small point: I think that the suggestion
from the article is that takeovers might be more difficult and
inhibited by the directive. One strength of our economy&#151;this is
an important factor&#151;has been a flexible approach to the rules on
companies bidding and how that has tied in to the roles and functions
of the panel. Is my hon. Friend suggesting that there is a risk that
that competitive advantage to our economy, provided by the structure of
our corporate takeover laws, might be reduced, even slightly, as a
consequence of the
directive?</div><a name="06071885000138"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071885000472"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> To be fair, a lot of the concerns have been
ironed out. We have gone some way, but that does not make my hon.
Friend&#146;s points any less important. I would be grateful for the
Solicitor-General&#146;s
views.</div><a name="06071885000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">Other companies
employ a certain ownership structure for tax reasons. Lawyers warn that
any changes could land companies with a big tax bill and that the
proposals do nothing to facilitate the takeover of companies where
there are large stable blocks of investors such as family owners.
Herbert Smith has said that it has a lot of sympathy with some
objectives of the proposals, but that they will create lots of
technical problems&#151;technical details often determine whether
takeovers succeed or
fail.</div><a name="06071885000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is an
important point and one that we should remember as we discuss this part
of the Bill. It is often not the high-level issues, but the
nitty-gritty, that is used in a takeover battle, particularly to thwart
a bidder&#146;s
movements.</div><a name="06071885000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is the
European take on the matter. It is worth pointing out how other member
states have implemented the takeover directive without resorting to,
for instance, heavy-handed criminal sanctions. For example, in Ireland,
if rules are breached, there is only a civil liability. The same is
true in Germany. Our concerns can be addressed differently from the
Government&#146;s proposals. We will come to the detail in later
clauses.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071885000473"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. It is open to hon. Members to quote from
an article, or indeed a series of articles. The convention, however, is
that they do just that: quote from the article. A continued recitation
of virtually the whole content of a series of articles is probably not
in order. I say that with due caution, because I recognise that the
hon. Gentleman is seeking to inform the debate. However, he said that
he would confine himself to the short version and I know that he would
not want to leave the Committee to wonder what would constitute the
long
version.</div><a name="06071885000144"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071885000474"></a>Mr.

The long version is on my desk and that is why I am being picky as to

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071885000475"></a>Mr.

those who are interested to

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071885000476"></a>Mr.

<div class="Column"><a name="Column756" />Column number: 757</div><a name="06071885000148"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06071885000477"></a><b class="B">Justine
Greening</b> (Putney) (Con): Is my hon. Friend saying that a
risk is being created that people might seek to challenge competition
laws, so that rather than wait until the takeover has occurred they
might directly challenge the takeover in the courts, using the takeover
panel code, as well as going down the Office of Fair Trading or
Competition Commission
route?</div><a name="06071885000149"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071885000478"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Yes. The fact is that until a recent statutory
instrument was put in place, the way to challenge panel decisions was
through panel procedures, and ultimately through judicial review, which
was very rarely used. The article that I just read out quoted a series
of City solicitors who said exactly that. The fact that matters are
being put on a statutory basis changes the legal environment and will
create more opportunities for legal cases. My hon. Friend is right to
highlight that.</div> <a name="06071885000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
make my comment on gold-plating clear to Committee members who are new
to this subject, we need to spend some time examining how we reached
this point in relation to takeovers. If you will forgive me, Mr.
Bercow, I will quote a relevant comment from &#147;A
Practitioner&#146;s Guide to the City Code on Takeovers and
Mergers&#148;, which is one of the key documents. It
states:</div><a name="06071885000337"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Having
at different periods over the past 14 years either languished in
stalemate or been subject of intense political negotiation, a strategic
trade-off was achieved in November 2003 between the European
Parliament&#146;s Internal Market and Legal Affairs Committee and the
Council on a compromise text for the Takeover Directive, which in turn
was approved by the European Parliament on 16 December 2003. On 21
April 2004 the European Parliament and the Council of the European
Union adopted the Takeover Directive. Member states are required to
implement the Directive...The Takeover Directive is an important
part of the European Union&#146;s financial services action plan
which is aimed at creating integrated market and financial services
throughout the EU. The original objective of the Directive was to
provide a common framework for the regulation of takeover bids in the
EU. However, over the course of the lengthy negotiations leading to its
adoption, the finally agreed text has been significantly watered down
from the Commission&#146;s original proposal and therefore falls far
short of setting a uniform standard of takeover rules throughout the
EU. For example, it proved impossible to reach a consensus amongst
Member States on the need for offeree company boards to be prevented
from taking defensive measures. The decision as to whether to impose
these restrictions is therefore optional for each member state under
article 9 of the Takeover Directive. The Panel believes this is a major
weakness of the Takeover Directive as a harmonising measure and,
because the directive is a &#145;minimum standards&#146; directive
and provides little by way of detail, harmonisation in many other areas
of takeover regulation is at a low
level.&#148;</div><a name="06071885000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">That goes very
much to the point that my hon. Friend the Member for Hornchurch
made.</div> <a name="06071885000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">The guide
continues:</div><a name="06071885000338"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Accordingly,
while the Panel believes that the directive will do little to improve
the UK system of takeover regulation, if implemented appropriately, it
will allow the current working approach of the Panel to continue
largely unchanged.&#148;</div><a name="06071885000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
gives some answer to my hon. Friend&#146;s earlier remarks. I should
be grateful to hear the Solicitor-General&#146;s views on
that.</div> <a name="06071885000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">The guide goes
on to say:</div><a name="06071885000339"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
first stage of the DTI&#146;s implementation process has commenced
with the publication of its Consultative Document in January 2005. On
the same date, the Panel published an 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column757" />Column number: 758</div>Explanatory Paper setting out in broad terms how it intended to put in
effect the necessary changes that will result from the Directive and
the Government&#146;s proposals. The Panel has been engaged in
detailed discussions with the DTI in preparation of its proposal for
implementation of the Directive with a view to ensuring that the Panel
and the key features of its current system of regulation of takeover
bids<i class="I">, </i>promulgating rule changes and administering and applying
the Code are
retained.&#148;</div><a name="06071885000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">That was
backed up by the statement I read out from the panel itself. The guide
continues:</div> <a name="06071885000340"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
particular the Panel has stressed the importance of preserving the
flexibility of<i class="I"> </i>approach and the speed and certainty of
decision-making which the current system
offers.&#148;</div><a name="06071885000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again, that was
repeated in the panel&#146;s statement.</div>
<a name="06071885000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">The guide then says:</div>
<a name="06071885000341"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The proposals from the
DTI Consultation Document reflect this approach and in particular
provide for the Panel to act as a supervisory authority for the
purposes of the Directive. The proposals are also founded upon the
continued independence of the Panel and have been designed to ensure
that the day-to-day constructive working relationship between the Panel
and its regulated community will be largely
unaffected.</div><a name="06071885000342"></a><div class="hs_brev">The DTI
has considered various options for implementing a regulatory framework
for takeover bids in connection with the Takeover Directive and
ultimately it has recommended the establishment of a &#145;light
touch&#146; statutory regime in primary legislation, which will give
the Panel the necessary rule making and other powers to carry out its
role as the supervisory authority under the Takeover
Directive.&#148;</div><a name="06071885000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the DTI has recommended a light-touch approach, please will the
Solicitor-General explain how we have come to be debating the
implementation of criminal sanctions for a breach of the takeover code?
In what possible way could criminal sanctions be considered a light
touch?</div>
<a name="06071885000159"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071885000479"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> On a point of order,Mr.
Bercow. As you are aware, the criminal sanctions are not a matter
directly for the
panel.</div><a name="06071885000160"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071885000480"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I think it would be regarded as a matter of
debate. At this stage I am happy for the hon. Gentleman to develop his
remarks, but I will be listening
intently.</div><a name="06071885000161"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071885000481"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Thank you, Mr. Bercow. I am not going to pursue
that point further here. The matter is relevant to the debate, but
because we shall debate it later on, I will not say the same thing
twice.</div><a name="06071885000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">The guide
continues:</div><a name="06071885000343"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
DTI&#146;s proposals for the implementing legislation include
measures to limit the possibility of tactical litigation in takeover
bids (which has been a key feature and advantage of UK takeovers) and
measures to grant immunity to the Panel and those involved with it in
the exercise of its regulatory
functions.</div><a name="06071885000344"></a><div class="hs_brev">The changes
that will be required by the DTI&#146;s implementation proposals
affect both the Panel and the Code. The changes to the Panel relate to:
(1) the scope of its jurisdiction, its constitution and the functions
of its constituent committees; (2) new powers to obtain information and
enforce the Code; (3) sanctions that the Panel will be able to impose;
and (4) confidentiality of information and co-operation between the
Panel and regulatory authorities in the UK and
overseas.&#148;</div><a name="06071885000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">It will not
surprise the Committee to hear that we shall concentrate on those
issues as we debate this part of the Bill.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column758" />Column number: 759</div><a name="06071885000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">The guide
says:</div><a name="06071885000345"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
conjunction with this, the Panel has decided to take the opportunity to
review its own internal procedures and operations (including its
judicial procedures). The scope of the Panel&#146;s jurisdiction will
be changed as a result of the Takeover Directive.
</div><a name="06071885000346"></a><div class="hs_brev">The scope of the
Directive is different from and generally narrower than the current
scope of the Code. The DTI is however proposing that the Panel&#146;s
regulatory authority under the legislation should cover both companies
and transactions covered by the Directive and those other companies and
transactions which do not fall within the scope of the Directive but
which are currently regulated by the Panel (for example, schemes of
arrangement, dual holding company transactions and partial offers). It
also proposes that the Panel should have the flexibility to make rules
to deal with future market developments in the field of takeovers as
they arise.&#148;</div><a name="06071885000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is a
key element in retaining flexibility. Perhaps the Solicitor-General
could confirm that that is the Government&#146;s intention.</div>
<a name="06071885000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">The guide
states:</div><a name="06071885000347"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
changes to the jurisdiction of the Code are proposed to include the
following:</div><a name="06071885000348"></a><div class="hs_brev">(1) the
current residency test which applies to the UK registered and traded
companies will no longer
apply;</div><a name="06071885000349"></a><div class="hs_brev">(2) the Code
will continue to apply to offers for listed and unlisted public and
certain private companies essentially in the same way as it does now.
Accordingly, the residency test will continue to apply to these
companies; and</div><a name="06071885000350"></a><div class="hs_brev">(3) as
required under article 4.2 of the Directive, the Panel will have shared
jurisdiction with other EU and Member States in certain cases where
registration of the company and admission to trading of its securities
are split and/or effected simultaneously on several regulated markets
within the EU. Except in these so-called &#147;shared
jurisdictions&#148;, the Code will continue to apply to takeover and
merger transactions, however effected. This will include partial
offers, offers from minorities, schemes of arrangement and dual holding
company transactions...The DTI is proposing that the implementing
legislation should establish the basic framework of the Panel&#146;s
constitution but that the Panel, which will continue as an
unincorporated association, will retain the discretion to determine the
details. The proposed changes to the Panel&#146;s constitution have
been summarised.</div><a name="06071885000351"></a><div class="hs_brev">In
order to comply with the Directive, the DTI has noted in its
Consultation Document that it will be necessary to provide the Panel
with certain new enforcement powers to ensure &#145;that all parties
comply with the rules made or entered in pursuant to [the]
Directive&#146;. Central to these new powers will be a right for the
Panel to require persons in possession of information which is
reasonably required by the Panel and the conduct of its activities, to
pass that information to the Panel. The proposed revised Introduction
to the Code will also set out in greater detail the Panel&#146;s
expectation of co-operation from those with whom it deals with. The DTI
is also proposing that the Panel should be given the power to make
rulings restraining any breach (or possible breach) of the Code or a
Panel ruling, or requiring a person to take such steps as the Panel may
specify in order to remedy the breach or secure compliance. In
addition, the Panel is to be given a power to require the payment of
compensation in cases where there has been a breach of certain rules of
the Code. Finally, the DTI is also proposing that the legislation
should provide the Panel with further powers to enforce compliance,
compensation rulings and requests for documents and information if
necessary. This is to be effected by granting the Panel the power to
make an application to the court to secure compliance with a Panel
ruling or request and failure to comply with the resulting court order
would amount to a contempt of
court.</div><a name="06071885000352"></a><div class="hs_brev">The Code
Committee has also identified that some changes will be required to the
mandatory bid provisions in Rule 9.&#148;</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column759" />Column number: 760</div><a name="06071885000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have discussed that, so I shall not go
into it again. The guide
states:</div><a name="06071885000353"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Finally,
the DTI has proposed in its Consultation Document that the UK
Government &#145;opts in&#146; to Article
9&#148;.</div><a name="06071885000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again, I dealt with
that issue before.</div>
<a name="06071885000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is the background. As the
Attorney-General said
himself:</div><a name="06071885000354"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
starting point is Article 17 of the takeovers directive, which requires
member states to put in place sanctions which are &#145;effective,
proportionate and dissuasive&#146;. That is to ensure the rules of
the directive are complied with&#148;.&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report,
House of Lords, </i>28 March 2006; Vol. 680, c.
GC304.]</div><a name="06071885000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">The directive requires
that a failure to comply with the rules about bid documentation must be
subject to sanctions that satisfy article 17. The Government&#146;s
approach is that the only option that satisfies that requirement is
criminal sanctions. They believe that the panel will otherwise not have
sufficient power effectively to deal with a failure to comply with the
rules about bid
documentation.</div><a name="06071885000399"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12
noon</div><a name="06071885000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
do not think that that is the case. The panel already has effective
sanctions. Although the panel is a non-statutory body, the remedies and
sanctions that are available to it have proved sufficient to ensure
compliance with the code and the SARs and been effective in practice.
Where the panel finds a breach of the code, its first concern is to
secure the appropriate remedy, which might be a retraction or
clarification of a misleading statement or the revision of an offer.
Where appropriate, the panel might require compensation for
shareholders.</div> <a name="06071885000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">An
example of that was the panel&#146;s rulingthat Guinness
should make payments totalling approximately &#163;75 million to some
former Distillers shareholders as a remedy for breach of rule 11 of the
code during its 1986 bid, when it purchased shares from certain
Distillers shareholders for cash at a higher price than that which was
available to shareholders generally under the
offer.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071885000482"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> My hon. Friend makes a valid point about
sanctions, about the rights that the panel already has and will
continue to need, and therefore about how it would exercise its
functions going forward. Will he comment on the unwritten arrangements
that operate in the financial markets? For example, a criticism that
might seem quite light in the more general context of regulation is
seen as extremely serious in the context of financial markets. An
individual who is the subject of an adverse opinion from the panel
might find it extremely hard to continue employment within the
financial market or to seek employment
elsewhere.</div><a name="06071885000174"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071885000483"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> My hon. Friend goes right to the heart of the
issue. That is why most practitioners and companies do not believe that
there is a need for criminal sanctions. The ultimate sanction of having
one&#146;s name read out by the panel is one that no director,
business man or shareholder would want to face, because it would
basically mean that no one would do business with them again. The
existing sanction is every bit as effective in destroying a
person&#146;s career as a criminal sentence, if not more so. It has 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column760" />Column number: 761</div>been sparingly used in practice, because whenever it is raised things
normally tend to happen quickly and be put right. My hon. Friend makes
an important point that we shall no doubt debate again when we discuss
criminal
sanctions.</div><a name="06071885000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">The panel
already has effective sanctions&#151;public and private censure or
reporting of conduct to another regulatory body. It can also issue
directions to those responsible to put the matter right and can order a
person to pay compensation to put the matter right, an example of which
I have just given.</div>

thatthe Bill as drafted allows the takeover panel to order the
payment of compensation if certain specified rules are broken. The
panel has stated that that will apply to those codes of rules dealing
with the payment of money. Please could the Minister give some guidance
on what parameters, if any, are likely to be ordered in relation to
that? That would be useful for all parties concerned in takeover bids
and would clear up some confusion about what the parameters are.
Concrete guidance on the matter could prevent future arguments which

in relation to panel decisions, and the fact that bidders are prevented
from exercising rights to exit from certain deals. Does he believe
that, although there is a feeling that judicial review actions will not
be encouraged as a result of the statutory basis, examples of this
nature and the change in the way in which the panel is
constructed&#151;and the rules that it

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071885000493"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Thank you, Mr. Bercow. I shall do my best to
comply with your ruling. The point that I was making on Terra Firma, by
the way, was that the coverage shows that the takeover panel&#146;s
existing powers have proved effective in dealing with powerful City
players. I was putting that point in the context of the proposals to
criminalise the sanctions. I am sorry if I was long-winded or not
clear.</div><a name="06071885000192"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071885000494"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> On a point of order,Mr.
Bercow. The discussion has been broad; for example, we have considered
sanctions, which are dealt with in clause 652, at considerable length.
I trust that when we come to such clauses you will bear it in mind that
there has been discussion on them. That will no doubt be reflected in
the way in which we may discuss those clauses at that
time.</div><a name="06071885000193"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071885000496"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Of course I agree with the Solicitor-General. We
have taken such an approach throughout our proceedings. <i class="I">[Laughter.]
</i>There are many, many articles that I could be rooting out. The
point is that the naming and shaming of advisers who flout acquisition
rules will always be the main weapon in the takeover panel&#146;s
arsenal as it clamps down on companies using takeover rules as an
excuse to hide details from investors. If that is no longer to be the
case, it could have profound and unwelcome
consequences.</div><a name="06071885000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
point that comes from the articles is that, throughout its existence,
the takeover panel has held that the fear of public rebuke alone is
often enough to keep the City in line. It would be helpful if the
Solicitor-General could accept that. If not, will he set out cases in
which the panel has failed in its role by not having done so? It is
worth noting that the panel has recently become more effective, as
shown in a July 2006 article in the <i class="I">Financial Times. </i>It states
that a French bank</div><a name="06071885000366"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;was
forced to admit it had hired an investment bank to study the
UK&#146;s seventh-largest bank as part of an assessment of potential

I should perhaps declare an interest in this point of order. Is it in

would be a problem with the author&#146;s copyright? I fear that it

will be.</div>

eloquence and manner of delivery in quoting from the articles, it is
fair to say that the point that my hon. Friend is trying to convey may
be best summed up in the language of a journalist&#151;to allow those
of us who are not lawyers to appreciate it in a layman&#146;s
way&#151;rather than through legalistic delivery, which is common
practice in such a Committee. Would my hon. Friend agree with
me?</div><a name="06071885000200"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071885000501"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. As the morning has progressed, I have
noticed that interventions, even when carefully constructed, have
tended to get longer and longer. I would urge hon. Members to exercise
a self-denying ordinance. An intervention is supposed to be just
that&#151;an intervention&#151;rather than a mini
speech.</div><a name="06071885000201"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071885000502"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Thank you, Mr. Bercow. The problem with long
interventions is that they hold up proceedings and make it all a much
longer business. To push on, I shall pithily read out the key points
that it is important to ask and which the 6 July 2006 <i class="I">Financial
Times</i>
raised:</div><a name="06071885000367"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Some
bankers believe the FSA&#146;s greater focus on market abuse,
particularly since the introduction earlier this year of the EU
Takeover Directive, may be encouraging the Panel to be quicker on the
draw.</div> <a name="06071885000368"></a><div class="hs_brev">While it is
inevitable that the level of speculative bids and market abuse will
rise in a robust mergers and acquisitions environment, forcing a bidder
to declare its hand too early can make completing a transaction very
challenging. &#145;If you are looking for a recommendation, it is
important for a target company to hear principal-to-principal about an
approach first, rather than read about it in the press because of a
panel statement following a leak,&#146;...This is particularly
relevant to private equity bids, which are often highly dependent on a
raft of pre-conditions, such as due diligence, the agreement of pension
fund trustees and the recommendation of the board.</div>
<a name="06071885000369"></a><div class="hs_brev">Ironically, bouncing bidders
into making a statement early can work to their
advantage.</div><a name="06071885000370"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#145;By
coming out early, a potential bidder can quickly get a market view on
whether it should proceed with a bid or not, which is helpful to them
and retail investors&#146;
&#148;.</div><a name="06071885000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">My point is to
question whether the speed element will be affected by statutory
codification. That would be detrimental from all commentators&#146;
points of
view.</div><a name="06071885000203"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06071885000503"></a><b class="B">Steve

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071885000505"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I never knew Whips to have humanitarian
concerns. No, I take that back absolutely 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column764" />Column number: 765</div>and unreservedly. We further believe that that is not an appropriate
area for criminal offences as failure to comply with the rules could in
itself constitute a criminal offence. Those rules are made by the
takeover panel itself. Although the panel will become a statutory body,
it will retain a great deal of its independence. It will be an
independent body&#151;subject to parliamentary scrutiny&#151;able
to alter its own rules and create new criminal
offences.</div><a name="06071885000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, we
do not propose that the way to rectify that is through greater control
of the takeover panel. The panel is one of the great City success
stories and has been effective in carrying out its purpose. Burdening
the panel with more bureaucracy would not be in the best interest of
its smooth running. There is a simpler, more straightforward way ahead.
Would the Solicitor-General please explain why the panel cannot be
allowed to deal with the breach by means of sanctions under the Bill,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071885000507"></a>The

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071885000508"></a>The

back to the panel about the seriousness with which the Conservative

largely irrelevant to the clause, although they are in order, as you

Crispin Blunt</b> (Reigate) (Con): I have been doing a slight
study of this matter, and my hon. Friend is entirely correct. At
precisely this time a week ago, we were considering clause 158, which
is an important part of the Bill, and the same is true of the
provisions relating to the takeover panel. Our discussion of clause 158
took slightly longer than one sitting, but that did not prevent us from
covering 261 clauses last week. My hon. Friend should continue to lay
out the groundwork for this important debate on the takeover panel, and
I am sure that those who are watching the debate will be perfectly
satisfied that Her Majesty&#146;s Opposition take the issues very
seriously.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071885000512"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Thank you, Mr. Bercow. My hon. Friend the Member
for Reigate (Mr. Blunt) makes the point very well.</div>
<a name="06071885000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of our concerns, which
needs to be discussed, relates to barriers to takeovers and to the fact
that the panel needs to maintain a level playing field. One of the
central controversies during negotiation of the directive related to
the extent to which the directive should address in substance barriers
to takeovers in the EU. There are numerous examples of such barriers,
but they might loosely be characterised under two headings: pre-bid and
post-bid defences. As the Government have stated, they have long
supported reducing barriers to takeovers in Europe, and that is
certainly a Conservative party policy objective. It was a key UK
objective to ensure that the directive included provisions on post-bid
defences.</div> <a name="06071885000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
important issue in considering barriers to takeover provisions was the
question whether it was appropriate to ring-fence the
directive&#146;s provisions from bids made by third-country
offerors&#151;companies registered outside the EU. It was argued that
it would be unfair for EU companies, which might be subject to a
radical liberalising regime under the directive, to be exposed to bids
from companies from outside the EU, which would be allowed to maintain
vigorous defences to takeovers. On that latter point, City and business
consultees stressed the advantages of the open takeover regime that
operates in the UK no matter where the bid is located.</div>
<a name="06071885000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">All those issues came to be
dealt with under the banner of the level playing field, reflecting the
need to achieve some equity in the manner in which the directive
addressed post-bid and pre-bid defences and to deal with the question
of parity with third-country takeover regimes. Ultimately, it became
impossible for political agreement to be reached on a directive that
would deal robustly with defence measures, and a proposal was made that
sought to overcome that hurdle by making optional key articles 9 and
11, which deal with barriers to takeovers. That solution was adopted to
secure final agreement to the directive, and optionality operates at
three levels, as I discussed in general terms earlier. Although I shall
not discuss that again at this stage, we shall return to it.</div>
<a name="06071885000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, to assist in exposing
barriers to takeovers<i class="I">&#151;[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i>
Finally on this point, the hon. Member for Birmingham, Hall Green will
be pleased to hear. To assist in exposing barriers to takeovers across
the EU, extensive disclosure and transparency provisions were laid down
in article 10 of the directive, and they apply on a continuing basis to
all companies admitted to trading in a regulated market in the EU.
There are consequently three policy choices to be made: whether all
companies registered in the UK whose shares are admitted to trading in
a regulated markets should be obliged to comply with the requirements
of article 9; whether such companies should be obliged to comply with
article 11; and whether the UK should adopt reciprocity
provisions.</div> <a name="06071885000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
provisions of article 9 have long been at the heart of the takeover
code, in rule 21, as the key to protecting minority shareholders. They
include the fundamental principle that it should be for
shareholders&#151;not the management of the target company&#151;to
decide on the merits of a takeover bid. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column766" />Column number: 767</div>Throughout the negotiations on the directive, important UK city and
business stakeholders emphasised their support for article 9 and the
principles underlying it. The Government therefore intended that the
implementing legislation should require all companies registered in the
UK and admitted to trading in a regulated market to be bound by the
obligations of article 9. The detailed provisions relating to article 9
would be laid down in the rules made under the proposed rule-making
power, to extend to the takeover panel, and would be set out by the
panel.</div> <a name="06071885000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
currently no restrictions on the way in which UK companies that are
admitted to trading in a regulated market can structure their share
capital and control. However, market pressure, brought to bear in
particular by institutional investors, has ensured that there are now
few UK-listed companies with differential voting structures or
restrictions on transfer of shares for voting rights. Such structures
are, however, more prevalent elsewhere in the EU. It would be helpful
if the Solicitor-General would respond to those
points.</div><a name="06071885000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
ever-changing nature of company law also gives rise to issues to be
considered. In an age of virtual bids and derivatives it is sometimes
the adaptability of the panel that needs to be examined, to assess
whether it can cope with company law, as it changes from time to time.
I want to refer to an article about Mr. Richard Murley, who was the
director general of the takeover panel. He said that his time there was
marked by the rise of the &#147;virtual bid&#148;, as well as a
lengthy debate about disclosure and regulation of derivatives, such as
contracts for difference. The article
continued:</div><a name="06071885000371"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;After
two stages of consultation, the new regime on disclosure of derivative
positions during offer periods came into
effect&#148;</div><a name="06071885000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">and quoted Mr.
Murley as
saying:</div><a name="06071885000372"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;What
we have tried hard to do is keep the rule book up to date with
what&#146;s going on in the
market&#148;</div><a name="06071885000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">and
adding:</div><a name="06071885000373"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Offerors
now expect days if not weeks of due diligence before they even
bid.&#148;</div><a name="06071885000224"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071885000513"></a>Steve
McCabe:</b> On a point or order, Mr. Bercow. What part of the
clause is the hon. Gentleman referring to at that
moment?</div><a name="06071885000225"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071885000514"></a>The
Chairman:</b> The answer to that is that the debate is on
clause stand part, so the hon. Gentleman is not obliged to state the
part of the clause that he is referring to or to have his remarks
traced back to any particular provision in the clause. The Question is
that the clause stand part of the
Bill.</div><a name="06071885000226"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071885000515"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The article
stated:</div><a name="06071885000374"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Evolution
in bid practices and financial instruments inevitably means the Panel
more often adds to the Takeover Code than subtracts from it.</div>
<a name="06071885000375"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#145;The reason the book is
more complex is that deals are more complex,&#146; Mr. Murley said.
But that complexity is focused in certain discrete areas: the
disclosure regime and activities of integrated houses. The rules on the
conduct of bids, he argues, are quite simple.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column767" />Column number: 768</div><a name="06071885000376"></a><div class="hs_brev">The Panel, moreover, removes
language that is no longer necessary. For example, it is proposing to
delete rules governing the timing of substantial acquisitions of
shares, added in the 1980s era of &#145;dawn
raids&#146;.</div><a name="06071885000377"></a><div class="hs_brev">The
overall approach in drafting rules, Mr. Murley said, &#145;is to have
the flexibility to respond to things that were not anticipated when a
rule was put into the
Code&#146;.</div><a name="06071885000378"></a><div class="hs_brev">It took
the same approach with the European directive. Where changes were
necessary to comply with it, &#145;we&#146;ve tried very hard not
to do more than the increment required. We&#146;ve tried very hard
not to
gold-plate&#146;.</div><a name="06071885000379"></a><div class="hs_brev">As
a result, although the Panel is due to become a statutory body after 37
years in various degrees of nonstatutory existence, the way it works is
not expected to change that
much.</div><a name="06071885000380"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#145;The
Panel is known for speed, flexibility and certainty,&#146;
Mr Murley said, and he is confident that will not
change.&#148;</div> <a name="06071885000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is
pleasing to
hear.</div><a name="06071885000401"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.30
pm</div><a name="06071885000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">The article
continued:</div><a name="06071885000381"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;But
some things are much different these days. Investment bankers used to
be prized for deal-doing skills and detailed technical knowledge of the
rule books. Now they are more business-driven and revenue-focused and,
apart from a few specialists in each bank, less focused on
technicalities. This means a bigger role for law firms; each keeps a
database of its Panel experience and skills. But the UK system is still
marked by an absence of litigation. Even though lawyers are involved,
dealing with the panel executive&#151;often entailing consultation,
guidance and negotiation&#151;is not like going to court. The
executive is the &#145;first port of call in a quasi-judicial
system&#146;,Mr. Murley said. Very few decisions of the
executive are appealed to the full Panel&#151;only five in his
two-and-a-half years, of which only one was overturned. The
panel&#146;s main concerns remain an orderly market and shareholders
in target companies. &#145;We think very much about them, especially
individual shareholders,&#146; Mr. Murley said. There will still be
plenty for his successor to
do.&#148;</div><a name="06071885000229"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071885000516"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. This is a verbatim recital of the terms
of the article, as far as I can see. I must exhort the hon. Gentleman
either to explain how exactly the terms of the article relate to the
Question whether the clause should stand part of the Bill or to
discontinue his reading of it.</div>
<a name="06071885000230"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071885000517"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The application of the article,Mr.
Bercow, is to explain the concern of Conservative Members that
codifying and providing a statutory framework should not put the speed
and flexibility that exist in the current system at risk. It was also
to explain that the takeover panel itself does not believe that it will
be put at risk and then to ask the Government to confirm their
understanding that it will not be put at
risk.</div><a name="06071885000231"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071885000518"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. The hon. Gentleman&#146;s explanation
is clear and it is entirely in order for him to develop that argument.
I simply appeal to him to respect the point that in adducing academic
or journalistic support for his position, he does so with brief
quotations rather than total recitations.</div>
<a name="06071885000232"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071885000519"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Thank you, Mr. Bercow. The problem being that so
many of these quotations are useful in supporting my argument. One gets
tempted into saying a little more than one perhaps ought.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column768" />Column number: 769</div><a name="06071885000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">Briefly, I shall go on to
restrictions on disclosure, and that aspect of the clause. In Grand
Committee in the House of Lords, Lord Hodgson raised concerns that this
part of the Bill allows the takeover panel to disclose virtually any
information it acquires to a wide range of bodies. We shall return to
that in greater detail.</div>
<a name="06071885000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">The fear in respect of
companies&#146; confidential information is a real one. If it were to
be realised, it could be highly detrimental to UK plc. Perhaps the
Solicitor-General could explain the background to these exclusions to
protection from onward disclosure, especially in
relation&#151;</div><a name="06071885000235"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071885000520"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I believe I am right in saying that
disclosure is covered in clause 648, so the hon. Gentleman is certainly
not at liberty to talk about that now. I feel sure that he has no
intention of doing so.</div>
<a name="06071885000236"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071885000521"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> You are absolutely right, Mr. Bercow.
</div><a name="06071885000237"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071885000522"></a>Justine
Greening:</b> It is interesting that my hon. Friend strayed on
to clause 648, because unfortunately for the Committee, clauses 647 and
648 are inextricably linked. Clause 647 is about the power to collect
information, which is clearly the information set that clause 648 could
require disclosure of, so I can easily see how he might have strayed
off on to clause 648. I, too, am looking forward to getting on to that
topic.</div><a name="06071885000238"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071885000523"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. The hon. Lady is generous and charitable
in her interpretation of what motivates the hon. Member for Huntingdon.
Although I entirely accept the point about one clause being
inextricably bound up with another, we must nevertheless follow the
principle of a chronological sequence. It is for that reason that he is
not at liberty to dilate on that later clause, to which we will, in any
case, come in due
course.</div>
<a name="06071885000239"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071885000524"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Thank you for that clarification,Mr.
Bercow. I take the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Putney
(Justine Greening), and we shall come to that
later.</div><a name="06071885000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">You are rising
ever more frequently to your feet,Mr. Bercow. I appreciate
that there are many other clauses in this part of the Bill on which we
will be able to elaborate our points. I have made wide points on clause
642 and established a framework on which discussions can take place. On
that basis, I look forward to the remainder of the
debate.</div><a name="06071885000241"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071885000525"></a>Mr.
Vara:</b> I shall add a few comments. I am mindful that my
hon. Friend has raised some of the points that I wanted to make. I
shall try not to repeat them, but by necessity I might need to refer to
some of them.</div><a name="06071885000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
takeover panel fulfils an important role in business and we need to
ensure that its operation is as flexible as possible. In view of the
statutory issue that has arisen, I urge the Solicitor-General to give
an assurance that that flexibility will remain. The business
environment is fast-moving and the terms used in 1985 Act are
different from those used now. For example, the term &#147;virtual
takeover&#148; did not exist then, and we need to ensure that there
is sufficient flexibility 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column769" />Column number: 770</div>for the panel to move quickly and adapt to a changing business community
before we introduce the next Companies Act, which may well be in many
years&#146; time.</div><a name="06071885000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall quote in part an article in the <i class="I">Financial Times</i> by Una
Saigol, which illustrates clearly the panel&#146;s difficulty. It
states:</div><a name="06071885000382"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Panel has a difficult balancing act to achieve. On the one hand, it has
a duty to protect a target company and its employees from a prolonged
period of uncertainty, which can destabilise a business, as well as
protecting
shareholders.&#148;</div><a name="06071885000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
article goes on to give an example with which I shall not trouble the
Committee. It then
continues:</div><a name="06071885000383"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It
can also be costly for the target company to be in an uncertain offer
period,&#148;</div><a name="06071885000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">as a particular
company found out when it had to pay &#163;2.6 million in fees alone.
On the other hand, to highlight the difficulty that it faces, the
article states:</div><a name="06071885000384"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
Panel has to ensure that there is no false market in
shares.&#148;</div><a name="06071885000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
article
continues:</div><a name="06071885000385"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
March, the UK market regulator said it had found widespread signs of
improper share price moves before corporate takeovers are
announced.&#148;</div><a name="06071885000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">With that in
mind, the article introduces the concept of the takeover panel working
closely with other organisations, particularly the Financial Services
Authority.</div><a name="06071885000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also wish
briefly to quote the panel&#146;s most recent annual report. The
chairman, Peter Scott QC, mentions the importance of the panel&#146;s
activities for other organisations, particularly the FSA. One paragraph
states:</div><a name="06071885000386"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;An
important part of the panel&#146;s activities involves cooperation
with the FSA. This extends beyond investigating potential instances of
insider dealing to looking into wider issues of market abuse and we
have built a close and constructive working relationship... It is
a priority for the Panel to ensure that the FSA is fully informed and
supported by the Executive in those areas of bid activity where the FSA
also has responsibilities for enforcement. Considerable efforts are
devoted by the Executive to ensure that this is in fact the case. Our
two organisations also work closely together on the way in which the
range of Directives which come out of Brussels should be implemented in
the field of takeovers. Apart from the Takeovers Directive itself, each
of the Market Abuse, Prospectus and Transparency Obligations Directives
will have implications for the regulation of
takeovers.&#148;</div><a name="06071885000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would very
much welcome an assurance from the Solicitor-General that the
flexibility of which we speak will be maintained.</div>
<a name="06071885000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">The panel is subject to
appointments, and I refer to the comments made in another place by the
Attorney-General, Lord Goldsmith, who
said:</div><a name="06071885000387"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;My...point
is the inclusive make-up of the panel. It currently includes
representatives from a wide variety of City and other organisations,
such as institutional investors and bankers as well as business. That
ensures a balance of views from Cityand business
participants.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of
Lords,</i>28 March 2006; Vol. 680, c.
GC286.]</div><a name="06071885000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would welcome the
Solicitor-General&#146;s assurance that appointment to the panel will
be strictly on an arm&#146;s length basis, that people will be
appointed entirely on merit, that no element of the &#147;old pals
act&#148; will operate, and that there will be total
transparency.</div><a name="06071885000252"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071885000526"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman know how
members of the panel are currently appointed, and why does he think
that change is needed?</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column770" />Column number: 771</div><a name="06071885000253"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071885000527"></a>Mr.
Vara:</b> I was hoping to be brief, but I will happily give
the Solicitor-General the example of the appointment earlier this week
of two people to the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of England.
Questions
arose&#151;</div><a name="06071885000254"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071885000528"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. Those matters have absolutely nothing to
do with the composition of the panel, and I therefore
exhort&#151;indeed, instruct&#151;the hon. Gentleman not to be
drawn down the blind alley of a generalised discussion about the
meritocratic nature, or otherwise, of appointments. However, he will, I
am sure, want to continue with his remarks&#151;in
order.</div><a name="06071885000255"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071885000529"></a>Mr.
Vara:</b> I am grateful for that guidance,Mr. Bercow.
I stand corrected if I gave the wrong example; I was simply referring
to the transparency of public appointments and to the need to avoid the
kind of comments that arose as a consequence of another public
appointment, to which I referred earlier. It was simply by way of
analogy, and I recognise that that is
difficult.</div>
<a name="06071885000256"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071885000530"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> The hon. Gentleman asked a serious
question, so let me give him a serious answer. Basically, the
appointment of members to the panel is nothing to do with Her
Majesty&#146;s Government; it is a matter for those who run the City
panel.</div><a name="06071885000257"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071885000531"></a>Mr.
Vara:</b> In order to explain my position, I seek your
permission, Mr. Bercow, to refer briefly to the appointment of two
individuals to the Bank of England Monetary Policy Committee, if only
to illustrate why I mentioned it. Two members were appointed to that
committee earlier this week by the Governor of the Bank of England.
However, subsequently articles in the press have stated that at least
one of the people appointed had a link to Ministers. Although the
appointments were made by the Governor, we wish to avoid a repetition
of assertions being made in articles about links between people
appointed to the panel and Ministers. The Solicitor-General is making a
far bigger point than the issue deserves. All that I wish to make clear
is that there should be transparency in the appointment, and there
should be no room for any subsequent
questions.</div><a name="06071885000258"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071885000532"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> The hon. Gentleman asks for
transparency and that people not be appointed in particular ways, but I
repeat that appointments to the panel have nothing to do with Her
Majesty&#146;s
Government.</div><a name="06071885000259"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071885000533"></a>Mr.
Vara:</b> The Chancellor of the Exchequer gave that same
answer, but it laid open the question raised by an article in the
<i class="I">Financial
Times.</i></div><a name="06071885000260"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071885000534"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> My hon. Friend raises a fair point. Ministers
will not appoint people, but perhaps my hon. Friend is trying to say
that as a result of putting the provision in statute, the process will
seem to be more governmental by nature, and we must be wary of
that.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column771" />Column number: 772</div><a name="06071885000402"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.45
pm</div><a name="06071885000261"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071885000535"></a>Mr.
Vara:</b> I am grateful to my hon. Friend. That is exactly
what I was saying. I wish that I had used his words rather mine, which
have left me open to questions from the
Solicitor-General.</div><a name="06071885000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am mindful of the time and am keen to make my final point. We have
increasing co-operation and workings with the European Union. My hon.
Friend referred to Britain&#146;s tendency to gold-plate regulations
and rules that emanate from Brussels. I urge the Solicitor-General to
ensure that when the takeover panel is subject to such European Union
rules and regulations, it will be given the flexibility needed to
ensure that business interests come first, rather than those of
bureaucrats who are concerned more about bureaucracy than the efficacy
of
business.</div><a name="06071885000263"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071885000536"></a>Mr.
Jones:</b> I must congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for
Huntingdon on what was, in the circumstances, a succinct commentary on
a very important clause that seeks to establish, for the first time,
the takeover panel on a statutory footing. He covered the ground
well.</div><a name="06071885000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would like to
raise a particular matter with the Solicitor-General. I referred to it
in an intervention on my hon. Friend and it was touched on in another
place when the Attorney-General opened the debate on the clause. The
noble Lord referred to the ninth report of the Delegated Powers and
Regulatory Reform Committee which made two recommendations. In
particular, I invite the Solicitor-General to comment on the report
where it said:</div>
<a name="06071885000388"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The House will wish to
be assured that the Panel will continue to be an appropriate body to
which the powers may be delegated and the House may wish to seek
assurances from the Government that no changes are possible to its
constitution which could change its suitability to be a rule-making
authority.&#148;</div><a name="06071885000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
response to that recommendation, the Attorney-General said that he was
happy to give such assurances. He gave them on six grounds. The first
was on the panel&#146;s history. He complimented the panel on
its 38 years of existence during which it had been one of the
&#147;great regulatory successes&#148; and had played an important
role in the continuing prominence of London as a &#147;world-class
financial centre&#148;.</div>
<a name="06071885000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second ground was the
existing authority of the panel, which is acknowledged in case law and
by statute. The panel is an interesting body because itis a
hybrid and operates without parliamentary intervention, but
nevertheless it is recognised in statute. The third ground was the
existing working arrangements. The Attorney-General pointed out that
the panel had well-developed links with other financial regulators and
institutions.</div><a name="06071885000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
fourth ground&#151;this point was mentioned by my hon.
Friend&#151;was the inclusive make-up of the panel. The fifth was
that the Government</div>
<a name="06071885000389"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;believe that there that there is
widespread support for the panel assuming the role of a rule-making
authority.&#148;</div><a name="06071885000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that
that was, indeed,
correct.</div><a name="06071885000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, the
Attorney-General mentioned what he described as the</div>
<a name="06071885000390"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;fallback power to replace the
panel as regulator.&#148;</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column772" />Column number: 773</div><a name="06071885000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">He went on to
say:</div><a name="06071885000391"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Government would retain the power through secondary legislation,
particularly the European Communities Act 1972, either to remove and
replace the panel as regulator or substitute rules made by the panel
which were contrary to Community law. I should perhaps say
&#145;and/or substitute rules made by the panel&#146; because
either or both would be
possible.&#148;</div><a name="06071885000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">He
continued:</div><a name="06071885000392"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
the event that the panel ceased to be an appropriate regulatory body or
there were concerns about the compliance of panel rules with the
directive, those powers could be exercised.&#148;
&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of Lords, </i>28 March 2006; Vol.
680,c. GC286.]</div><a name="06071885000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
would be powers either to replace the panel or to changes its rules. He
went on to say that he regarded that very much as a last
resort.</div><a name="06071885000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those remarks
cause me some concern and I invite the Solicitor-General to elucidate
on them. Perhaps he could further clarify the circumstances under which
the panel might be regarded as no longer being an appropriate
regulatory body. What criteria would be applied in making that decision
and who would apply them? In other words, who would monitor the
panel&#146;s activities? Under what circumstances would they deploy
that weapon of last resort, by deciding that the panel was no longer an
appropriate regulatory body? What sort of concerns about compliance
with the directive would trigger the replacement of the panel or the
substitution of its rules? What mechanism would be in place to do
that?</div> <a name="06071885000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Attorney-General indicated that the replacement of the panel or its
rules would be done through secondary legislation. How would that
secondary legislation operate?</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071885000538"></a>Mr.
Jones:</b> Yes, indeed. In fact, the threat of operation by
secondary legislation perturbs me in particular. To what extent would
there be parliamentary scrutiny outside that
procedure?</div>
<a name="06071885000277"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071885000539"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The point about consultation that my hon. Friend
raises is important. The panel has a firm and strong history of
consultation. How would that tie in with consultation under the
procedure for statutory instruments?</div>
<a name="06071885000278"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071885000540"></a>Mr.
Jones:</b> My hon. Friend&#146;s point is important, which
is exactly why I have raised the issue. The power to replace the
takeover panel through secondary legislation seems draconian. I have no
doubt that the Attorney-General meant it when he gave those assurances
that it would be used as a weapon of last resort. Nevertheless, the
point was touched on in Grand Committee in another place but, so far as
I can see, it was not explored further. It is a matter of concern and
one on which we should like considerable clarification.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column773" />Column number: 774</div><a name="06071885000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">Furthermore, if the takeover
panel were indeed replaced via secondary legislation, under what
framework would the body that had replaced it
operate?</div><a name="06071885000280"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06071885000541"></a><b class="B">Paul
Farrelly</b> (Newcastle-under-Lyme) (Lab): I have long
experience of the operation of the panel, both in the City&#151;as a
practitioner and a corporate financier&#151;and as a former City
editor of a national newspaper. I have long welcomed its flexibility,
but I also recognise the calls that have been made from time to time
for it to be put on a more statutory footing. However, in all the
representations that I have received during this Committee, I have not
yet received one from the takeover panel objecting to the
Government&#146;s proposals. Has the hon. Gentleman received such a
representation?</div><a name="06071885000281"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071885000542"></a>Mr.
Jones:</b> No I have not, but with respect the points that I
am raising are on matters of clarification. So far as I can see, they
have never been investigated. They are mentioned obliquely by the
Attorney-General as a residual power that might be deployed in some
circumstances. The Committee has a right to know, and is anxious to
know, under what circumstances they will be
deployed.</div><a name="06071885000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
interested to know under what framework the body that replaced the
takeover panel would operate. Would it operate under part 24, with the
name of the new body simply interpolated for that of the takeover
panel, or would a new framework be proposed?</div>
<a name="06071885000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">These are matters of concern,
and the principal concern is that the powers have been retained
by&#151;</div><a name="06071885000284"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071885000543"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> Concern for
whom?</div><a name="06071885000285"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071885000544"></a>Mr.
Jones:</b> They are a matter of concern for me, for one, but I
have no doubt that they are a matter of concern to a number of other
people, including several residents of the City of London.
Nevertheless, it is a matter for clarification. It was not fully
investigated in another
place.</div><a name="06071885000286"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071885000545"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> We have not heard representations from
the takeover panel. It has no concerns about the matter. There is no
reason to expect that the panel will cease to be the appropriate body.
As the Attorney-General said, it is an ultimate fall-back position if
the panel should somehow collapse, but the Government do not anticipate
that it will do so. We would certainly hold appropriate consultations
if it ever did, but the circumstances would be so extreme that I
suspect the number of people concerned is very
limited.</div><a name="06071885000287"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071885000546"></a>Mr.
Jones:</b><b class="B"> </b>I am sure that the Solicitor-General is
right and that the powers would be deployed only as a matter of last
resort. Nevertheless, will he explain the basis on which they would be
deployed and how they would be deployed? It is not sufficient to say
that the powers would never be deployed if in fact they exist. If they
are to be deployed, can he clarify upon what basis? I look forward to
the Solicitor-General&#146;s response to my
points.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071885000547"></a>Mr.
Davies:</b> I had not intended to contribute to the
discussion, but so that there can be no doubt in anybody&#146;s mind
that the Opposition have not passed over the clause with excessive
haste and levity, let me make it clear that all Conservative Members
have focused on this important
matter.</div><a name="06071885000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall make
two rapid points in the time available. The first is that the takeover
panel, by general and international consensus, is the single best
example anywhere of successful self-regulation in financial markets.
Its record during the past 25 to 30 years&#151;it is probably more
than 30 years now&#151;is quite extraordinary. As I said, its
decisions have always been upheld by the courts. That is quite a
remarkable
tribute.</div><a name="06071885000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
panel&#146;s principles have been the basis for many other
countries&#146; development of takeover codes. Even the fundamental
principles in articles 9 and 16&#151;the need to protect small
shareholders, the need to make a complete bid if 30 per cent. is
achieved and so forth&#151;have become standard in takeover laws and
codes in many other countries, including countries within the European
Union. The concept of concert parties, which is absolutely essential,
was identified as a problem and dealt with by the panel. Numerous
scandals in the more distant past in this country and in recent decades
elsewhere have shown the need for clear rules about concert
parties.</div> <a name="06071885000291"></a><div class="hs_Para">The takeover
panel should receive nothing but praise from the Committee, and I would
be very worried if a statute providing a framework for the
panel&#146;s activities were to threaten in any way its future
effectiveness and credibility. There is only one reason, in my
view&#151;</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071885000548"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> Will the hon. Gentleman give
way?</div><a name="06071885000293"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071885000549"></a>Mr.
Davies:</b> Let me finish my sentence. There is only one
reason for including the panel in statute and providing that framework:
we in this country have a great interest in a level playing field
throughout the European Union, and, in principle, the rules under which
other EU-based companies can make bids for British companies should be
comparable to those under which British companies can make bids on the
continent. Everybody should be clear about what the rules are. It is
necessary, if we are to have a level playing
field&#151;</div><a name="06071885000294"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071885000550"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> Will the hon. Gentleman give
way?</div><a name="06071885000295"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06071885000551"></a>Mr.
Davies:</b> I will give way to the Solicitor-General in a
moment, if he will be patient for about 60
seconds.</div><a name="06071885000296"></a><div class="hs_Para">If rules are
to apply across the European Union, clearly we must agree on a common
directive. That means that it must be embedded in British law as it is
in the law of continental members of the Union, or indeed the Republic
of Ireland. That seems sensible. The courts have had strong support for
the panel and its own decisions until now, and I do not believe that a
statutory framework will change
that.</div><a name="06071885000297"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">It being One
