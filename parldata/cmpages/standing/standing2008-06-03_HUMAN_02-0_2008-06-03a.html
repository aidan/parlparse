<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060423000273"></a>The
Minister of State, Department of Health (Dawn Primarolo):</b>
Before we broke for lunch, I was responding to the hon. Member for
Oxford, West and Abingdon on the subject of artificial gametes. I was
explaining to the Committee that there is currently research into in
vitro maturation and in vitro growth of gametes, and this involves
taking immature eggs or sperm and maturing them in vitro. This could
allow eggs to be matured from ovarian tissue and sperm from testicular
tissue without the need for the tissue to be transplanted back into
someone. It could also be used to treat certain types of infertility
where there the development of the eggs or sperm is blocked.</div>
<a name="08060423000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">The current definitions do
allow gametes matured in vitro to be considered permitted. The Bill
also allows research into the development of artificial gametes,
including the ultimate test as to whether an artificial gamete is
considered functional fertilisation<b class="B">. </b>If an artificially derived
sperm can fertilise an egg, or an artificially derived egg can be
fertilised, the sperm or the egg could be described as functional.
However, the hon. Gentleman, in quoting various references, including
quite a lot of the debate in another place, did not do justice to the
challenge that researchers face. A lot more research and reassurance
would be required on the functionality of such gametes before it would
be appropriate to use them in treatment.</div>
<a name="08060423000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government&#146;s
position is that, if research into artificial gametes demonstrates that
they might effectively be used in treatment, this should of course be
considered. However, our current view is that there is too little
research into how these cells might be derived, and into the safety of
such techniques, to be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column46" />Column number: 46</div>able to make an informed judgment about their use. The application of
this technology would be highly significant. It would mean a baby being
born having been created from cells other than eggs and sperm, and it
is my view that it would not be appropriate to allow such a significant
development without proper consultation and parliamentary
scrutiny.</div> <a name="08060423000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman touched on that himself when he quoted the British Medical
Association. I disagree with the view of the BMA in that I think we
need more than regulations&#151;even affirmative ones&#151;in order
to discuss the matter. It is something that will significantly change
the way people have children, and it is entirely appropriate that
proper consideration is given to any decision about allowing it. The
hon. Gentleman also touched on who, under the regulations, would be
allowed such treatment, and whether the regulations could prescribe
those who would be allowed access to this treatment if it turned out,
in x years&#146; time, to be successful. Given all the complexities
with regard to DNA and its development, and this particular route of
research, could any regulations restrict those who would be entitled to
apply for
it?</div><a name="08060423000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">First,
any regulating power would need to be considered in the light of the
need for the Government&#146;s action to be compatible with the
European convention on human rights. If the technology could be made
available to same-sex couples and heterosexual couples&#151;and there
is a continual series of &#147;if&#148;s in these
sentences&#151;there would need to be a strong, objective
justification for treating same-sex couples differently. I have to say
to the hon. Gentleman, regardless of whom he has spoken to in his
extensive discussions on this matter, that I am not aware of any such
strong justification for the writing of a power to prevent access by
some.</div> <a name="08060423000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of course, the
point about discrimination is crucial. The use of this technology for
heterosexual couples only would be difficult to justify objectively,
but there are wider questions. This is fundamentally different. It
raises different ethical issues to those raised on mitochondrial
donation. The Government are not saying &#147;no&#148; to this ever
happening in the future. We are saying that, at the point at which this
research is, further work needs to be done, further consideration of
the ethical and scientific reasons for pursuing
it&#151;</div><a name="08060423000032"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08060423000274"></a><b class="B">Dr.
Evan Harris</b> (Oxford, West and Abingdon) (LD): Will the
right hon. Lady give way?</div>
<a name="08060423000033"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060423000275"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> The hon. Gentleman spoke for half an hour. If
he will allow me to conclude my points, I will be happy for him to come
back in.</div> <a name="08060423000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">It also
seems to me that when this House considers the science, particularly in
this area, we need to be able to satisfy ourselves where that science
may take us, what issues will be raised and whether or not we feel able
to come to decisions on this subject. His hon. Friend the Member for
Southport talked about a blank cheque. I entirely reject that notion.
Research is at an early stage, and we are not clear where it is taking
us. We have not had a full debate about what is possible or
discussion of the ethical issues involved. The Government are not
saying no to the idea, but we are saying that further consideration
needs to be given and proper consultation carried out. Now is not the
time, and a regulating power is not the way forward.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column47" />Column number: 47</div><a name="08060423000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is why, when the hon.
Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon and others raised it before, the
Government declined to take the route that they suggested. It is not
the right way to proceed with legislation to say afterwards that we
will answer all the questions once we have given a regulating power
that we may or may not switch on. In the previous discussions, we
clearly flagged up what the regulations would need to
address&#151;for instance, for mitochondrial donation, and those
debates are already going on. It is on that basis that I would decline
such an amendment to the Bill if it were before us&#151;it is not. I
hope that the clause will stand part of the
Bill.</div><a name="08060423000036"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060423000276"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> It is not clear to me whether the Minister is
giving way. If she does not give way, her remarks become just an
exposition. The whole point of a ministerial response to a debate is to
allow interventions if the Minister is sure of her ground, as I am sure
the right hon. Lady is. I do not know why she would not wish to take
interventions. If she does not, it gives her the right to stay seated
and not respond to specific questions after she has set out her
position. So I am asking whether she is willing to respond
again&#151;</div><a name="08060423000037"></a>

<a name="08060423000038"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060423000278"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. The right hon. Lady has made her position
plain. She has stated her case and she has sat down. It is entirely
open to the hon. Gentleman to come back, as the right hon. Lady
indicated.</div>
<a name="08060423000039"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060423000279"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I am coming back, but I was wondering whether I
would be wasting my breath in a sense in asking her to respond to
particular points, as is usual in a Committee stage debate, or whether
she is just intending to stay seated. I would like to know that so that
I can bear it in mind when I choose what points to make. Either I am
making concluding points, or I am asking further
questions.</div><a name="08060423000040"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060423000280"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I suggest, respectfully, that the hon.
Gentleman puts it to the
test.</div><a name="08060423000041"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060423000281"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I think that is wise advice. Let us see if the
Minister is prepared to answer a couple of questions. I am grateful to
her for setting out what she did, and I would like to deal with two key
points that she raised. First, on discrimination. she argued that
strong, objective justification would be needed to treat same-sex
couples differently from heterosexual couples. This is an interesting
question, because we are talking about whether an individual will be
able to access specific treatment. An infertile male who is being
treated with a woman may currently receive treatment from an in vitro
fertilisation clinic in the form, for example, of donor
sperm&#151;they do not receive donor eggs. Where a woman is
infertile, the problem is dealt with by means of donor eggs, not donor
sperm. That could be an individual woman seeking treatment on her own,
where no couple is
involved.</div><a name="08060423000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
could therefore argue that the test is whether the person is being
treated in a reasonable way and whether they are receiving treatment.
My understanding of the Human Rights Act 1998 is that it does not give
people 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column48" />Column number: 48</div>the right to receive a specific treatment, as long as they are not
unreasonably, disproportionately discriminated against in accessing
treatment or services. My first question, therefore, is whether the
Government have legal advice stating that there is an issue of
discrimination against same-sex couples. Secondly, can they see no
objective justification for legitimising the distinction that I have
described by setting it out in regulations that a man must be treated
with sperm from stem cells and that a woman must be treated with eggs
from stem cells? I have taken informal advice from human rights
lawyers, and they believe that there is an objective justification for
such a provision, even if it involves different treatment that might be
considered indirectly discriminatory. Same-sex couples can be treated
with donor sperm and eggs. We are talking about treating infertile
individuals to give them their only chance to have children with
the same genetic relationship that one would expect with a
father.</div> <a name="08060423000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">On my second
question, the Minister said that the proposals would raise different
ethical issues, and I listened carefully to what she said in
identifying them. She said that the proposals would significantly
change the way in which people have children and that we would be
creating children through cells other than eggs or sperm. However, I do
not think that we would be doing that, because we would still have to
create an embryo &#147;by...fertilisation&#148;, to use the
words in the clause. The fertilisation would have to be done by a germ
cell, even if it had been derived from a somatic cell. The words in the
clause&#151;I am keen to stick to them&#151;specify that very
clearly. It cannot be said that the regulations would allow anything
other than an embryo to be created by fertilisation. The Minister
herself referred to the fact that gametes are widely defined for these
purposes as germline cells at any stage of maturation. They are not
necessarily sperm or eggs&#151;they are certainly not necessarily
sperm. Immature spermatagonal cells count as gametes in this respect.
If they are grown or matured in vitro, they would not necessarily be
sperm. The Bill therefore already provides for embryos to be created by
fertilisation using cells that are not sperm&#151;we should be clear
about that. Given that necessary protection in the Bill, it is not
right to say that embryos will be created by cells other than eggs or
sperm, except to the extent that is already permitted for immature
gametes for the purposes that the Minister has set out.</div>
<a name="08060423000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">The proposals would not
significantly change the way in which people have children. If the
Government thought that the issue was ripe for consultation in
2005&#151;indeed, it was put out for consultation&#151;it should be
ripe for discussion in the House now. It cannot be considered
premature, a priori, to debate the issue in the House of Lords and the
House of Commons. In 2005, the Government were of the view that a
regulation-making power was legitimate; that is the position that they
started from in their consultation paper. I am concerned that they have
decided against allowing a regulation-making power without having very
good reasons, albeit that they have pragmatic concerns. Their position
is not clear to me. It does not look as though the Minister is
responding to the two points that I am
making.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column49" />Column number: 49</div><a name="08060423000246"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.15
pm</div><a name="08060423000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
a consensus statement dated 11 April 2008, the Hinxton group set out
how close it thought this science was to reaching the clinic. My
understanding is that this peer review group thought that it was five
to 10 years away. That is before the time scale within which another
Bill is likely to be introduced. They recommended that the Government
look kindly on permissive legislation which would allow that to happen,
and made it clear that they thought there was a great deal of hope,
with this technology, for clinical treatment of individuals. It is
unfortunate that the Government seem to be opposed to allowing a
regulation-making power now without setting out clearly why they think
it would be discriminatory to restrict it and, separately, what the key
ethical issues are and why they are new compared to other
issues.</div> <a name="08060423000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">I conclude my
remarks by regretting that the Government have not been willing to set
out clearly their grounds for believing that the amendment tabled in
the Lords would be too discriminatory, not setting out why they think
there are fresh and significant ethical concerns here, and not
appearing to be willing to have a debate in a Committee of Parliament
about those
issues.</div><a name="08060423000047"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060423000282"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> The hon. Gentleman creates a case, advances it,
and then, when he does not get the answer he wants, says that a
justification has not been given. He asked me a question about
discrimination, and I gave him the answer with regard to advice. The
hon. Gentleman knows that it is not normal for Governments to publish
legal advice, and we are not about to start now. I went on to say that,
notwithstanding the advice, there are ethical issues, beyond what is in
the Bill, that need further consideration, and there is a difference
between what we are currently providing for and what would be provided
for in these circumstances. What we have is a stand-off. The hon.
Gentleman simply does not agree with me. It seems to me that there is a
difference between a power dealing with mitochondrial donation to avoid
the transmission of serious diseases and with the repairing of existing
embryos&#151;which is where the regulation-making power is&#151;and
a different power dealing with artificial gametes and the creation of
gametes and new life. There is a fine
distinction.</div><a name="08060423000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">On behalf
of the Government, I am saying not that we have set our face against
this, but that further discussion and further consideration of the
issues is needed. I hear what the hon. Gentleman says, but not
everybody agrees about how far away the science is from possible use.
The appropriate way forward would be proper consultation on these
issues and, if necessary, amendments to primary legislation. That is a
far more significant and important place to have these sorts of
discussions. I hear what the hon. Gentleman is saying and I understand
that he disagrees with me, but no matter how many times he puts this
proposition to me, that will be my reply on behalf of the Government.
</div><a name="08060423000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a question
of understanding the very fine differences between what science might
be able to do in the future and how we seek to regulate it, and that
goes to the very heart of what we are trying to deal with in discussing
this Bill and its predecessor. Discrimination is a subset of that, but
the ethical issues must come first. I am sorry if the hon. Gentleman
does not agree 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column50" />Column number: 50</div>because there is a lot about which we have agreed. However, in response
to his raising such important issues in a clause stand part debate, I
have laid out the reasons for the Government&#146;s view and if the
House takes a different view, that is a matter for the House. We remain

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060423000285"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b> Thank you for your guidance, Mr.
Gale. The purpose of amendment No. 22 is to get across to both the
Government and the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority that,
while the HFEA is held in very high regard and is perceived globally as
the lead regulator in such issues, there is concern that it has in the
past and perhaps will in the future be a closed shop. The amendment
would ensure that amenable clinicians who wished to serve on the HFEA
and others who wanted to be reappointed could not be reappointed again
and again, as can happen at the moment. The effect of that practice is
keeping others out as the ratio of expert members is
limited.</div><a name="08060423000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">The majority
of clinics have a good relationship with the HFEA, but that is not
universal, as I have found out in my meetings with those who have had
dealings with the HFEA. Some clinics have had difficulties and they put
that down primarily&#151;not solely&#151;to the static membership
of the authority. There have also been issues of competitive conflict,
and it is important that clinicians do not sit on licensing committees
when determining policy that might have a beneficial impact on their
own clinics. I shall not give specific examples of that, but I am sure
that officials are aware that that has
happened.</div><a name="08060423000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060423000286"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman have similar concerns
about clinicians who are rivals to other clinicians being involved in
inspections, and delivering a report that might impact on the business
of those 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column51" />Column number: 51</div>other people? I do not know whether it is possible to avoid that
situation, but perhaps it also needs to be
considered.</div><a name="08060423000060"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060423000287"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b> The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. The
purpose of a future amendment is not only to ensure that such a
situation does not arise, but to prevent clinicians without specialist
and expert knowledge in certain subjects producing reports that often
have to be corrected or reworked later. I shall deal with that when we
come to the subsequent
amendment.</div><a name="08060423000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would
also be helpful if the HFEA made public the dates of appointments so
that people could see how long someone had been a member of the
authority. The public should also be given assurances about the
HFEA&#146;s fresh expertise and vigour. It is clear from my
discussions that if the Bill passes&#151;as most of us on this
Committee hope it will, as a result of the substantial discussions in
pre-legislative scrutiny and both Houses of Parliament&#151;the HFEA
will have an even busier time, as we gradually extend the type of
activities that it can license. It is therefore important that it does
not atrophy&#151;although I am not suggesting that it has&#151;but
continues to move forward with vigour, bringing in new blood as often
as possible. That is the purpose of amendment No.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060423000288"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> Members of the HFEA are
appointed by the Appointments Commission on behalf of the Secretary of
State for Health following advertisements in the national press. Anyone
is free to apply and can be considered for membership. The Human
Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 provides
that:</div><a name="08060423000233"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A person
shall not be appointed as a member of the Authority for more than three
years at a
time&#148;.</div><a name="08060423000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, that can
be extended for another three years with the agreement of the
Appointments Commission. After six years, if members wish to continue
to sit on the authority, it is not prohibited, but they must reapply
through an open competition. They may be reappointed, but only if they
are the best candidate for the
job.</div><a name="08060423000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendment would set a six-year limit on the
full period that any member can serve. Although it does not necessarily
sound unreasonable, it would mean a lack of flexibility to reappoint
people with valuable expertise and experience in their field. It is
essential that the HFEA comprises the best calibre of candidates
available. The amendment could restrict that.</div>
<a name="08060423000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">While the hon. Gentleman was
speaking, I was looking at some of my notes in relation to his point
about the dates when people were appointed and how long their term ran
for. I do not have that information. I think that some members of the
HFEA have served for more than six years, but they started before the
process was run by the Appointments Commission. I understand that three
members have served for six years. They would have to apply for
reappointment under the current recruitment
exercise.</div><a name="08060423000066"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08060423000289"></a><b class="B">Mike
Penning</b> (Hemel Hempstead) (Con): Will the Minister clarify
whether that is retrospective? If they have already served six years
when the legislation comes into force, will they then have another
three plus three before they have to apply, or will the previous years
be taken into account, meaning that they will have to apply straight
away?</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column52" />Column number: 52</div><a name="08060423000067"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060423000290"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> I think that I am correct in
saying that, once the Appointments Commission became responsible, the
period considered included whatever period they might already have
served. If the hon. Gentleman will forgive me, I will need to
double-check that, but the point is that it is common on many public
bodies to have a period in which people can be reappointed before going
through a complete re-application. As I said to the hon. Member for
Boston and Skegness, an open competition is advertised and run by the
Appointments Commission, which is specifically charged with ensuring
that the public body&#151;in this case HFEA&#151;is staffed by
people with appropriate skills. It will also look to ensure that
anybody who applies meets the specification. Although this is published
nationally, that would still happen. I am not aware whether appointment
periods are in the public domain or whether they were on the HFEA
website. I do not have that information to hand, but I am happy to
check.</div>
<a name="08060423000247"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.30
pm</div><a name="08060423000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
the hon. Gentleman is trying to achieve in terms of the make up of the
HFEA is already in place with respect to the break at six years and the
need to reapply. I am sure that he would agree that the converse is
true, and that even if someone has served six years, if they clearly
have the expertise and are the best person despite advertising,
national recruitment and consideration, we would not want to refuse
them access to being appointed by the Appointments Commission. I hope
that he is reassured that he can track how long members have
served&#151;I will check that that is the case&#151;and that there
is, in effect, a six-year break, with the caveat that people can
reapply. I am sure that he would agree with that, and I hope that he is
satisfied.</div>
<a name="08060423000069"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060423000291"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b> I am grateful to the Minister
for that response. Of course, I understand and agree with the
flexibility argument that she put forward. Obviously, we must have
people of the best calibre on the authority. However, she will also be
aware that there are a limited number of clinician places on the
authority. I am not going to press the amendment to a Division, but I
wanted to ensure that the Minister, the Committee and those responsible
for the HFEA understood the concern that a position on the authority
should not be a permanent fixture that is renewable every three years.
Certainly, publicly detailing appointment dates and the length of time
that those on the authority have served would go some way towards
satisfying people, and it would show that there was change and
turnover. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div>
<a name="08060423000070"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment, by leave,

<a name="08060423000071"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060423000292"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 23, in
schedule 1, page 54, line 17, at
end add&#151;</div><div class="hs_brev">&#145;4 In sub-paragraph 8(2),
after &#147;experience&#148;, insert &#147;in at least one of the
activities that may be licensed under this
Act&#148;.</div><a name="08060423000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment would add a provision to schedule 1, which amends the
1990 Act. To return to the point made by the hon. Member for Oxford,
West and Abingdon, it would ensure that HFEA inspectors were doctors,
embryologists or researchers who were qualified to conduct inspection
at IVF research units. That is not necessarily what happens at the
moment, and there have been conflicts between clinics and the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column53" />Column number: 53</div>HFEA, some of which have been successfully challenged
through negotiations and, ultimately, the threat of legal
action.</div> <a name="08060423000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
inspection reports take place during the licensed period&#151;either
three or five years&#151;or at the end of those licensed periods for
renewal for IVF clinics. They are undertaken to inform the authority
about whether a licence should be renewed or whether there are issues
as the licensed period progresses. Those are, of course, made public
and are accessible to those who use the clinics. There have been some
issues when the interim report that the inspectors put together has
been completely disagreed with by the clinic. There is a great
nervousness among those who run some&#151;although not all&#151;of
the clinics that part of the reason for that is that those doing the
inspections do not necessarily have the expertise that they require and
there is a lack of understanding. There are numerous examples of having
to rework the reports.</div>
<a name="08060423000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand the positive move
that clinics now have the ability to make official responses to those
inspectorate reports, which are also made public. However, the starting
point must be that those doing the inspections in the first place have
a detailed understanding and knowledge of what they are inspecting.
Picking up the point made by the hon. Member for Oxford, West and
Abingdon, we must also ensure that we do not get into a situation in
which someone who is doing an inspection has a conflict of interest, or
an interest in producing a relatively negative report on a particular
clinic that might may have an advantageous effect on the clinic that
they work for.</div>
<a name="08060423000075"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060423000293"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Member for Boston and
Skegness for raising this matter. Although I encouraged him to make his
point, there is a difficulty for the HFEA in finding someone with
clinical expertise who is not in competition with someone else, unless
it has a cadre of professional inspectors, which might be possible, or
one has a way of identifying people who clearly are not in competition.
For example, we would have to consider the situation for people working
in London.</div>
<a name="08060423000076"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"></b><b class="B"><a name="08060423000294"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b> The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right to make
that point. I am not going to raise specific examples, but I am sure
that he will be aware of one particular example in the HFEA when this
very situation arose because of the very close proximity in
geographical terms of the two clinics. That is the sort of issue that
needs to be
avoided.</div><a name="08060423000077"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060423000295"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> Absolutely. The hon. Gentleman&#146;s analysis
is spot on. I would say that more creative thinking needs to be done by
the HFEA to ensure not only that conflicts of interest do not arise,
but that suspicions of conflicts of interest do not arise. This is
unfortunately&#151;or, some would say, fortunately&#151;a very
competitive field in which large amounts of income are at stake. I know
that the HFEA and indeed the Government are aware of the situation,
which is why they strive to ensure that there are basic standards so
that people are not misinformed about what success rates are, for
example.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column54" />Column number: 54</div><a name="08060423000078"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060423000296"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> The hon. Members for Boston and Skegness and
for Oxford, West and Abingdon have raised an important point, and the
hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon went on to elaborate why the
balance is difficult to strike. Perhaps it would be helpful if I gave
the hon. Gentlemen some indication of how the HFEA is
proceeding.</div><a name="08060423000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">At
present, the HFEA has nine inspectors. Three are embryologists, three
are nurses, one is a doctor, one is a scientist and one is a generalist
with an audit background. The HFEA has in-house inspectors and no
longer uses inspectors from outside the
HFEA.</div><a name="08060423000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
would require inspectors to have experience in at least one of the
activities that may be licensed under the Act. That would mean that the
HFEA would be able to recruit only people who were, for example,
doctors or nurses with experience in infertility, embryologists,
scientists with experience of using human embryos in research, and
people who perhaps run internet sperm delivery services&#151;I think
that the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon was touching on that
point.</div>
<a name="08060423000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">The qualities
that make a good inspector are not necessarily limited to experience in
licensable activities, although that may be helpful. The ability to
gather evidence to ensure that centres are conducting licensable
activities in adherence with the Act, the licence conditions, and the
code of practice are vital. Therefore, people with experience of
auditing or investigating, or scientists, nurses, and doctors with
other specialist knowledge, could make equally good inspectors as those
who work in the
field.</div><a name="08060423000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do recognise,
and of course it is obvious, that an understanding of the licensable
activities is essential for an HFEA inspector. The authority has thus
introduced a competency-based training programme for all new inspectors
to achieve that. Part of the programme includes spending time in a
licensed centre to observe practice and to gain an understanding of how
a centre works from day to day. The HFEA also has a number of external
advisors who have experience in activities that may be licensed under
the Act, such as nurses, doctors and embryologists who act as
inspectors on a number of inspections every
year.</div><a name="08060423000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
think that the concerns of the hon. Member for Boston and Skegness are
being addressed by ensuring that the inspectors are suitably qualified
and able to report with regard to the code<b class="B"> </b>and the licence
conditions. He and the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon flag
up a live issue to the HFEA concerning a reasonably small community of
practitioners, the importance of having such expertise, and the need
not to undermine the commercial or business concerns that often
underpin these
clinics.</div><a name="08060423000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that the hon. Member for Boston and Skegness will accept that the
amendment is not necessary, that it would be over-restrictive, and that
there might be problems with recruiting the qualified people he feels
might be necessary. Nonetheless, the HFEA is addressing this matter,
and what is important is that the inspectors can consider the issues
before them. I hope, on that basis, that he will be prepared to
withdraw his amendment.</div>
<a name="08060423000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not sure how this might be
achieved, but if the hon. Gentleman is particularly interested in the
specific work that the HFEA is doing with regard to its 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column55" />Column number: 55</div>in-house inspectors and their qualifications and how to avoid any of the
problems that he feels might exist, I am sure that we could find a way
of ensuring that he is kept in touch with developments so that he can
satisfy himself and his colleagues on those
issues.</div><a name="08060423000086"></a>

Simmonds:</b> I thank the Minister for that answer and for the
offer to keep me in touch as the HFEA develops its thinking and makes
progress in that area. I would certainly like to take her up on that
offer. I am pleased that the HFEA recognises that there is an issue
that needs to be addressed, and I was comforted by the fact that the
Minister felt progress was being
made.</div><a name="08060423000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of course, I
understand that the community is small and that no particular clinic
likes to be criticised, whether that criticism is justified or not.
There are clearly sensitivities. Certainly, one of the things I felt
when meeting people involved in the clinics was that they tended to
divide into two camps: those who were satisfied with the reports and
inspections they were getting from the HFEA, and those who definitely
were not. This is not the only reason why they were not satisfied, but
clearly progress needs to be made. I also understand that we cannot
possibly have a situation where we are over-restrictive on the
recruiting pool. We need to have appropriate number of inspectors to
make inspections, and particularly to produce the interim reports at
the end of a licence. On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="08060423000088"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060423000298"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 4, in
clause 6, page 5, line 35, leave
out subsection
(3).</div><a name="08060423000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
relates particularly to the charging of fees specifically to give
advice. There is no question that there is a necessity for the HFEA to
be allowed to charge for licensing, even though some of the licensing
fees, based on the number of people benefiting from and using the
clinic, are very substantial indeed, in some cases running into the
hundreds of thousands of pounds.</div>
<a name="08060423000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment would remove the
right of the authority to charge a fee for advice. Will the Minister
explain what that advice might be? What, in fact, might the HFEA want
to charge for? Surely advice should be freely available to allow those
who are considering applying for a licence to have the best opportunity
to submit all the relevant documents in the first place. That should be
part of a consultation process free at the point of access with the
HFEA.</div><a name="08060423000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">From my reading
of the clause, it would also enable the authority to charge a person
considering treatment for providing gametes or embryos. In my view,
this should be free, as the current process is costly, traumatic and
time-consuming enough. There has to be an assumption that the HFEA will
give free advice to clinics to enable them to meet the criteria, to get
the licence and to ensure that they are safe. There is concern from
within the clinic community that HFEA charges could amount to not
insubstantial sums for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column56" />Column number: 56</div>carrying out roles that the authority should be fulfilling in the first
place. I am referring to the additional information that is required

Minister clarify what sort of categories of advice the HFEA will be

from wanting to be
donors?</div><a name="08060423000095"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08060423000299"></a><b class="B">Robert
Key</b> (Salisbury) (Con): I support the amendment very
strongly because it addresses the fundamental issue of whether it is
right for some of the services in the national health service to be
paid for by the patient. Any licence charge is inevitably passed on to
patients&#151;and in different ways. Quite a lot of it comes down in
the end to postcoding. I object very strongly to the discrimination
against fertility centres in the national health service. They find
themselves faced with very high charges, as my hon. Friend the Member
for Boston and Skegness said. As far as I can see, this measure is an
extension of that, although perhaps the Minister will convince me that
it is nothing to do with that, that patients will not suffer or lose a
penny, and that the primary care trust will not be able to pass on any
of the charges to
patients.</div><a name="08060423000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
basic point is that there should be no discrimination against fertility
treatment. Fertility treatment is not a luxury; it relates to a medical
condition. The rich will continue to look after themselves. If we are
not careful, we will see the national health service clobbering the
poor&#151;it is as stark as that. This is an issue of principle. My
hon. Friend is seeking, in a far kinder way than me, to press the
Minister to explain the measure, and I support him. I shall take some
convincing that the amendment should be withdrawn, and I hope that it
is not.</div>
<a name="08060423000097"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060423000300"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> The intention behind the provision is not to
implement the charging to which the hon. Members for Salisbury and for
Boston and Skegness have referred. The clause provides for a
discretion, not a duty. It is discretionary to charge a fee for advice
provided under the clause when the advice requested from people to whom
licences apply is greater&#151;let me
explain.</div><a name="08060423000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">The provision
is intended to allow the HFEA to recover costs that it has incurred in
providing specialist advice. It was considered appropriate to make the
power discretionary, which enables the HFEA to consider whether a
charge is necessary. It is not about income generation. It is a
discretionary levy that will be used only when appropriate, such as if
a clinic wants to consider what systems it needs to put in place to
comply with a European directive. It will be provided for within the
national health service if we are required to move the entire service
to comply with a particular European directive, or if a restructuring
of the service is necessary. The amount of work generated for the HFEA
by such a request could go way beyond the usual requests suggested by
the hon. Members for Boston and Skegness and for Salisbury.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column57" />Column number: 57</div><a name="08060423000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the information provided by
the HFEA goes beyond that by helping the structure of the business, it
has the option to charge a fee. That power will be used sparingly
because such a thing will occur only in rare circumstances, but none
the less it will happen. The public purse would otherwise be under
pressure and strain because of having to provide advice to private
organisations on how to comply with requirements. That does not seem to
be the correct way to proceed.</div>
<a name="08060423000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">I absolutely understand the
point made by the hon. Member for Salisbury. I imagine that he was
thinking of clinics asking for information. We are talking specifically
about them going beyond that and asking for much more detailed advice
about compliance or
structure.</div><a name="08060423000101"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08060423000301"></a><b class="B">Jeremy
Wright</b> (Rugby and Kenilworth) (Con): Of course we accept
the Minister&#146;s reassurances once again, albeit with the caveat
that she will not always be the Minister. Will she answer this specific
question? If I understand her correctly, she seems to be arguing that
in the majority of cases in which information or advice is sought by
organisations or individuals, the HFEA would not contemplate charging a
fee, but that in exceptional cases, it might. Why does the clause not
say that a fee is not to be charged save in exceptional
circumstances?</div><a name="08060423000102"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060423000302"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> The power would be a duty if it was required in
all circumstances. It is a discretionary power regarding not
information, but specific advice. If we intended the HFEA to charge for
everything&#151;information and advice&#151;we would put a duty on
it to do so. We are requiring it to charge, with discretion, if the
demand goes beyond information. The authority will have to decide
whether to make a charge.</div>
<a name="08060423000103"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060423000303"></a>Robert
Key:</b> The Minister has the enormous advantage of having
been a Treasury Minister for many successful years. She will know that
in the arguments that we had with the HFEA over the charging of primary
care trusts or, more usually and more directly, fertility clinics, the
authority said that it was bound by the instructions of the Treasury.
That is about as discretionary as a local council charging council tax
to its residents.</div> <a name="08060423000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am totally unconvinced by the Minister&#146;s argument. She has been
unable to give a guarantee that the charges will be discretionary. We
all know of discretionary charges in almost every area of life, and I
am not convinced that the charges will not be passed straight on to
primary care trusts and fertility clinics&#151;and ultimately to
those seeking help.</div>
<a name="08060423000105"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060423000304"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> I want to resolve this. I
understand the hon. Gentleman&#146;s fears, but this is discretion
under specific circumstances. If he has a way forward, I would be happy
to take a further intervention. When there is a request for substantial
advice from the HFEA that would cause substantial cost and go beyond
the information that it normally gives or the work that it would
normally do, it has the discretion to decide whether or not it charges
a fee. It need not definitely charge a fee, but it 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column58" />Column number: 58</div>may do so, to ensure that the public purse is not unduly called upon.
Has the hon. Gentleman a way of having that caveat but not removing the
provision completely, which is what the amendment would do? The
amendment would completely remove the HFEA&#146;s ability to have the
discretion to decide whether it wants to recoup its costs in
exceptional circumstances when the cost is
great.</div><a name="08060423000106"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060423000305"></a>Robert
Key:</b> Of course, the answer is to include the phrase
&#147;exceptional circumstances&#148; somewhere and then to define
them. Will the Minister also point to anywhere in the Bill that
describes what the normal function of the regulatory authority
is?</div><a name="08060423000107"></a>

the work that the HFEA has done predicated on the 1990 Act, and the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s expertise in this area, he knows full well that
the HFEA will be regularly asked for information. The caveat that I am
drawing here is about advice. I am loth to leave the HFEA exposed when
there might be substantial claims on its resources through providing
advice, but I absolutely agree with the hon. Gentleman that we are not
sending a signal in the Bill or from the Committee that we would expect
everything to be charged. This is a caveat that is additional to the
provisions in place. Given that the Bill amends the 1990 Act, when it
is silent, it means that the measure is in the 1990
Act.</div><a name="08060423000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to be open
with the Committee, but I do not want to accept a complete removal of
the proposition. I would ask the hon. Member for Boston and Skegness to
reconsider his amendment and give us time to think about it.
Regrettably, if he feels that he must press the amendment to a
Division, I fear that I must ask my colleagues to resist it. It would
be better to try and sort this out
properly.</div><a name="08060423000109"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060423000307"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b> I listened with great interest to the
Minister&#146;s response. She initiated her comments by using the
word &#147;discretion&#148;. My hon. Friend the Member for
Salisbury ably made the point that Governments have the discretion to
raise taxes all the time. I am not suggesting that fees for advice from
the HFEA are the equivalent of tax, but they could definitely have an
impact on costs for someone wishing to receive treatment from one of
the clinics, if an element of those fees was passed
on.</div><a name="08060423000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">If all this is
about implementing EU directives, my hon. Friend the Member for Rugby
and Kenilworth came up with exactly the right wording:
&#147;exceptional circumstances&#148;. I would argue that
implementing EU directives is probably an appropriate call on the
taxpayer, rather than the individuals using clinics. The HFEA, since
its inception, has survived perfectly adequately without having to
charge for advice under existing structures. Also, there could be a
major deterrent for those who are using the clinics in what is already
sometimes an extremely costly
exercise.</div><a name="08060423000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am sorry
to disappoint the Minister. I am grateful for her offer of looking at

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060423000323"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b> Clause 7 strikes me as a curious measure. It
states that the authority, meaning the HFEA, should carry out its
duties</div> <a name="08060423000234"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;effectively,
efficiently and
economically&#148;,</div><a name="08060423000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">but one
would have thought that that is implicit for any Government authority.
Does it mean that the HFEA has so far been ineffective, inefficient and
uneconomic? What would be the impact on the HFEA if the clause was not
included? The HFEA&#146;s behaviour and performance should not be
altered because it should operate that way whether or not the clause is
included.
</div><a name="08060423000135"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08060423000324"></a><b class="B">Dr.
John Pugh</b> (Southport) (LD): My question is on proposed new
section 8ZA(2), which
states:</div><a name="08060423000235"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
carrying out its functions, the Authority must, so far as is
relevant&#148;&#151;</div><a name="08060423000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am

the principles under which regulatory activities should be transparent,

It is accepted that the HFEA and its delegated committees will make
some big decisions, but it is not guaranteed to be without conflicts of
interest, whether financial, as have been mentioned, or based on
research&#151;people may wish to encourage research in which they are
involved or actively discourage research in which they are involved. In
fact, such conflicts of interest, far from being hypothetical, are
regarded as extremely likely by most members of the Committee who have
spoken. There are also public funding
issues.</div><a name="08060423000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">I recognise
that the HFEA has a strong lay element, but in any environment in which
there are lay and professional people, the latter have a big impact on
what the former decide and think. The HFEA has a strong ethics
committee, but that is largely concerned with the treatment of its
clients.</div><a name="08060423000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is perfectly likely&#151;I am assured that this happens&#151;that
when making decisions that have financial or research implications,
members declare and state their interests. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column60" />Column number: 60</div>However, I pondered some time ago whether there was
a standing register of interests. My hon. Friend the Member for Oxford,
West and Abingdon declared an interest at the beginning of the previous
sitting, but I assume that if we check carefully, we will find a
further declaration in the Register of Members&#146;
Interests&#151;<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> One would indeed
hope so. I have scoured HFEA&#146;s website to find out what are
people&#146;s relevant standing interests, whether financial or
research. I could not find that information, so I contacted the HFEA
and asked whether it had a standing register of interests. I thought
that that was a good idea if only because there will be huge sums of
money riding on some of its decisions&#151;one has only to see the
investment by the Wellcome Trust and others to realise how big those
sums might be. Does the Minister know whether there is a standing
register of interests for HFEA members? If not, suggesting that it
produce one might be a laudable way of future-proofing
legislation.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060423000325"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I point out to my hon. Friend that there is a
difference between declarable interests that one might want to make
Parliament aware of and registerable interests. The registrar is quite
fussy about what he or she thinks it is necessary to
register.</div><a name="08060423000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">My point
concerns the issue of HFEA mission creep. If the Minister will permit
me, I think that it is appropriate to raise it here, because it is
relevant to proposed new section 8ZA(2), which
says:</div><a name="08060423000237"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
carrying out its functions, the Authority must, so far as relevant,
have regard to the principles of best regulatory practice (including
the principles under which regulatory activities should be transparent,
accountable, proportionate, consistent and targeted only at cases in
which action is
needed).&#148;</div><a name="08060423000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
a minor concern, but I hope that the Minister can set my mind at rest.
A couple of years ago, the HFEA sent out a mission statement to Members
of Parliament. The mission statement did not stick to what Parliament
had intended the HFEA to do. The HFEA decided that part of its job was
to maintain public confidence in the law. If Parliament makes the law,
it is Parliament&#146;s job to maintain confidence in the law.
Otherwise, acceptable activity that Parliament has said should be
licensed and considered appropriately should not be subject to extra
regulation because of a perceived need to keep public opinion on
board.</div> <a name="08060423000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">Otherwise,
newspapers could raise scare stories and, if the HFEA&#146;s mission
has crept to include a general issue of public confidence rather than
what is set out in proposed new section 8ZA(2), it might say,
&#147;Well, we might have licensed this and permitted it, but it
might kick up a fuss. There&#146;s an institutional risk.&#148;
That is the other thing. The HFEA&#146;s policy documents include a
little section saying what the risk is to itself of bad headlines,
rating them low, medium, high or whatever. It is inappropriate for the
HFEA, which was set up by Parliament to do a job&#151;a job that,
generally speaking, it does well&#151;to start having regard to
interests such as what the <i class="I">Daily Mail </i>might say about its
decisions.</div> <a name="08060423000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">The HFEA
rowed back from that position when I raised the matter, asking where it
came from, as I could not find it in the HFEA&#146;s own terms of
reference or the statute. It would be helpful if the Minister confirmed
that the excellent paragraph that she proposes to insert in the Bill
makes it clear that</div>
<a name="08060423000238"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;activities should
be...targeted only at cases in which action is
needed&#148;,</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column61" />Column number: 61</div><a name="08060423000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">and that nothing in the statute requires
the HFEA to distort what it is doing in order to please what it
perceives as public or media opinion. Unfortunately, it is in the
firing line. I respect the HFEA for what it does, because it gets a lot
of hassle from some in the media, and indeed some politicians, when it
takes a decision that they do not like. However, it would be open to
greater criticism if it bent towards that or away from implied
criticism. I hope that she will make it clear, albeit only briefly,
that the HFEA&#146;s job is to implement the law as Parliament has
laid it down and develop policy where appropriate. Perceptions of
public opinion, short of formal consultations where the HFEA feels them
to be relevant, are not part of its remit.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060423000326"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> It is always surprising what things catch a
Minister in Committee. I thought that clause 7 was very
straightforward. Perhaps I can explain why the Government did it and
then answer the
points.</div><a name="08060423000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of
course the Government expect all public authorities to operate
effectively, efficiently and economically. That is not a reflection on
the HFEA&#146;s past practice or performance. It is simply that the
principles of better regulation were implemented following the Hampton
report, which was quite a long way after the 1990 Act. They require
regulation to be transparent. Regulators should be open and keep
regulations simple and user-friendly. Regulation must be accountable.
Regulators must be able to justify decisions and be subject to public
scrutiny. It must be proportionate. Regulators should intervene only
when necessary. Remedies should be appropriate to the risk posed and
costs must be identified and minimised. The principles also require
regulation to be consistent whereby rules and standards must be joined
up and implemented fairly. They require regulation to be targeted so
that it is focused on the problem and minimise the side
effects.</div><a name="08060423000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government took the opportunity provided by the fact that we were
updating the 1990 Act and included the principles in the Bill. They
have been widely accepted by the House. It was no more, no less than
that. Such action was not a reflection on the performance of the HFEA.
We just took the opportunity offered by the Bill to put on the record
something that we already expected. We did so for clarity. We did not
mean to cause difficulties in Committee. In answer to the points that
have been made, I must say that it is nothing to do with whether I
continue to be the Minister; it is simply a tidying-up
exercise.</div><a name="08060423000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Southport raised a different issue&#151;a register of what
is declared. I am not exactly sure about what detail is provided
publicly at the moment, but I agree with him. I shall put to the HFEA
the point that such a register should exist and be accessible. It would
be good practice and I thank the hon. Gentleman for raising it with
me.</div><a name="08060423000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon asked me to confirm that the
measure is about complying with the Bill, not with the views of the
media. I am happy to confirm that. I think that he wanted to make sure
that that was on the record, and I am pleased to assist him. I hope
that members of the Committee will accept that there was no other
motive behind the provision, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column62" />Column number: 62</div>expect that it is a good principle. I hope that I have put their
concerns to rest, and that they agree that what must be the most modest
clause in the entire Bill should now stand

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060423000327"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b> I have one or two queries about the clause. It
gives the HFEA the power to contract out particular functions to other
Departments or public offices. How would the contracted-out bodies be
accountable? It would be helpful if the Minister could give us an idea
of which bodies might be involved? Will it be the Human Tissue
Authority, the Department of Health or the Medicines and Healthcare
products Regulatory Agency? In what circumstances does the Minister
think that the powers would be
necessary?</div><a name="08060423000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">To make
sure that my understanding of the Bill is correct, I must know whether
contracting out will exclude licensing and the guidance of the HFEA,
and that there will be no opportunities for licensing, for example.
What about inspections? We discussed that earlier. They are not
specific to the granting of a licence, but are relevant to it. Such
matters go to the authority for discussion and consideration. Will
issues be confined to a public authority or will the HFEA contract out
to the independent sector, including the private sector? What criteria
will be put in place by the Department of Health or will it be left to
the HFEA to make sure that the contractee will have the relevant level
of appropriate skills and expertise, experience and qualifications to
do the particular
job?</div><a name="08060423000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">My third and
final specific question about clause 8 concerns proposed new section
8C(2)(c) that states:</div>
<a name="08060423000239"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;it is a function of making
subordinate legislation (within the meaning of the Interpretation Act
1978).&#148;</div><a name="08060423000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps the
Minister could clarify what is meant by subordinate legislation, and
whether it is the same, or different, from
regulation.</div>
<a name="08060423000250"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.15
pm</div><a name="08060423000158"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060423000328"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I thought that the hon. Member for Boston and
Skegness asked interesting questions. I am particularly interested in
the answer to the last one, as I, too, had that written down.
Inspections would not be excluded from being contracted out under
proposed new section 8C(2), and that leads to the question about
whether it is necessary to identify other people who can provide
inspections, albeit apparently public bodies.</div>
<a name="08060423000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">My purpose in
supporting clause 8 is to recognise that in this increasingly complex
area of regulation, particularly with the advent of potential stem cell
therapies, it is important that the HFEA is able to hand over this
aspect of its work and contract it out, under negotiation and with
consultation, to the HTA or the MHRA, so that there is a smooth working
arrangement. The MHRA, for example, could take the lead and would
obviously have to refer back on occasion to the HFEA. From the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column63" />Column number: 63</div>reading that I have done of some of the complexities around the European
directive on cells and tissues for human application, it seems that
that sort of thing will be necessary. I hope that the Minister
will confirm that.</div>
<a name="08060423000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand and
hope&#151;again I might be wrong&#151;that one of the other points
of this is to ensure that the authority can delegate certain powers to
a sub-committee, which might speed up processes. There is concern in
the clinical world that it can take a very long time for the authority
to make a decision. I think that without that provision, the authority
has to meet as a full authority to sign off a number of things, and
that potentially refers to the creation of sub-committees or committees
of the authority. Again, I would be grateful if the Minister could
clarify that.</div>
<a name="08060423000161"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060423000329"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b> The hon. Gentleman is
absolutely right. Perhaps I may refer him to clause 10, which relates
to the power to delegate and establish committees. The purpose of that
clause is to speed up the licence process. He is right to highlight the
concern of many clinics about the time it takes for the HFEA to make
its decisions.</div>
<a name="08060423000162"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060423000330"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. The hon. Gentleman is right&#151;we
shall come on to clause 10 in due course.</div>
<a name="08060423000163"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060423000331"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I agree with you, Mr. Gale. The hon.
Member for Boston and Skegness is right, and perhaps that answers the
point. Clause 10 deals with that concern, not clause
8.</div>
<a name="08060423000164"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060423000332"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> At present, the 1990 Act does not allow the
HFEA to enter into an arrangement with either a public or private body
to undertake any of its functions. That means that there is limited
flexibility when carrying out some of its functions, which could lead
to the duplication of inspections or other aspects of its regulatory
work. The new provision in clause 8 introduces more flexibility to the
way in which the authority operates. The provisions work together with
those in clause 9&#151;we are coming on to that&#151;that enable
the HFEA to assist other public bodies. It will help the authority to
carry out its functions more effectively and avoid duplication, thus
reducing the burden on clinics and others subject to licensing. The
provision was thought to be sensible to modernise the regulation and
keep certain issues within the Bill, following the removal of proposals
to establish the regulatory authority for tissue and embryos.</div>
<a name="08060423000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">Proposed new
section 8B gives the authority power to make agency arrangements with
Government bodies, other public authorities or holders of public
office, and provides for that body to exercise the authority&#146;s
functions, or for it to provide services to the authority. Such
arrangements may include, for example, those with the Human Tissue
Authority or the Healthcare Commission to carry out inspections on its
behalf. Both those authorities are regulated, transparent and
responsible. However, the responsibility for the functions themselves
would remain with the HFEA, so that body would still be
accountable.</div> <a name="08060423000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">Proposed
new section 8C gives the power to make a contract with any person to
carry out functions of the authority. However, under the provision, the
authority cannot contract out functions related to
licensing  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column64" />Column number: 64</div>decisions, the right to enter, the search or seizure of property, or
other functions prescribed in an order made by the Secretary of
State.</div>
<a name="08060423000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">For example,
the provision allows a private company to undertake inspections of
laboratories on behalf of the authority, and the clause provides that
the authority remains in control of its functions and responsible for
all acts or omissions under such arrangements. We are seeking to remove
duplication with other public authorities when that is sensible, thus
reducing the number of inspections and the regulatory burden. Any
powers in the area would have to be subordinate to the legislation, and
that includes the regulating-making powers. It could also include
powers such as making orders. The approach is quite straightforward,
and because of the exclusions on specific issues, I hope that hon.
Members will accept that this is about using similar inspections and
expertise in the public sector and reducing duplication, not the HFEA
losing control of its responsibilities or transparency. I hope they
will also accept my points about what cannot be contracted out and what
will remain absolutely central to the work of the
HFEA.</div><a name="08060423000168"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060423000333"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b> I might have misunderstood what the Minister
said. Did she clarify the point about this relating only to other
public sector bodies so that no independent or private sector
charitable or voluntary organisations will get involved, particularly

as are, quite rightly, licensing and the other issue with regard to the
code of practice. What about the specific point regarding the interim
inspections?</div><a name="08060423000169"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060423000334"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> May I help the hon. Gentleman by making an
intervention? Proposed new section 8C gives authority to contract with
another person to carry out functions and sets out exclusions. In the
example I gave, such a function might be undertaking an inspection of a
laboratory on its appropriateness, but would not include the other
functions: licensing, right of entry, and search or seizure. That would
occur in limited circumstances, and that possibly could go beyond a
public authority. However, others provisions relate to public
authorities.</div><a name="08060423000170"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060423000335"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b> I am grateful for that clarification, as I
understood what the Minister just confirmed: the HFEA is going to be
allowed to contract out not just to the public sector, but, in very
specifically defined circumstances, to the independent sector, as the

authorities and then, quite naturally, to charge them should it do so.
I am conscious that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column65" />Column number: 65</div>those bodies could be some of the ones that the authority has already
contracted out to that could be charged for the work that the authority
does for them. I am particularly concerned about proposed new section

states:</div><a name="08060423000240"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Assistance

not agree and therefore the work cannot be done? The measure is very
ambiguous. This is the second time this afternoon that we have seen
such terminology&#151;&#147;as it thinks fit&#148;&#151;in the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060423000337"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> The provision is a reciprocal
arrangement with proposed new section 8B. New section 8E will permit
the HFEA to provide services to other public bodies, such as the Human
Tissue Authority or the Healthcare Commission, undertaking inspections
in the same premises as the HFEA. They might arrange for the HFEA to
cover their inspection in the course of the authority&#146;s
inspection regime. The HFEA, not the Healthcare Commission or the Human
Tissue Authority, would then carry the cost of undertaking the
inspection. The provision gives a mechanism for sharing the benefits of
reducing the burden to those who are inspected and the cost to the
public authorities performing the
inspections.</div><a name="08060423000178"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060423000338"></a>Mike
Penning:</b> I thank the Minister for being so clear. I only
wish that this part of the Bill, which is quite long and detailed, had
given us a couple more sentences, as the Minister has done. The
provision is very simply put: &#147;as it thinks fit&#148;. I do
not wish the Minister to disappear soon, but other Ministers will be
around to take her place. They will see the provision in the Bill, and
the situation is not as clear in the Bill as the Minister has
described.</div><a name="08060423000179"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060423000339"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> But the clauses interact
together, so if we rewind to the debate on better regulation and the
obligations of the HFEA in discharging its duties as a public
authority, the same duties apply to the Healthcare Commission or the
Human Tissue Authority. Those public bodies would act responsibly and
accountably. I think that the hon. Gentleman is concerned that the HFEA
would act in a predatory fashion by charging another public authority
for the purposes of income generation, following which there would be a
dispute.</div>
<a name="08060423000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not know
why parliamentary draftsmen settle for these phrases, although they are
excellent people who do fantastic things and get our legislation into
understandable forms, whatever the hue of the Government. I assure the
hon. Gentleman that the measure does not provide for some sort of turf
war or disagreement on charging, and I hope that he accepts that. It is
reasonable to reduce regulation, and when there is a gain to one
authority because another authority has undertaken work, there will be
a sharing of benefits between the authorities, as well as a clear
benefit to the establishment that was inspected, because it will end up
with only one inspection, rather than
two.</div><a name="08060423000181"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question put

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060423000340"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b> Again, I just have a few
questions for the Minister. Will she clarify the exact possible
workings of clause 10, which deals with contracting out to, and the
setting up of, committees? The clause gives the authority the power to
delegate and establish committees, and there is concern over the
accountability and transparency of the process. Will the Minister tell
us her thoughts on which committees the HFEA thinks it might be
appropriate to set up? To whom would it delegate and on what terms, and
what would be the relationship between the committees and the
HFEA?</div><a name="08060423000251"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.30
pm</div><a name="08060423000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also
understand that the committees can include people who are not members
of the HFEA, thereby potentially linking back to some of our
discussions on earlier clauses about the appropriateness, the
qualifications and the relevance of some of the people who may serve on
the committees. Will the Minister explain exactly why it is necessary
for the authority to be able to set up the committees? What has not
worked well in the HFEA to date that makes it necessary? Why is it
necessary to be able to bring in outside people who are not members of
the authority?</div><a name="08060423000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would
also like to make sure that clause 10 will not allow the authority to
move away from decisions licensed by the senior level in the authority
and from responsibility for the code of practice. I understand that the
purpose&#151;again, it would be helpful if the Minister confirmed
this&#151;is to speed up the decision-making process. There is
clearly concern about the time that some licensing decisions take, but
it is important to maintain transparency and accountability. Some
clinics have serious concerns about licensing being renewed at a purely
executive level, not an authority level. A confirmation is needed that
the appeal process will remain in place, despite the powers to delegate
down, and that it will remain the same structure and fall to the people
on the appeal panel, not the people who made the original
decisions.</div>
<a name="08060423000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
will also be aware of the context. There has been judicial criticism of
the former chief executive. I do not want to go into detail, but it may
in part drive some of the concerns. Of course I understand that a
process is needed for speeding up decision-making for granting
licences, but it would be helpful if she would confirm whether
delegation applies to all categories set out in the Bill for which the
HFEA has responsibility, which include licensing, variation, suspension
and
revocation.</div><a name="08060423000188"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060423000341"></a>Robert
Key:</b> The explanatory notes to clause 10
have, I regret to say, managed to confuse me. I should be grateful for
clarification on two simple points. If the Minister can convince me, my
mind will be at rest. I am not clear whether it is meant that staff
will be able to take licensing decisions and develop the code of
practice. That is what it seems to say. Can she also point us to the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column67" />Column number: 67</div>measure in the Bill&#151;if she cannot, could she tell us&#151;what
functions will still be able to be exercised only by members of the
HFEA?</div><a name="08060423000189"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060423000342"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> At present, the 1990 Act
requires HFEA members to be involved in all licensing decisions. As
hon. Members have said, there has been comment about whether that is
overly restrictive on the speed with which decisions are taken,
particularly with regard to what might be considered routine licence
applications. Clause 10 provides that the authority can set up
committees to which it can delegate any of its functions. It will give
the HFEA the flexibility to determine how best to manage its licensing
process. That may involve divisions between more routine decisions and
decisions that are slightly more challenging or
contentious.</div><a name="08060423000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
new provisions mean that there will no longer be a specific requirement
for a licence committee to be set up, nor will any such committee be
required to comprise only HFEA members. Under the new provisions, for
instance, the delegation to any committee could include members as well
as a member of staff.</div>
<a name="08060423000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under the 1990 Act, the
authority could not delegate any function relating to licensing in that
way. The Bill ensures that the HFEA can delegate licensing decisions to
staff, ensuring that such decisions can be made quickly and within a
framework set by the authority. There will need to be an escalation
procedure to ensure that difficult or more contentious decisions are
taken with the appropriate authority under these delegated powers.
Therefore, we are asking the HFEA to consider how to deal speedily with
licence
applications.</div>
<a name="08060423000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">The provisions are sensible and
provide flexibility so that the authority can speed up its decision
making and meet requirements of better regulatory practice. That will
help the authority respond proportionately to its functions, delegating
when appropriate, which should speed up decision making and cut costs.
We thought that this provision was sensible to modernise regulation and
would be in keeping with the Bill. It was particularly necessary
following the removal of the proposal to establish the regulatory
authority for tissue and embryos. As we took that part of the
regulation out, we needed to have something in this clause instead. The
provision should help to speed up the matter, but it does not remove
the responsibility of the entire authority for the decisions that are
taken. It is a question whether&#151;I am struggling for the words to
describe this&#151;there are less complicated decisions that could
then be endorsed by the full Committee, but that could be considered
more quickly. The question of the appeal process and everything that
needs to be in place is there. That is the main requirement.
Arrangements are continuing to be reviewed and put in place to ensure
that the provision is robust.</div>
<a name="08060423000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
members of the Committee will be reassured that this is a proportionate
response to criticism of lack of speed in agreeing licences,
particularly when they are straightforward. The provision recognises
the full range of expertise in the authority, but none the less makes
it clear that decision making has to be speeded
up.</div>
<a name="08060423000194"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060423000343"></a>Robert
Key:</b> I should be grateful if the
Minister would be so kind as to write to me in response to one of my
points and share the letter with members of the Committee. I asked her
what functions could be exercised only by the members and could not be
delegated.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column68" />Column number: 68</div><a name="08060423000195"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060423000344"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> I am happy to do that. The
members will still be responsible for all decisions, because there will
need to be an endorsement. In that sense, there is no removal of power
from the members of the board. As regards providing flexibility to the
HFEA, I will be happy to write to all members of the Committee, through
you, Mr. Gale, to explain the sort of things that we would
want to interact to ensure that there is no loss of accountability,
expertise and scrutiny in this area by the regulatory authority that we
have put in
place.</div><a name="08060423000196"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060423000345"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b> My hon. Friend the Member for
Salisbury has, as always, hit the nail on the head. I am very grateful
to the Minister for consenting to his request to circulate a
clarification letter to the Committee. I think that there would be
concerns if the HFEA was allowed to delegate the totality of functions,
including licence suspension or revocation, without retaining control
over the key ones. I am grateful to the Minister for giving way and
also for agreeing to send us a letter, which we will look at
closely.</div><a name="08060423000197"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060423000346"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> I am more than happy to do
that. This was a matter that the pre-legislative scrutiny Committee
looked at when considering flexibility for the HFEA, although not
necessarily in this area. I assure the hon. Members for Boston and
Skegness and for Salisbury that the points that they have raised were
precisely those that I and my officials, who will remain nameless,
focused on. We wanted to ensure that the regulatory authority continued
to discharge its statutory duties correctly. I happily undertake to get
those details to members of the Committee as quickly as I
can.</div> <a name="08060423000198"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question put

Gale&#151;it has been rather a long afternoon already.
</div><a name="08060423000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">During the passage of
the Bill through another place, a debate took place on the use of
embryonic stem cells derived under research licences in therapeutic
applications. The Government subsequently wrote to all peers involved
in that debate setting out how, in the Government&#146;s view,
embryonic stem cells derived under an HFEA research licence could be
used in therapeutic applications. The amendments are consequential to
the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column69" />Column number: 69</div>Government&#146;s taking that view in another place. They will ensure
that research centres deriving embryonic stem cells that are intended
for therapeutic use are required to abide by the quality and safety
standards set out in the European tissues and cells directive, in
relation to stem cells and the embryos from which they are
derived.</div>
<a name="08060423000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">The directive
lays down standards of quality and safety for human tissues and cells
intended for human application, including gametes and embryos. The
relevant requirements already apply to embryos used in reproductive
treatment under the Human Fertilisation and Embryology (Quality and
Safety) Regulations 2007. Stem cells derived from embryos are also
regulated under the Human Tissue (Quality and Safety for Human
Application) Regulations 2007. It is important that those standards are
applied also to the embryos used to derive stem cells in human
applications in order to ensure the necessary levels of quality and
safety of tissues to be used in treatment.</div>
<a name="08060423000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">I commend the amendments to the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060423000351"></a>Mark
Simmonds:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for introducing
this batch of amendments. I have one or two queries. I understand the
logic of what she said, but there is no mention anywhere else in the
Bill of therapeutic applications for humans. Indeed, on the Floor of
the House I and the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon tabled
separate amendments and new clauses to allow licence for therapies to
take place, but they were rejected by the Minister.</div>
<a name="08060423000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would be helpful if the
Minister were to explain the wording used in the letter that she kindly
sent Committee members. How does the
phrase</div><a name="08060423000241"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;intended for
non-reproductive therapeutic application for humans&#148;</div>
<a name="08060423000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">fit in with her view that she will not
allow licences for therapies in the Bill? That letter then refers
to</div> <a name="08060423000242"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Directives
on safety and quality of cells and tissues for human
applications&#148;</div><a name="08060423000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">and
&#147;the relevant requirements&#148;. What are the relevant

explain what they
are?</div><a name="08060423000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">After the debates
in the other place, I initially thought that the application of the EU
directive did not apply to non-medical fertility services. However, the
Minister has confirmed today that it does apply to them. Will she
clarify that matter? Does it also cover the provision of gametes for
such purposes for both non-medical fertility services and
non-reproductive therapeutic
applications?</div><a name="08060423000252"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060423000352"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I seek your advice, Mr. Gale. I think
that the last two important questions raised by the hon. Member for
Boston and Skegness, were clause stand part-type questions, because the
deletion of the exception for non-medical fertility services is already
in clause 12. We are debating, initially, additional amendments to
that. Will you let me know shortly whether you wish me to deal with my
questions around non-medical fertility services?</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column70" />Column number: 70</div><a name="08060423000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Boston and Skegness has raised an important issue. I am
aware that we cannot really reopen the question of licences for therapy
at this stage, but, as he said, the issue involves stem cells intended
for non-reproductive therapeutic applications to humans. My question
for the Minister is simple. Would that cover non-research applications
to humans, or would that always cover research applications for the
lifetime of the Bill? If it includes non-research applications, then
further questions are raised about whether the Government are right to
be confident that any applications of stem cells derived from embryos
created under a licence could be created under a licence for research,
because there will always be research involved in the process? We
cannot reopen that discussion here, and I am not proposing to, but it
would be helpful for the Minister to clarify her view. Would those
non-reproductive therapeutic applications to humans apply to
non-research applications? Does her definition of research apply to
clinical trials? That is one understanding&#151;research carried out
under a research ethics committee approval, with a clear protocol. Or
is research to be read more widely&#151;some would say much more
widely?</div><a name="08060423000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will make
two more points. It is important, looking at the 1990 Act as amended,
that the safeguards apply here. The safeguards referred to include the
transfer of money and information and maintaining proper records. The
clause is important, therefore, because those are the general
conditions of
licences.</div><a name="08060423000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">My second
question I cannot remember. I might seek to intervene on the Minister,
if it occurs to
me.</div><a name="08060423000216"></a>

was perfectly happy to have a stand part debate at the start rather

matters in context, I am perfectly happy to allow the debate now. If
the hon. Gentleman wishes to add to his remarks, please feel free to do

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060423000354"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> On the issue of non-medical fertility services, I
think that what the Government are doing in the clause is removing the
exception for such services from the provisions. The tissue directive
and indeed the European Communities Act 1972 section 2 process did not
permit the Government to apply the licence conditions that we see in
the clause to non-medical fertility
services.</div><a name="08060423000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">What are
non-medical fertility services? They are defined in section 2 of the

are provided in the course of a business, for the purpose of assisting
women to carry children, but are not medical, surgical or obstetric
services.&#148;</div><a name="08060423000219"></a><div class="hs_Para" style="text-align: left;">It
would be useful for the Committee to know what are not the
&#147;medical&#148;, which I guess is using drugs, &#147;surgical
or obstetric&#148;, which speak for themselves,
&#147;services&#148; that will be covered by the general licence
conditions, which are extensive. How have we survived for so long under
the 1990 Act with non-medical fertility services&#151;my reading of
the measure might not be correct&#151;apparently not subject to the
licence conditions? To put it another way, will the Minister assure us
that this is not a discretionary regulation and, even if it is, that it
is not over-regulation of services that would not necessarily require
regulation by the HFEA? There is a general trend that as soon as an 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column71" />Column number: 71</div>authority is regulating things, it wants to continue regulating them and
identify new things to regulate. It is sometimes the job of Parliament
to retreat from that trend. <i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> The
ironic laughter of the hon. Member for Norwich, North reminds me that a
number of Select Committee reports, particularly the report that came
out under his chairmanship in 2005, argued that it was time that the
HFEA did not regulate basic fertility treatment because it is now
pretty standard. It is useful to collect information, but is it right
that licensable matters are subject to all such regulations, while, for
example, surgery to remove the blocking of fallopian tubes to treat
infertility continue to be completely unregulated by the HFEA? Such
treatment is currently subject to all the other regulation that
currently binds doctors. That is a wider issue, but I have been
provoked by the inclusion of non-medical fertility services in the
scope of the licence conditions in the
clause.</div>

term</div> <a name="08060423000244"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;non-medical
fertility services&#148;?</div> <a name="08060423000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">He
asked me what they might be: essentially, the measure is about internet
sperm delivery services&#151;he may have mentioned those. They have
to be described as &#147;non-medical&#148; in case any attempt is
made to deliver services other than via the internet, which currently
happens, apparently.&#151;<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i>
Perhaps I should have used a different
phrase.</div><a name="08060423000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">Moving on, I
should explain why the amendments are necessary, which will answer the
point made by the hon. Member for Boston and Skegness. The quality and
safety standards that are set out in the EU directive are aimed at
preventing the transmission of disease from donor to recipient of
tissues or cells. Two separate points were made and I do not want to
lose the distinction. The EU directive requires that provision is based
on the safety and quality of services, and that consent is obtained.
That is the set of issues to which the amendments
relate.</div><a name="08060423000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second set
of issues relate to therapeutic services. The Government believe that
the measure applies to research only. Our view is that, under a
research licence, an embryo can be used to derive stem cells for human
application as long as it can be shown to be part of a project of
research. The amendments would introduce a requirement to comply with
the directive that is aimed specifically at the limited area of quality
and safety, as I described. Two separate issues were conflated by my
use of the word &#147;therapeutic&#148; in my earlier remarks.
However, the issues are not connected. The amendments relate
specifically to the directive arrangements.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060423000356"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I know what the Minister says,
but it shows that the provision of stem cells for therapeutic
application cannot be said to be irrelevant to the HFEA or to the Bill.
It could be argued that it is a matter for the Human Tissue Act 2004 or
the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency; that once the
cells are used, the embryo is long gone, so it is not a matter for the
Bill or HFEA licences. I am keen not to provoke the Minister because we
are nearing the end of the sitting, but does she recognise that, even
as far as this relatively minor provision goes, when stem cells derived
from embryos&#151;not embryos&#151;are put into humans, the licence
conditions for the storage, use and creation of the embryo are relevant
to the end use, at least in principle? That goes to the question, to
which we might return, whether there needs to be greater specificity in
other aspects of the licence arrangements for such end
uses.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08060423000359"></a>Dawn
Primarolo:</b> Yes, and I listened very carefully to it. The
Government have not said that the provision of stem cells for
therapeutic application is irrelevant to the HFEA. The issue, which we
discussed on the Floor of the House, is whether therapy licences are
necessary. It is a separate issue. I can see the tenuous link that the
hon. Gentleman is trying to make, which is why I was careful to anchor
my comments by saying that we are talking about research for
therapeutic services, not the therapies themselves. We had a debate on
that on the Floor of the House, as I said. I have concluded my remarks
on that and I hope that they were helpful to the Committee.</div>
