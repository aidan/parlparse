</a></center></H3><P>
<H5>9.55 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Minister for Energy and Competitiveness in Europe (Mrs. Helen Liddell):</B> I beg to move,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That, during proceedings on the Utilities Bill, the Committee do meet on Tuesdays at half-past Ten o'clock and at half-past Four o'clock and on Thursdays at Ten o'clock and at half-past Two o'clock.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I welcome hon. Members to the Committee and you to the Chair, Mr. Hood. I am in the pleasant position of serving on a Committee whose Chairman comes from another part of Lanarkshire and will understand my accent.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Eleanor Laing </B>(Epping Forest): Hear, hear.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> Indeed, some Opposition Members may manage to understand my accent, too. I shall have to see what local dialect difficulties I can create to confuse the Committee. I am grateful for the opportunity to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Hood. I am conscious that our sittings will continue for a long time and that we shall rely heavily on your experience. I know that you are a keen gardener and that Mrs. Roe, our other Chairman, is interested in horticulture. I am sure that the Opposition and the Government will try to ensure that we have concluded our deliberations before the serious gardening season, although I would not put too much strength into that assertion. You may care, Mr. Hood, to get somebody else to look after the weeding for a few months. The Bill is large, and all of your parliamentary experience will be needed to guide us in our deliberations during the next few months. The sittings motion sets the times and dates for those deliberations. Some changes have been made since the motion was laid, for reasons that I shall outline.
<P>
In recognition of the complexity of the Bill, we propose to give the Committee an opportunity to work on its structure. For the next week, we will sit only in the morning. We shall sit on Tuesday 15 February from 10.30 am until 1 pm and on Thursday 17 February from 9.55 am until 11.25 am. The Government want to make progress on the detail of the Bill from then on. We propose four sittings a week, on Tuesdays from 10.30 am until 1 pm and from 4.30 pm until 7 pm, and on Thursdays from 9.55 am until 11.25 am and from 2.30 pm until 5.30 pm. I am sure that most hon. Members are aware that a short recess has been announced and that it will run from 23 to 25 February, assuming that the business of the House has been completed by that time.
<P>
I hope that hon. Members will find the proposed arrangements satisfactory and that they will contribute to an orderly, successful and detailed scrutiny of the Bill. I am pleased to see in the Committee hon. Members who spoke on Second Reading and I am happy that the Committee of Selection has included them. Many interesting points were made on Second Reading about renewable energy, the new electricity trading arrangements, and the social and environmental guidance, to name but a few subjects. During the next few weeks, we shall become very familiar with NETA, which began life as RETA--review of electricity trading arrangements. My officials have been prepared to brief members of all parties to help them to deal with the technical complexity of the Bill. The Government will be happy to arrange for further detailed briefings to be made outside the Committee, should we come to additional issues of technical complexity with which it is not comfortable to deal because hon. Members' knowledge--not least mine--is not of the required level.
<P>
I take this opportunity to thank the Opposition, who were gracious enough to highlight on Second Reading aspects of the Bill that they supported. Those aspects included the merger of the gas and electricity regulator, separate licences for electricity supply and distribution, the establishment of independent consumer councils and the reform of the electricity pool, this last in principle only. No doubt the Opposition will have detailed concerns that require clarification and, in the spirit of true co-operation, I shall endeavour to respond to them.
<P>
The Bill is very important. It delivers on the promise that we made during the general election campaign to achieve open and predictable regulation that is fair to customers and shareholders. It will improve the transparency, consistency and predictability of regulation, and it will provide a stable framework. I am sure that hon. Members would agree that we have an excellent opportunity further to improve the Bill. It will allow the people of this country to benefit from utilities regulation reform in a changing marketplace that will provide many opportunities for better service. I look forward to a lively and constructive debate.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> May I clear up something with the Minister? Does she want to move formally that we do not meet in the afternoon next week, or does she want to move the sittings motion as on the amendment paper?
<P>
<H5>10 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Greg Pope </B>(Hyndburn): On a point of order, Mr. Hood. I should like us to agree to the motion on the order paper. If we need to skip sittings, I shall announce that when I adjourn the Committee.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I thought that that was so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Gibb </B>(Bognor Regis and Littlehampton): I welcome you, Mr. Hood, to the Chair. I have not had the pleasure of serving on a Committee that is chaired by you, and I look forward to working with you over the coming weeks.
<P>
The Opposition regard the Bill as extremely important. We want to ensure that it is debated fully; aspects of it concern us. Our approach is to improve it by taking into account the views of people outside the House, so that we have a satisfactory regulatory system, but I am worried that the process is riddled with incompetence. I know that there is a shortage of parliamentary draftsmen and that it is difficult to get Bills drafted, but this Bill has not been well handled. There is uncertainty about next week's sitting and some clauses were missing, which meant that a revised version had to be issued.
<P>
The rumour is--I must base my comments on rumour because the Minister has given me no information--that there will be several hundred Government amendments. We need to know when they will be tabled. The Government allegedly pride themselves on their consultation with industry, but 12 amendments were tabled yesterday and might be debated next week. What time does that give the Opposition and people outside the House to promote their views? It is inadequate and unsatisfactory to table amendments so late. That might be necessary for some clauses, but there has been time since Second Reading to hold discussions on amendments with outside parties. I want two assurances: first, that we will have sufficient time to consult people outside the House who are worried about the Bill and the amendments and, secondly, that we will have time to table amendments to the amendments.
<P>
The explanatory notes give a long list of the categories that are to be amended. They state:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the Government intends to bring forward amendments later in the passage of the Bill...to give effect to them."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
How many amendments will the Minister table to each category? It is not unreasonable to expect that information. I would be alarmed if the Department did not have it. If it is not provided today, the Committee should be delayed until it is available. When will those amendments be tabled? We must ensure that we do not sit too soon after they have been tabled. The Government Whip is sighing, but the point is serious. As Opposition spokesman, I intend to take the Bill seriously. However, no Opposition Member can do that unless he has sufficient time to consider amendments and to consult outside bodies.
<P>
There will be Government amendments under several categories, including some concerning
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"a requirement for each regulator to take into account the implications of its decisions for other regulated sectors within a multi-utility".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
When shall we have the amendments? There will be
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"a requirement for regulators to give collective consideration to matters of common interests, and to publish the results".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
When shall we have those amendments? There will be
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"a requirement for the regulators to establish a code of practice on their consultation and decision-making procedures".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There will be amendments on
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the regulators' existing powers to publish information to align them with the equivalent powers of the new consumer councils so that the regulator can also publish information where this is in the interests of consumers".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There will also be amendments relating to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"measures consequential on the separation of electricity distribution and supply--including provision for transfer schemes for public electricity suppliers"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"measures to increase competition on gas transportation".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Finally, there will be
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"amendments to the procedures for referring licence modifications to the Competition Commission consequential on the new procedures for licence modifications".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We need to know today the number of amendments under each of the categories, when they will be published and when they will be debated.
<P>
In moving the sittings motion, the Minister said that the structure of the Bill would be debated next week. Will she clarify whether that means that we shall debate from clause 1, clause 84 and schedule 1 according to the motion, or does she have in mind a quasi-Second Reading debate on the organisation of the Bill?
<P>
The Bill lacks necessary details. It refers to many new regulatory powers--key clauses will give important new powers to the regulator and the Secretary of State. When will the draft statutory instruments referred to be published? I strongly believe that they should be published in good time for the debate on the power-making clauses. We do not know how many people the new authorities will employ or at what cost; nor the way in which the new consumer council people will be appointed.
<P>
We shall need considerable time to debate the Government's method. How do they reconcile their regulatory and interventionist approach with other views? David Edmonds--the telecoms regulator who will continue under the new regime--has said that regulation should be rolled back before competition is introduced. How do they reconcile the approach with the statement of Ian Byatt, the Director General of Water Services, that the Bill was over-complicated because it was over-prescriptive, and that the regulator would be festooned with detailed requirements likely to raise the cost, but not the effectiveness, of the regulations?
<P>
These are important philosophical points. Information on the statutory instruments is needed. I am pleased that guidance has already been published and I would like to see more published on social and environmental issues. Before we can debate the points, we need to know about powers, cost and who will be appointed.
<P>
How do the Government reconcile the approach with the views of PowerGen, which says that the regulations have
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the potential to increase significantly the costs and risks of business ... increasing costs to companies and working against the long-term interests of"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the consumer?
<P>
The approach is different from that of the Gas Act 1995, which was about potential future conduct. Under the Bill, unlimited fines may be applied to past acts--the scope is unlimited. The consequences for industry are dramatic. In most cases, fines will ultimately be borne by the consumer, for whom we are concerned.
<P>
We must spend considerable time on the issue and on understanding the way in which the system of fines will work. How will they ensure that the fines are proportionate and fair, and what will be the mechanism for implementing them? We need to debate those issues.
<P>
The appeals mechanism is a matter for concern. The Bill provides for a limited appeals mechanism, which is effectively limited to judicial review. There is no provision for the court to consider the facts. I am concerned about subsection (8) of new section 27E on financial penalties, which says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Except as provided by this section, the validity of a penalty shall not be questioned by any legal proceedings whatever."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is a far-reaching provision, and we must know what the Government mean by it. It contrasts sharply with the provisions of the Competition Act 1998, under which fines are imposed only if there is negligence or intent. It will be possible to impose fines under the Bill even if the activity was unintended. The approach taken in the Bill seems to be adversarial and I want to ensure that we have sufficient facts to enable us to debate it properly.
<P>
All those uncertainties will make companies more cautious and less innovative than they should be, with the result that the industry will be less competitive. That is bad for business. I am worried about the information requirements, a question that was raised on Second Reading, and about the regulatory gaining that could take place. That happened in the United States, where rivals who were also customers of the big utilities, used the information requirements in similar legislation to find out information that would enable them to compete more effectively, or even unfairly, with existing players. How do the Government propose to tackle that risk, of which the Minister said that she was aware?
<P>
On directors' pay, the published provisions relate to price-regulated activities, but what if the directors are in a public limited company, with only one or two utility- based subsidiaries, and its main activities are elsewhere? How do the Government intend to resolve that problem, in which the main players in that public limited company are not even on the board of the utilities companies? We must resolve such questions before we can debate the issue properly in Committee.
<P>
A key aspect of the Bill is the issue of duties and downgrading the promotion of competition. That concerns me because competition has produced lower prices for consumers, but lower prices are not achieved through legislation, We need to be certain about the Government's intention, which is vague. Why are the Government changing the order of objectives and duties? Is it because of purely presentational issues or do they have concrete concerns about the existing arrangements? What is the definition of consumer in the new objective? Does it include other electricity, water, telephone and gas companies, or does it relate only to the individual domestic consumer? That needs to be defined more precisely so that we know whom the Government intend to target.
<P>
What if there is a conflict between present and future consumers? How do the Government intend to resolve that conflict? It might be that today's consumers will benefit from a certain prescription but at the expense of future consumers. How can the regulator act as a custodian of both the consumer interest and the competitive process? Do the Government intend the regulator to deal with the industry and the consumer council's to deal with consumer bodies? That is not clear in the Bill or the explanatory notes, but we must fully understand it before we debate other clauses. Why are the Government downgrading the security of supply, which was always the utility companies' primary objective under the previous Act?
<P>
What will be the consequence for consumers' utility bills of giving the Secretary of State powers to impose social and environmental obligations on the regulators? Will those social and environmental costs simply be added to consumers' bills? As there will be no price capping of electricity bills, how will we ensure that costs are not merely passed on to consumers in the form of higher electricity bills? We already pay £1.20 a year for such objectives, which seems reasonable; will that figure be increased to £5 or £10? It is beholden on the Minister to explain precisely the effect that the proposal will have on consumers' electricity bills. The fear is that it is another taxation through stealth, imposed by the Government to implement their programme.
<P>
I am concerned about how the Committee will scrutinise the Bill. I am anxious, too, about the number of Government amendments that have been tabled. I want to know today the timetable, the number of amendments and how they fit in to the new matters on which the Government intend to legislate, which are detailed in the explanatory notes. The Bill has not been well handled so far and it is for every member of the Committee, not just Opposition Members, to ensure that the Bill is properly scrutinised. At the end of the day, we should have a Bill that will serve--[Interrtiption.]

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> At the end of the day, we should have a Bill that will serve the country well, because gas, electricity, water and telephone are vital services. We must ensure that the Committee helps to produce a better measure than the Bill as drafted, which is not worthy of being on the statute book.
<P>
<H5>10.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Norman Baker </B>(Lewes): On behalf of Liberal Democrat Members, may I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Hood. I have not had the pleasure of your chairmanship since I was a member of a Committee on European matters, and I am glad that you are chairing this Committee. I speak on behalf of the Liberal Democrat opposition; it might be helpful to the Committee if I refer to Liberal Democrat opposition and Conservative opposition, as we are separate parties with separate views on several matters.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Laing:</B> Indeed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Baker:</B> I am glad to have confirmation of my remark from the hon. Lady.
<P>
We shall approach the Bill in a constructive manner. pressing the Government when it is important to do so on issues that we believe are essential, such as freedom of information and the environmental implications of the Bill. We shall support the Government when we believe that they are doing the right thing. I hope, as a consequence that we shall make progress in our debates. 9 10 I suspect that you will not be taking gardening leave in the next few months, Mr. Hood. However, I am encouraged by the thought that a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step, which is what we are taking this morning.
<P>
I ask the Minister to confirm that any briefings available to the Conservative opposition will also be available to Liberal Democrat Members. I agree with the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) that amendments should be tabled in sufficient time for all members of the Committee to consider them, to assess their implications and, as the hon. Gentleman said, to take external soundings from interested parties. It would, of course, be helpful if Bills were drafted so that there was no need for Government amendments, but that is just pie in the sky.
<P>
Liberal Democrats believe that the Bill is well- intentioned and broadly correct, although we may table amendments to improve it. We hope to give it a fair wind and to make progress; we shall concentrate our efforts on essential matters and try not to delay the Committee unnecessarily.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Member for Lewes (Mr. Baker) for his constructive approach to the Bill. I confirm that briefings will be available not just to the Opposition but to all members of the Committee. I am conscious that the Bill contains detailed, technical points and we shall ensure that all Members are comfortable with those technicalities, at every stage.
<P>
I was surprised that the hon. Gentleman did not mention consumers, but perhaps the tirade from the official opposition pushed that subject out of his mind. We have it now, in the words of the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb), that the Conservative opposition do not want the consumer to have the early benefits that the Bill will bring about. That does not surprise me. We have to reform utilities regulation because of the mess made by the previous Government, who put consumers at the bottom of the list.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Bruce </B>(South Dorset): Will the right hon. Lady give way.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> No, I will not give way at the moment. because the hon. Gentleman was not here to begin with. I shall give way later.
<P>
As to the points made about the rules of the House by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, he criticised the Government for incompetence, but I notice that he had not got his act together enough to table amendments. He objected to the Government Whip's intervention with respect to seeking advice on the sittings motion. One reason for ministerial coyness about answering questions about the business management of a Committee is respect for the usual channels. The Government Whip will consult the Opposition Whips to ensure smooth progress of the Bill. If I am to take it from the hon. Gentleman's remarks that he wants to dispense with the usual channels, I am sure that the Committee's proceedings could be much more expeditious and more interesting to Labour Members than they will be under the spirit of co-operation.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Laing indicated dissent.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I am delighted that the hon. Lady appreciates the benefits of the usual channels. Indeed, when the hon. Gentleman began his remarks, his hon. Friends from the Back Benches were singularly lacking. That is a sign of the Opposition's great passion and commitment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Bruce:</B> I hope that the right hon. Lady will give way at appropriate times: we shall then get on much better. She may be interested to know that the usual channels have not informed our Whips that about 900 Government amendments are to be tabled. However, we heard it through unofficial channels, because the Government have told consumers and producers that it will happen.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> The hon. Gentleman is trying to scare the Committee. The usual channels have not informed the Government of 900 amendments.
<P>
I would rather have come to Committee with a complete Bill, but the Government have a heavy legislative programme. They were elected with a commitment to making progress for ordinary men and women, after 18 years in which those men and women were virtually ignored except to be made the subject of vindictive attacks. We shall deal with the Bill in accordance with the rules of the House of Commons.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton and his hon. Friend the Member for South Dorset (Mr. Bruce) are scaremongering about the number of amendments. There will be a substantial number, but that is not a unique occurrence with complex legislation. I draw the hon. Gentlemen's attention to the Companies Act 1989. The Government tabled 400 amendments in the other place and 110 to one part of the Bill on Report. They tabled 60 amendments on the first sitting.
<P>
The Government have presented the Bill now because they want consumers to be able to benefit from it. They also want discussion on the broad and significant issues involved. We do not want debate on many of those issues to be truncated. There is much for the Committee to get on with. Consumers and industry recognise what the Bill will do for the utility companies and for consumers' interests. I am sure that the usual channels will in due course ensure that both Opposition parties have proper access to amendments and that we shall be able to discuss them constructively.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brian White </B>(Milton Keynes, North-East): Do not this Government listen and respond to people's concerns, rather than, like the previous Government, ramming legislation down people's throats?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> My hon. Friend is correct. The Bill is before us because of extensive consultation with industry. We changed our minds about several of our intentions as a result of that consultation. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State said on Second Reading that we would revisit the question of the availability of information for consumer councils and perhaps table amendments. We are a Government who listen. However, synthetic angst about the Committee's proceedings does not do the consumers or utility companies any good. Utility companies and consumers want to see rational and constructive debate about the detail of the Bill. We have sought to take into account the views of companies and consumers, and shall continue to do so. The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton asked, in effect, for another Second Reading debate in Committee. That would not be appropriate. Bills are considered in Committee so that we can discuss in detail the amendments that are tabled.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I have listened carefully and patiently to the Minister. Can she now tell me how many amendments the Government intend to table?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> The hon. Gentleman's question is rather naðve. I cannot answer him at this point. Some amendments will be consequential amendments, and some will merely insert commas into sentences. I suggest that the hon. Gentleman reads the record of the proceedings of the Companies Bill, from which he will see that some of the consequential amendments that a Government have to make are such that we cannot yet say how many there will be. For example, some will be tabled as a consequence of changes to other legislation that are not yet apparent. An amendment tabled by one of my hon. Friends or an Opposition Member could, if accepted, lead to consequential amendments on some scale. I am not Mystic Meg: I am here to ensure that consumers and utility companies are given utilities regulation that is transparent, fair and improves companies' operations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> That is totally unacceptable. Given that the Minister can be allowed the caveat of disregarding amendments that are consequential to non-Government amendments that are accepted by the Committee, how many Government amendments will there be to each of the categories that are referred to in the explanatory notes?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> The hon. Gentleman apparently did not understand what I said. His question is impossible to answer, because I cannot foresee the number of consequential amendments, which may indeed be consequential on the Committee's acceptance of amendments that are tabled by the Opposition. If I were able to do that, I would play the lottery every week, and would probably be off planting a garden that is even better than yours, Mr. Hood. The Committee will have ample opportunity to discuss the Government's amendments, as well as those that the Opposition table--once they have managed to get themselves in a position to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> It is all very well for Government and Opposition Members to have these exchanges, but it is important for utility companies and consumers to know what the Government have in mind. They must have sufficient time to see what the Government are proposing and to make representations to hon. Members on both sides of the Committee. That will enable us to have sensible discussions. Publishing a Government amendment 48 hours beforehand does not provide adequate time.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> That is why the Government have taken two years to consult on the issues that the Bill covers. Interested parties have had plenty of opportunity to comment--indeed, many of the Bill's provisions are a direct consequence of that consultation process. When I sat on Committees as an Opposition Member, I never found it difficult to receive representations from interested parties in respect of amendments. Perhaps Members of the official Opposition and other Opposition parties will have to make themselves more available to those who wish to make representations to them. We have been making ourselves available for the past two years.
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> That is completely unsatisfactory. I simply asked the Minister to clarify what she meant when she said that we will debate the structure of the Bill next week. Does she mean that we will discuss clause 1, clause 84, schedule 1 and so on during next week's sittings? That was a straightforward question, and it deserves a straightforward answer.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> The hon. Gentleman seems to be unaware of the fact that we are about to discuss the order of consideration.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Then I hope that the Minister will answer my question at that point. I asked her how many amendments the Government currently intend to table, and she is unable to respond. That will alarm people outside this House. The Government are completely at sea on this important Bill. The polemical way in which the Minister responds to my questions is also discouraging.  We are discussing very important issues.
<P>
The Minister may believe in parliamentary scrutiny, and there may have been two years or more of consultation before the legislation was drafted, but the important thing is that the words of the Bill are scrutinised. We are debating issues of such complexity that the Minister felt it necessary to brief Committee members, for which we are grateful. It is not adequate to table amendments only 48 hours before the Committee. How are we to understand them, take soundings outside the House or allow outside bodies to consider their implications? It took at least a week for outside bodies to give proper consideration to the terms of the Bill. It would take a similar length of time to consider amendments, especially if they are to run to numbers such as 900, 700 or 500. Will the Minister give a broad estimate of the number? Will there be fewer than 100 or more than 400?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I hate to have to repeat myself. The Committee will become long and tedious if I have to repeat even the most basic points. There may be consequential amendments--
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Aside from the consequential amendments.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> How can I judge the matter aside from consequential amendments? That is almost impossible. The hon. Gentleman is merely trying to string this debate out. If we reached the order of consideration, we might make some progress.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I have no intention of stringing this out. I want the debate to finish quickly, but I want straightforward answers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Bruce:</B> Perhaps my hon. Friend is pressing a delicate point. Clearly, people in the Department of Trade and Industry have told other interested parties how many amendments will be forthcoming. Perhaps they have not told the Minister. If she does not know, that must be the case.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> That is a good point. Clearly, she does not know, which is worrying. The hon. Member for Milton Keynes, North-East (Mr. White) spoke about the Government listening and responding. How can they do so when proposed legislation is not available?
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Resolved,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That, during proceedings on the Utilities Bill, the Committee do meet on Tuesdays at half-past Ten o'clock and at half past Four o'clock and on Thursdays at Ten o'clock and at half-past Two o'clock.<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> May I set some ground rules? The sitting motion may be a broad topic, but I will not tolerate right hon. and hon. Members heckling during speeches. I say that to both sides of the Committee.
<P>
I remind the Committee that two financial resolutions are connected to the Bill, copies of which are available in the Room. Adequate notice of amendments should be given, as a general rule. My co-Chairman and I do not intend to call starred amendments, including any starred amendments that may be reached during the afternoon sitting of the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I beg to move,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That the Bill be considered in the following order, namely, Clause 1; Clause 84; Schedule 1; Clause 2; Clause 6; Clause 85; Clause 3; Clause 86; Clauses 4 and 5; Clause 87; Clause 7; Clause 88; Clause 8; Clause 12; Clause 89; Clause 9; Clause 13; Clause 90; Clause 10; Clause 14; Clause 11; Clause 15; Clause 91; Clauses 16 to 19; Clause 92; Schedule 2; Clause 95; Clause 20; Clause 96; Clause 21; Clause 94; Clauses 22 to 24; Clause 93; Clauses 25 and 26; Clause 63; Clause 66; Clauses 27 and 28; Clause 64; Clause 29; Clause 62; Clauses 30 to 33; Clause 65; Clause 34; Clause 67; Clause 100; Clause 35; Clause 68; Clauses 36 to 41; Clause 69; Clause 42; Clause 70; Clause 43; Clause 71; Clause 44; Clause 72; Clause 101; Clause 45; Clause 73; Clause 46; Clause 74; Clause 47; Clause 75; Clause 97; Clause 102; Clause 48; Clause 76; Clause 98; Clause 49; Clause 77; Clause 99; Clauses 50 to 57; Clause 78; Clause 58; Clause 79; Clauses 59 to 61; Clause 82; Clause 80; Clause 81; Clause 83; Clauses 103 to 105; Schedule 4; Clause 106; Schedule 3; Clauses 107 to 132; Schedules 5 to 7; Clauses 133 and 134; new Clauses; new Schedules.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We have departed from the order of provisions in the Bill. We did so for good reasons, with which I hope that the Committee will agree. The schedules will be taken immediately, when it is sensible to do so, after the clauses or groups of clauses to which they relate. That is common practice, of which everyone who has served on Standing Committees will be aware. It makes for a much more logical discussion.
<P>
This is a complex and technical Bill. Hon. Members will be aware that the Bill is set out utility sector by utility sector. However, a number of provisions relating to the energy and telecommunications sector are identical. It is therefore logical to discuss--as far as is practicable--each energy clause followed by a corresponding telecoms clause, if there is one. If we had to keep repeating ourselves, the discussion would become disjointed. For example, we shall discuss clause 1, which relates to the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority, followed by clause 84, which relates to the Telecommunications Authority.
<P>
Extending that principle, again in the interests of logical debate, we propose to consider the Bill in the following order: first, new regulatory arrangements, in clauses 1 to 88, including schedule 1; secondly, objectives of regulation, in clauses 8 to 91; thirdly, functions of consumer councils, in clauses 16 to 93, including schedule 2; fourthly, licensing, in clauses 25 to 68; fifthly, duties of electricity distributors, in clauses 36 to 41; sixthly, performance standards, in clauses 69 to 74; seventhly, enforcement of obligations, in clauses 47 to 98; eighthly, remuneration and service standards, in clauses 49 to 99; ninthly, electricity from renewable sources, in clauses 50 to 55; tenthly, energy and telecommunications miscellaneous, in clauses 56 to 103; eleventhly, water, in clauses 104 to 123, including schedules 4 and 3; twelfthly, the Competition Commission, in clauses 124 to 130; and finally, miscellaneous and supplementary issues, in clauses 131 to 134, including schedules 5 to 7. That will allow us to take the water clauses as a block.
<P>
As hon. Members will remember from Second Reading, the water regulatory arrangements are different from the energy and telecommunications arrangements, and will be dealt with by the Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, my hon. Friend the Member for Sunderland, South (Mr. Mullin). We propose to take at the end any new clauses needed to complete the Bill, assuming that they are not ready to be slotted in as we go through it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The order of consideration represents a sensible approach and accords with my view that clauses of the same theme should be taken. Many of the provisions are identical, and it makes sense not to have the same debate three or four times, depending on whether water is included.
<P>
I am still concerned about what the Minister meant when she referred to debating the structure of the Bill. What does she mean by that; what will we be debating on Tuesday and Thursday?
<P>
Can the Minister guarantee that the key statutory instruments referred to in the Bill will be available in draft form before the Committee debates the relevant clause, and say how far in advance of the debate they will be published? Will she also say when the amendments will be tabled? She clearly cannot give me the number of them, because she does not know it, but can she say how long members of the Committee will have to consider them before the sitting, and confirm that she will not leave it till the last minute--the 48 hours referred to by you, Mr. Hood? How many new clauses does she think there may be towards the end of our proceedings?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> We shall endeavour to table amendments to give Opposition Members, and indeed my hon. Friends, adequate time to consider them, but that is in the hands of the parliamentary draftsmen. I ask the official Opposition and Liberal Democrat Members to ensure that the Government have advance notice of their amendments as well, to give us an opportunity to consider them.
<P>
I understand that the business that we hope to get through on Tuesday morning has been agreed through the usual channels. Perhaps the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) will discuss the agreement with his Whip. If he wishes me to go through the order of consideration again, I am happy to do so.
<P>
On Tuesday morning, we shall be able to examine the main structure of the Bill, which is about reforming utilities regulation. The first area that we shall discuss is the new regulatory arrangements, which allow us to consider the core of the Bill--the replacement structures. We will move on from that to consider the objectives of regulation, because in a modern market, regulation requires transparency and clarity. We should also have an idea of costs. Transparent and clear regulation will make it possible to drive down the costs of regulation, which is the Bill's core aim. Our debates next week will go to the heart of the Bill. We should make progress discussing the Bill's overall framework before proceeding to its nuts and bolts.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton knows that I cannot tell him how many new clauses there will be, but when we are able to do so, we shall make that information available through the usual channels. If it is appropriate to discuss them during our deliberations, we shall arrange for that to be done.

<P>

<B>Mr. Baker:</B> Will the Minister confirm that the usual channels will include the Liberal Democrat Whips Office?
<P>
I welcome the structure that the Minister set out and her sensible approach. However, I am concerned about the regulation of water. It is somewhat artificial to have one regulatory regime for gas, electricity and telecommunications and another for water. Water is not a significantly different utility, but it happens to be the responsibility of the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, while the other utilities are the responsibility of the Department of Trade and Industry. The Bill's proposals follow not logic but current departmental divisions. I hope that the Government will consider whether the regulatory regime for water should be more closely related to those for gas, electricity and telecommunications. Will the Minister ensure that the Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions is fully apprised of our debates on the regulation of gas, electricity and telecommunications? I hope that he will be open minded--
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> She.
<P>
<B>Mr. Baker:</B> I was referring to the hon. Member for Sunderland, South. I hope that he will be fully apprised of our debates on the regulatory regimes for gas, electricity and telecommunications and that he will consider regulating water along similar lines. That would avoid reinforcing departmental battles between the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions and the Department of Trade and Industry.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I must apologise to the Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, my hon. Friend the Member for Sunderland, South. I inflated his importance by promoting him to the fairer sex.
<P>
Water is treated separately not for reasons of convenience or because a Minister from the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions was involved, but because there is a fundamental difference between water and gas, electricity and telecommunications, namely the absence of competition in relation to water. It was made clear on Second Reading that that is why different provisions are needed. It was logical to group together issues relating to water. Our debate on gas, electricity and telecommunications would be blurred if we had to make cross-references to a situation that does not involve competition. We seek to encourage such competition in relation to gas, electricity and telecommunications.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Hyndbum (Mr. Pope), who is a Whip, and I will ensure that the usual channels includes the Liberal Democrats.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Bruce:</B> I rise briefly not only to discuss the order of consideration but also to make a declaration of interest. It is important for Committee members to do so. In our forthcoming debates, I shall be careful not to promote any particular interests above those of ordinary consumers.
<P>
I am a professional adviser to the Telecommunications Managers Association, and my family and I have a small number of shares in most of the privatised electricity companies and more substantial holdings in telecommunications companies, including BT and Cable and Wireless. I think that we no longer have shares in water companies. I am also a user of electricity, telecommunications and water. When I first entered the House, I belonged to the Industry and Parliament Trust, and we paid close attention to the Central Electricity Generating Board, which was replaced by many individual companies.
<P>
I want to discuss briefly the order of consideration. I thank the Minister for arranging for officials from the Department of Trade and Industry to brief Committee members on the Bill. My hon. Friends and I, and one Labour Member, attended that useful briefing, to which I hope that the Liberal Democrats were invited.
<P>
Several all-party committees have proposed making changes to the Office of Telecommunications. Before the election, the Labour party was committed to reducing the number of regulatory bodies that operated in the field of communications and broadcasting, and I believe that a White Paper was involved. However, it is strange that the Government want to change Oftel's structure and to find a way forward for Oftel and the other regulatory bodies. Will the Government take that extra step in their reform of Oftel?
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his contribution and for his declaration of interest. It is good to start in a business-like manner.
<P>
The regulation of telecommunications is associated with the way in which technology will change. The hon. Gentleman may know that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport is engaged in a wide-ranging review of new technological developments in telecommunications, which will transform the operation of telecommunications and e-commerce. We are entering a new digital age, and new structures may be needed in the longer term. However, we cannot currently discuss them because we are not aware of all of the changes in technology or in international responsibilities that will occur.
<P>
Reforming the regulation of telecommunications will benefit the ordinary end-user of the telecommunications industry. If new structures have to be added to take account of new technology, we should ensure that the groundwork has been done and that consumer interests have been taken into account. Judging by the interests and the shareholdings of the hon. Member for South Dorset, he has an extensive knowledge of the telecommunications industry--it is no doubt much greater than my own. He is undoubtedly aware that major new technological developments need to be taken into account, and that it will take some time to do so. We may not be able to do so before the next general election. I am sure that the Government and the Opposition agree on the importance of that process.
<P>
<B>Mr. Baker:</B> Have Ministers and officials from the Department for Culture, Media and Sport been consulted on the convergence of telecommunications and broadcasting?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> Yes.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Resolved,
<P>
