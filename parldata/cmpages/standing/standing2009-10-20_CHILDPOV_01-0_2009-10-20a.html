Chairman:</b> I have a few preliminary announcements to make.
Hon. Members may remove their jackets during Committee sittings. Will
all members of the Committee ensure that mobile phones, pagers and so
on are turned off or switched to silent mode during sittings? Copies of
the money resolution in connection with the Bill are available in the
room. I remind members of the Committee that adequate notice should be
given of amendments. As a general rule, I and my fellow Chair do not
intend to call starred amendments, including any that might be reached
during an afternoon sitting of the Committee.</div>
<a name="09102059000007"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Committee
will first be asked to consider the programme motion, on which debate
is limited to half an hour. We will then proceed to a motion to report
written evidence and a motion to permit the Committee to deliberate in
private in advance of oral evidence sessions, both of which I hope we
can take formally. Assuming that the second motion is agreed, the
Committee will then move into private session. Once it has deliberated,
witnesses and members of the public will be invited back into the room
and our oral evidence session will
begin.</div><a name="09102059000008"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09102059000279"></a><b class="B">Andrew

I was saying, if the Committee agrees to the programme motion, it will

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
1</b><a name="09102059000286"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Graham Stuart</b> (Beverley and Holderness) (Con): According
to the &#147;Oxford English Dictionary&#148;, in modern English
&#147;eradicate&#148; means to remove or destroy completely. Do you
accept that describing the targets in the Bill as relating to the
&#147;eradication&#148; of child poverty represents an
inappropriate use of the word? Would the term &#147;substantial
reduction&#148; be more
appropriate?</div><a name="09102059000027"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Timms:</b></i> No, I would not. Eradication is the
appropriate term, because poverty needs to be measured other than by
relative income. If we are reducing the proportion of children growing
up in households with incomes of less than 60 per cent. of median to 10
per cent. or less, we are not eradicating the phenomenon. However, the
Bill carefully includes other measures because, as most people would
accept, that one measure does not capture the totality of poverty. We
could say that if we have achieved all the targets in the Bill, we have
met our goal. That is not to say that there will never be children in
households with income of less than 60 per cent. of median income.
Nevertheless, the phenomenon of child poverty, which all of us see and
which grew rapidly for a while but has been reduced in recent years,
would have been
eradicated.</div><a name="09102059000028"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
2</b><b class="B"><a name="09102059000287"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> So are the Government announcing today that they
are rejecting relative poverty as the fundamental measure of
poverty?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column4" />Column number: 4</div><a name="09102059000029"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Timms:</b></i> The Bill includes four measures. From the
outset, our intention, which has been widely accepted, was to recognise
that attempting to measure poverty with a single measure would not
work.</div><a name="09102059000030"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
3</b><b class="B"><a name="09102059000288"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> The Government set out that they were going to
seek to put Britain among the best countries in Europe in terms of
child poverty. However, while other countries in Europe have fewer than
5 per cent. in relative poverty today, the Government are defining
fewer than 10 per cent. as &#147;eradication&#148;. Surely that is
an insult to the children who will continue to suffer relative poverty,
even if the measures are
successful.</div><a name="09102059000031"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Timms:</b></i> No, they do not. Denmark has the lowest
proportion of any EU country, which is 10 per cent. on the most recent
2007 data. Every other EU country has a proportion higher than 10 per
cent.</div>
<a name="09102059000032"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
4</b><a name="09102059000289"></a><b class="B">Ms
Karen Buck</b> (Regent's Park and Kensington, North) (Lab): A
past criticism of child poverty progress has been that while some
low-hanging fruit has been dealt with, the problem of severe and
persistent poverty has not been tackled as rigorously as we would have
liked. In the Bill, tackling persistent poverty will be dealt with
retrospectively through the new Understanding Society survey. Is there
not a danger that that will effectively postpone rigorous action on
dealing with severe and persistent poverty? How will that be
overcome?</div><a name="09102059000033"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Timms:</b></i> I do not think that it will have that effect.
It is true that, because of the break in the data, it will be a while
before we have the numbers to enable us to set the right level of the
target for persistent poverty, but I do not think that that needs to
delay action to address the problem&#151;I certainly hope that it
will not. For me, this is a particularly important measure. We can all
see that while being in a household with a relatively low income for a
short period is one thing, all the evidence shows that being in that
situation for a long period can be seriously damaging to a
child&#146;s prospects. We are lumbered with the break in the data,
but I do not think that that needs to delay action on tackling the
problem.</div><a name="09102059000034"></a>

5</b><b class="B"><a name="09102059000290"></a>Ms
Buck:</b> Do you accept that groups concerned with poverty
would probably say that a ministerial hope will not be enough to
reassure them that measuring severe and persistent poverty will be
central to the Government&#146;s objectives? Can we not be
firmer?</div>
<a name="09102059000035"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Timms:</b></i> There are two separate things. Persistent
poverty is in the Bill. It is clear that it will be a key element in
the targets have to be hit, which places it right at the heart of the
Government&#146;s strategy for tackling child poverty. Severe poverty
is a slightly different matter. There are quite serious measurement
difficulties regarding exactly what we mean by severe poverty. The
survey evidence makes it pretty clear that there is something a bit odd
happening, because those who appear in the income survey data as having
the lowest incomes&#151;significantly less than 60 per cent. of
median income&#151;appear not to be suffering from material
deprivation. There has been some research into that but I do not think
that we fully understand it. I cannot say that we will be measuring
severe poverty closely, because of the difficulty in the data but, for
persistent poverty, we most certainly will.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
6</b><b class="B"><a name="09102059000291"></a>Ms
Buck:</b> This is my last question. All the evidence indicates
that it is primarily, though not exclusively, black and minority ethnic
populations who are most at risk of severe and persistent poverty. Does
the Bill&#146;s impact assessment address that, and how do you see
the correlation between ethnicity and poverty being
addressed?</div><a name="09102059000037"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Timms:</b></i> It is certainly true that the levels of child
poverty are significantly greater in quite a number of the ethnic
minority groups&#151;not all, but quite a number. Helen might want to
comment on this, but that has been the reason behind specific work in
the DWP around employment for parents and others from ethnic minority
groups and the establishment of the ethnic minority advisory group. I
see that being addressed through our work on employment, and we will
need to address it elsewhere in the
strategy.</div><a name="09102059000038"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Helen
Goodman:</b></i> I would just add one point, which is that
this ties in with part 2 of the Bill, which addresses the powers and
duties of local authorities. It is precisely because different
communities face different barriers to employment and tackling poverty,
which is partly due to different minority communities, that we want to
give local authorities that particular
focus.</div><a name="09102059000039"></a>

like to apologise, Mr. Caton. I thought that I was 15
minutes early for 11 o&#146;clock, so apologies to all
Committee members. I walked briskly from the Department for Children,
Schools and Families. I am the Minister of State for Children, Young

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
7</b><a name="09102059000293"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Jamie Reed</b> (Copeland) (Lab): On the issue of measurement,
while no one doubts the intentions of the Bill, there are issues to be
resolved. We have talked about some of the most severely impoverished
groups of children in the country, who require the provisions of the
Bill to be applied to them. There is a difficulty with asylum-seeking,
Gypsy and Roma children, for whom there are no targets in the Bill, are
there not? How are we going to address those people?</div>
<a name="09102059000042"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Timms:</b></i> The answer is that the strategies required by
the Bill&#151;this picks up on a point that Helen was
making&#151;will need to address the position of those children along
with other children. The difficulty to which you are rightly drawing
attention is about counting children who are not in households in the
normal sense and who, therefore, will not be picked up in the household
surveys on which data will be based. Nevertheless, we can address the
needs of those children through the strategies drawn up and it is
firmly our intention to  do so.</div>
<a name="09102059000043"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
8</b><b class="B"><a name="09102059000294"></a>Mr.
Reed:</b> My concern is that although we can measure the
effect of the Bill, it will be difficult to measure the needs
comprehensively before we implement the Bill. I am still worried that
some children might slip below the radar&#151;children of families
that do not claim income tax credit, the family entitlements that they
are allowed or free school meals&#151;or not appear on our radar at
all. How will the targets in the Bill address their
needs?</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column6" />Column number: 6</div><a name="09102059000044"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Helen
Goodman:</b></i> May I say something about this,
Mr. Caton? Obviously, to measure what is happening over
time, we need a definition of the children who are measured&#151;that
is the definition of &#147;children in households&#148;. That does
not in and of itself exclude asylum-seeking children or Gypsy, Roma and
Traveller children. Some of those children live in households; they
will be counted and covered in the normal way. As far as Traveller,
Gypsy and Roma children are concerned, it all depends on whether the
sites where they are living are permanent, with post codes and proper
addresses. Those children will be
included.</div><a name="09102059000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would not want the Committee to take away the idea that the Government
do not have equal concern for the small number of children who are not
covered by the survey, the way in which they are treated and their
quality of life, and that we do not have programmes to address their
needs. For example, we have particular targets and objectives to help
looked-after children to improve their educational achievement. I think
that the DCSF Minister knows more about this than I do and might be
able to help you a little more. Not being covered in the Bill is not a
sign of the Government not being concerned about them.</div>
<a name="09102059000046"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dawn
Primarolo:</b></i> I want to add briefly that this is a
question of the layers of a strategy. Stephen and Helen have covered
measurement but, over and above that, there has been specific mention
of Roma and Traveller children and children from asylum-seeking
families. My Department is working with local authorities to develop
strategies for that very small number of children who could fall
outside our radar, as you rightly say. The challenge, as always, is to
ensure that our strategy looks at all the determinants and measures the
ones that we think are key for all children in tackling
poverty&#151;that is where we are&#151;and to make decisions about
what you put in a Bill while ensuring that it is reinforced by other
strategies and
policies.</div><a name="09102059000047"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
9</b><b class="B"><a name="09102059000295"></a>Andrew
Selous:</b> One other group in society suffers more than its
fair share of poverty: families in which disability is present. A
disability within a family clearly adds a significant element of cost
to that family. I do not think that anyone would dispute that. The
Government count disability living allowance as income for such a
family, but I think that we recognise that that is offset by the costs
of dealing with the disability. Do the Government recognise that as an
issue? Do the Ministers before us think that that is fair and right,
and do they propose to do anything about it? With housing costs, we
look at income both before and after the costs; is there not the case
for doing the same with the costs of
disability?</div><a name="09102059000048"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Helen
Goodman:</b></i> I am sure that the Committee is aware that
that is a long-standing issue, which we have discussed on other
occasions as well. Of course, people with disabilities have higher
costs, and those higher costs are recognised by the Government in the
disability living allowance, which is paid to people at different rates
depending on the impact of the disability on their way of life. We
intend to continue with
that.</div><a name="09102059000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have some difficulty measuring that impact on families before DLA is
paid, not least because we do not know how many people might have such
needs&#151;they are not measured if people do not claim the
allowance. However, the Bill is a step forward, because if you turn to
the definitions in the material deprivation standard 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column7" />Column number: 7</div>you will see that a number of them are about families with a disabled
person&#151;a child or an adult&#151;only being able to achieve the
quality of life that we are looking for with a higher standard of
living. So, including the material deprivation standard tightens it up
considerably.</div><a name="09102059000050"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
10</b><b class="B"><a name="09102059000296"></a>Andrew
Selous:</b> Okay, but there are no plans to stop counting DLA
as income available to the family, in a generally understood
sense.</div><a name="09102059000051"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Helen
Goodman:</b></i> DLA is
income.</div><a name="09102059000052"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
11</b><b class="B"><a name="09102059000297"></a>Andrew
Selous:</b> But it has costs attached, which you would accept
are
specific.</div><a name="09102059000053"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Helen
Goodman:</b></i> Of course, it does have costs attached, but
it is also income; it would be nonsensical not to include it as
income.</div><a name="09102059000054"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
12</b><b class="B"><a name="09102059000298"></a>Andrew
Selous:</b> But you do it differently for housing,
don&#146;t
you?</div><a name="09102059000055"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Helen
Goodman:</b></i> We do it differently for housing, but I am
not sure why the hon. Gentleman thinks that that is a parallel. I am
not sure that I have fully understood why there is a parallel
there.</div><a name="09102059000056"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
13</b><b class="B"><a name="09102059000299"></a>Andrew
Selous:</b> I can explain that parallel very clearly. I think
that most people accept that what a family has to live on, for food,
heating and so on, is what they have available after they have paid
their rent. That is why the Government have an &#147;after and before
housing costs&#148; way of looking at the issue. Is it not very
similar with disability in those families that have clear, defined
weekly costs relating to their
disability?</div><a name="09102059000057"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Helen
Goodman:</b></i> I do not think that it is, because although
the disability living allowance is paid to people according to the
impact on their way of life, to meet their needs, the lack of that
income is not the same across the board in the systematic way that it
is with
housing.</div><a name="09102059000058"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
14</b><a name="09102059000300"></a><b class="B">Steve
Webb</b> (Northavon) (LD): To inform our assessment of how
much the issue matters, is the Minister willing to ask her
Department&#146;s statisticians simply to run the stats through once
minus DLA, so that we have a sense of how much the inclusion of DLA,
which is income regarding which no costs are taken account of, affects
the figures? I used to construct those figures myself, and it is simply
a matter of excluding one income value from the totals and turning the
handle. Is she willing to do that, to inform the Committee&#146;s
discussions?</div><a name="09102059000059"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Helen
Goodman:</b></i> I do not know whether it is as simple as
that.</div><a name="09102059000060"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102059000301"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> It
is.</div><a name="09102059000061"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Helen

is.</div><a name="09102059000062"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
15</b><b class="B"><a name="09102059000302"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> May I explore what would constitute a breach of the
duty on the Secretary of State under clause 1? If the Bill had been in
place since 1997&#151;enshrining the 2004-05 and the 2010 targets, as
the 2020 target is enshrined in the Bill&#151;what would the
Government have done differently?</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column8" />Column number: 8</div><a name="09102059000063"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Timms:</b></i> I do not know. The Bill is clear about the
circumstances in which the duty would be breached&#151;that is, if
the targets are not met by the end of the financial year 2020 and if
the report required by clause 14 states that they have not been met. If
that kind of arrangement had been in place for the 2010 target, as we
got closer to 2010 there would have had to be changes. What those would
have been is impossible to say.</div>
<a name="09102059000064"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
16</b><b class="B"><a name="09102059000303"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> May I give one example? The Institute of Fiscal
Studies, in its report of February this year&#151;produced in
conjunction with the Joseph Rowntree Foundation&#151;said that in
order to meet the 2010 target, an additional &#163;4.2 billion in tax
credits and benefits would need to be spent. Had the Bill been in
place, as I described a moment ago, would the Government, in order to
comply with the Bill, have had to increase benefits and tax credits
along those
lines?</div><a name="09102059000065"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Timms:</b></i> The difference is that under the terms of the
Bill there will be strategies drawn up, kept up to date and reviewed,
and regular progress reports will be made over the 10 years leading up
to 2020. Certainly, there will be a need for significant policy
initiatives, but I hope that it would be possible to show over the
course of the next decade that the Government are on track to meet the
target, given the significantly different and more demanding set of
arrangements that the Bill puts in place.</div>
<a name="09102059000066"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
17</b><b class="B"><a name="09102059000304"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> But the Government have had strategies in place to
meet their child poverty targets over the past few years. The Bill
would now enshrine them in legislation, but the Government have had
strategies. Yet we get to 2009 and it is pretty clear that the 2010
target is not going to be met. That has been clear at least since 2006.
What would the Government have done since, say, 2006, when the IFS said
that an additional &#163;4.3 billion needed to be spent on tax
credits and benefits, given that they had a hard and fast obligation to
meet the
target?</div><a name="09102059000067"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Timms:</b></i> First, on the question of the 2010 target, the
IFS estimates that, if there are no further policy initiatives, we
should be about two thirds of the way to the 2010 target by the end of
the financial year 2010-11. That is despite the fact that we are in the
biggest downturn in the world economy for 60 years or more. The
arrangement that the Bill sets out is significantly more demanding for
the coming decade than the arrangements that have been in place over
the past 10 years. That is the reason for the legislation.
There will be strategies, formally drawn up, required by the Act, there
will be a commission to advise on the work and there will be regular
formal progress reports on how we are getting on. I believe that that
will enable the Government over the next 10 years to ensure that the
targets are delivered by 2020.</div>
<a name="09102059000068"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
18</b><b class="B"><a name="09102059000305"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> So it would it be fair to say that the Bill imposes
a tougher regime, and gives a higher priority to child poverty, for
future Governments than has been in place for the current Government
over the past 10
years.</div><a name="09102059000069"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Timms:</b></i> It is certainly a more demanding regime,
yes.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column9" />Column number: 9</div><a name="09102059000070"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
19</b><b class="B"><a name="09102059000306"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> We all know that the public finances are going to
be in a more demanding position over the next few years, but is that an
obligation that the Bill imposes on future
Governments?</div><a name="09102059000071"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Timms:</b></i> Yes. The central challenge for the work of
drawing up the strategy will be to show how achieving the targets can
be delivered alongside the consolidation that will be required for much
of the coming decade. Indeed, that is an important reason for clause 15
highlighting that the strategy needs to be consistent with the overall
economic
strategy.</div><a name="09102059000072"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
20</b><b class="B"><a name="09102059000307"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> We will come to clause 15 in a moment. We are
looking forward to a greater emphasis on child poverty from now on;
that appears to be what you are saying. A pre-Budget report is coming
up, presumably next month. The Government could start trying to comply
with the 2010 target then by introducing measures to increase tax
credits and so on. I have a suspicion that you are not going to do that
to the extent of meeting your 2010 target. Why
not?</div><a name="09102059000073"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Timms:</b></i> Questions about what may or may not be
announced in the PBR are probably for another occasion. It is certainly
clear that it will be difficult to hit the 2010 target in the current
circumstances&#151;a point I have made on a number of
occasions&#151;but we certainly have not given up on the target. As I
say, on the basis of the Institute for Fiscal Studies projections, and
without any additional initiatives, we will be two thirds of the way to
that
target.</div><a name="09102059000074"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
21</b><b class="B"><a name="09102059000308"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b><b class="B"> </b>May I ask one more quick question on this
subject? You quote the IFS and you also state that you have had the
difficulties of the recession. The implication is that that has made
things harder. The child poverty measure is a relative measure and, by
and large, low-income families who are on benefits tend to be less
affected by the recession than those who are working and those at the
median level. The IFS has said that its forecasts for child poverty in
2010 would be slightly lower if the economy were to perform worse than
the Treasury assumed. It has been clear for some years&#151;years
predating the recession&#151;that you were not going to meet the 2010
targets. So is not the claim that it is due to the recession complete
nonsense?</div>
<a name="09102059000075"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Timms:</b></i> No. You are absolutely right to point out that
there is not a straightforward link between the economy being in a
recession and what happens to child poverty. From memory, although the
child poverty line was on a generally inexorable upward ascent
throughout the period from 1979 to 1997, it did not go up that much
faster during the very damaging recessions in the &#146;80s and the
&#146;90s. However, in the current environment, Government spending
is very tightly constrained. That, in particular, is what has limited
what has been possible over the last couple of
years.</div><a name="09102059000076"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
22</b><b class="B"><a name="09102059000309"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> I am just trying to think through this issue of the
value added of the Bill. I think that we would all agree that any
enhanced effort to tackle child poverty is a good thing, that progress
is a good thing and so forth, but we are not really talking about that.
We are talking about eradication and a binding 2020 target. If, in a
very benign economic environment, we miss the five-year target and the
10-year target&#151;that, as 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column10" />Column number: 10</div>has been said, is the low-hanging fruit&#151;it does not take a genius
to say that the next five years are going to be very tough financially.
We are not going to achieve the 2020 target without some very dramatic
change of policy and emphasis. That would be the central assumption of
an independent observer. The focus on the get-out clauses then starts
to become important, as does the focus on enforcement, which is the
flip side of the Bill. I have a couple of questions about
enforcement.</div>
<a name="09102059000077"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Timms:</b></i> May I just make a comment? I accept the logic
of your point. One of the things that will be different during the next
10 years is that we will be able to benefit from the substantial
investment in public services over the past 10 years, and that will
have a significant impact. The Bill requires us to draw up a strategy
to set out how targets can be achieved in what will be a constrained
fiscal environment over much of the next decade. I certainly do not
accept that it is time to give up or admit
defeat.</div>
<a name="09102059000078"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
23</b><b class="B"><a name="09102059000310"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> No, I was not suggesting that we give up, but we
need to know what the world would be like if it looks as if we are
going to miss those targets. The first question is about how one
enforces that duty. Will the Minister tell us what he envisages might
happen? Suppose we get to 2017-18 and we are miles away from the
target. Presumably, we will not know the 2020 numbers until
2022&#151;I am not quite sure how that works. Who brings forward the
judicial review? Who has to have the money to enforce the duty? If the
measures are not working, who is going to use the stick? What is the
value-added of this measure?</div>
<a name="09102059000079"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Timms:</b></i> First, I do not envisage us getting to a
position in 2016 or 2017 where we are surprised to find that we are not
on track. By that stage, we will have had a number of
iterations&#151;two I think&#151;of the strategy. We will have had
regular annual reports, and the Government will be required to take
every opportunity to ensure that by the time we get to 2017, we are in
a position to achieve the target.</div>
<a name="09102059000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">When it comes
to who might take forward a judicial review, I think, at least in
theory, that it could be done by a wide range of people. I suppose one
could anticipate that those might include some of the effective child
poverty lobbying
organisations.</div><a name="09102059000081"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102059000311"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> But they would have to find the money to do
that.</div><a name="09102059000082"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Timms:</b></i> No doubt there would be costs but, as you
know, often those costs do not prohibit action from being
taken.</div>
<a name="09102059000083"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
24</b><b class="B"><a name="09102059000312"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> What about the defence that one might offer? We will
come on to clause 15 more substantively in a moment, but judging by the
Bill, the child poverty commission might say, &#147;We recommend
this, but after having regard to the fiscal circumstances, we are not
sure that we can actually find &#163;4 billion&#148;, or whatever
the number is by the end. The Secretary of State, having regard to the
fiscal position might say, &#147;We&#146;d love to tackle child
poverty but we haven&#146;t got the money.&#148; The judicial
review then comes along, and the Minister stands up and says,
&#147;We would have loved to have done it, but we didn&#146;t have
the cash, and the Bill allows us to not achieve it.&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column11" />Column number: 11</div><a name="09102059000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given that it
will be possible to say such things in  15 years&#146; time,
and given that it will probably be impossible to achieve those goals if
we cannot do it when the times are right&#151;we have missed the
five-year and the 10-year targets&#151;are we not building up a whole
set of excuses for 10 years&#146; time?</div>
<a name="09102059000085"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Timms:</b></i> No. I take issue with a number of those
points. In particular, the Bill does not say that if fiscal
circumstances are difficult the target does not have to be met. The
target is not qualified in the Bill and that is an important point that
should be underlined.</div>
<a name="09102059000086"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
25</b><b class="B"><a name="09102059000313"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> But the strategy is.</div>
<a name="09102059000087"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Timms:</b></i> No. The strategy needs to be consistent with
the economic realities. That is true and clearly must be the case. Any
Government strategy must be consistent with the truth about the fiscal
environment. It is a strength of the Bill that that point is explicit,
rather than implicit or assumed. However, hitting the target in the
Bill is not subject to propitious fiscal circumstances. The Bill
requires those targets to be met.
</div><a name="09102059000088"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
26</b><b class="B"><a name="09102059000314"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> What if the immovable object hits the irresistible
force? What if meeting the target requires something fiscally, but the
advice is that we cannot do it fiscally? What gives?</div>
<a name="09102059000089"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Timms:</b></i> Under the Bill, a court could, in response to
a judicial review, require the Government to make substantial spending
commitments in order for the targets to be met. This is a strongly
binding target.</div>

27</b><b class="B"><a name="09102059000315"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I shall follow on similar lines. I am interested in
your point that the court could require the Government to make fairly
substantial spending commitments. For example, it could presumably
require the Government to increase child tax credits, which is perhaps
unlikely, but do you envisage that as a possibility under the Bill? Is
there any reason why a court could not do
that?</div><a name="09102059000091"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Timms:</b></i> I do not know whether, in practice, a court
would want to set out the detailed policy changes that it thought were
needed, although it is conceivable that it might. I suspect that it
would not give instructions on quite that detailed a levy, but it
certainly could require the Government to make substantial
expenditure.</div><a name="09102059000092"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
28</b><b class="B"><a name="09102059000316"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I suspect that you are right that the court would
send it back to the Government and ask them to think again and come up
with more proposals. However, if the proposals were inadequate to meet
the requirement&#151;the likes of the IFS and the Joseph Rowntree
Foundation tend to state that the only way that the Government can meet
a target at a particular point is by increasing tax credits&#151;it
is presumably possible that that may
happen.</div><a name="09102059000093"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Timms:</b></i> There certainly could be a judicial review
that in effect required the Government to spend more on tax credits or
some other element of the benefit or tax credit
system.</div><a name="09102059000094"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
29</b><b class="B"><a name="09102059000317"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> Briefly returning to my earlier counter-factual
point: if there was currently an Act enshrining the 2010 target and the
Government did not intend to meet that target through an increase in
child tax credits, it would presumably be possible for a child
poverty  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column12" />Column number: 12</div>lobby to take the Government to judicial review with a view to requiring
an increase in expenditure in that
area.</div><a name="09102059000095"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Timms:</b></i> What that means is that the Government need to
plan over the next 10 years not to be in a position where they would
meet a judicial
review.</div><a name="09102059000096"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
30</b><b class="B"><a name="09102059000318"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> In the way that the Government have not planned in
the past 10
years?</div><a name="09102059000097"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Timms:</b></i> As I have said, the arrangements that the Bill
will put in place are significantly more demanding than those that have
been in place over the past 10
years.</div><a name="09102059000098"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
31</b><b class="B"><a name="09102059000319"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> May I return to the issue of the irresistible force
and the immovable object? In addition to clause 15, the Government also
intend to introduce a fiscal responsibility Bill making it legally
binding to reduce the deficit. Who knows, maybe you and I will debate
that issue sooner rather than later, Minister. If reducing the deficit
is going to be legally binding and enforceable in the courts, there
could be two legally binding obligations, one of which is under the
Child Poverty Bill, as you have described it, requiring a considerable
increase in public spending, and the other requiring a significant
reduction in public spending. How would those two judiciable legal
requirements
work?</div><a name="09102059000099"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Timms:</b></i> The Bill requires a strategy for delivering
the child poverty targets that is consistent with the
Government&#146;s fiscal strategy. Both those goals need to be
delivered, and the Bill requires one of them to be
delivered.</div><a name="09102059000100"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
32</b><b class="B"><a name="09102059000320"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> But as you have said, it is possible for the court
to state, &#147;The strategy is not working and, regardless of the
fiscal strategy, the target is non-negotiable and is not qualified.
This is what you need to do to meet the target: spend more
money.&#148; At the same time, however, there could be another Bill
in relation to which someone could take the Government to judicial
review, and the court could state, &#147;Don&#146;t spend more
money.&#148;</div><a name="09102059000101"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Timms:</b></i> What you are rightly underlining is the nature
of the targets set by the Bill, the fact that they are to be taken very
seriously by the Government over the next 10 years and that there needs
to be a convincing strategy to deliver them. I do not think that any
Government would want the sort of train crash that you describe to
occur in 10 years&#146; time. It therefore requires action planning
now to ensure that that crash does not
occur.</div>
<a name="09102059000102"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
33</b><b class="B"><a name="09102059000321"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> But again, if we look at 2010&#151;I am not sure
I would necessarily describe it as a train crash&#151;the Government
are not meeting their objectives. They could do so by increasing
expenditure on child tax credits. As you, Minister, rightly said, you
are constrained by the state of the public finances. Notwithstanding
your best efforts, and those of the Government over the last 10 years,
we are where we are. If we are in a similar position in 2019 as we are
now, what happens when the court has two Bills it is trying to enforce,
one requiring additional expenditure and another potentially requiring
less?</div>
<a name="09102059000103"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Timms:</b></i> One of the central benefits of the Bill is
that in 2018-19, we will be in a different position relative to the
2020 target than we are now. We would have had the Bill in place, and
its obligations would have been addressed throughout the
decade.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column13" />Column number: 13</div><a name="09102059000104"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
34</b><b class="B"><a name="09102059000322"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I have one final question. Is it not the case,
regardless of whatever clause 15 states, that the duty under clause 1
would be subject to a later Bill that would impose a duty of fiscal
responsibility on the Government&#151;that a subsequent Bill would
trump an earlier
one?</div><a name="09102059000105"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Timms:</b></i> No. I do not think so. As I have said, the
Bill as it stands will require a strategy to deliver the targets in
clause 1, which is consistent with the wider fiscal framework. I do not
think that that would be affected by the later
legislation.</div><a name="09102059000106"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
35</b><b class="B"><a name="09102059000323"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> Is there an intention for there to be a carve-out
from the fiscal responsibility Bill for the obligations under the Child
Poverty
Bill?</div><a name="09102059000107"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Timms:</b></i>
No.</div><a name="09102059000108"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
36</b><b class="B"><a name="09102059000324"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> I think the last question goes to the heart of the
matter. Minister, do you accept that it is the Government&#146;s job
to mediate between different interests and priorities of any
time?</div>
<a name="09102059000109"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Timms:</b></i> We are all doing that the whole time,
yes.</div><a name="09102059000110"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
37</b><b class="B"><a name="09102059000325"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> Yet, you are taking some priorities and setting
them in a statutory framework. Let us take at face value your
undertakings today that a difference will be made. It will be different
from when the Government promised solemnly in Parliament that they were
going to halve child poverty by 2010, which they have not, and somehow
putting it in legislation would not change that. But let us assume that
that is true. Going forward with ever-changing priorities and
obligations, you are setting up an immovable need to tackle child
poverty. Is that not fundamentally wrong if you have not gone through a
set of priorities and are able to show how you will not end up with
savage cuts to, for instance, support for the
elderly?</div><a name="09102059000111"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Timms:</b></i> That depends on the degree of priority one
assigns to the goal of eradicating child poverty. The Bill received an
unopposed Second Reading in the House of Commons, which I interpreted
as meaning that across the House, Members assign a high priority to
eradicating child poverty. I think that they are right to do that, and
I am pleased that there is such a degree of consensus that the area is
one to which a high priority should be
assigned.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
38</b><b class="B"><a name="09102059000326"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> I put to you the reasons for introducing the
legislation. I know there is a genuine desire in the Government and
across Parliament to eradicate child poverty; whether the Bill does it
is a different matter. There are also two other, less creditable,
drivers. The first is that by bringing the legislation forward, the
Government create a smokescreen for their failure to deliver on their
2010 target, which was a solemn and supposedly binding one. The second
is an attempt, as almost everything seems to be under this Government,
to create dividing lines with the Opposition, who do not wish to be put
into a position&#151;I can say as a Back Bencher&#151;where they
appear to be less interested in eradicating child poverty than the
Government.</div><a name="09102059000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">At
its heart, the legislation is fundamentally flawed for precisely the
reasons that my Front-Bench colleague Mr. Gauke has just
laid out. It is grossly unfair to create an expectation among those
concerned with child poverty that it will be eradicated when it will
not. It is also 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column14" />Column number: 14</div>grossly unfair on other interests, be it the elderly, the disabled or
any other vulnerable group, who will be disadvantaged if the Bill has
the force that you are claiming for it.</div>
<a name="09102059000114"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Timms:</b></i> If the aim of the Bill was to create a
dividing line in the way that you have described, it was a signal
failure because everyone supported it. I am glad that everybody
supported it, because I welcome the fact that&#151;in contrast with
the position between 1979 and 1997, when child poverty in the UK more
than doubled to the highest rate in Europe&#151;there is today a
consensus to address the problem and achieve the targets set out for
2020.</div>
<a name="09102059000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
question of 2010 and 2005, I always felt that the 2005
target&#151;perhaps I should say the 2005 milestone, rather than
target&#151;was only missed by a whisker, though it subsequently
appeared missed. The target, the overriding goal, has always been for
what would be achieved by 2020. That was what Tony Blair set out in
1999. Subsequently, we said that this is how we hoped to progress
towards that target, but the big prize has always been what we could
achieve by 2020.</div>
<a name="09102059000116"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
39</b><b class="B"><a name="09102059000327"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> May I push you, though, on the other groups,
because circumstances change. There could be a massive deterioration in
the British economy, we could find ourselves in another war&#151;who
knows what might happen. The truth is that because of this legislation
the interest of child poverty eradication will be put ahead of
priorities that have not managed&#151;for political purposes which I
certainly ascribe to the Government in bringing this forward&#151;to
get themselves the same legislative support. That means that any
Government will find themselves failing to make the proper
balance&#151;their fundamental duty&#151;between different
interests, because they will be guided by this legislation to favour
child poverty eradication against the interests of any other vulnerable
group.</div>
<a name="09102059000117"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Timms:</b></i> I understand that argument. That is a view
that could have been expressed on Second Reading. As it happened,
nobody opposed the Bill on Second Reading, and I welcome very much the
cross-party commitment in the House to tackling the problem of child
poverty as a very high priority.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
40</b><b class="B"><a name="09102059000328"></a>Mr.
Reed:</b> It is of course unquestionably right, morally, that
the Bill should bind future Governments to the eradication of child
poverty. There can be absolutely no doubt about that whatever. With the
Minister&#146;s experience in other Departments, is it not a common
occurrence for Government objectives to be subjected to judicial
review? Green groups take on our energy policy time and again. This is
just part and parcel of ordinary government, is it
not?</div><a name="09102059000119"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Timms:</b></i> It certainly does happen from time to time in
a number of contexts, yes. It is not something that Governments seek,
but it happens.</div>

41</b><a name="09102059000329"></a><b class="B">Judy
Mallaber</b> (Amber Valley) (Lab): UK child poverty strategies
deal with very wide aspects of poverty. Some of those are not included
in the Bill, such as crime, family breakdown and disability. Why is
that?</div><a name="09102059000121"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Helen
Goodman:</b></i> You mentioned a long list: crime, disability
and family breakdown. Your question is related to our earlier
discussion about minority communities. It 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column15" />Column number: 15</div>is important, when we build those strategies, that they are robust and
measurable. However, that does not mean that they can cover every
single area of Government policy. The Bill is not a crime Bill; it is
not a disability Bill; and it is not a family law Bill. Therefore, it
does not seem to be sensible to include in the strategies every single
thing that will ever have an impact. Indeed, not all of those things
are measurable in the way that I think you would need them to
be.</div>
<a name="09102059000122"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
42</b><b class="B"><a name="09102059000330"></a>Judy
Mallaber:</b> The child poverty commission will be responsible
for advising Government on meeting the income and material deprivation
targets and on the aspects of the Bill covered in the strategy. How
broad will the commission&#146;s remit be if it feels that other
factors not mentioned in the Bill are critical to meeting those
targets? Will it have a broad remit to advise Government as it sees fit
across the
board?</div><a name="09102059000123"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Helen
Goodman:</b></i> Yes. The commission is intended to be
completely independent. The advice it gives the Government on how to
achieve the targets will be published, so it will be possible for
anybody to see what the commission is saying to the Secretary of State.
Throughout part 2 of the Bill, on local authorities, we are linking
with work on crime and disability through the local child poverty
strategies, but that is different from having them as part of the
building blocks. That does not mean that all sorts of things are not
going on in other parts of government to improve the situation in
respect of crime, disability and family
breakdown.</div><a name="09102059000124"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
43</b><b class="B"><a name="09102059000331"></a>Judy
Mallaber:</b> Because, obviously, in the Bill we are talking
about a broad range of issues in the strategy that could affect child
poverty, which is reflected in having three Departments represented
here. Will one Department have overall responsibility for making sure
that those targets are met? Alternatively, how will that responsibility
be shared across
Departments?</div><a name="09102059000125"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Timms:</b></i> It will be the Government, corporately, that
will be responsible for delivering the targets. The strategy will set
out which parts of Government will do which tasks, but the Government
as a whole are obligated under the
Bill.</div><a name="09102059000126"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
44</b><b class="B"><a name="09102059000332"></a>Judy
Mallaber:</b> This is probably an impossible question, but if
targets are missed, will there be any way of assessing how much impact
which of the various factors involved had in terms of us meeting or not
meeting the target? How will that assessment be carried out, to guide
future policy
decisions?</div><a name="09102059000127"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Timms:</b></i> That would be quite a difficult exercise; I
hope that the occasion would not
arise.</div><a name="09102059000128"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Helen
Goodman:</b></i> I do not think that the situation is quite
as mechanistic as that. We could draw up a strategy that was a Heath
Robinson machine, saying that this would produce this and that would
produce that, but because there are a large number of influences on
child poverty there will be a whole range of actions to address
it.</div><a name="09102059000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">May
I come back to your point about family breakdown and say a little more
about that? The Government are not wholly convinced that family
breakdown is a cause of poverty; on the contrary, we tend to hold the
view that poverty is a cause of family breakdown. We are concerned not
to move into a mentality that is punitive 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column16" />Column number: 16</div>or that attributes completely false causal links. For example, if we
look at the situation of lone parents, it is not in fact being a lone
parent that causes a family to be in poverty or otherwise&#151;the
most important aspect is whether the lone parent is in work or not. The
child of a lone parent in a full-time job has only a 10 per cent.
chance of living in poverty, whereas one in a workless household has a
55 per cent. chance of living in poverty. The status of the family is
not of itself a driver of
poverty.</div><a name="09102059000130"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
45</b><b class="B"><a name="09102059000333"></a>Andrew
Selous:</b> Following on immediately from that, Minister, is
it not the case that if your parents separate you are twice as likely
to grow up in poverty as a
child?</div><a name="09102059000131"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Helen
Goodman:</b></i> The data that we have show that there is a
small downward blip at the point of a family breakdown, but that over
the long term the outcomes for the children are not as you described.
Furthermore, what is considerably more harmful for children is living
in families with high levels of
conflict.</div><a name="09102059000132"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
46</b><b class="B"><a name="09102059000334"></a>Andrew
Selous:</b> Okay. Perhaps we shall look further into the data
and develop that issue later in the Bill. I am concerned that you seem
to be rowing back from what your own regulatory impact assessment on
the Bill
says:</div><a name="09102059000253"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;family
breakdown may have caused the family to fall into
poverty.&#148;</div><a name="09102059000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">That

that the outcomes for children in families that have formed and

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
47</b><b class="B"><a name="09102059000335"></a>Andrew
Selous:</b> No. My first question was on the data that I have
seen, which say that if you live in a family situation in which your
parents have separated&#151;classically known as a single or
lone-parent family&#151;you are twice as likely to be living in
poverty as a child. We will, perhaps, go back to the data and come back
to that issue. My second point was that in your answer to the hon.
Member for Amber Valley you seemed to be rowing back from what is in
the impact
assessment:</div><a name="09102059000254"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;family
breakdown may have caused the family to fall into
poverty.&#148;</div><a name="09102059000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
was delighted to see that in an official Government document. Most
people would say that it is common sense. While I wholly accept that
poverty causes families to fall apart&#151;I am absolutely with the
Minister on that&#151;I think that it is a two-way relationship. Your
impact assessment says that. I hope that you are not rowing back from
it; that was what you seemed to be implying in your answer to the
question put by the hon. Member for Amber Valley.</div>
<a name="09102059000137"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Helen
Goodman:</b></i> The difference between us is probably about
time scales, but my colleague from the DCSF has something to
add.</div>
<a name="09102059000138"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dawn
Primarolo:</b></i> I think that it is somewhere between the
two. Conflict in a family leading to break-up has a negative impact on
children; I think that that is quite clear. The question is on the
contribution of poverty to that break-up in the first place that needs
to be taken into account. The stable relationship is crucial. When 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column17" />Column number: 17</div>we look at families and the relationships in them, we see that a complex
set of factors is involved. I know that the hon. Gentleman has spent a
long time looking at that and appreciates that as well.</div>
<a name="09102059000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is not
always possible to say that there is one direct causal relationship,
but conflict and break-up can be a cause of the family moving into
poverty. There were slightly different questions being asked and
answered about the nature of the family unit, what is important in
managing the stability of relationships within that and how that could
or could not contribute to the child experiencing
poverty.</div><a name="09102059000140"></a>

I ask the Treasury Minister why he believes that it has proved so much
harder to reduce child poverty than the Government thought in 1999? I
do not think that anyone doubts the Government&#146;s commitment or
effort; they announced a plan to eradicate child poverty by 2020 in
1999. The target was to reduce it by a quarter by 2005. We had the good
times up to 2005 and will have more difficult times up to 2010. Why has
it proved harder to reduce child poverty than the Government thought?

have made very substantial headway and have learnt a lot. We have seen
very large investments in public services&#151;early years education,
child care and so on&#151;that will help us in the coming decade as
well. The question slightly implies that not much has happened, but

Selous:</b><b class="B"> </b>No, I will stop you there Minister. I
accept that, according to the Government&#146;s targets, there has
been progress; I am not disputing that. However, to reach the 2020
target the Government themselves thought that they had to reduce child
poverty by a quarter by 2005 and by half by 2010. It is generally
accepted by people who study this in great detail, outside the House
and across the country, that it has proved more difficult than the
Government thought would be the case. If we are going to do better in
the next decade, the Bill needs to focus on why we have not done as
well as the Government hoped&#151;why they set the targets for 2005
and 2010. We have had the list of achievements, which are not disputed,
but why has it proved harder than was thought in 1999?</div>
<a name="09102059000144"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Timms:</b></i> On the IFS projections we will be two thirds
of the way towards the 2010 target by the end of that financial year,
and there may be scope to get closer still. That is a substantial
achievement. The constraints that we currently see because of the
worldwide economic circumstances have impeded what we might otherwise
have achieved by the end of 2010-11, but I agree that we need to learn
from the experience of the past decade. Setting that target in 1999 was
absolutely
unprecedented&#151;</div><a name="09102059000145"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
50</b><b class="B"><a name="09102059000338"></a>Andrew
Selous:</b> May I stop you there? In the good times, up to
2005, we did not meet the first target to reduce child poverty by a
quarter. That was before the recession, in fairly benign economic
circumstances, so what went wrong then?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column18" />Column number: 18</div><a name="09102059000146"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Timms:</b></i> Actually, we got very close to meeting the
2005 milestone, and it was pretty widely expected that we would. There
was a good deal of surprise when the data came out and showed that we
had narrowly missed it. As far as I know, no other country in the world
has set about doing the job in this way, with a target to eradicate
child poverty in 20 years. I agree that we need to learn lessons from
what has gone well. The Bill is part of that, ensuring that we have a
more demanding set of arrangements in place over the next decade, so
that we can hit the 2020
target.</div><a name="09102059000147"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
51</b><b class="B"><a name="09102059000339"></a>Andrew
Selous:</b> You mentioned the rest of the world. Has anywhere
else legislated to reduce poverty and, if so, has that been
effective?</div><a name="09102059000148"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Timms:</b></i> I am not aware of anywhere else that has
introduced legislation. There are certainly countries where child
poverty is less common than in the UK. The Bill is pioneering
legislation, which is being followed with a good deal of interest
around the
world.</div><a name="09102059000149"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
52</b><b class="B"><a name="09102059000340"></a>Andrew
Selous:</b> Clause 8 on the UK strategies is a central part of
the Bill, and it is what Ministers will concern themselves with as soon
as the Bill becomes law. I am sure that there are already draft UK
strategies. Notwithstanding the progress that has been made, do
Ministers accept that if we are to do better over the next
decade&#151;the Financial Secretary was good enough to admit that we
do need to&#151;we need to have a greater understanding of and to
tackle the causes of child poverty in families? Is that a fair
understanding of Government thinking on that
point?</div><a name="09102059000150"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Timms:</b></i> My colleagues might want to comment on that. I
think that on the whole we do understand the causes. We need to
continue to encourage parents into work, look at the barriers that
people in some circumstances still face and see what we can do to
overcome them. Looking back on the decisions that have been made over
the past decade in respect of our investment in public
services&#151;education, early-years child care and so on&#151;they
seem to have been the right ones, in terms of us benefiting from them
in the coming
decade.</div><a name="09102059000151"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Helen
Goodman:</b></i> May I add something? I think that your
earlier questions were predicated on the assumption that there is only
one driver of poverty&#151;namely, financial support for families
with children. That is why you concentrated so much on the
Bill&#146;s relationship to the forecast for the public finances.
However, as I am sure you know, clause 8 includes improving parental
skills and employment opportunities, promoting children&#146;s health
and education outcomes, and improving the quality of housing and local
area facilities and services. Those are all areas in which we have
secured and can continue to secure improvements, and some of those
improvements can and have been achieved without further public
spending.</div><a name="09102059000152"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
53</b><b class="B"><a name="09102059000341"></a>Andrew
Selous:</b> I accept that. My earlier questioning did not
imply that I was focusing uniquely on the family. Education and
worklessness have been mentioned, and we have touched on the family. I
want to ask about addiction, debt and the benefit traps that mean that
many people up and down the country make a rational calculation to stay
on a very small amount of benefit that they view as safe and secure.
The Financial Secretary to the Treasury may remember that those issues
were raised by Jobcentre Plus staff at the child poverty 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column19" />Column number: 19</div>conference that he and I attended in Manchester a couple of weeks ago.
The issue is important, because if people are going to progress there
needs to be common ground on what is holding them back and on the
causes that are keeping people in child poverty.</div>
<a name="09102059000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">Addiction has
not been mentioned, and I put it to the Ministers that when there is
serious drug addiction in a family, no matter how much you increase the
tax credit, it will probably not do a lot for the children. Debt and
its potential impact have not been mentioned either. There are severe
and specific issues aside from low income. A number of the causes
universally recognised by the centre-right and centre-left of British
politics are not in clause 8, and they need to be addressed if we are
going to do better over the next decade. I have not heard a list, but I
have a list of six: educational underachievement, worklessness,
addiction, debt, family separation and benefit traps. We have heard
about a couple of causes from the Ministers, but I want more on this
issue.</div><a name="09102059000154"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dawn
Primarolo:</b></i> You are absolutely right in noting how
drug addiction and alcohol misuse in families act as a barrier to the
parent getting work. The National Treatment Agency for Substance Misuse
is working with local partnerships and Jobcentre Plus on employment; I
would be happy to send the hon. Gentleman a note on that. They are
looking at how movement into employment&#151;I am sure that we all
agree that employment is the best route out of poverty&#151;is
prevented or does not occur because of addiction. It is important that
we focus the provision of services, both through Jobcentre Plus and the
local partnerships, on families with children&#151;though not
exclusively on such families&#151;and address the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s
point.</div><a name="09102059000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
issue rests with the Department of Health but, because of the impact on
children in families, it also comes under my brief, to ensure intensive
support. That goes back to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s earlier point
about whether relationships are stable within the family and the
consequences of that for children. Work is being undertaken and I see
it as part of the employment, education and skills remit to look at
drugs and alcohol, which is another area where there can be neglect,
and an inability for the child to benefit from Sure Start and outreach.
Specific strategies are being developed in relation to substance misuse
and alcohol, which echoes another point that the hon. Gentleman made
earlier. The stubbornness of some of the causes of poverty in
particular families and the necessary strategies needed are clearer
now.</div><a name="09102059000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
first five years in education are more important than the next 45
years. The investment in the early years, and the fact that that is now
beginning to show progress through this year&#146;s early years
foundation stage results, show how important it is to work at that
early stage. Education has a role to play in future skills and
employability. The strategies on narrowing the gap and raising
attainment in both primary and secondary schools have a crucial role to
play in contributing to the overall strategy. They are being taken
forward and are clear successes in what are still the relatively early
stages. The hon. Gentleman will know that it takes quite a long time to
see the effects.</div>
<a name="09102059000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, I
share the hon. Gentleman&#146;s interests and concerns about the
family. It is important that we understand the causes and how to
support stable and positive relationships and parenting because of the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column20" />Column number: 20</div>clear benefits to the child. In my view as a Minister, to put the child
at the centre is to ask what are the supporting requirements to ensure
that that child can flourish. I will be happy to send a copy to all
Members of the
Committee.</div><a name="09102059000158"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Helen
Goodman:</b></i> May I say something about benefit traps and
debt? I do not know whether members of the Committee are aware that
last week we published the tax-benefit models tables. They show
progress over a long period of time. Obviously, the concern with the
benefit trap is to do with cases where withdrawal rates of benefits are
extremely steep as people&#146;s paid income goes up. The number of
people with a marginal deduction rate of over 90 per cent. has fallen
in the past 12 years from 130,000 to 60,000. The number of people with
a marginal deduction rate of 70 per cent. has fallen similarly from
740,000 to 300,000. We can see in both those cases, looking across the
board, that there are now about half the number of people in benefit
traps that there were when the Government came to power. That is in
large measure because of the significant reforms we have made to the
tax and benefit system.</div>
<a name="09102059000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have also
latterly done a number of things to address particular concerns about
the uncertainty that people face when they move into work. They have a
lot of anxiety about whether they will be better off. When people go to
the jobcentre nowadays they get a better-off calculation done for them
to enable them to understand that they will be better off. We have also
introduced run-ons on tax credits and housing benefit. We have
increased the earnings disregards. There has been a range of such
reforms. Each in itself might not seem significant, but taken together,
they have produced that halving of the number of people in the
so-called benefit traps.</div>
<a name="09102059000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman also talked about debt. I am sure that he is aware of the
consumer White Paper that was published in the summer. One of its
proposals is to prevent unsolicited approaches by credit card
companies. That is precisely the sort of thing that can drive people
into a spiral of unsustainable debt. Again, we are taking action on
that. There are obviously serious issues with regard to people on very
low incomes. We have had a whole programme of activity over several
years in conjunction with the banks and credit unions to strengthen the
credit union movement. The Government established the growth fund,
which has nearly &#163;100 million in it, to which the Chancellor
added a further &#163;80 million in this year&#146;s Budget. It
means that 180,000 people have received loans on reasonable terms, who
would not otherwise have been able to do so. I am talking about people
probably outside the banking system and whose credit ratings are
extremely low. We have the safety net of the social fund and, this
year, have put an additional &#163;263 million into it. We
are extremely alert to the problems of debt and have been very active
on that
front.</div><a name="09102059000161"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102059000342"></a>The
Chairman:</b> We will come back to clause 8 in a moment, but
the most recent exchanges have stimulated three members of the
Committee to ask further
questions.</div><a name="09102059000162"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
54</b><b class="B"><a name="09102059000343"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I shall speak very quickly about your first point,
Minister, after which I shall ask my further question. You mentioned
marginal deduction rates of above 90 per cent. and 70 per cent. Do you
know the numbers for a rate of above 60 per cent.?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column21" />Column number: 21</div><a name="09102059000163"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Helen
Goodman:</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B"> </b></i>I do not have them on me at
the
moment.</div><a name="09102059000164"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
55</b><b class="B"><a name="09102059000344"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> Until 2007, the Department for Work and Pensions
published an annual &#147;Opportunity for all&#148; report that
listed a range of indicators of progress or otherwise in dealing with
factors such as living in a jobless household, teenage pregnancy, low
educational attainment and erratic school attendance, school leavers
not in education, employment or training, living in substandard housing
or temporary accommodation, infant mortality rates, teenage smoking and
obesity. Those are all similar to what we were talking about when we
discussed causation, and to the points made by my hon. Friend the
Member for South-West Bedfordshire. Why did the DWP stop publishing
those reports? Why not include some of them under the Bill as points to
be picked up as part of the strategy?</div>
<a name="09102059000165"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Helen
Goodman:</b></i> With that question, the hon. Gentleman has
tested the absolute limits of my knowledge of the history of my
Department. I do not know the answer, but I will find out. However, the
fact that the reports are not being published in one document does not
mean that the information is not available. I will find out where it is
available.</div><a name="09102059000166"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
56</b><b class="B"><a name="09102059000345"></a>Mr.
Reed:</b> If we were to look at the map of child poverty in
the United Kingdom, we would see direct correlations between areas that
suffered aggressive de-industrialisation during the 1980s and 1990s and
pockets of severe child poverty&#151;the most severe child poverty
that we see today. There would be a lot of surprises, particularly with
regard to rural
areas.</div><a name="09102059000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall move on from one of the important points made by the hon. Member
for South-West Bedfordshire about the barriers that are in the way. It
is hard to address, from a technocratic point of view, some of the real
cultural problems, not only with people who are in the benefits trap
and in long-term unemployment, but with the significant numbers of
people who, by contrast, do not come forward to claim what they are
entitled to claim, and who, for whatever reason, will not enter the
system and are falling outside the scope of the programmes that we are
introducing. We do not seem to be addressing that real cultural issue
when it comes to beating child poverty. How will we address
it?</div>
<a name="09102059000168"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Helen
Goodman:</b></i> You are asking about two different things. I
shall talk first about the regional dimension and then about the
take-up problem. What you say about there being different needs in
different regions is absolutely right. That is why we see local
authorities as key partners in achieving the eradication of child
poverty. We want local authorities to incorporate their child poverty
objectives with their sustainable communities planning so that we
achieve an approach that is sensitive to the different needs of
different areas. Although we have not set out particular measures under
the Bill, we are establishing a process that will enable us to identify
the problems that you
mentioned.</div><a name="09102059000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">Not
all benefits have high take-up rates, although child tax credits have a
particularly high take-up rate of between 80 and 90 per cent. That is
way above the 30 per cent. of the family income supplement,
which was the precursor to child tax credits way back when, and part of
the benefit system. The Department for Work and Pensions constantly has
take-up campaigns to encourage people to avail themselves of their
entitlements. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column22" />Column number: 22</div>I would say that the cultural difficulties with take-up are probably
greater among older members of the community than among parents with
young children. We had a report done recently by Sir Trevor Chinn,
which looked at how further to improve our work on take-up.</div>
<a name="09102059000170"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Timms:</b></i> May I add a couple of points? Helen has raised
the cultural issue, which is important. We have made some progress on
that. At the beginning of 2008, we had 29.4 million people in
work&#151;more people in employment in the UK than we have ever had
before. When I was Minister with responsibility for work, the best part
of the job was meeting people who had gone into work after long periods
out of work, perhaps because of a health problem. Returning to work
after 10 or 18 years, they said how their lives had been transformed as
a result. We have made some headway in dealing with the cultural
problems, but I agree that there is more to be
done.</div><a name="09102059000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is interesting that in the area that I represent in east London, the
mayor of Newham has introduced an employment pilot. The idea is that
the local authority works intensively with the small number of people
who take part. The deal is that we guarantee that if you go into a job
you will be better off. If we need to, we will give you extra money to
make absolutely sure that you will be better off as a result of having
gone into
work.</div><a name="09102059000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">Something
like 100 families have been part of the pilot. It is interesting
because it has not been necessary for the council to give extra money
to anyone so far. Mr. Selous made the point about the
perception. That is not to say that there is no one at all who is not
better off for going into work; there are people in some circumstances
who are not. The incidence of that problem is much less than is widely
thought and one of the things that we have to do is to explain to
people and show them what the benefits of being in a job
are.</div>
<a name="09102059000173"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
57</b><b class="B"><a name="09102059000346"></a>Ms
Buck:</b> That leads into what I was going to say, although I
hate to disagree with a colleague. Important though the impact of
de-industrialisation on employment was in many parts of the country,
the Minister knows that the highest concentration of poverty is in
London, despite the fact that overall, and notwithstanding the present
situation, it is one of the healthiest labour markets in Europe. That
tells us something important. It tells us that there is an issue about
better-off calculations and marginal rates of deduction. It is good to
hear from the Minister that a proportion of that has fallen
significantly, but I think it is still very much in
place.</div><a name="09102059000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
bigger picture, and something that has been entirely missing from what
we have talked about this morning, concerns the role of employers and
the world outside the state in meeting the poverty target. Is it not
true that half of all children in poverty are living in families where
at least one person is in work? Is it not the case that one of the most
important ways we can achieve the poverty target is to deal with the
problem of low pay? Some of that is to do with work incentives and
tapers and so forth, but a lot of it is to do with challenging
employers on the issue of low pay. We have a dilemma. Tax credits are
important and valuable, but in a way they subsidise bad employment
practice and low pay. Should that not be at the heart of what the
Government are trying to achieve?</div>
<a name="09102059000175"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Timms:</b></i> I very much agree with the point that you made
about employers having an important role. One of the strengths of the
London Child Poverty Commission 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column23" />Column number: 23</div>work that you were involved in, and the follow-up to that, has been a
recognition of the importance of engaging employers and everyone
working together to tackle the problem. It is certainly right that if
we can find ways to increase people&#146;s incomes in work, that will
make a significant contribution to what we need to do. Going to
employers directly about that, and the sort of living wage campaign
that we have seen in London, can make a helpful contribution. Equally,
we need to be able to work with people to help them progress once they
are in work. That is one of the substantial benefits of the big
investment that we are making in skills training at the
moment&#151;the Train to Gain programme. That will enable people who
are in work to develop their skills and, over time, to increase their
incomes. Your point about employers is important. As you will know, the
other thing that came out strikingly from the work in London was the
difficulty parents there had in finding part-time work. If we can
encourage employers to provide that kind of opportunity it will help a
lot,
too.</div><a name="09102059000176"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Helen
Goodman:</b></i> To add to those points, 1.5 million children
are living in families where there is somebody in work. Of those, 25
per cent. are families where one parent is working full time and 21 per
cent. are those where one or both parents are working part time only.
One of the conclusions we draw from this is that we need to concentrate
more on what we call second-earner activity in families and attaching
those people more strongly to the labour market. We have programmes in
the jobcentres now for addressing specifically the needs of those
workers, as well as encouraging the one parent in a family who is
working to move on from part-time work to full-time work.</div>
<a name="09102059000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">The minimum
income guarantee, which people now have when they are in work, has
increased in real terms by 30 per cent. over the last 10 years. That is
very significant. As well as what Stephen has just said about
encouraging employers to offer more part-time work, we have put new
legal obligations on employers to offer more flexitime. Obviously that
will enable more families to balance better their work and their family
life and thereby encourage people to take jobs who might otherwise have
felt that the barriers and the practicalities were simply too
difficult.</div><a name="09102059000178"></a>

Barrett</b> (Edinburgh, West) (LD): I should like to return to
clause 8 and getting the strategy right. I listened to what the
Minister said about the preparation, and witnesses have expanded on the
work that has gone into that. Clause 8 details the review of the
strategy, making progress and so on. One thing it does not have is a
duty to implement the strategy like that in the Disability
Discrimination Act 1995. Does that give you a get-out clause, because
it is just not there, or will you simply be left with a strategy that
does not have to be
implemented?</div><a name="09102059000179"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Timms:</b></i> I do not think there is a get-out clause here,
although I understand the question. In the DDA the obligation was to
compile an access strategy which would be a one-off exercise that would
then need to be implemented. The difference here is that the strategy
will evolve and be updated every three years. Some elements of the
first strategy that is published may well not get implemented because
three years on it is clear that a different approach needs to be taken
and some things need to be done more and other things less. That 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column24" />Column number: 24</div>is the big difference between those two pieces of legislation, which
helps to explain the difference of approach here. The key is that the
target, as we were saying earlier, is binding. So there is the
strongest possible incentive for the Government and their partners to
deliver a strategy that over time achieves the
targets.</div><a name="09102059000180"></a>

up on is about bedrooms for children over the age of 10. I do not know
how many people on the Committee know that the bedroom standards and
the legal definitions of overcrowding are different&#151;I could
describe that point in great detail, but I will not detain the
Committee for too
long.</div><a name="09102059000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
knew that the Committee was concerned about this issue, so I checked
out the statistics on it this morning. I can tell the Committee that
the criterion used in the child material deprivation standard is
tougher than that for the legal bedroom standard. Therefore, the number
of people who do not meet the material deprivation standard in this
country comprises 16 per cent. of children, whereas under the statutory
definition, the number of households that are overcrowded is only
2.7 per cent. Although the Bill does not include more about
overcrowding and the statutory definition of housing, having checked
the material deprivation standard, I think that it will turn out to be
a tougher standard than would otherwise have been
produced.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
61</b><b class="B"><a name="09102059000350"></a>Ms
Keeble:</b> That is helpful and it would be useful to have a
note on that. If that standard has to be achieved through the Bill, why
are housing authorities in two-tier local government areas not included
as partner authorities under clause 18(b)? They are specifically
excluded. My housing authority in Northampton, which I must say does
appalling things to families with children, is specifically excluded as
a partner authority.</div>
<a name="09102059000186"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Helen
Goodman:</b></i> That is probably because the housing
associations are independent of
Government.</div>
<a name="09102059000187"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
62</b><b class="B"><a name="09102059000351"></a>Ms
Keeble:</b> No, not housing associations. Sorry&#151;it is
housing authorities and district councils in areas where there is
two-tier local government. District councils as housing authorities are
specifically excluded. Under 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column25" />Column number: 25</div>Every Child Matters, the Department for Children, Schools and Families
has excluded housing authorities from responsibility. There is a clause
that specifically excludes housing authorities; they are not
responsible authorities, they are partner authorities, yet it is those
authorities that have to deliver on this overcrowding standard. I
welcome any improvement to the overcrowding standard; I think it is
wonderful, but it must be delivered.</div>
<a name="09102059000188"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Helen
Goodman:</b></i> But the partner authorities have a duty to
co-operate with local authorities so that responsibility for chairing
meetings and drafting the strategy lies with the responsible local
authorities mentioned in clause 18. However, all the partner
authorities set out in clause 19, which includes those district
authorities, are required to co-operate in the needs assessment, the
strategy and in carrying it out.</div>
<a name="09102059000189"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
63</b><b class="B"><a name="09102059000352"></a>Ms
Keeble:</b> May I come back to that issue? In fact, when I was
a housing Minister, Karen Buck and I had long and turbulent discussions
about mechanisms for dealing with homelessness, and the arrangements
that were made between children&#146;s services and housing services.
The net result&#151;because of legal difficulties that they are
supposed to have protocols, which looked very much like what you have
here&#151;was that it does not work; it spectacularly does not work.
Unless an authority has a clearly specified responsibility to do
something, it will not do it. The authorities do not talk to each
other. I have had endless problems with the county council and the
borough council when we have talked to each other. For example, last
weekend, we had a special needs couple with two children in a
one-bedroom flat in disrepair, and the two authorities did not talk to
each other about it. Would you look at moving housing authorities up to
being responsible
authorities?</div><a name="09102059000190"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Helen
Goodman:</b></i> Obviously, overcrowding and poor-quality
housing have a huge negative impact on some families, and I am sure
everyone understands that. What we need to think about as we move
forward is the extent to which a change in the legal definition is the
most effective way of tackling the issue. My understanding is that if
we were to go down that path, it would take about 15 months to
implement such change&#151;I am not ruling it out, but it would
certainly take 15 months to implement it, and then we might need to
consult on that, and that could add more time. Should we not
concentrate on putting more resources into tackling overcrowding and
into running more pilots and experiments for dealing with the issue on
the ground? I would suggest that that would bring an earlier
improvement than the change to the legal
definitions.</div><a name="09102059000191"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
64</b><b class="B"><a name="09102059000353"></a>Ms
Keeble:</b> I have one more question about two partner
authorities that are not included. The first is development
corporations, which are now responsible in some areas for procurement
and allocation of land for housing, including social and affordable
housing, which is a big issue. The second is race equality councils,
given the big correlation between certain ethnic minority groups and
poverty. I wonder whether thought has been given to how those two
factors are delivered on.</div>
<a name="09102059000192"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Helen
Goodman:</b></i> Regional development agencies have not been
included as partner authorities because the focus is on a more local
level.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column26" />Column number: 26</div><a name="09102059000193"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09102059000354"></a>Ms
Keeble:</b> I mean development corporations, not RDAs. It is
the ones that were set up to do all the planning and delivery. They
have the planning powers and all the rest of it
now.</div><a name="09102059000194"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Helen
Goodman:</b></i> If you look at clause 20(1)(c), you can see
that we can co-operate
with</div><a name="09102059000255"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;such
other persons or bodies as the authority thinks
fit.&#148;</div><a name="09102059000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
could include race equality councils, development companies, people
from the voluntary sector and whoever would be appropriate. That will
vary from place to
place.</div><a name="09102059000196"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
65</b><a name="09102059000355"></a><b class="B">John
Howell</b> (Henley) (Con): I want to continue with the local
authority theme and the duties imposed by the Bill on local
authorities. The Minister will no doubt be aware of the cynicism over
the indicator NI 116, which is widely seen as delivering
merely a paper output. Many authorities have already chosen to unpack
that and go for a range of more specific indicators that produce
outcomes that are much more reflective of their own local
circumstances. To what extent will the Government ensure that local
authorities have the necessary flexibility and freedom to be able to
match the Bill to their own
circumstances?</div><a name="09102059000197"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Helen
Goodman:</b></i> I am afraid that I do not share
Mr. Howell&#146;s cynicism. Even before we introduced the
Bill, some 45 local authorities had already chosen the indicator NI 116
as one of the 30 that they were going to prioritise and work towards.
Out of the 33 London local authorities, 14 are signed up to the child
poverty pledge. We have pilots in a number of local authorities. In a
later sitting, we will hear from people who have been working in three
of the beacon councils on child poverty strategies, so I really do not
think that local authorities are negative in the way that you
suggest.</div>
<a name="09102059000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that
you were asking whether we were constraining local authorities. I do
not think that that is right. We will issue guidance, but the reason
for doing so is to reduce the burden on them so that they do not have
to reinvent the wheel and think everything out from scratch all over
again, which would be costly. We are supporting them with some small
financial resources and by putting skills in through the Government
offices and&#151;I do not know how much you know about
this&#151;through their own self-management organisation, the Centre
for Excellence in Outcomes, or C4EO. We are also providing them with a
data tool for measuring, so I think that we give them a supportive
environment and approach that will help them to progress with this
work.</div><a name="09102059000199"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
66</b><b class="B"><a name="09102059000356"></a>John
Howell:</b> The cynicism, Minister, is coming from the local
authorities themselves. The numbers you cite are small in the great
scheme of things, because they have opted for measurements of child
poverty alleviation that are much more reflective of their own local
needs. If you look at the local needs assessment regulations&#151;the
draft regulations that accompany the Bill&#151;I have to ask why you
have chosen to impose quite a rigid standardised view and have, again,
not left the flexibility to local councils and local partnerships to
pursue things that are much more targeted to what they know in their
own
area.</div><a name="09102059000200"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Helen
Goodman:</b></i> We want to give local authorities the
flexibility to implement measures in ways that are sensitive to local
needs. Obviously those vary, and obviously 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column27" />Column number: 27</div>that is a proper role for local government, but at the same time we need
to be sure that we expect the same standards so that we give children
across the country the same opportunities, irrespective of whether they
live in Durham or Buckinghamshire.</div>
<a name="09102059000201"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
67</b><b class="B"><a name="09102059000357"></a>John
Howell:</b> One of the areas in which that is, perhaps, most
significant is the thrust&#151;both from the Bill and from the
regulations&#151;that leads councils to tackle that on a geographical
basis, rather than family by family. Many councils opted out of looking
at that on a geographical basis&#151;opted out of saying, &#147;We
are going to have a programme that is there for a complete
area&#148;&#151;because that is particularly wasteful and
untargeted. They have found that using a family-by-family basis, and
approaching that through the education system&#151;which knows where
families in poverty really are&#151;is a much more effective
approach. My reading of both the Bill and the draft regulations
suggests that you are actually pushing councils away from that sort of
approach.</div><a name="09102059000202"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Helen
Goodman:</b></i> No, I really do not think that that is
right. Just pause and think for a moment about who the partners are
going to be. We want to encourage local authorities to work with the
voluntary sector. We want the children&#146;s trusts to be very much
involved in that work, and they work on a family-by-family
basis.</div>
<a name="09102059000203"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
68</b><b class="B"><a name="09102059000358"></a>John
Howell:</b> Lastly, what does the Bill do to bring together
the voluntary sector and other partner organisations to deliver
effectively and ensure that the innovation and energy is
captured?</div><a name="09102059000204"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Helen
Goodman:</b></i> The local authorities are able to involve,
as a fully-fledged partner authority, any voluntary sector organisation
where those in that organisation agree that that would be appropriate.
We did not think that it would be right to put the same duties that are
on the statutory bodies on to the voluntary sector, because of course
the whole point about the NGOs is that they want to maintain their
independence. We do not want them to be driven solely by the agenda of
the Government, and they do not want that either.</div>
<a name="09102059000205"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Timms:</b></i> It is worth adding that the intention is to
provide guidance about local authorities and third sector organisations
working
together.</div><a name="09102059000206"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
69</b><b class="B"><a name="09102059000359"></a>Mr.
Reed:</b> Aside from the abilities of front-line professionals
working in this field for local authorities throughout the country, we
have some dreadful local authorities up and down this
country&#151;some absolutely rotten organisations. We all know that.
Recent cases of child abuse and child murder have in many ways proven
this. What confidence do you have that every local authority can
deliver what is being asked of it by the
Bill?</div><a name="09102059000207"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Helen
Goodman:</b></i> The whole purpose of giving every local
authority the duties in the Bill is precisely to tackle that serious
problem you
raise.</div><a name="09102059000208"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
70</b><b class="B"><a name="09102059000360"></a>Mr.
Reed:</b> I certainly hope that, in addition to the
flexibilities that local authorities require to meet the specific needs
in their localities, there will be some significant and
effective&#151;I almost hesitate to use this term&#151;central
control over those measurements and targets. Would that be
right?</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column28" />Column number: 28</div><a name="09102059000209"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Helen
Goodman:</b></i> Regarding the measurements and targets
themselves, yes, but with respect to the ways of working, no. We want
to leave space for innovation and flexibility at the local
level.</div><a name="09102059000210"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
71</b><b class="B"><a name="09102059000361"></a>Mr.
Reed:</b> In the same way that we have discussed the potential
for judicial review of existing or future Governments&#146; ability
to meet the Bill&#146;s requirements, what do you envisage as the
power of central Government to take effective and immediate intervening
steps to ensure that local authorities are doing what is required of
them?</div><a name="09102059000211"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Helen
Goodman:</b></i> We will review the situation when we collect
the information, which we are going to do on a three-yearly basis, from
the local authorities. That will be the moment at which it will be
possible for central Government to review how things are working in
practice.</div><a name="09102059000212"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
72</b><b class="B"><a name="09102059000362"></a>Mr.
Reed:</b> Finally, on a slightly different tack, how are the
needs of children living in local authority care met under the Bill?
How will local authorities meet the requirements of those children?
What measurement processes will be in place to make sure that local
authorities meet the needs of the children whom they have in
looked-after
care?</div><a name="09102059000213"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Helen
Goodman:</b></i> This relates to the earlier discussion about
asylum-seeker, Gypsy and Traveller children. Most children in local
authority care are living fostered in families&#151;I think 70 per
cent.&#151;so they would be covered in households in the normal way.
The other 30 per cent., as I said, are looked after under the
obligation and statutory framework run by the children&#146;s trusts.
As I also said, we have got a whole set of objectives and measurements
to improve the quality of life and outcomes for that particularly
vulnerable group of
children.</div><a name="09102059000214"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
73</b><b class="B"><a name="09102059000364"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> The child poverty commission is overseeing a Bill
that the regulatory impact assessment says will cost about &#163;400
billion over 20 years. Its budget, according to that assessment, is
&#163;190,000. It will meet four times a year and appears to have no
research budget. Does it have any real teeth? Does it have the
resources to do the
job?</div><a name="09102059000216"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Mr.
Timms:</b></i> It is very important that it does. Our view of
the commission is that it should have a key role in identifying
barriers to hitting the targets, for example, and in advising the
Government on what each of the revisions of the strategy should
contain. If you look at organisations such as the Social Security
Advisory Committee or the Low Pay Commission, they are organisations
that one might say have fairly modest budgets in comparison with the
overall spend in the area in which they are advising but, as
Mr. Webb knows, they are very influential and effective
organisations.</div><a name="09102059000217"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
74</b><b class="B"><a name="09102059000365"></a>Steve

it is just scavenging for what is lying around? If it needs research
doing, can it have the budget to get it done?
