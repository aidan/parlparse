<P>
Amendment proposed [this day]: No. 33, in page 6, line 38, at end insert `substantially similar.—[Mr. Maclennan.]
<P>
<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Question again proposed, That the amendment be made.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that with this we are taking amendment No, 34, in page 6, line 40, leave out from `person' to end of line 42.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Mr. Mike O'Brien):</B> It has been suggested that this provision will prevent members of campaign groups from seeking information from public authorities, but I do not believe that it will have that effect. Where such people ask for identical information, they will receive it, unless the cost of doing so in one case exceeded the limit, because there would be only one cost associated with finding that information. The cost of sending out the information will not fall within the calculation of the limit. Where such people ask for different information, for the purposes of the provision, they will not be acting in concert. The provision will apply only where each person seeks a subset of the same information, and the limitation cost to the authority is thereby evaded. Those circumstances will be prescribed in regulations.
<P>
Under freedom of information regulations, the amendments could inhibit public authorities from carrying out their main tasks. In particular, smaller public authorities could be prejudiced. The circumstances in which aggregation will be permitted will be set out in the regulations. Should problems arise, they will be subject to annulment by Parliament, so I ask the right hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (Mr. Maclennan) to withdraw the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robert Maclennan </B>(Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross): Before I withdraw the amendments, I should make it clear that I do not accept the reasons adduced by the Under-Secretary for my doing so, and I hope that this is a matter to which we shall return.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Greenway </B>(Ryedale): I beg to move amendment No. 102, in page 6, line 44, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`divided by a whole number, prescribed in regulations, which is greater than the total number of requests.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We have been discussing the extent of which aggregate requests for information could fall foul of a cost aggregation. Given the Under-Secretary's comments, I suspect that subsection (4) may be subject to different interpretations. We have no quibble with attempts to reduce public cost and to avoid several members of a campaign group making the same request for the same information. However, subsection (4) does not make it clear that the appropriate limit will increase where several items of information are requested. Such a circumstance need not involve a number of campaign members asking the same question. An individual who seeks redress after an accident or other incident may want to discover what relevant information is available.
<P>
We assume that the Government have in mind some form of sliding scale. Clearly, where several items of information are requested, one cannot roll up the appropriate limit according to the number of requests. In such a case, the appropriate limit should differ from that which applies to a single request. Regulations on fees and aggregation should not enable public authorities to refuse to supply the same information to, say, five or six people who share the same problem, on the ground that the appropriate limit has thereby been exceeded. Although it would be wrong for the appropriate limit to apply only in respect of each and every application, the provision of a sliding scale would be a suitable halfway house.
<P>
We toiled over the appropriate wording for the amendment. It would require the cost of complying with requests for information to be
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``divided by a whole number, prescribed in regulations, which is greater than the total number of requests.''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That would provide a sliding scale for assessing the appropriate limit. It would give comfort to those who are concerned—as, to some extent, are we—that subsection (4) will work to their disadvantage by enabling public authorities to shield themselves from providing information on the ground that the aggregation of such requests has exceeded the appropriate limit. That would not be right, but nor would it be right for the appropriate limit to apply to each and every request. There must be some aggregation.
<P>
We all want to avoid wasted cost, and the amendment is perhaps the way to deal with it. I commend it to the Under-Secretary.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I accept that the hon. Member for Ryedale (Mr. Greenway) is trying to be helpful.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stephen Day </B>(Cheadle): That is the point at which the hon. Gentleman is most dangerous.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The hon. Gentleman says from a sedentary position that that is the point at which the hon. Member for Ryedale is most dangerous, but I am sure that his attempts to help are genuine.
<P>
The hon. Member for Ryedale has suggested a sliding scale, but, if I may be self-critical for a moment, the problem is that the Bill is complex. It is supposed to be a people's Bill, and one would have liked it to be readily intelligible to the ordinary member of the public who seeks information, but we must get the balance right. Given the variety of public authorities and the various circumstances in which information might be requested, the Bill has to be complex. However, a Bill that is already complex should not be unnecessarily complicated further, and I fear that that is what the amendment would do.
<P>
The amendment would prevent a public authority from refusing to deal with a series of requests from one person, or from different people who are, or appear to be, acting in concert, if the unit cost of each request is less than the appropriate limit, which will be set in regulation. Because the amendment would require the total cost to be divided by a number that is greater than the total number of requests, the unit cost will be less than the actual cost. Without the amendment, an authority will be able to refuse to reply if the aggregate cost of doing so exceeds the limit.
<P>
The purpose of subsection (4) is to prevent an applicant or a group of applicants evading the appropriate limit by packaging requests in a series of smaller ones. The Government believe that people should have a right of access to information at a low cost, but that that right should be subject to sensible limits. We have already announced that we are minded to set the appropriate limit for authorities at £500, and to restrict the cost that can be included in that calculation to the marginal cost of locating and finding the information in question. For information to be disclosed under clause 1, we have further made it clear that the charge to applicants will not exceed 10 per cent. of those marginal costs.
<P>
Under the Government's proposals, an applicant would receive a subsidy from the taxpayer of about £450 before the cost limits came into play. We believe that it would be wrong for individuals to ask the taxpayer to provide a greater subsidy than £450 per request. That is a substantial sum and we want to ensure a proper balance. We can do that by limiting the subsidy to 10 per cent. of the marginal costs. We shall provide some subsidy, but it will not be excessive.
<P>
I was asked whether it would be wrong, in particular circumstances, to aggregate the costs of five or six people. We cannot provide for that; the regulations are intended to deal with requests that are divided into a number of separate requests as a means of defeating the cost of the application. I accept that the hon. Member for Ryedale seeks to be helpful and that his suggestion has some benefits, but such a means of dealing with requests does not command the Government's support.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> That is helpful. Perhaps I did not listen intently enough when we debated the matter on earlier amendments to clause 11—or perhaps the Under-Secretary did not explain it in such explicit terms. He now says that subsection (4) is meant to prevent people avoiding the appropriate limit by dividing up their requests into segments. I take it that the regulations will give priority to ensuring that public authorities cannot abuse the system in the other direction by falsely aggregating what are clearly stand-alone requests.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I can confirm that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> That is excellent. I could not agree with the Under-Secretary more when he says that we should protect the interests of taxpayers. Indeed, during the stand part debate on clause 8, I resisted the temptation to say that for 90 per cent. of the cost to be borne by the taxpayer was a pretty hefty subsidy—so it is. Equally, however, we support the Government's objective. If a new culture of information is to be available to people, they should not be put off by the excess cost of applying for access to information.
<P>
We have probably flogged the matter sufficiently, but it has been helpful further to clarify the fact that subsection (4) will not be used as a means of preventing people from obtaining information to which they are entitled. It is a preventive measure, ensuring that people do not avoid the appropriate limit by dividing up their requests into various segments. If that is all that is intended, we are greatly reassured. We need to protect public authorities from abuse, but we must ensure that the regulations reflect the fact that public authorities should not use subsection (4) as a means of perpetrating abuse of bona fide applicants by wrongly aggregating requests. We are happy with the Under-Secretary's reassurance that that will not be the case. As I said earlier, we look forward to seeing the draft regulations. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>

<B>Mr. Mark Fisher </B>(Stoke-on-Trent, Central): I beg to move amendment No. 40, in page 6, line 44, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(4A) A public authority which treats the costs of complying with two or more requests in the manner described in subsection (4) must at the time of doing so notify the Information Commissioner of this fact and supply to the Commissioner copies of the requests concerned.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I think that the Under-Secretary now appreciates that all parts of the Committee have some concerns about aggregation. I heard what he said in previous debates on clause 11, and I look forward to discovering the effect of some of those responses. However, by requiring an authority to notify the commission whenever it aggregates two or more requests, the amendment would put a slight check, or a potential rein, on the use of aggregation.
<P>
The amendment does not require the commissioner to approve a decision to aggregate, but drawing it to her attention will mean that she will have a record of its use. She will therefore be able to monitor it, and, if it is abused or used excessively in any direction, she will at least be able to advise the Minister about it. It is a mild restraint. I commend it to the Under-Secretary.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I understand that the amendment is supported by the Campaign for Freedom of Information. I was a little bemused, however, because I could not quite figure out what the Information Commissioner would do with the information. Much information would be sent to her, but what should she do with it?
<P>
The amendment would require authorities to inform the commissioner every time they aggregated the costs of two or more requests for the purpose of determining whether the total cost exceeded an appropriate limit under clause 11. The authorities would also have to lodge copies of the requests with the commissioner.
<P>
I presume—my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mr. Fisher) indicated that I was right—that the purpose of the amendment is to deter authorities from abusing clause 11 to avoid communicating information to applicants. If so, there are other ways of doing it. However, although the amendment requires authorities to submit papers to the commissioner, it does not require the commissioner to investigate cases of abuse—nor, indeed, to do anything. It seems merely to create a bureaucracy for the commissioner to receive that information, to hold it and to do nothing with it. My hon. Friend suggests that the commissioner may inform the Minister, but it is not clear what the Minister should do. I am not sure of the genuine purpose of the amendment.
<P>
Under clause 50, applicants may already complain to the commissioner, who has the power to decide whether authorities have acted in accordance with the provisions of part I. Applicants are therefore already protected from authorities' improper use of clause 11. The commissioner's strong powers to investigate the failure of authorities to apply the legislation already provide the necessary deterrent against abuse. There is no reason to single out clause 11 for special treatment.
<P>
Finally, it has been estimated that as many as 50,000 bodies could be brought within the scope of freedom of information legislation, given that the Bill will cover every school, optician, GP and local authority in the country. The amendment might, therefore, cause a large volume of paper to be lodged with the commissioner every time that two or more people make such an application. It would result in bureaucracy for small organisations such as doctors' practices and for the Information Commissioner. I am bemused at the Campaign for Freedom of Information, which was aware of the amendment, and about the point of the amendment, which would seem to involve expense with very little point. The principle that my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central advocates—that we should ensure that authorities do not try to abuse clause 11—is good, but clause 50 covers it much better, enabling the applicant to make a complaint to the Information Commissioner, who can then intervene. That is how to deal with the matter, rather than through the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for directing me to clause 50, which I shall examine in the light of his remarks. I hope that he is right. He is resisting the amendment on the grounds of the volume of work that would be involved. I hope that he is wrong about that and that an enormous number of applications would not be rejected because of abuse of aggregation. I suspect that he is wrong, and I hope that it would be an occasional device. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> In our consideration of the clause, reference has been made to marginal costs, to which the Under-Secretary referred. On this occasion, it is not because my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Norfolk (Dr. Turner) coughed, but I am not clear about what the Under-Secretary said. Will marginal costs be calculated by examining the time involved in locating and retrieving information, in which case the £500 limit is generous and workable, or will they include rather more than that, adding staff time to the time involved in locating and retrieving information? If he means the latter, £500 would be quickly absorbed, and the limit would be rather tight, not to say mean. However, I hope that the Under-Secretary will have encouraging news for me, and will confirm that he said what I thought that he said—that marginal costs will relate to the time involved in locating and retrieving information, in which case I congratulate him, because it is a generous limit.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I chose not to move amendment No. 16 because we debated a similar matter on an earlier clause. I wanted to clarify that point, given that we are having a clause stand part debate. I also hope that, in responding to the matters raised by the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central, the Under-Secretary will confirm that the Government intend quickly to introduce regulations under clause 11, as they have agreed to do under clause 8.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Yes, I can confirm that. The answer to the question asked by my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central is that marginal costs include the costs of staff time involved in locating the information, but do not include the costs of staff time involved in preparing the information or considering whether an exemption applies. Disbursements may be charged in addition to the 10 per cent. of the marginal costs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> I am most encouraged by that.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 11 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 12</center></H4>
<H4><center>Vexatious or repeated requests</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 104, in page 7, line 5, after `request', insert `or applicant.'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss amendment No. 103, in page 7, line 5, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(1A) It shall be lawful for a public authority to apply to the Information Tribunal for an order that an applicant who habitually and persistently requests information without any reasonable grounds for such a request is a vexatious applicant.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> The purpose of the amendment is to explore the meaning of the word ``vexatious'', which is not defined in the Bill. It is novel for the Bill to allow that a request is vexatious, when in reality it is the applicant who is vexatious rather than the request. Amendment No. 104 would insert the words ``or applicant'' to allow for the possibility that the request or the applicant may be vexatious. That would give a public authority the opportunity to refuse to comply with requests for information from vexatious applicants.
<P>
Amendment No. 103 would add a subsection allowing a public authority to apply to the information tribunal or the commissioner—it is not essential for the purposes of the debate to specify which—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``for an order that an applicant who habitually and persistently requests information without any reasonable grounds for such a request is a vexatious applicant.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That would bring into the Bill the definition of the word ``vexatious''. I understand the underlying purpose of the clause. The Government are endeavouring to give public authorities some protection from people who habitually and persistently make similar requests. Hon. Members should think of their constituency mailbags. We all have one or two constituents who write to us habitually and persistently.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien indicated assent.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am relieved to know that the Under-Secretary has some of those as well. They turn up in our surgeries from time to time. In my case, there is one who seems to turn up more often than everyone else put together, to the extent that he can become vexatious.
<P>
I shall not labour the point, because I can see from the Under-Secretary's reaction that he appreciates my argument. Perhaps the amendment does not represent precisely the best way of dealing with the matter, but I hope that the Under-Secretary will, at least, agree to think about it further. As I have said before, he is a lawyer and I am not. However, I envisage all kinds of difficulties in trying to establish that a request is vexatious without having first established that the applicant is vexatious because he habitually and continually makes repeated requests. Any sensible person would recognise that a public authority ought to have the power to say, in the interests of taxpayers and its efficient governance, ``We've had enough of you, sunshine. We don't want to have to deal with you any more.''
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath </B>(Somerton and Frome): The amendment has made possible an interesting discussion of the relevant terms. However, we must part company with the hon. Member for Ryedale. We all know that some people will behave vexatiously—possibly as a result of this legislation—and hon. Members have no doubt experienced such behaviour in their surgeries. One gentleman came to six of my surgeries. He was not attempting to act vexatiously, he just kept thinking of something else to ask me as soon as he left the room.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
An important distinction needs to be made. As the hon. Member for Ryedale explored the issue further, he described the questions rather than the applicant as vexatious. It is important that we label someone's actions as vexatious rather than the person themselves, because any request that a person who had been so labelled might make would, by definition, be vexatious. A person's persistence may vex a public authority greatly, but that is not sufficient to put his or her request outside the terms of the Bill.
<P>
I caution the hon. Member for Ryedale to accept that there is a distinction between the two concepts; people are vexatious only in so far as their actions are vexatious. That is the definition that the Bill uses. The Minister may be able to help us with either a better legal definition or examples of previous usage of the word in legislation.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. O'Brien indicated assent.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> The hon. Gentleman nods, so I look forward to hearing his response. I would be concerned if we introduced the concept of a vexatious applicant as opposed to an applicant who was behaving vexatiously.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The concept of the vexatious litigant is well known in law. It refers to a person who habitually or persistently abuses the rights of audience or the right to take proceedings to court. Hon. Members might not be surprised to hear that the way in which the courts, the Legal Aid Board and others interpret that concept has been the subject of considerable litigation. Obviously, people who are vexatious litigants tend to litigate against all sorts of people.
<P>
It is also not novel to describe the request rather than the applicant as vexatious. I am informed that many pieces of legislation refer to the application rather than to the applicant. The word vexatious refers to applications that abuse the right in some way—for example, a request that returns to a theme that has habitually been brought up but which has been dealt with previously is arguably vexatious. However, we can deal with both concepts—a vexatious request or a vexatious applicant.
<P>
The amendment would be sweeping and onerous. It goes too far, because it would effectively result in all public authorities blacklisting an applicant who may have made vexatious applications to only one public authority. That would be much too onerous. However, I want to consider the concepts. We have taken the view that the request should be the issue that is considered, but the proposal of the hon. Member for Ryedale, that the applicant should be considered, also has some merit. I only had the opportunity to consider the issue last night. A more limited definition of a vexatious applicant—for example, one that applied only to a particular public authority and which designated a particular area of information requested of that authority—may be worth considering.
<P>
I would ask that we take another look at the general concept. We will probably stick with the idea that the application rather than the applicant should be vexatious. Both are options, but I am reluctant to have them both in the Bill. The hon. Member for Ryedale and the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath) both made reasonable points, and I should like to consider them further to see whether there is a different way of approaching the issue.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am grateful to the Minister. As I said, I acknowledge that the amendment may not be framed entirely appropriately, but I welcome the fact that the Minister accepts that the issue merits further consideration. We look forward to hearing more about that, but for now I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 42, in page 7, line 6, leave out subsection (2).
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss the following amendments: No. 105, in page 7, line 8, leave out `or substantially similar.'
<P>
No. 17, in page 7, line 9, leave out `reasonable interval' and insert `period of six months.'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> The amendment would omit subsection (2), which deals with repeated requests and thus identifies the problem as one of repetition. The only qualification offered is the expression ``a reasonable interval'', but the meaning of that is not altogether clear. Can my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary tell us what is meant by ``a reasonable interval''?
<P>
It appears that behind clause 12(2) lies the idea that repeated requests are mischievous or vexatious. I hope that my hon. Friend will agree that one can envisage many kinds of repeated requests that are not mischievous or vexatious. A body that seeks to monitor information held by a public body or the actions, processes or policy making of a public body will need to ask for such information at regular interval. Unless the same request is periodically and regularly submitted, there is no way in which an applicant or a non-governmental organisation could know when the situation changes. The same applies to journalists who track policies.
<P>
Those are not mischievous or vexatious requests—they may be in the public interest and totally serious. Subsection (2), however, could rule them out. Once the first request had been satisfied by the public body, there would be no obligation on it to accept others until ``a reasonable interval''—a rather imprecise term—had passed. Presumably the reasonableness of the interval would be determined by the public authority in the first instance. If the request was slightly inconvenient, there would be a considerable incentive for that authority to decide that more time should pass before the request could be considered and satisfied.
<P>
If the Under-Secretary intends to respond by pointing out that subsection (2) is based on an identical provision in the Data Protection Act 1998, he will have a good point. In that Act, it is the only ground for refusing a vexatious request. In the Bill, because clause 12(1) specifies a vexatious request, I suspect that it is the vexatiousness rather than the repetition of requests that my hon. Friend seeks to deter. I believe that subsection (1) makes subsection (2) otiose. The same does not apply to the provision in the 1998 Act, because that Act does not contain the equivalent of subsection (1). The Under-Secretary has drafted subsection (1) so well that he has made subsection (2) redundant. I hope that he agrees and will accept my amendment, which would result in the extremely elegant phrasing of subsection (1).
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am not sure that we agree with the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central. We think that there is a case for subsection (2) and, from my exchanges with the Under-Secretary, I know that there is also a case for another subsection. Subsection (2) deals with repeated requests, which are different from vexatious requests, or requests from vexatious applicants.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman explain how a request can be vexatious if it is not repeated?
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> There is a world of difference between a vexatious and a repeated request. Someone may repeat a request because he is dissatisfied with the answer that he received, for example, and may be trying to find out whether the information is available. The Bill deals not just with the release of information, but primarily—from the very first, in clause (l)(l)(a)—with the right to know whether information is held. The Under-Secretary explained this morning the great difficulty that the Health and Safety Executive had in locating and preparing certain information. It is therefore possible to have a repeated request that is not vexatious. One must accept that or agree to differ.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes my point. If a repeated request is a serious and necessary one, it is, as he says, not vexatious, but one does not then need subsection (2) to disqualify serious and virtuous repeated requests.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> The hon. Gentleman misses another reason for out needing subsection (2) although it gives no indication of what a reasonable interval might be—an omission that amendment No. 17 addresses. If an applicant made the same request every week for five or six weeks, I would begin to be persuaded that that was in some way vexatious. However, my understanding of subsection (2) is that it endeavours to provide a public authority with an opportunity to say, ``Look, we have already responded to you once; we do not have to respond to you again because we gave you all this information two months ago and it has not changed.'' Such a repeated request would not be vexatious.
<P>
I understand the hon. Gentleman's argument that he would rather subsection (2) did not exist, but I am proceeding on the basis that the Minister will not be convinced of that. If we are to have subsection (2), we therefore need to ask whether its wording is adequate. We also need to consider two key questions posed in the amendments. First, should the subsection be available only if the request is identical, or is there an argument for including the words ``or substantially similar''. Before the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central intervened, I was about to say that earlier this morning the Liberal Democrats attempted to add the words ``or substantially similar'' in respect of requests for information in clause 11. We are coming at the same points from different directions, although I wonder whether the phrase ``or substantially similar'' is already outlawed by subsection (1). Do we need to include the phrase? In other words, should that protection to a public authority be available only where the information or the request for information is effectively the same? I could envisage a situation in which an individual tries to obtain information, does not strike gold the first time, but believes that, if the public authority tries harder, it may be able to locate what he is looking for. Could the authority then just say, ``We have had all this before, the request is substantially similar and therefore the answer to it is no''? So the first point to consider is whether we want to include ``or substantially similar'', given that there is the provision on vexatious requests and that we do not want in any way to block someone with a genuine case who has a genuine desire to locate information and who seeks only, on confirmation that it exists, to have it released to him.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
One must also bear it in mind that the subsection could also come into play in a request for information that may be caught by one of the class exemptions that are subject to a prejudice test or to the general discretion available under clause 13. The Committee should therefore question whether ``or substantially similar'' is appropriate for inclusion in subsection (2). The second point is that the subsection does not define a reasonable interval. Amendment No. 17 suggests a period of six months, not because it has been clutched out of the air as a period that might be considered as reasonable, but simply to indicate that we need a clear idea of what the Government think a reasonable interval should be, if they are—against the better judgment of the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central—to persist with subsection (2). The amendments are therefore to some degree probing amendments.
<P>
I make those final comments against the background that the Under-Secretary has in any event agreed to look at the issue of the vexatious applicant or vexatious request and may want to look at the whole clause in the round when he reviews it and when he takes my comments into consideration.

<P>

<B>Mr. David Heath:</B> I have a great deal of sympathy with amendment No. 42. If one includes section (1), subsection (2) becomes redundant. If one has a general means of preventing vexatious questioning, one does not need a second way of defining that vexatious questioning. One does not need to set out provisions to cope with particular circumstances because one already has a more general, encompassing power that can be used.
<P>
I have sympathy with the first amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Ryedale. If the amendment of the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central is not acceptable to the Committee, that amendment would at least ameliorate the worst excesses in dealing with the ``or substantially similar'' point. I have less sympathy with the second of the hon. Gentleman's amendments. It seeks to address the temporal dimension of a series of questions. All Back Benchers are familiar with trying to elicit information, via the Table Office, from Government Departments. Questions posed at different times receive different answers—not because the question was different but because time has elapsed since the original question. The degree of that difference is often governed by the type of information sought and the speed with which events, whatever they may be, have moved in the interim. That is why I cannot accept that ``reasonable interval'' should be more precisely defined; it is clear that that will differ in different circumstances. If a radioactive cloud were advancing over western Europe, as it did post-Chernobyl, one could ask a series of identical questions at hourly intervals and receive different answers. Such questioning would not be vexatious, but would be a genuine seeking of information to the applicant's advantage.
<P>
It would be a mistake to attempt to define a reasonable interval. Why have the Government bothered to include such terms at all, when the first half of the clause already deals with vexatious questioning? All that subsection (2) does is limit a questioner's ability to ask genuine questions. It cannot limit the ability of a vexatious questioner to ask questions, because that is already catered for in subsection (1). Why is a second element of definition of vexatious questioning necessary? I cannot find a reason, but I can imagine all sorts of circumstances in which the power not to comply with a request is abused to stop someone asking perfectly proper questions over time to ascertain how a particular activity is progressing. I can think of few circumstances in which questions would fall foul of subsection (2), but not of subsection (1). If my logic is secure, the best thing is to accept the amendment and to get rid of subsection (2), which muddies the waters and does not assist in the operation of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central asked for the Government's view on the phrase ``reasonable interval''. An interval is a period of time and the term ``reasonable'' is well known in law. The recently deceased Lord Denning, who was a very learned judge, had occasion to consider the meaning of the term. He famously took the view that it meant the perspective of a man on the top deck of the Clapham omnibus. Effectively, he suggested that the meaning depended on what a reasonable person would consider in all the circumstances involved. The hon. Member for Somerton and Frome rightly said that in circumstances such as those which occurred after the Chernobyl disaster, what is reasonable could change from hour to hour. The circumstances involved are therefore the relevant criteria for judging what is reasonable. A public authority that is dealing over a long period with requests for the same information made every day, every week or even every few months could be regarded as being subject to unreasonable demands if the circumstances have not changed.
<P>
I am afraid that I must speak even more loyally to my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central, and say that the meaning of reasonable interval depends on the circumstances involved. The hon. Member for Somerton and Frome was entirely right about that. However, the Bill requires public authorities to consider what is reasonable and ensures that they cannot simply determine that an application judged to be vexatious some time ago is vexatious if repeated later. If a reasonable interval has elapsed, a repeated application may no longer be vexatious, which is why subsection (2) provides protection for the applicant. The hon. Gentleman asked why subsection (2) was necessary. It is needed partly to more clearly define the term ``vexatious'' and partly to give protection to applicants, who should know that public authorities must reconsider an application deemed to be vexatious if a reasonable interval has elapsed and if it is not vexatious for another reason.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> The Under-Secretary's statement that the clause has been inserted to protect applicants puts it in a new perspective. If that is the case, will he consider drafting subsection (2) in its reciprocal form? That would make it clear that the measure is intended simply to provide the opportunity to remove the argument that a question is vexatious if a reasonable time has elapsed. That impression is not given by the current phrasing and no member of the Committee has read it in that way.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I am pleased to be giving a new perspective to the hon. Gentleman and my colleagues. The clause is meant not only to protect the applicant but to make clearer for the public authority how it should approach the situation. We need the extra provision in clause 12(2) as repeated requests are not necessarily vexatious. An applicant's request to an authority, identical to one that has been properly answered by that authority, may not necessarily be vexatious. However, we cannot expose authorities to the burden of having to comply with such repeated requests unless a reasonable period has elapsed. That will protect the applicant and the authority.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> Will my hon. Friend give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> May I give just one more example of a vexatious question, which occurred to me while the hon. Member for Ryedale was trying to answer an intervention from my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central? The example, which is different from those envisaged by the amendment, is of such a question that someone seeking merely to be vexatious might ask.
<P>
One week, a public authority might be asked what kind of strawberry ice cream it uses in its kitchens. The following week, it might be asked what kind of vanilla ice cream it uses. The questioner might go through a list of such entirely vexatious questions. It is possible to imagine a person being vexatious to get back at a public authority for real or imagined slights.
<P>
We must provide not only protection for applicants so that they know that they may make requests that the authorities will have to consider properly after a reasonable interval, but protection for public authorities. A reasonable period must elapse before a person may make further requests. What constitutes a reasonable period depends on the circumstances, as the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome says.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> The Under-Secretary said that a reasonable period ought to elapse, even for serious rather than vexatious requests. Why should any time elapse if a request is serious and in the public interest? If it is serious, it should be taken seriously.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> My hon. Friend has misinterpreted me: I am talking about vexatious requests.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> Subsection (1) covers vexatious requests, so the Under-Secretary does not need subsection (2).
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> We need subsection (2) because it gives clarity to subsection (1) and fits in the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stephen O'Brien </B>(Eddisbury): Will the Under-Secretary give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> There is a danger of taking the issues at the wrong angle, so let me explain our reasoning. I shall give way to the hon. Gentleman when I have given my objections to the amendments.
<P>
Amendment No. 42 would delete subsection (2), which allows authorities to refuse requests if the applicant has recently been supplied with the same, or with substantially similar, information. The requirement to respond to such repeated requests might place unreasonable burdens on authorities and would risk hampering their functioning, especially that of small ones such as doctor's surgeries or small museums. That is not the aim of FOI, and it will be damaging to the cultural change that we aim to encourage in the public sector.
<P>
The clause is drafted so that whether an authority has to comply with a repeated request will depend on what is reasonable in the circumstances. If the authority is small or if the cost of providing the information is large, it may be very burdensome to require an authority to provide the same information to the same applicant once it has already done so. However, in other instances, such as relatively simple information provided by a large organisation, the information should be provided. Furthermore, if the information is of a sort that could be expected to change rapidly, a reasonable interval would be a matter of weeks or even days. It would depend, again, on the circumstances. It could even be hours if circumstances were constantly changing.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central pointed out that while there is a similar provision in the Data Protection Act 1998, there is no further provision there for vexatious requests. However, while vexatious requests might be the same as repeated requests for substantially similar information, that would not necessarily be the case. Vexatious requests could include supplementary requests from the same individual for further clarification of an original request beyond the point where more information could reasonably be provided. That is not the same as repeated requests for information, and the provision is therefore necessary.
<P>
Finally, while it may be good practice for information to be placed on the internet after it has been supplied to one applicant, it is up to the Information Commissioner to agree to the contents of publication schemes under clause 17.
<P>
Amendment No. 105, tabled by the hon. Member for Ryedale, would limit a public authority's exemption from the obligation to comply with a request for information so that it covered only identical requests. It would not apply to substantially similar requests. That is too restrictive. An applicant would need to change only one small aspect of the original request to ensure that it was not identical and avoid the exemption, even though it was substantially the same request and it required the same answer as before. Several substantially similar requests could place an unreasonable burden on the authority and affect its work. We must, to coin a phrase, all be reasonable and strike the right balance. Specifying identical requests is too rigid an approach; including substantially similar requests—which will be, in the phrase used by the hon. Member for Ryedale, effectively the same—goes no further than necessary to prevent applicants from avoiding the effect of the clause.

<P>

<B>Mr. Stephen O'Brien:</B> It occurred to me while we discussed vexatious and repeated requests that it was conceivable that a repeated request might not be vexatious. Vexatiousness carries an inference—I know that this has been discussed in the courts—of intent, which pure repetition need not. A degree of judgment must be applied to the word ``vexatious'', whereas it is a plain matter of fact whether a request has been repeated. That struck me as being for the protection of applicants and to assist them through the process, as well as helping the authority concerned; there must be instances in which repetition is misguided rather than vexatious. For that reason, I support the Under-Secretary's line. I see a need for subsection (2) in addition to subsection (1), as protection of both sides of the process.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> That was a very welcome intervention. I agree with the hon. Gentleman's argument.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath:</B> I simply observe that when the Under-Secretary gave the detailed rationale for his rejection of amendment No. 42, not once did he use his earlier argument that it was for the protection of the applicant; he said that it was purely for the protection of the authority.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> There is no reason why I should repeat my argument. The hon. Gentleman heard it quite clearly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> No doubt my hon. Friend was grateful for a bit of support for the shaky logic of his response.
<P>
I hope we can agree that vexatious requests should be refused; that repetitive but well-intended requests that have a serious public interest purpose should be allowed; and that repeated frivolous, mischievous or vexatious requests should be refused. If the Under-Secretary agrees with all three of those statements, he is agreeing that repetitive, mischievous and vexatious requests are covered by ``vexatious'', as set out in subsection (1). Therefore, subsection (2) is not necessary.
<P>
As for the point made by the hon. Member for Eddisbury that we should turn down repeated requests that are virtuous and serious—
<P>
<B>Mr. Stephen O'Brien:</B> Misguided.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> If my hon. Friend wants to clarify the matter by including and defining the word ``misguided'', he must state who is to judge that. The idea that misguided requests, whatever that patronising term means—envisage applicants being patted on their heads—could be turned down by a public body, puts us in murky waters.
<P>
We agree about the term ``vexatious''. Repetitive requests are a problem only if they are vexatious, which is covered in subsection (1). The Under-Secretary's logic fell apart. As he said, the Bill aims to give access to valid and serious applications, but sometimes those will be made on a repeated basis. They should be allowed, but vexatious, mischievous and pointless requests should be disqualified, as they are in clause 12(1). I urge the Under-Secretary to reconsider his flow of logic at a time when ideas are not being put to him on the hoof. I think that he will see that the elimination of vexatious requests is covered in clause 12(1). The clause title, ``Vexatious or repeated requests'', does not bear analysis because repeated requests that are serious should be allowed. He conceded that point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> We are talking about requests that have been complied with by public authorities. Is my hon. Friend saying that repeated, albeit serious, requests for the same information should be allowed, even if a reasonable period has not elapsed between the requests, and given that the information has been provided?
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> Yes, because the information or circumstances may change. The only way in which a crusading NGO or journalist could establish that would be to submit a serious request. If a request is frivolous and time-wasting, perhaps it should be disallowed, but a serious request should not.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Serious repeated requests could be monitored by computer-generated means. If circumstances are likely to have changed, the public authority should comply with the request. Is the hon. Gentleman saying that if they are unlikely to have changed and there is, none the less, a serious request, a public authority should comply with it?
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> No. It is interesting that the Under-Secretary refers to computer generation and the role of new technology. I hope that when information has been sought, public bodies will place it on their internet site—most such bodies now have an internet site—where it will be readily available and updated as and when that is necessary. That would obviate the need for repeated requests for it. If that is not done, the only way in which one could pursue a problem about, for example, incidents involving health and safety at work would be to make serious and well-intentioned requests. Clause 12(2) will allow the Health and Safety Executive to refuse such requests on the grounds that it could say,``We gave out that information last month and the Minister gave me permission to refuse to do so again.'' I am sure that that is not the Government's intention. The situation is covered admirably by clause 12(1).
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I confirm that our intention is that perhaps a reasonable time should be allowed to elapse, although it is possible that situations may change. The courts will need to interpret the phrase, ``reasonable interval''. Someone may apply for the same information every day if it is reasonable to do so, although that would obviously have an impact on the authority's work. As I said, we all have to be reasonable in this context.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> I hope that the Under-Secretary will give the matter further thought. Is cover needed for anything other than vexatious requests? We may return to this matter on the Floor of the House or in another place. In the meantime, I hope that he will consider whether the elegant drafting of clause 12(1) obviates the need for clause 12(2). I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 79, in page 7, line 17, leave out from `Part II' to `or' in line 18.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, we may take Government amendments Nos. 45 and 46.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> The amendment deals with serious developments that have occurred between the Bill's appearance in draft form and in the published form that we are considering. Since the Government first embarked on this programme of enlightenment, there have been retrograde developments in their thinking on freedom of information.
<P>
Freedom of information should bring enlightenment—it should involve shining a spotlight on subjects that are of public interest. That public interest should be perceived and there should be no countervailing public interest in keeping documentation under wraps. Alas, the blinds are increasingly being pulled down on that light. In that respect, the clause is one of the Bill's most disturbing developments.
<P>
The duty under clause 13 to consider the public interest in disclosing exempt information applies only to certain exemptions. Amendment No. 79 would extend that duty to all exemptions.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The two Government amendments do the opposite, closing the shutters even tighter. The Government originally introduced a wholly different concept and clause in the draft Bill applying the public interest test to all exemptions other than those relating to security bodies and court records. The onus is therefore on them to justify changing their mind and contracting the ambit of that enlightening procedure. I am tempted not to justify every single aspect of my amendment, which would protect the general principle that disclosure in the public interest should be fostered by, not excluded from, the clause.
<P>
However, I recognise that arguments of different quality and weight apply to various matters covered by the Bill. Therefore, I do not attach equal weight to clause 19, which deals with information that is reasonably accessible to the public, and clause 21, which deals with information supplied by bodies dealing with security matters. However, different considerations apply to excluding the public interest, as demonstrated in the seven, or perhaps eight, matters covered by the amendment.
<P>
Will the Minister explain in detail why the Government have gutted the clause, which is quite different from clause 14(1) of the draft Bill? It is, however, right that individual clauses should apply the duty to consider the public interest. Under clause 19, information that is already reasonably accessible to the public is exempt, even when a charge is made for it. All information which authorities are legally required to make public is held to be reasonably accessible. However, it is commonly accepted that what is held to be reasonably accessible may not be in practice. For example, public authorities sometimes refuse to supply photocopies of information. If a public authority tells one of my constituents that he or she may inspect information which is held elsewhere, it is doubtful whether that information is reasonably accessible, as it is distant from the authority's location.
<P>
Clause 21 deals with information supplied by bodies dealing with security matters. At first blush, the strongest position may be that the public interest should not be considered in relation to that exempt category. However, the amendment is not designed to open access to the bodies as such, but to material that may be held by or be passed through the offices of such bodies. It is not so unreasonable to consider that bodies that would not normally be subject to trawls for information might hold such material. Indeed, Lord Griffiths gave an example in the Spycatcher case, saying that if, theoretically, a member of the security service
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``discovered that some iniquitous course of action was being pursued that was clearly detrimental to our national interest, and he was unable to persuade any senior member of his service or any member of the establishment, or the police, to do anything about it, then he should be relieved of his duty of confidence so that he could alert his fellow citizens to the impending danger.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Clause 30 deals with another exempt category, information supplied to a public authority by a court tribunal or inquiry. The Bill does not cover the bodies, and documents relating to their proceedings that are held by public authorities are exempt as a class, regardless of whether disclosure would prejudice legal proceedings. The Campaign for Freedom of Information has helpfully focused on the problem raised by the development of the Government's thinking. I agree with its thinking that such an exemption would protect, for example, the courts of a military board of inquiry held by the Ministry of Defence, decisions of the vaccine damage tribunal held by the Department of Health and inquiries held under statutory powers into child abuse, medical negligence, financial misconduct or other matters of public concern. My amendment would allow access to such materials where the public interest in disclosure outweighed whatever interest the exemption was intended to protect.
<P>
Clause 38(1) relates to personal data about the applicant, another exempt category. The Bill provides that a request by someone seeking personal information about himself be dealt with under the right of access to personal data in the Data Protection Act 1998. Such information is therefore exempt under clause 38. However, the 1998 Act's right of access contains no public interest test, and the transfer of requests from the Bill to that Act may in some cases reduce the applicant's rights. The amendment would mean that a request for one's own personal data would not be exempt under the Bill if its disclosure were in the public interest.
<P>
Clause 39 again deals with a new category. It exempts information when its disclosure would constitute a breach of confidence. Indirectly, the exemption incorporates the public interest test found in the civil law of confidence. The courts have held that obligation of confidentiality may be set aside, or may not have arisen at all, if the information reveals the existence of crime, fraud, serious misconduct or danger to the public. Although the term ``public interest'' is not exhaustively defined under the law of confidence, tests of it tend to be difficult to meet and too narrow for the purposes of a freedom of information Act.
<P>
The public interest in the context of freedom of information involves a wider range of issues. We highlighted some of them in the earlier debate on the purpose clause, which referred to the need to promote the accountability of public authorities, informed public debate, public participation in the making of decision and public understanding of the powers, duties and operation of public authorities.
<P>
Some of those wider elements of the public interest can be seen in the ombudsman's decision from the open government code of practice. He has held that updated figures about the capital costs of a large project should be disclosed, even if that could result in limited commercial prejudice to the body concerned, because
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the public interest, in holding public bodies to account for their use of public funds, is a strong one.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There are precedents for legislation that extends or overrides the common law obligation of confidentiality, some of them introduced by the present Government. They include section 27(5) of the Data Protection Act 1998, which covers information supplied in confidence. One of the most far reaching is found in the Food Standards Act 1999, which gives the Food Standards Agency wide powers to obtain information about
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``food premises, food businesses or commercial operations being carried out with respect to food.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In pursuit of its functions, which include providing information to the public to assist them in making ``informed decisions about food'', it is free to publish
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``any . . . information in its possession (whatever its source)''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In doing so, the agency must
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``consider whether the public interest in the publication of the advice or information in question is outweighed by any considerations of confidentiality attaching to it.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Government's stance on this issue is developing in a dangerously constrictive way. It is hard to understand how the philosophy embodied in the passage that I have just read out from the Data Protection Act could be so comprehensively disregarded in the drafting of this clause.
<P>
Clause 42, the last of the clauses covered by the amendment, deals with disclosures prohibited by statute. Information whose disclosure is prohibited by statute could also be subject to the Bill's public interest test. Such information is exempt under clause 4. I understand that the Government are reviewing existing statutory restrictions with a view to repealing or amending those considered unnecessary. The Bill creates an order-making power to relax restrictions that interfere with the disclosure of information. A simpler way of achieving the desired result would be to allow the public interest test in clause 13 to override such statutory restrictions.
<P>
Government amendments Nos. 45 and 46 add two further exemptions to the list of exemptions not subject to clause 13. The first applies to information exempt under clause 32 on the ground of parliamentary privilege. The second applies to information exempt under the first condition of clause 38(2). That provides that personal data about someone other than the applicant are exempt if disclosure would contravene any of the data protection principles, or if the data are subject to a notice under section 10 of the Data Protection Act 1998 because disclosure would cause substantial and unwarranted damage or distress to the individual concerned.
<P>
It is hard to understand why the public interest test is excluded from such personal data. The effect in both cases is to limit the opportunity of the Bill to establish a public interest case to set against the wide-ranging and complex exemption for personal data in clause 38(2). In relation to information covered by a section 10 notice, in particular, the public interest provision would help to clarify what was meant by ``unwarranted'' damage or distress—that is, to clarify that such damage or distress may be warranted where it is a consequence of a disclosure justified in the public interest.
<P>
I am sorry to tax the Committee at such length on the amendment, but it is necessary because the Government have shifted their position in so retrograde a manner following the consultation period. It would be of great interest to know whether they can adduce in support of this closing of the shutters any representations that these denials of consideration of the public interest were necessary or even desirable.
<P>
The Campaign for Freedom of Information is not a single body; it is an umbrella body comprising a large number of constituent members. In its deliberations on the Bill, it seeks to bring to bear the views of that wide membership. It has engaged in extensive consultations. It does not reflect an idiosyncratic view, a woolly liberal Hampstead view or a peculiarly conservative view, with which the Prime Minister now associates all kinds of horrors. It represents a wide spectrum of interests and constituency membership. Therefore, its representations deserve unusually serious consideration by the Government.
<P>
In arguing for the amendment, I hope that I have done justice to the great work done by the organisation and its constituents. Historically, the campaign's efforts had supported the Labour party. We therefore expected to find ourselves in broadly the same camp as the Government. It has been a matter of the greatest disappointment to discover that such extraordinary divergence is developing.

<P>

<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I have listened with interest to the argument of the right hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross. Conservative Members differ from him in terms of approach. As the Minister has acknowledged, one of the difficulties of the clause is the grave disquiet about the extent to which harm, prejudice or a public interest test should apply to the use of discretion. We will debate that issue in more detail later. If the Government do not give ground on the matter, there will be arguments in relation to what the right hon. Gentleman has been saying.
<P>
The key question is whether the Bill should provide for blanket exemptions, to which no discretion can apply even where it can be shown that the public interest might require release of information. I am not 100 per cent. convinced that the Government are wrong to say that there should be blanket exemptions. Whether or not the list in its entirety is appropriate is a matter for the Committee to consider. The right hon. Gentleman rightly points out that the Government are adding two more to the list of blanket exemptions.
<P>
I shall outline the approach of Conservative Members. First, the public interest or harm test should be strengthened in respect of the use of discretion. Secondly, as we go through the Bill, individual consideration should be given to some of the blanket exemptions. We should also consider some of the class exemptions, although they would still be subject to the discretionary test. Thirdly, the powers of enforcement in respect of the wrong use of discretion should be strengthened.
<P>
I hope that that helps the Minister in understanding our position. We can see why the provision has been drafted in that way, but as part of an overall equation, some elements of the structure of the Bill are inadequate. If those elements are not strengthened, the argument of the hon. Member for Ryedale is all the stronger. At this juncture, we should like to think that the Minister can be persuaded to shift his position on some of the other points that I have raised. If he were to do so, we should be more content to see certain class exemptions. We are, therefore, reserving our judgment until we see how the Minister moves on some of the other issues that I have outlined.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> If my hon. Friend the Minister needed encouragement, I should have thought that the support of the hon. Member for Ryedale in the terms that he offered was enough to make him reconsider his position. We all accept that exemptions are necessary. Every freedom of information regime in the world has exemptions, but those of us who have ever taken trouble over the issue, realise that though they are necessary, they can be dangerous. Every other regime in the world realises that there must be some restraint on the exemptions. They cannot be completely blanket. The only effective restraint is a public interest test. The Government recognised that in the original draft Bill and provided exemptions that were out of the reach of a public interest test in two respects. I refer to court records and security matters. I look forward, with some trepidation, to hearing why my hon. Friend the Minister, when redrafting the Bill, added all those other areas, putting them outside the reach of a public interest test. He has also added clauses 32 and 38 to that list. I believe that he is going entirely in the wrong direction.
<P>
The hon. Member for Ryedale said that we could cover these matters individually, and no doubt we shall debate them after we have discussed clause 19. I urge my hon. Friend the Minister to think carefully. He will be tested on the Floor of the House and in another place. A public interest test is one of the core elements of the Bill. It is the only protection that we have from the abuse of what the Government intend—access to information—in areas that are rightly exempt. While applauding the Bill and the necessary exemptions, which are shared by other countries, surely my hon. Friend can see that he must provide the restraint of a public interest test in as wide an area as possible. My hon. Friend's original draft Bill was along the right lines. I am amazed that he has gone in a completely different direction since then.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The right hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross describes the Government's attitude as dangerously constricting. His approach is over-the-top hyperbole. I never expected to accuse the right hon. Gentleman of that. The Bill gives new rights to the public. They will have a statutory right to know certain things. No matter what our differences on the detail of the Bill, the right hon. Gentleman knows that people will be able to get information from their doctor's surgery, museum, local authority, and so on. They did not have access to those places before. The Government cannot be described as having an attitude that is dangerously constricting—on the contrary.
<P>
On clause 13 especially, the Government are prepared to put their point of view robustly. However, we always said that we would consider any point raised during the BM's passage. I say for the benefit of my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central that we listen with care to all matters that are raised with us. Our response will be robust but not dogmatic and we are willing to hear arguments being tested.
<P>
I agreed with much of what the hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross said about the Campaign for Freedom of Information, which deserves praise for the way in which it has kept the matter to the fore. By not allowing it to die the campaign ensured that the issues would be brought before the House through the medium of a Labour Government—the first Government to have created a statutory right to know.
<P>
In passing, I should point out that many areas of the press have been extremely quiet in their support of the Campaign for Freedom of Information, which is regrettable. A notable exception, of course, is The Guardian, whose willingness to take up the subject is praiseworthy. I confess to not having agreed with all the points that the paper raised, nor the way in which it made them, and I must warn it not to go over the top. Nevertheless, together with the campaign, the paper has kept the matter at the forefront of debate, and both deserve credit for that. Therefore, although I might need to argue about some matters of detail, I endorse many of the supportive comments about the Campaign for the Freedom of Information.
<P>
I do not agree with the hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross that in substance we have moved away from the draft Bill. In fact I do not accept that we have moved at all in any real sense. The draft applied the obligation to consider disclosure of information in the exercise of an authority's discretion only if such disclosure was lawful. That has been removed and replaced with references to the clauses which, as a matter of law, leave no discretion for an authority to disclose, as well as references to where the exercise of the discretion would be nonsense, or inappropriate.
<P>
The effect of amendment No 79 would be to require authorities to reach a decision under clause 13 for all exempt information. However, practical reasons, policy consideration and legal restraints mean that in certain limited circumstances authorities should not be required to consider disclosure of exempt information under the clause. As the Bill is drafted, authorities do not have to consider their discretion to disclose information if it falls into any of the following exemptions: information accessible to the public by other means, under clause 19; information supplied by or relating to bodies dealing with security matters, under clause 21; court records, under clause 30; personal information, under clause 38(1); information supplied in confidence, under clause 39; prohibition on disclosure, under clause 42, and information exempt by order of the Secretary of State, under clause 43(2).
<P>
The reasons vary with each case. Briefly, the justification is, first, under clause 19, that the information is already accessible by other means. Depending on the circumstances, it could either be nonsense for an authority to be required to make a decision under clause 13, or an authority could already be obliged to provide the information under another regime. An illustration of the former might be a telephone directory. Authorities should not have to consider whether to send an applicant a copy of a telephone directory because, clearly, the applicant should approach British Telecom instead. An illustration of the latter is where information is covered by sections l00A to K of the Local Government Act 1972, which requires local authorities to make certain information available, so there is no need for the authority to consider any discretion under freedom of information legislation. It is important to note that, if the information is not accessible by other means, applicants may apply for it under the FOI regime, which will act as a top-up to other freestanding access regimes. The Bill will not affect those regimes; they will still enable people to gain access to information.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for seriously addressing each issue in turn. He has just made the point that information must be made available by other means. No doubt, he will acknowledge that FOI access could be easier and cheaper for applicants, given that those public authorities that are required to issue information may have entirely different and more onerous charging regimes. In citing that example, he could be constraining a right.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The right hon. Gentleman is right to say that the FOI regime may be a cheaper means of obtaining information that people may legitimately obtain by other means, such as by purchasing it from a shop. For example, Home Office or House of Commons documents might be more expensive if bought commercially than if bought under the FOI regime. Is it the right hon. Gentleman's intention that the FOI regime should be a new means of undermining either the commercial basis on which organisations, such as the House or the Home Office, sell such documents, or the basis on which bookshops sell information that public authorities happen to possess? I do not think that that is his intention. That is what we mean when we talk about information that is already accessible by other means.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for asking that question, which I am only too delighted to answer. It is not my wish to undermine charging regimes, but it is my wish to increase accessibility. If a pricing regime has put documents beyond the means of the public, it is clearly highly desirable that the Bill overcomes that.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The Government have to produce documents at a particular cost, although some documents can be substantial and their reproduction might be allowed. The right hon. Gentleman suggests that people should undermine that system because they cannot afford the commercial price of a document or information that public authorities hold by simply applying for it under the FOI regime. He may think that that is the purpose of the Bill, but it is not.
<P>
The purpose of the Bill is to allow people to gain access to information, which they cannot otherwise gain from a public authority by the normal means, so ending the culture of secrecy in Government and other public authorities and enabling people to have a right to know not only how their money is spent but how to gain access to the information systems of public authorities. The Bill is not about enabling people to buy something more cheaply than they can in the shops. I do not accept that the right hon. Gentleman has a legitimate point. Clause 19 is right and his logic is difficult to follow.
<P>
I know that the Committee is pressed for time, but I want to deal with several other clauses. Let me deal with clause 21 on information supplied by or relating to bodies dealing with security matters. Disclosure of such information will almost always be against the public interest, and as a matter of policy the Government are committed to ensuring that the work of such bodies is not hampered under the FOI regime. Therefore, if the information requested falls into that class, there should be no further need to consider whether to disclose it. That is the Government's view; others may take a different view.
<P>
Clause 30 deals with court records. The normal rules should apply to the release of those records. If an applicant requires disclosure of information contained in court records, it is for the courts to determine what should be made available. For that reason, if an authority has established that the information falls into that class, there should be no reason for the authority to consider further whether to release it in the public interest. That is a matter for the courts to decide. We should not take away the court's authority to decide this issue.
<P>
In the case of personal information exempt under clause 38(1), the authority should already have taken account of the public interest under the relevant provisions of the Data Protection Act. There is therefore no need for the authority to consider the matter again.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> These matters that the hon. Gentleman now says are excluded from the requirement of the test of public interest were not excluded when the Government put forward their draft Bill. What éclaircissement hit the Government and caused them to stand on their head on this issue?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> We listened to what the public said during the consultation. We listened to the people. That is the purpose of consulting. We listened to those who made representations to us. We listened to many sources who were prepared to put forward their views, and it is entirely right and proper to do that. At the very outset, I said that the Government were prepared to listen and to put a view robustly, but that we are also prepared to look at the strength of the argument. We have been persuaded by some of the points that have been put to us. The right hon. Gentleman says that the Data Protection Act contains no explicit public interest test. That is true, but the principles set out in that Act will ensure that the public interest is taken into account.
<P>
In the case of clause 39, on information supplied in confidence, and clause 42 on prohibitions on disclosure, as a matter of law an authority has no discretion to disclose the information in question, so an authority cannot be required to consider the exercise of a power that it does not possess.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> Will my hon. Friend confirm that, during the consultation, serious public bodies and members of the public approached the Government and urged them to put these further restraints in the Bill? If public bodies said, ``No, no, we do not want this, please put these restraints in,'' will he, in the spirit of the Bill, name those organisations?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> My hon. Friend will be aware that, during the consultation on the Bill, most organisations that made representations said that the White Paper, as drafted, should be constrained in certain respects. Contrary to the popular myth that everyone was appealing for greater openness, many people saw that there was merit in getting a better balance in the Bill by taking into account both the concerns of those who wanted rights to privacy and confidentiality, particularly in commercial areas, and the ability to be efficient in government. We looked at the logic of those arguments. Although I do not say that large numbers of public bodies made representations, we looked at the arguments that were presented and came to a reasonable and reasoned conclusion. That is the way in which Governments should approach this matter.
<P>
The draft Bill excluded information about court records and the security services. It also excluded those exemptions where disclosure would not be lawful. That would cover confidential information. The further exemption makes the Government's intentions clearer in that respect. That is the way in which I would approach these things. As for the public interest test in the common law of confidence, information is exempt under clause 39 where the common law of confidence applies. There is already a public interest test in the common law of confidence. If consideration of the public interest within that common law leads to the conclusion that the information is not confidential, the exemption will not apply and the applicant will have a right to the information under clause 1.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> The test needs to be invoked to go beyond existing law, to strike a balance and to enable the applicant to benefit from the view that the public interest lies in disclosure. It is not a matter of enforcing common law rights.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> When we create statute, it is not always a matter of enforcing common law rights, but a matter of considering whether it is appropriate for common law rights to be preserved. We take the view that, in these circumstances, the public interest lies in preserving common law rights of confidence. They are relied on when many bodies provide information to the Government. Some campaigning bodies—I am thinking of one particular example—provide the Government with information, use rights of confidentiality and agree that that information should be supplied. As a result, new investigations take place, and we often hope to put the results into the public domain. However, the relevant, high-profile organisation seeks to maintain an element of confidence.
<P>
There are circumstances, therefore, in which these provisions are justified. The right hon. Gentleman can say that we should err more on the side of openness. I would not dispute that there are sound arguments in favour of that view. Equally, however, there are sound arguments on the other side. As Oliver Wendell Holmes Jnr. said, in every case one has to weigh up the arguments and come down on one side or the other. We have come down on one side, the right hon. Gentleman on another. There is legitimacy in both arguments, but the Government have adopted this point of view.
<P>
The right hon. Gentleman referred to clause 43(2), which relates to information exempt by order of the Secretary of State. It applies only to orders made by the Secretary of State under clause 43(2), which already incorporates a public interest test. There is no need to require authorities to make a further decision as to where the public interest lies. The Government are convinced that there are good reasons in every case for removing the duty to consider disclosure under clause 13. We are prepared to argue the case. By striking out this part of the Bill wholesale, the amendments would fail to take account of the particular circumstances of each case.
<P>
Government amendments Nos. 45 and 46 are intended to clarify this part of the Bill, as it relates to personal information and parliamentary privilege. As I have already stated, an authority's discretion to disclose personal information is limited as a matter of law. The only discretion that authorities have to disclose such information is where such a disclosure would not contravene data protection principles. The Bill is unclear about the application of clause 13 in that regard, and may lead users to believe that the Bill requires authorities to consider the exercise of their duty to disclose personal information to third parties in the public interest, even if such disclosure would be inconsistent with data protection principles. That point must be clarified. The amendments would make it clear that the duty to consider a discretionary disclosure does not arise when the disclosure would contravene data protection principles—the first condition referred to in clause 34(2).
<P>
A further point is the application of clause 13 to information to which the parliamentary privilege exemption in clause 32 applies. The Government believe that there should be no duty to consider discretionary disclosure of information, in order to leave the privilege of Parliament unfettered. The amendment therefore includes the exemption relating to parliamentary privilege—clause 32—in the list of clauses to which clause 13 does not apply. To protect the privileges of Parliament, the proper procedure must be openly and properly applied, using the rules that have arisen as a result of consideration by Nolan and others. However, the question remains as to how the public interest is to be taken into account in the case of information that is subject to parliamentary privilege. The answer is that, in the case of such information, the public interest should be taken into consideration by Parliament. Parliament can waive its privilege and disclose such information when the public interest arises. I therefore urge my right hon. and hon. Members to accept amendments Nos. 45 and 46. I also request the right hon. Gentleman to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> I am conscious that we have had a long debate on the matter, and, although it is important, I do not wish to protract matters. I want briefly to answer the Minister's charge that I was seeking to denigrate the Bill by drawing attention to the way in which the Government, between the publication of the original draft Bill and this Bill, have tightened it to such an extent that it seriously damages its original concept. That is not to denigrate the Bill, but to focus on what the Government have done, which has not destroyed but detracted from the efficacy of their measure in opening up public authorities' information. That is my general point.
<P>
On a couple of other occasions, the Minister took criticism of a particular aspect of the Bill to be an attempt to denigrate the whole. That is not my purpose. My purpose is to improve the Bill and, in some cases, to restore the Government's earlier intention. Their claim to have received strong representations on the specific matters under debate would have been fortified by more examples. Perhaps it may fortify the argument for greater disclosure about advice in later debates, because the evidence on which the Government rest their case is of such a general kind that it does not support the Minister's arguments. It is possible that, in the last analysis, it has been a matter of Government hunch. If so, I hope that the House and the other place return to these matters and reconsider, with particularity, clause by clause, the exemptions in the Bill and the case for excluding consideration of where the public interest lies. It will be a much longer process than our present consideration, but it may be what we have to do. The Government have firmly set their face against the exempt clauses being subject to public interest scrutiny.
<P>
I have exhausted the Committee's attention, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> I appreciate that we have spent a long time on the clause, as the right hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross said. I do not apologise for that, or for taking up more of the Committee's time, because the balance between exemptions and the public interest to which the Minister rightly referred, is at the heart of the Bill. If we get this wrong, and there is imbalance, we prejudice much of what the Government want to achieve. That is a difficult balance, but it is wrong to say that the draft Bill or the White Paper were dangerously unbalanced. The matter was subjected to hard arguments in Cabinet Committee for more than a year. We struck a pretty good balance then, but the balance seems to have changed since the draft Bill, and that, as the right hon. Gentleman said, is a matter to which we will have to return.
<P>
The amendments change the discretionary public interest test in clause 12 to a mandatory test. With later amendments to the commissioner's powers, they would allow the commissioner to require disclosure on public interest grounds. It is a different way of trying to protect the public interest against the bulldozer of exemptions; it is often a necessary bulldozer, but it should, and I hope will, commend itself to the Government, although I suspect that the Minister will resist it tonight.
<P>
Clause 13 requires an authority to consider making a discretionary disclosure of information which it could refuse under some of the exemptions, or on cost grounds. In taking those decisions the authority must consider whether the public interest in disclosure outweighs the public interest in protecting the exemption, the balance that the Minister rightly said is so important.
<P>
The problem is that the discretionary decisions are not fully reviewable by the commissioner. In other cases, such as those concerning whether information is exempt, the commissioner can issue a legally binding notice requiring an authority to disclose. Where clause 13 is involved, the commissioner is explicitly barred from requiring disclosure. She can only make a recommendation, as specified in clause 48, and tell the authority please to reconsider. But the authority can reject that recommendation without offering any reason. That is why the amendments would require authorities to release information where the public interest in openness outweighed the public interest in withholding it. The amendments would make decisions under clause 13 subject to the Bill's normal enforcement procedure. The Bill lays down that procedure and the amendments are in the spirit of the Bill for that reason. 
<P>
Amendment No. 50 would remove the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``in the exercise of the authority's discretion'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
so the decision whether to confirm or deny the existence of exempt information would no longer be discretionary. If the balance of public interest justified it—I emphasise those words—confirmation would have to be given. That, and no other, is the correct proviso, restraint and caveat.
<P>
Amendment No. 51 would delete the same words from clause 13(3). The decision whether to disclose information would no longer involve the exercise of the authority's discretion. It would put it in law and, as I said in respect of previous amendments, that is what the Bill is about. We want to try to take such matters out of the hands of Ministers or public authorities and provide some objective security for the access to information that the Government, laudably, want to achieve.
<P>
Amendment No. 52 would remove the reference to making a disclosure from clause 13(4), so the amended clause 13 would read:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``In making any decision under subsection (2) or (3), the public authority shall having regard to all the circumstances of the case—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) inform the applicant whether it holds information, and<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) communicate the information to him,<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>whether the public interest in disclosure outweighs the public interest in maintaining the exemption in question.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The public interest test is crucial. The Bill's test applies to information falling within its class exemptions, the disclosure of which would cost more than the appropriate limit and which weighs prejudice or commercial interests or triggers any of the other harm test exemptions, when there is nevertheless an overriding public interest in disclosure. Those points are of enormous importance.
<P>
The Bill contains a long list of class exemptions, which we shall discuss in detail at a later stage. All of them permit information to be withheld, even if disclosure would cause no harm. That is a surprising ``even if'', which is at odds with other freedom of information regimes. A vast amount of information covered by these provisions is subject to no right of access at all and may be disclosed solely at an authority's discretion under clause 13. That is why the clause is so crucial. In that respect, the Bill is not really a serious advance on the code of practice. A case could be made that the Bill makes it easier to withhold information. The temptation for a public body to abuse that discretion will regularly arise whenever disclosure could expose the body to embarrassment or criticism for failure to do something, for poor judgment, making a bad decision, concessions to vested interests, and so on. Such things will inevitably arise, and it is precisely to protect us from the weakness of the code of practice, which does not prevent public bodies abusing the right to know in that way, that we need legislation.
<P>
Without strengthening, the clause could easily undermine so many of the Government's laudable ambitions. I ask my hon. Friend the Minister to look again at the clause. Even if he has to resist the three amendments tonight, will he acknowledge that there is a role for the commissioner and that we need to strengthen the public interest test to make it effective? We want to achieve the balance, which my hon. Friend rightly says that he wants, between exemption and public interest. The Bill, as drafted, does not achieve that balance. The amendments would be one way, but not the only one, of achieving a better balance.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath:</B> In supporting the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central, I have an additional point to make. There seems to be a double test of discretion. There is a discretion to determine the public interest. My understanding is that the public interest must be based on all the facts that are relevant to the case. It is, therefore, illogical that there should be a second discretion to consider the facts, which will have already been considered in determining the public interest. That is a weakness in the drafting. The Minister may be able to persuade me that I am wrong about that, but I see no reason for introducing a spurious second test, which would appear to override the public interest in circumstances that I cannot envisage.

<P>

<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central is right to say that I shall resist his amendments, but I shall consider the points that he raised. The Government recognise that there is always concern about such issues. It is not intended that clause 13 will allow authorities deliberately to act contrary to the public interest with regard to decisions under freedom of information legislation. Nothing in the Bill requires anything to be kept secret and clause 76 makes that explicit. The exemptions do not mean that information will not be disclosed, they merely provide an option that it need not be disclosed if the authority decides that there is good reason for that. Nothing in the Bill limits the powers of a public authority to disclose information held by it, and we certainly want all public authorities to create mechanisms for the dissemination of information.
<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I listened with care to the comments on amendment No. 52. Clause 13 requires a public authority to reach a decision on the public interest. If an authority concluded that disclosure was in the public interest, it would find it difficult not to disclose the information and, if it did not do so, it would be strongly criticised by the commissioner and others. Similarly, if an authority reached an unreasonable view of the public interest, it could expect criticism and the possibility of judicial review of its decision. The Government believe that the concern expressed in the amendments has been covered in the Bill or in the legislation covering judicial review.
<P>
We are already firmly committed to the principle that in a democracy only Ministers or elected representatives should have the final say on what constitutes public interest. It is not acceptable for the ultimate arbiter of such decisions to be an unelected official, no matter how wise that official may be. The basic issue is accountability, which is as it should be in a democracy. The Government believe that the ballot box is the best way of keeping those who act on behalf of the public accountable to the public.
<P>
There is another reason why I cannot accept amendments Nos. 50 and 51. At the moment, clause 13 operates when there is no statutory duty to disclose information that has been requested. It therefore relies on the pre-existing powers of an authority to disclose information. That is the discretion referred to. The amendments would remove the references to an authority's pre-existing discretion—that is, the power to disclose information—without adding anything to clarify where the power to make the disclosure is to be found. However, although I cannot give an undertaking now, the Government are considering how the provision may be strengthened. Members of the Committee can expect the Government's response on Report when we shall have considered the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South and other members of the Committee.
<P>
I come to the matter raised by the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome. The Bill has only one public interest test, set out in clause 13, which requires an authority to consider all the relevant circumstances. The reference to the public interest is found in clause 13(4), which underlies the Government's belief that it is desirable to ensure that information is available in the circumstances set out in that clause. I hope that my hon. Friend will withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his positive response in rejecting my amendments and I am pleased that he will consider how to strengthen the protections in the Bill. I am sorry that I was not sufficiently silver-tongued to persuade him to accept my amendments, but it is a positive step forward that he has said publicly that he will consider the matter further. Will he bear in mind some submissions that may be more persuasive and more authoritative than what I have to say? The Select Committee on Public Administration, with whom my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary and the Home Secretary had a constructive relationship, said:
<P>

The House of Lords Select Committee stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``If the ultimate decision whether information is exempt from such a right of access is made by a government Minister or public authority rather than by an independent arbiter, the law may be regarded as a statement of good intentions, but it is not a Freedom of Information Act as that term is internationally understood.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Of those whom I would pray in aid, I hope that the most persuasive will be the commissioner whom the Under-Secretary has garlanded with praise, as has almost everyone else.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> The hon. Gentleman's eloquence on the amendment needs to be considered by the Under-Secretary. Does he agree that the Government's general constitutional argument that Ministers are empowered democratically to have the last word on where the public interest lies is an extraordinary out-of-date view? It is artificial, bearing in mind that the suppliant, compliant nature of Parliament and its duration would mean that any Minister could effectively veto a raft of individual matters during the lifetime of Parliament without there being public recompense. Furthermore, the courts in exercising their powers of judicial review have a significant role to play in determining where the public interest lies.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> I do not agree with the right hon. Gentleman that such an argument is out of date, but I agree absolutely that it is completely against the purpose of the Bill. We believe in an open society and the Government release an enormous amount of information by grace and favour of Ministers. Most Departments are free with their information, when it is not inconvenient to be so. But the argument that such matters should be left to Ministers is deeply flawed because that is the status quo at present and that is why we need an objective yardstick in the form of legislation rather than such matters being left to the flow of Ministers.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for allowing me to intervene briefly to respond to the right hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross, whose comments were profoundly undemocratic. I regard the history of the development of democracy in this country as one of giving the people's representatives power and in many ways taking it away from officials of the Crown. We must ensure that the Bill contains a little democracy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> But surely democracy must be expressed through Parliament and its legislation. At present, Ministers who are elected democratically and have authority vested in them through the ballot box have the power, but we all agree that that power untrammelled by legislation, is not sufficient. It has not led to the open society that we want, which is why the Bill was introduced. We do not want to provide an objective framework within which Ministers can move democratically. The Under-Secretary wrongly describes the process of democracy. It is not to object to the democratic legitimacy of Ministers that we need legislation to act as a framework within which successive Administrations can operate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> When I said that the hon. Gentleman's argument was out of date, I had in mind the centralising view ``L'état c'est moi'', which the Under-Secretary is adopting to some extent. Even something as recent as the Government's decision that matters relating to the public interest should not be determined by a Minister but a body established for that purpose is a good example of how our modern democracy recognises the fallibility of Ministers and, indeed, Parliament, in determining where the public interest lies. No one would deny the democratic principle that those who are elected should draw up such determinations. However, there are important exceptions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> This brief exchange began with friendly applause for the Minister. However, I fear that this short discussion is putting wedges between us, which I do not want as the Minister's comments were constructive. However, I remind him of Elizabeth France's submission to the Public Administration Committee on 16 December 1999. She said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``I think the simple remedy is to allow discretionary decisions to be reviewable and an enforcement notice issued if the Commissioner's view is that in spite of preliminary discussion about the balance the public authority has given, what the Commissioner believes to be the wrong weight [has been given] to the some of the elements considered.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Minister has a high opinion of the Information Commissioner, who will be central to maintaining such a balance. As the Under-Secretary and Home Secretary reflect on that balance, I hope that the former takes the opportunity to talk with the Information Commissioner before taking his final decision on the matter. However, I am pleased that he will consider how to strengthen restraints on exemptions. I therefore beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to move amendment No 2, in page 7, line 39, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(4A) In making any decision under subsections (2) or (3), the public authority shall also have regard to whether substantial harm would be caused by informing the applicant that it holds the information, or by communicating the information to him.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment is extremely important, and will be followed by an equally significant group of amendments. They all address two of the four issues which, as I outlined at the outset of our deliberations, we wish to press. Amendments Nos. 3, 4 and 97 relate to another clause, but are pertinent to the subsection (5).
<P>
I shall be brief, as time is pressing. As the Minister knows, the White Paper, ``Your Right to Know: Freedom of Information'', promised a substantial harm test in determining the public interest in relation to releasing information for which there is a discretionary power to release. Paragraph 3.7 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``We believe the test to determine whether disclosure is to be refused should normally be set in specific and demanding terms. We therefore proposed to move in most areas from a simple harm test to a substantial harm test, namely will the disclosure of this information cause substantial harm?''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There was grave anxiety that that proposal was not included in the draft Bill. The history of what has happened since is well documented. The Select Committee was strongly critical of the Government's failure to adhere to the statement in its original report. After the publication of an amended draft Bill, the Select Committee, in its second report on the matter—although its first report of this Session—welcomed changes made by the Minister and his Department. However, it complained that the Bill still did not deliver an explicit statement that, unless there is a compelling argument to the contrary, the public interest should be regarded as coming down in favour of disclosure. That is similar to the question of whether there should be a purposes clause, which we discussed at the outset of our deliberations. Responding to that debate, the Minister said that his mind was not closed and that he would be prepared to consider further change to the Bill, possibly in clause 13.
<P>
Subsection 4 requires public authorities to have regard to the desirability of disclosure
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``wherever the public interest in disclosure outweighs the public interest in maintaining the exemption''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
On what criteria will the public interest be judged? More importantly, what degree of harm or prejudice would be required to justify a refusal—``refusal'' being the word that is used in the White Paper? We tabled the amendment so as to be able to ask the Minister why the Government no longer think that the substantial harm test is justified. To conclude—in anticipation of a Division in the House—we shall not press the point about substantial harm. However, we are not satisfied that the Bill is good enough in that respect.

<P>

<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> It would be fair to say that, despite the amendment, we are not wedded to the substantial harm test, especially the substantial aspect. In a way, we are teasing the Under-Secretary. We are asking him to tell us why he has shifted his position. Nevertheless, the Bill is not good enough. The Under-Secretary should anticipate that, if he does not bring forward a stronger test or give a clear indication that he intends to do so at some point, we shall try to find another way of introducing a harm test into the Bill's arrangements on Report.
<P>
Enforcement is weak in this context. That will be clear to anyone who has read the deliberations in the Select Committee report. I shall not bore the Committee by quoting from it, because I know that the Under-Secretary is familiar with the arguments. Enforcement is weak, and the test of harm must therefore be strong. The amendment was tabled in the spirit of offering the Government an opportunity to strengthen the Bill's provisions, and I commend it to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> It would be inappropriate to introduce a provision requiring authorities, when making discretionary disclosures, to have regard to whether substantial harm would be caused by informing the applicant that it holds the information requested or by communicating it to him. I appreciate that the hon. Gentleman is teasing us a little, but the amendment is inappropriate. It would introduce a harm test designed to quantify the effects of disclosure into a clause which must address the different question of where the public interest lies. Furthermore, the amendment seeks to direct the authority to consider the seriousness of the consequences of disclosure, as against the public interest in disclosure, yet clause 13 already achieves that.
<P>
In terms of the way in which the Bill is structured, the issue of the harmful effects of disclosure has already been addressed in deciding whether an exemption applies—where it is appropriate for it to do so, because not all exemptions are harm-tested. The amendment would merely repeat an earlier stage of the process of deciding whether to inform the applicant that it holds the information or to communicate it to him.
<P>
The amendment is inappropriate in two further ways. First, it seeks to apply in all cases a single omnibus test based on substantial harm. A harm test is not appropriate for all cases, and when it is appropriate it would need to be tailor made for the interests specified in the case. For example, in health and safety cases, such a test would have to find out whether the physical health, mental health or safety of an individual would be endangered. Secondly, the amendment contains the term ``substantial harm'', which is the language used in the White Paper proposals. However, part II of the Bill contains the test of whether exemptions
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``would or would be likely to prejudice.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is important that consistent language is used throughout the Bill to avoid confusion in the minds of those who will use the legislation, and it is necessary to find a formula that expresses the Government's intentions clearly in translating the policy contained in the White Paper into legislation. The formula on exemptions subject to a prejudice test delivers the principle that the harm caused should be real, actual or of substance, as implied by the White Paper. However, the White Paper contains phraseology that is in general use and is not legally specific. In our view, the term ``prejudice'' is the best term, as it has an understandable pedigree in legislation and ensures that people understand the meaning of the provisions. One reason why the Government did not use a substantial harm test as suggested in the White Paper is that the majority of people who expressed an opinion on it in response to consultation said that they were not in favour. All of the consultation responses have been published, so hon. Members can see them.
<P>
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will ask leave to withdraw the amendment in the light of my remarks.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> The Under-Secretary has given us a reason why the Government will not make such a huge volte face. However, I am not sure that it will satisfy hon. Members who remain critical on the subject, and I do not think that he will expect it to. The amendment deals with one of the most important matters outstanding in the Bill and there is much to be gained by arguing on issues about which we clearly disagree. Given the lateness of the hour, however, I think that the Committee should reflect on the Under-Secretary's remarks and seek to persuade him to press the matter in other ways. In that spirit, and although we are not satisfied by the Under-Secretary's reply, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 3, in page 7, leave out lines 40 to 45.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to consider the following amendments: No. 4, in clause 33, page 18, line 17, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(except factual information which has been used, or is intended to be used, to provide an informed background to decision-taking).'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 97, in clause 33, page 18, line 21, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(1A) Information is not exempt by virtue of subsection (1) or section 34 insofar as it consists of—
<P>
(a) factual information;
<P>
(b) the analysis or evaluation of, or any projection based on, factual information; or
<P>
(c) expert advice on a scientific, technical, medical, financial, statistical or other matter.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> Although I shall try to be brief, the issues dealt with by the amendments take some time to explain. Amendment No. 3 relates to clause 13 and amendment No. 4 relates to clause 33, but the two matters dealt with are linked.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> For the Committee's information, amendments Nos. 4 and 97 apply to clause 33.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I was making that point, which is confusing. In many respects, the issue dealt with by the amendment relates more to clause 33 than to clause 13. There is grave concern that clause 33 prevents the release of factual information on which policy and decisions are based. Even the most straightforward, mundane and routine data would be caught by the wording of clause 33. The code of practice specifically provided that information or data that had informed policy decisions or formulation would be released. As the Minister knows, the code contains a specific statement to that effect, under the heading ``Information that the Government will release''. Similarly, paragraph 2.18 of the White Paper contained an explicit statement that information would be released, and it specifically accepted the code position. I doubt whether that could be made any clearer to the Committee. However, the draft Bill altered that approach and was intended to provide a class exemption. The relevant draft provision was clause 28 and, if one thinks only of the Data Protection Act 1998 in this context—some Committee members bear the scars of that Standing Committee, which was very drawn out and complex—enough clauses numbered 28 have given difficulty already; I was therefore relieved that the one that I mentioned is now clause 33.
<P>
The Select Committee criticised the use of a class exemption and recommended a different approach to achieve a reduction in the level of protection for information related to the formulation or development of Government policy. The Government made substantive changes in the wording of the clause, but the Select Committee's second report—the first of the 1999–2000 Session—stated that those changes did not alter matters overall. The Bill still catches innocuous information. There is no requirement, either, to have regard to a harm test in deciding whether to release that factual information. The Minister will, I am sure, recall that several Second Reading speeches made the same point.
<P>
We want the Bill to exclude factual information that has informed the formulation of policy or decision-taking from the general class exemption relating to policy and decisions. We have no objection to a class exemption relating to formulation of policy and decision-taking. We object—this was also the Select Committee's point—to the fact that the class exemption catches the factual information. Amendments Nos. 3 and 4 would achieve a better outcome than the Bill would.
<P>
All that section 13(5) does is require the public authority to have regard to the desirability of the release of the factual information, but without a harm test. Discretion is therefore clearly retained with respect to the release of simple factual information. We can all imagine different types of information that would be relevant. One that springs to my mind concerns recent events in agriculture. The Government will have had information on which they had to make decisions about policy—notably about the BSE crisis. The Bill provides discretion about whether that factual information should be released. The code, the White Paper and the Select Committee all state that the factual information should be released, even if discretion applies to the formulation of policy.
<P>
On balance, the Select Committee is right, and the Bill should be amended. We think that clause 33 should be more extensively changed to give it a contents exemption basis, rather than a class exemption basis. The exemption would apply only subject to a harm test. At this juncture, as the Committee is considering clause 13, subsection (5) of which is so directly related to clause 33, we needed to raise the matter that I have set out. We shall review our attitude to clause 33 when the Minister has responded.
<P>
Clause 13(5) makes a good attempt to redress some of the concerns that have been expressed, but we do not believe that it goes far enough. Clause 33 needs to be amended. Our current view is that either factual information should be excluded—amendment No. 4 would have that effect, although its wording may not be perfect—or clause 33 should be amended so that its current exemption procedure is replaced with a contents-based exemption procedure.
<P>
I hope that I have made the Opposition's views clear. We look forward to the Under-Secretary's response.

<P>

<B>Mr. David Heath:</B> Amendment No. 97, which stands in my name and that of my right hon. Friend the Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross, does not refer to clause 13—it relates only to clause 33—but it has been grouped with amendment No. 3 so we must discuss it now.
<P>
In this context, the hon. Member for Ryedale and the Liberal Democrats are working in the same direction. I do not fault his amendment, but it is in the nature of things that I should prefer amendment No. 97. I shall not repeat his arguments about the apparent contradiction between the Bill and similar provisions that are contained in the open government code and in the White Paper.
<P>
I am sure that at least one Committee member will recognise amendment No. 97—it contains a provision that first appeared in 1992 in the Right to Know Bill, with which the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central was intimately connected. It also appeared in the same year in the Right to Information Bill, which was introduced by the Labour party when it was in opposition. That Bill was co-sponsored by the then leader of the Labour party and his deputy. We are moving with the grain of Labour party policy as it was articulated in 1992. It is important to explore why that policy appears to have changed since then.
<P>
The amendment's phrasing is not revolutionary—it has appeared in previous freedom of information legislation, and it appears to be doing a good job in various legislatures. I hope that the Under-Secretary will not argue that the amendment cannot be agreed to because its exemptions would paralyse government. They would clearly not do so—such exemptions are already in operation in many Commonwealth countries that have freedom of information laws.
<P>
The amendment would bring us more closely into line with proposals that were advanced by the Scottish Executive in a consultation paper outlining a Scottish freedom of information Bill. When we discussed the Bill's broad nature in our first sitting I said that I wanted to learn from the approach of the Scottish Executive and to ensure that the Bill will not be deficient in comparison with legislation that will come before the Scottish Parliament in due course.
<P>
I do not believe that there are sound reasons for exempting the factual information or basic analysis specified in amendment No. 97. The Under-Secretary will have to go some way to convince me that those items should be exempt from the Bill, and we shall certainly want to return to the matter, either when we reach clause 33 or later.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Amendments Nos. 3 and 4 would make factual information, that has been used or is intended to be used to provide an informed background to decision-making, subject to disclosure under the rights of access that clause 1 confers, by removing it from the class exemption for the formulation of Government policy. Such information might remain exempt under clause 34. Amendment No. 97 would remove from clauses 33 and 34 factual information, analysis and evaluation of and projections based on factual information, and expert advice in general.
<P>
The Government expect that factual and background information will usually be disclosed when policy decisions are announced. It was to reinforce that expectation that the Government included in clause 13 a requirement for Government Departments to consider the disclosure of such information. The Government are satisfied that the Bill achieves the amendments' objectives. Nevertheless, we have noted the views expressed in relation to the matter, and we shall continue to consider the points that have been made in Committee. We shall examine the matter and will reach a conclusion in due course.
<P>
It is not generally understood that the background information on which most Ministers make decisions is already in the public arena. The idea that Ministers have access to a reservoir of confidential statistical information, for example, to which the public have no access, is, by and large, a fallacy. Admittedly, some information relating to national security, for example, may not be publicly available, or may be available to Ministers before becoming publicly available, but at some point most of the information on which Ministers make decisions is in the public arena.
<P>
It is not true that, as the hon. Member for Ryedale suggests, clause 33 prevents the disclosure of factual information. Although factual information relating to Government policies falls within the class of exemption, clause 13 applies, which will ensure that all factual information will be released when it is in the public interest so to do. Nothing in the Bill will prevent the disclosure of any information.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I hear what the Under-Secretary says, but subsection (5) does not provide a sufficiently strong impetus for the release of such information. It merely refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the desirability of communicating to the applicant factual information''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That does not seem sufficiently strong to provide the presumption that factual information will be released to meet what the Under-Secretary says is the Government's expectation. We should like that to be strengthened.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I hear what the hon. Gentleman says. I shall consider those points and bear them in mind as we conclude our deliberations.
<P>
The hon. Member for Somerton and Frome referred to the Scottish proposals, which do not include a tribunal: the route of appeal is an internal or judicial review. The UK Bill provides for a tribunal as an important part of the appeals process. The Scottish proposals do not relate to public records, whereas the UK Bill provides a unified regime for current and historical records. It is important that the grounds for withholding records after 30 years are included in legislation. In the Scottish proposals, an exemption seems to have been provided for research, statistics and analysis, but there is no such exemption in the UK Bill. The coverage in the Scottish Bill is not as wide as that in the UK Bill in many ways. For example, the Scottish Bill would exclude GPs from the freedom of information legislation.
<P>
Let us see what happens. All we have are the Scottish proposals, and it is not always helpful to compare policy proposals. Let us not reach some sort of fanciful conclusion. It would not be true to conclude that the Scottish proposals are necessarily better than the UK proposals. The Scottish Committee that deals with the matter will no doubt find that the transition from principles to legislation is difficult, as it is for any legislation.
<P>
The Scottish proposals say that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the use of the term substantial prejudice may not of course suit every circumstance and the wording of individual exemptions may need to be tailored to the specific subject matter at hand''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We shall have to wait and see what that means, and see what tailored harm tests look like before anyone can claim that the Scottish regime will be more open than the UK regime. Let us not crow until the circumstances are clearer. I contend that the Bill is good, as is the way in which we are approaching it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for his response, which was slightly more encouraging than his response to the previous amendment.
<P>
Perhaps I can sum up the situation. The Under-Secretary has twice acknowledged to the Committee that he recognises concern about the drafting and the interaction of some of the clauses. I dare say that he has raised an expectation that the Government are likely to introduce some fresh thinking on clauses 13 and 33. A relatively minor amendment may have a profound effect, or we may see some substantial redrafting.
<P>
<B>Mr O'Brien:</B> The new Labour Government always introduce invigorating and fresh thinking, but sometimes the hopes of the Opposition are dashed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> The Under-Secretary has anticipated my next comment. If the hopes of the Opposition are dashed, the hopes and expectations of many of his hon. Friends will equally be dashed. I have tried hard to take a constructive approach in this Committee and not to use the inflammatory language of confrontation, but I want to end by warning the Under-Secretary. The elements that I have touched on in the past two debates are linked to the purposes issue, and so deal with three of the big four matters that I said that we had to explore in Committee. Unless there is some change in the arrangements by Report, such widespread anxiety leads me to expect that the Government will rightly have rebellion in their ranks.
<P>
In view of what the Under-Secretary said and the acknowledgement that he made, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath:</B> I beg to move amendment No.80, in page 8, line 1, leave out from `made' to end of line 2 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`promptly and in any event not later than the twentieth working day following the date of receipt; and in this section `date of receipt' has the same meaning as in section 9(5).'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Bill, rather curiously, requires a two-stage process of decision making about exemptions. The authority must decide whether information is exempt before taking a separate decision on whether it wishes to apply its discretion to disclose that exempt information. What is curious is not that that should be a two-stage process, but that it should operate on two different time scales. The first decision is required to be made within 20 working days, while the rather feeble provision in clause 13(6) requires that the second decision be made
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``within such time as is reasonable in the circumstances.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Of course, what is reasonable in the circumstances can be determined only by the courts, but it will be very hard to establish a test of reasonableness.
<P>
<H5>7.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
We can find no other freedom of information legislation that incorporates a similar double time scale, although perhaps the Under-Secretary knows of examples. There seems no sensible reason why there should not be synchronicity between the two areas of determination so that an authority is required in the same time scale first to determine whether the information is exempt and then to apply its discretion about whether to disclose it. Thus, the amendment proposes simply that 20 working days should be the same period for both decisions. That would provide certainty for the applicant and direction to the authority and it would improve the Bill.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Amendment No. 80 would require an authority to make a decision on discretionary disclosure under clause 13 within 20 working days of the date of receipt of the application. The same period is allowed for decisions under clause 1(1). The Bill currently allows an authority up to 20 working days to reach a decision under clause 1(1)—that is, to decide whether the information requested is exempt. After the authority has made that decision, clause 13 requires it to make a further decision on whether to exercise its discretion to disclose, taking into account all the circumstances of the case and the desirability of communicating exempt information to the applicant when the public interest in disclosure outweighs the public interest in maintaining the exemption.
<P>
Clause 13(6) requires that that second decision is made
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``within such time as is reasonable in the circumstances.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There are good reasons for not specifying a fixed time limit for those decisions. First, it is important to note that two distinct steps are involved. In taking a decision under clause 13, an authority must already have determined that the information was exempt. While that decision must be made promptly, it could take the full 20 days that the Bill allows. We would not expect that usually to be the case, but it is conceivable. The authority may, for example, wish to consult those to whom the information relates or those who would be likely to be affected by disclosure. The Secretary of State's code of practice under clause 44 will contain guidance for authorities on such consultation.
<P>
The amendment would leave no time for further discussion on a decision under clause 13, which requires an authority to take all the circumstances of the case into account in balancing the public interest. Such a decision may be far more complex than the original decision on whether the information was exempt. It is impossible to specify a time limit for the taking of such decisions because much would depend on the circumstances of each case.
<P>
However, the Bill provides that the decision must be taken within a reasonable period in the circumstances. We have already discussed the concept of reasonableness—it is well known in law and provides safeguards. The amendment would disadvantage not only authorities, by imposing an impractical time limit on them, but also applicants and others affected by disclosure, by causing decisions on the public interest to be taken hastily and sometimes to the disadvantage of the applicant. If time is short, authorities may be more likely to withhold information than to disclose it on the basis that when a matter has not been properly considered, it is better to be safe than sorry. On the other hand, authorities may decide not to consult those affected by disclosure on the basis that it would take too long. For this reason, clause 13(6) provides for a decision to be taken within a reasonable time, to ensure that decisions can be taken soundly. I recognise the concern behind the amendment, but, to prevent authorities from stalling, the Bill gives the Information Commissioner power to issue an enforcement notice under clause 52(2) requiring the authority to make a decision in accordance with clause 13 within a time set out in the notice. Therefore, safeguards are already in the Bill and that is a far more practical and realistic approach. On that basis, I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> I am not remotely convinced by what the Under-Secretary said. He gave us all the reasons why he felt that—or the advice given to him—the amendment would be impossible, impractical or disadvantageous. No such considerations apply to any other freedom of information legislation, under which such a measure is not impossible, impractical nor disadvantageous. They do not apply to the code of open government, where all harm-tested exemptions are subject to the code's public interest test in a single test after which applicants are notified.
<P>
Potentially a real problem arises—the uncertainty for the applicant who, having been advised that the material is exempt, must wait for an indefinite unspecified period to know what an authority has decided. That complicates the procedure of appeal to the commissioner but would be of no great benefit. We think that the Minister is wrong and that the matter will have to be debated again. However, in the circumstances of this evening's sitting, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
