						</b> On a point of order,
Mr. Atkinson. Good morning to you and to the
Committee.</div>
					<a name="07012352000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">It might
help the Committee if I expand upon whatI said in our previous
sitting on amendment No. 30. Members of the Committee will remember
that it would have added contracted-out prisons to the list of
establishments to which the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006
applies. The hon. Member for Cheadle, who moved the amendment, was
concerned that people undertaking activities relating to children in
contracted-out establishments should be subject to the relevant
requirements of that Act. Having been made aware of that concern, I
asked my officials to look into the matter.</div>
					<a name="07012352000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that the Committee will
be reassured by paragraph (3)(1) of schedule 4 to the 2006 Act, which
lists the types of establishments to which the Act&#146;s safeguards
apply. Included on the list in sub-paragraph (d)
is</div>
					<a name="07012352000270"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;an institution which
is exclusively or mainly for the detention of
children&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07012352000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">That will mean
that employees of all prisons, young offenders institutions and secure
training centres, whether publicly or privately run, will be covered. I
hope that the Committee finds that clarification helpful, particularly
given the scope of clauses 11 to 15, all of which can at least in
theory apply to institutions in which children are
held.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
Edward Garnier</b> (Harborough) (Con): I want, if I may, to
highlight my concerns about the importation and use of controlled drugs
in the prison estate. Drugs must feature heavily in any discussion of
prison policy, not only because they are responsible for bringing the
majority of offenders into prison but because they present apparently
intractable problems inside. They also prevent successful resettlement
and rehabilitation after
release.</div>
					<a name="07012352000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">As we
understand it, the main cause of crime is drugs, followed closely by
alcohol. The number of people beginning a prison sentence for drugs
offences has more than doubled in the past 10 years from 3,483 to 7,153
each year. At the end of December 2005,17 per cent. of male
sentenced prisoners and 35 per cent. of female sentenced prisoners had
been convicted of drugs offences, by far the largest proportion
convicted of any offence. Furthermore, the problem is getting worse. In
1995, drug offences accounted for only 10 per cent. of male sentenced
prisoners and27 per cent. of the sentenced female prison
population.</div>
					<a name="07012352000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
figures are still misleadingly small: a much larger group of prisoners
have committed an offence that is in some way drugs-related. Some 55
per cent. of prisoners report having committed offences connected to
their drug taking, with the need for money to buy drugs being the most
commonly cited factor. A study for the Home Office found that 73 per
cent. of respondents had taken an illegal drug in the year before
entering prison.</div>
					<a name="07012352000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of
course, drug use does not stop on entry into prison. Little or nothing
is done on the inside to cure addictions. There are things called
drug-free wings on prison, a concept that I find extraordinary. The
situation is regrettable and, in a speech provided as evidence to the
all-party group for abuse investigations, the Lord Chief Justice, Lord
Phillips, said:</div>
					<a name="07012352000271"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Drug treatment is an
essential step to rehabilitation in the case of many
offenders.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07012352000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of
course, efforts are being and have been made to improve the situation.
Prisoners are subject to random mandatory drug tests and, in 2003-04,
many morethan 53,000 people entered drug detoxification
programmes&#151;nearly double the target of 27,000 entrants by April
2004. Nevertheless, use among prisoners remains high and the situation
unsatisfactory. A recent Home Office study found that 40 per cent. of
prisoners had used drugs at least once while in their current prison,
25 per cent. in the past month and16 per cent. in the past
week. The problem is particularly acute among women prisoners, of whom
it is estimated that two thirds have a drug problem. Total eradication
might be unrealistic, but we ought to be doing much better than we
are.</div>
					<a name="07012352000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">If clause 17 and
other parts relating to controlled drugs improve the situation, I will
be happy to applaud them. However, I am concerned that the
proposalis just another headline to be deployed by the
Government to show that they are doing something about the use of
illegal drugs in prison and that nothing more will happen. I would like
to use this stand part debate to urge the Government to get a grip. I
appreciate that they are doing something, but they need to do a lot
more about the scourge of drug use in our prisons.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column188" />Column number: 189</div>
					<a name="07012352000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">We face a terrible problem. As I
pointed out a moment ago, drugs are the root cause of much of the crime
that leads to people going to prison, but there are pressures on those
outside to import drugs to those inside. Numerically, the numbers are
small, but some prison officers, particularly those in big city
prisons, are under tremendous pressure from drug gangs or barons to
import drugs into prison. People will approach them, either in prison
or outside, and tell them that their home address is known, as well as
that of their children&#146;s school and their wife&#146;s,
husband&#146;s or partner&#146;s work place, and that it would be a
sensible idea if they delivered drugs to a customer inside
prison.</div>
					<a name="07012352000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">We also know
that prison officers&#151;certainly the rank and file&#151;are not
terribly well paid and, therefore, must be very tempted by offers of
large sums of money to import drugs into prison. We can tackle that in
a number of ways. For instance, we could enhance the professionalism of
prisoner officers&#146; careers, and give them better training and
more self-esteem in order to prevent that very small number of officers
from being tempted or pressured into bringing drugs into prison and to
take a better course of action.</div>
					<a name="07012352000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clearly, most of clause 17 is
common sense and brings up to date the criminal law relating to the
conveyance of prohibited articles into or out of prison. I shall stop
there and trust that the Government will do rather more than just pass
a law and that they will provide greater support to the Prison Service,
the police and prison officers so that the scourge of drug taking and
dealing, and the resultant high reoffending rate, can be dealt with
coherently and
effectively.</div>
					
					<a name="07012352000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07012352000311"></a>Mr.
Sutcliffe:
						</b> I thank the hon. and learned Gentleman for
raising an important issue about the use of drugs in prison. He is
quite right to point out that clause 17 will modernise parts of the
Prison Act 1952 dealing with prison security. Clauses 16 to 19 deal
with illicit articles. He moved on to a wider point about drug taking
and I agree with him&#151;it is a major problem that cannot be
treated cosmetically. We must get to the heart of the problem. That is
why I am pleased that mandatory drug testing, which is considered the
most accurate assessment of drug use, is showing the lowest levels of
drug use since 1997. However, our ability to detect drugs pushes up the
figures on drug
use.</div>
					<a name="07012352000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">We must deal with
the problems that people have regarding drug use but, as the hon. and
learned Gentleman said, we must also determine what we can do to stop
the smuggling of drugs and mobile phones into prisons. The clauses deal
with stopping that
smuggling.</div>
					<a name="07012352000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
and learned Gentleman raises many issues. He has also asked a number of
parliamentary questions on drugs, which I have answered. I am sure that
we will return to that in future. Clause 17 replaces the existing
section 40 of the Prison Act 1952, with new sections 40A, 40B and 40C.
The purpose of the clause is to update, clarify and refine the existing
provisions, and to create new offences that address the development of
new technology such as mobile phones.
</div>
					<a name="07012352000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">When the 1952 Act was
taken through Parliament, the primary focus of illicit smuggling into
and out of prisons was alcohol and tobacco. As the hon. and learned
Gentleman says, these days drugs present a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column189" />Column number: 190</div>major problem and their illicit use within prisons is assisted by the
use of mobile phones. Although the Prison Service is taking forward a
series of measures to tackle those important issues, it is essential
that the relevant legislation is also brought up to date to recognise
and reflect the prohibited items that are of key interest
now.</div>
					<a name="07012352000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
offers greater clarity, breaking down the prohibited items into three
bands that are grouped according to their seriousness; the maximum
penalty for each band is also graduated according to seriousness. The
most serious items of drugs, explosives, firearms or other offensive
weapons are set out in list A in new section 40A(2). New section 40B
makes it an offence to convey articles in list A into or out of prison
without authorisation. The maximum penalty for committing such an
offence will be10 years&#146; imprisonment, a fine, or both.
That sends a clear message that we will not tolerate illegal operations
in prisons that threaten or undermine the security of the prison,
prisoners, staff and ultimately the public. The availability of a
severe maximum penalty will help to deter visitors from making casual
attempts to smuggle drugs into
prisons.</div>
					
					<a name="07012352000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07012352000312"></a>
							<b class="B">James
Brokenshire</b> (Hornchurch) (Con): Will the Minister comment
on the inclusion of mobile phones in list B, rather than list A, given
the increasing problem of mobile phones being smuggled into prison?
They are often concealed, for example, within laptops that are used in
the preparation of legal cases. Such smuggling may pose a risk in terms
of public threats, including terrorism and other issues; if criminals
are able to contact the outside world using mobile phones while they
are in prison, that would seem to be quite an important issue to
address.</div>
					
					<a name="07012352000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07012352000313"></a>Mr.
Sutcliffe:
						</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for raising
that point, and I hope I will address it to his satisfaction
shortly.</div>
					<a name="07012352000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was
discussing the need for the maximum penalty to be increased, as it had
not been raised since 1952. It is an anomaly that smuggling alcohol and
tobacco should be subject to a more severe penalty than the penalty for
smuggling drugs or firearms, unless the drugs or firearms are directly
associated with assisting an escape.</div>
					<a name="07012352000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the hon. Gentleman said, the
clause also addresses the problems caused to the security of our
prisons by new technology. It does so by creating new offences of
taking mobile phones, sound recording devices or cameras into and out
of prison. Those prohibited items are set out in list B of new section
40A(3). New section 40C makes it an offence to convey those items into
or out of prison without authorisation. As he said, mobile phones
present a particular threat to the security of our prisons, and they
can enable prisoners to continue their illegal activities and aid the
supply of drugs.</div>
					<a name="07012352000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">Cameras and sound recording
devices can also threaten the security of prisons. Pictures taken
inside prisons can compromise security, and potentially aid escape. At
the same time, new section 40C(4) provides a public interest defence
for an offence committed under new section 40C; it maintains the right
to bring to the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column190" />Column number: 191</div>attention of a court a serious failure of a prison, such as the abuse of
prisoners. Finally, a list C item is any item described as such by
prison rules, and is subject to a maximum penalty of a &#163;1,000
fine.</div>
					<a name="07012352000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">We consider the
revision of section 40 of the 1952 Act to be sensible and reasonable.
It addresses the issues raised by new technology and will provide the
Prison Service with strong legislative support in its efforts to
prevent illegal activities inside prisons.</div>
					<a name="07012352000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Hornchurch
is right to raise the issue of mobile phones; it will always be kept
under consideration, because of the related security issues. We believe
that it is right that mobile phones are on list B at this time, to
reflect the serious nature of the problem. We do not think mobile
phones are as big an issue as drugs are at the moment for the reason
that the hon. and learned Member for Harborough pointed out, but we
will keep them under
consideration.</div>

							<a name="07012352000314"></a>James
Brokenshire:
						</b> I am grateful that the Minister will keep the
issue under review, because mobile telephone technology is moving on,
and the size of the equipment needed and the ability to break it down
are becoming more of an issue for the Prison Service. I seek the
Minister&#146;s assurance that there will be regular monitoring,
given the ability to conceal parts within laptops and other pieces of
equipment that now go through and are much more difficult to screen.
The problem is particularly serious in view of of the terrorist threat
that this country continues to
face.</div>
					
					<a name="07012352000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07012352000315"></a>Mr.
Sutcliffe:
						</b> Prison security is always kept under review,
particularly in respect of the more serious, category A prisoners. The
distinction I wish to make is that list A articles are illegal outside
prison as well as inside, whereas mobile telephones are on list B to
reflect the seriousness of the problem that they cause inside prison.
That does not negate what the hon. Member for Hornchurch says:
certainly we have to keep reviewing security. As the Under-Secretary of
State for the Home Department, my hon. Friend the Member for Gedling,
who is sitting to my right, said, our aim is always to have a balance
between the issues we face, and mobile telephones are not equivalent
to, say, explosives. I thank my hon. Friend for that point. With that
clarification, I hope that the Committee will accept the
clause.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column191" />Column number: 192</div>
						ill inside prison. I started the debate last week,
but the matter is perhaps more appropriately dealt with under clause
20.</div>
					<a name="07012352000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under clause
20(1), the Prison Act 1952 is amended where section 7(1) makes
appointing a medical officer for each prison a requirement. That
provision will now be omitted. I can understand the policy, because now
health services are provided within prison by the national health
service through the local primary care trust. Patients in prison are on
the list of a local GP practice, or covered by some other arrangement
made by the PCT, so a dedicated prison doctor is no longer necessary.
However, if we are not to have a dedicated prison doctor, we must
surely have proper facilities for the treatment of the mentally
ill.</div>
					<a name="07012352000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">The problem
cannot be just brushed under the carpet. Lord Phillips, the Lord Chief
Justice, speaking to the all-party parliamentary group on substance
abuse in March 2006 in this building,
said:</div>
					<a name="07012352000272"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Many
actual or potential criminals are dangerous because they suffer from
personality disorders or other mental conditions which can be diagnosed
as illnesses. Prison is not the best place to detain those who are
mentally
disordered.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07012352000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">Sadly,
however, all sorts of people with mental disorders are sent to prison,
partly because the national health service no longer has provision for
residential care of the mentally ill, which, in fairness, partly flows
from the failure of the care in the community systemto cope
with many of the people who have mental illnesses. A number of people
who live rough or commit crimes of violence are mentally ill. They may
be mentally ill because they have a mental problem that has occurred
naturally, or the balance of their mind has been affected by drugs. It
does not matter why they are ill, however; what is important is that
once diagnosed, they receive the appropriate treatment. It is
regrettable that prisons are used&#151;I say this not only as a
politician but as a Crown court recorder&#151;as adjuncts to the
national health
service.</div>
					<a name="07012352000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">Mental health
problems are worryingly prevalent among those entering prison: 72 per
cent. of males and 74 per cent. of females in prison suffer from two or
more mental disorders, compared to only 5 per cent and 2 per cent.
respectively of the general population. What is more, 20 per cent. of
men and almost 40 per cent. of women entering custody say that they
have attempted suicide. In the past decade, one prisoner has committed
suicide every four days.</div>
					<a name="07012352000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is no point in saying
that mentally ill offenders would be better managed outside prison and
would be better off if they never entered prison in the first place.
That is uncontroversial and has been stated by Anne Owers, the chief
inspector of prisons. Her estimate, based on visits to prisons, is that
41 per cent. of prisoners held in health care centres should be in
secure national health service accommodation. The Lord Chief Justice
agrees. In relation to prisoners suffering from mental disorders, he
says that</div>
					<a name="07012352000273"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;many of these
would be better detained in mental
hospitals.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07012352000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">Treatment
of the mentally ill in prisons is far from ideal. I appreciate that the
ordinary prison officers who do the health work in prisons do their
best, but they are not trained to deal with mentally ill people. As a
result of overcrowding in prisons and the insufficient number of prison
officers looking after prisoners, particularly at weekends, the
mentally ill are left in their cells instead of being given appropriate
treatment.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column192" />Column number: 193</div>
					<a name="07012352000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are mental health in-reach
teams in 102 prisons, but at any one time there are likely to be at
least 40 prisoners who, having already been assessed, must wait three
months or longer before being transferred to hospital. Many more have a
long wait before an assessment takes place.</div>
					<a name="07012352000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">Far from helping to cure mental
health problems, the environment and the regime of prison seem likely
to exacerbate them. Research has shown that 28 per cent. of male
sentenced prisoners with evidence of psychosis reported spending 23
hours or longer in their cells each day&#151;more than twice the
proportion of those without mental health problems who spend that
length of time in their cells. Suicide attempts and incidents of
self-harm are frighteningly high. Nearly a third of women in prison
injure themselves an average of five times, and 6 per cent. of men do
so twice.</div>
					<a name="07012352000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">Jonathan
Aitken, who involuntarily became something of an expert on prisons, has
written this about his time in
prison:</div>
					<a name="07012352000274"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;On the
wing, there was plenty of evidence of behaviour brought on by mental
distress...one young man only ever wore the same pair of jeans and
a green nylon cagoule. He never wore shoes or socks, never went out on
exercise, hardly ever spoke to anyone and was understood to have been
taken advantage of sexually by predatory prisoners...Another had a
habit of inserting objects into his body: a pencil in an arm,
matchsticks in his
ankle.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07012352000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">The conclusion
that he drew, and that I draw, is that prison does little to address
the many and severe mental health problems of its inmates. That has
consequences for the resettlement needs of released prisoners with
mental health problems, because those needs are not being identified or
met. Some 96 per cent. of mentally disordered prisoners, including 80
per cent. of those who have committed the most serious offences, are
put back into the community without supported housing. More than three
quarters are given no appointment with outside mental health experts or
carers. According to the Government&#146;s social exclusion unit,
more than 50 prisoners every year commit suicide shortly after
release.</div>
					<a name="07012352000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">Hidden
behind the apparently uncontroversial clause is an enormous problem
that is getting worse and needs to be tackled. If the Government are
not to have a dedicated medical health officer in every prison because
of the new arrangements with PCTs, it is incumbent upon them to ensure
that there is, not merely some mental illness care, but more than
adequate mental illness care for people going into prison, those in
prison and those coming out of prison. I do not attach personal blame
to the Minister, but the Government can no longer say, &#147;Well,
this is something we have inherited.&#148; They have been in office
for 10 years. I look forward to some words of reassurance from the
Minister.</div>
					<a name="07012352000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 20(3)
makes ineffective section 17 of the Prison Act 1952, which bans painful
tests carried out by medical officers on prisoners in order to detect
malingering or for other purposes. Why is a painful test for any
purpose necessary? Will the Minister explain precisely what is the
purpose of removing section 17, and therefore the ban on such tests,
and say what will happen instead? I cannot believe that any humane
medical officer would deliberately hurt anyone, although some
investigations clearly require discomfort 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column193" />Column number: 194</div>to be inflicted on a patient. I look forward to hearing the
Minister&#146;s explanation of clause 20(3) and ofthe
removal of obligations under section 28(5) of the 1952
Act.</div>
					
					<a name="07012352000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07012352000317"></a>Mr.
Sutcliffe:
						</b> I shall deal first with the reality of the
clause and how it affects the Bill and then return tothe hon.
and learned Gentleman&#146;s concerns about mental health provision
and to the wider debate about mental health
issues.</div>
					<a name="07012352000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
removes the requirement for prisonsto appoint a medical
officer. The role of the medical officer in prisons is long outdated;
its creation in legislation reflected the custom and practice in
prisons long before the creation of the national health service and
before the Prisons Act 1952 in which it appeared was passed. It
represents the old way of providing health services to
prisoners.</div>
					<a name="07012352000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">With the
recent transfer of responsibility for prison health services in public
sector prisons to the national health service, the great majority of
prison health services are now delivered under the general provisions
of the National Health Service Act 1977. Local primary care trusts now
commission those services and the continued existence of the prison
medical officer is at odds with the modern national health
service.</div>
					<a name="07012352000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">When it was
first implemented, the medical officer role represented a mix of
managerial, practical and clinical duties, some of which we would now
view as inappropriate for a clinician. Over the years, the role has in
practice evolved considerably to keep pace with the modernisation of
the service. It has moved from the tradition of the person with that
role being an officer of the prison towards a more appropriate role,
equivalent to that of a community
GP.</div>
					<a name="07012352000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">The removal of the
medical officer role servesto support the significant
improvement and modernisation of prison health services that has taken
place in recent years. It also reflects the enormous cultural change
that needed to take place in prisons to effect those changes. The
clause removes outdated, unhelpful terminology that acted as a barrier
to the delivery of practical and cultural change in prison health
services. The change ensures that the future of the prison health
service is within the NHS, with health services provided via the 1977
Act, in line with services for the rest of the population. That is the
reasoning behind the clause, which hon. Members will understand in
relation to the purposes of the Bill.</div>
					<a name="07012352000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">Rightly, and understandably,
the hon. and learned Gentleman raised the issue of mental health
problems in prisons. I agree with him that there are people in prison
with mental health problems who do not need to be there and we should
make every effort to ensure that their needs are
addressed.</div>
					
					<a name="07012352000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07012352000318"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Robert Flello</b> (Stoke-on-Trent, South) (Lab): Will the
Minister give me reassurance and comfort that the flexibilities in the
Bill will allow some of the superb work with people who have mental
health problems that is carried out by the not-for-profit sector in an
almost non-statutory, much more easily approachable manner, to be
developed and applied in the Prison
Service?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07012352000319"></a>Mr.
Sutcliffe:
						</b> Very much so. I am grateful to my hon. Friend
for pointing out the role of the not-for-profit sector and I would hope
to see that work not only continue but develop in the way that he
outlined. The hon. and learned Member for Harborough said that prison
officers were not trained in mental health awareness. He is wrong. We
have invested close to &#163;500,000 in training 9,000 prison
officers in mental health awareness, so there are prison officers with
the skills. Clause 20 does not affect the current ability of prison
officers to develop health and safety training and to look at how they
deal with a situation. It does not affect the chain of command if there
is an attempted suicide and the medical officer needs to be called. The
procedures are all in place.</div>
					<a name="07012352000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. and learned Gentleman
concentrated on the role of the Prison Service in relation to mental
health problems. He will know, because he deals with some of the issues
in his other role, that the disposal of people with mental health
problems who have committed an offence is a matter for the courts. So
the courts have a major role to play when they receive the reports on
individual
cases.</div>
					
					<a name="07012352000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07012352000320"></a>Mr.
Garnier:
						</b> Of course the Minister is right, but the problem
is that there is a difference between being in such a mental state that
one needs to be sectioned and placed in a secure hospital and being
mentally ill but still short of needing to be sectioned. Many courts
frequently have to send to prison people who are not, if I may loosely
use the expression, &#147;McNaghten mad&#148;, but who are none the
less not well. While it would be better and preferable to send those
people whom I loosely described as not being well into the national
health system, there is not room or there are not the beds
available.</div>
					<a name="07012352000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
goodness&#146; sake, there are not even spaces for mentally ill
people who do not commit crimes; we know that as constituency Members
of Parliament. When we send people to prison, we have to do so
irrespective of our private wish that they could go somewhere else. As
a judge, one has to do what the law requires one to do. Once they get
to prison, the judge has no say over how the individual is cared for,
and if there is an absence of proper care there is nothing that the
judge can do about it.</div>
					
					<a name="07012352000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07012352000321"></a>Mr.
Sutcliffe:
						</b> I am grateful to the hon. and learned
Gentleman, who brings to the Committee experience of the role of a
judge. I am not making the case that it is all down to the courts, but
there is a role for the courts to play in terms of some of the
diversion schemes that have been put in place for mental health
assessments to be undertaken so that the courts can be provided with
information about an offender&#146;s mental condition and any
treatment that may be appropriate. I take the point that it does not
meet all circumstances and some of the needs may not be apparent at
that court process.</div>
					<a name="07012352000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am not labouring the point and saying that it is all down to the courts
and it is no one else&#146;s responsibility, because clearly it is a
responsibility and we have as a Government tried to make significant
improvements to the mental health services available within prisons
through the development of the new NHS mental 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column195" />Column number: 196</div>health in-reach services, which are backed up by an investment of more
than &#163;20 million a year. As the hon. and learned Gentleman says,
there are in-reach teams in 102 prisons, including 60 staff now in
post. They ensure that mentally ill prisoners are assessed as too ill
to remain in prison so that they can be transferred to a hospital
setting appropriate to their care and security under the requirements
of the Mental Health Act.</div>
					<a name="07012352000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">In 2005, 24 per cent. more
prisoners with mental illness too severe for them to be in prison were
transferred to hospital than in 2002. The figures were up to 896 from
722. There has also been a decrease in the number of people waiting
more than 12 weeks for a transfer to hospital. In the quarter ending
June 2006, 44 prisoners were waiting, down from 62 in the same quarter
in 2005, so we are showing a significant improvement. We are also
running pilots that explore the possibility of reducing the 12-week
waiting standard to just 14 days.</div>
					<a name="07012352000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. and learned Gentleman
asked about prevention of suicide and self-harm. Suicide rates in
prison remain higher than in the general population, although they have
declined. Some 78 apparently self-inflicted deaths occurred in 2005, 95
in 2004 and94 in 2003. That must be put in the context of the
number of individuals passing through the prison system each
year&#151;more than 130,000. Every death in prison is a terrible
tragedy affecting families, staff and other prisoners deeply.
Ministers, the National Offender Management Service and the Prison
Service are committed to reducing the number of such tragic incidents.
I am a member of a group of stakeholders looking at ways in which we
can do
that.</div>
					<a name="07012352000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">Self-inflicted
deaths in custody are subject to highly random and large cyclical
swings. The most reliable measure is the three-year rolling average.
From 2003-04 to 2005-6, that stood at 121 deaths per 100,000 prisoners,
which reflects the stabilisation of the figures over recent years. The
Safer Custody Group, whichI reported on earlier, works with
the prison andhealth services, and a variety of agencies,
looking at assessment, care in custody and
teamwork&#151;ACCT&#151;to help at-risk prisoners. ACCT will be
extended to all prisons in
2007.</div>
					<a name="07012352000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. and
learned Gentleman asked also about what we were doing for people with
mental health problems when they leave prison. Continued treatment in
the community is vital for such people and in February 2006 the Home
Office launched a five-year strategy for protecting the public and
reducing reoffending. That contains a commitment to look at ways in
which offenders receive effective mental health treatment, whether in
prison, hospital or the community. Offenders identified as having
severe or enduring mental health problems are subject to the care
programme approach during their stay in prison and on
release.</div>
					<a name="07012352000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. and
learned Gentleman is quite right. This is not a party political issue.
He will accept that there have been mistakes with care in the community
and that the past 10 years have seen improvements. However, we need to
go further. During the short time that I have been in my post, I have
been concerned about mental health problems in prison, particularly
among young offenders. A great deal more needs to be, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column196" />Column number: 197</div>and can be done. I am working with health Ministers to improve the
situation and the Committee will be aware of the improvements in the
Mental Health Bill, which is going through the
Lords.</div>
					<a name="07012352000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">Mental health
is an important issue, not only for the Committee, but for those
tackling reoffending and looking at a range of health needs. The hon.
and learned Gentleman talked about the number of women in prison with
mental health problems. I saw that first hand on a visit to Holloway.
It was distressing to see some people who could have been dealt with in
another way and I look forward to Baroness Corston&#146;s report on
vulnerable women, which will come out soon. He referred to subsection
(3), which repeals the &#147;painful tests&#148; provisions in the
Prison Act. If he requires more details on that, I shall be happy to
write to him and to the Committee. However, with that explanation
ofthe Government&#146;s policy on mental health and the
particular issues relating to clause 20, I hope that the Committee will
support
it.</div>

						<b class="B"> </b>Allegedly. It is a very valuable
compendium of sentencing powers and the forms of words that judges are
recommended to speak when sentencing an individual. I do not want to go
through all of that. I simply want to point out to the Minister that
the whole sentencing regime, as created by this Government over the
past 10 years, is incredibly complicated. It does not make clear to the
defendant the sentence they will get and it does not make it clear to
the public, and more particularly the victim of the offence, what the
defendant is about to receive.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column197" />Column number: 198</div>
					<a name="07012352000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us look at several headings
which relate to sentences for defendants aged under 18 on conviction.
For custodial sentences, we have detention and training orders. We have
detention under section 91 of the Powers of the Criminal Court
Sentencing Act 2000 for less than 12 months or for 12 months or more.
We have a required minimum sentence of detention under the Firearms Act
1968. We have an extended sentence of detention under the Criminal
Justice Act 2003. We have detention for public protection under the
Criminal Justice Act 2003 and we have detention for life under the
Criminal Justice Act 2003.</div>
					<a name="07012352000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Under
non-custodial sentences, we have youth community orders of a general
nature. There are curfew orders, exclusion orders, attendance centre
orders, supervision orders, action plan orders, community
rehabilitation orders, community punishment orders, community
punishment and rehabilitation orders and drug treatment and testing
orders. That is as of January 2006. No doubt it has changed several
times since then. Do not worry&#151;I am sure that I will be on a
Judicial Studies Board course to correct any mistakes that I have made
before very long.</div>
					<a name="07012352000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
detention orders early release aspect of this is complicated. It is
complicated even more by the context in which one has to understand it.
The purpose of my amendment is to get the Minister publicly to explain
precisely what is intended by clause 24 and how it fits into common
sense and honesty in sentencing.</div>
					
					<a name="07012352000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07012352000327"></a>Mr.
Sutcliffe:
						</b> The hon. and Learned Gentleman makes a wider
point again about sentencing policy and the advice that is given. He
will be aware that the Home Secretary announced in July that we were
looking at all of this and that there is a consultation process taking
place at the moment about sentencing. We do want to see greater clarity
in the sentencing provisions, but we also want the public to understand
clearly what sentencing is about.</div>
					<a name="07012352000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 24 makes a minor
technical adjustment to the arrangements for early release from a
detention and training order. At present, a trainee who is granted
early release must be released on a particular date. If for some reason
that date is missed, the trainee must stay in custody for a further
month. This can happen for a number of reasons. Problems with finding
accommodation suitable for electronic tagging is a notable example.
Clause 24 introduces greater flexibility by allowing the release to
take place on any day after the early release point has
passed.</div>
					
					<a name="07012352000282"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.15
am</div>
					<a name="07012352000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
will prevent trainees sentenced before the new arrangements come into
force from being released in accordance with them. The Government see
no reason for delaying the effective introduction of the more flexible
arrangements in this way. We are not proposing any change in general
practice. Trainees serving between eight and 18 months who qualify for
early release will continue to be released one month before the
mid-point of the order. Qualifying trainees serving 18 months or more
will be released one or two months before the mid-point. If for some
reason the early release date is missed&#151;for example because of a

so.</div>
					<a name="07012352000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause is
highly appropriate and will give us flexibility. The amendment would
not, and in our view it would make matters worse. I understand why the
hon. and learned Gentleman raised the matter&#151;he wanted to

am impressed by his ability to deal with his roles as a judge and a
Member of Parliament. He is clearly an exceptional

						</b> I remember once advising the Prime Minister of a
foreign country on a matter of defamation law. After I had advised him
not to take action against a particular publication, he thanked me and
gave me a set of first-day covers from his country. I was about to
pocket them, hoping that a cheque for my fee would follow shortly
thereafter, when my instructing solicitor took them away from me and
said that he would have them on the basis that philately would get the
Prime Minister everywhere.</div>
					<a name="07012352000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am afraid that the Minister
is good at flattery&#151;I expect first-day covers to head my way
shortly&#151;but the clause seems to be a means for the Government to
get around the custody overcrowding problem. That is at the heart of
the problems faced by the Prison Service and the custody system. Until
the Government sort out the overcrowding problem and stop pretending
that early releases are for criminal justice reasons rather than to
make space for the queue of people coming into our prisons and young
offender institutions, confidence in their ability to manage this
aspect of public policy will be diminished.</div>
					<a name="07012352000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">Today is not the day for a
prolonged debate on the matter. The Opposition will constantly return

							<b class="B">Mark
Williams</b> (Ceredigion) (LD): I beg to move amendment No.
40, in
clause 25, page 18, line 25, leave
out subsection
(5).</div>
					<a name="07012352000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
stands in my name and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Cheadle. I
think that the appropriate expression may be that I have been left
holding the baby, but I shall proceed. Clause 25(5) allows the
Secretary of State to direct that some young people be removed from
young offender institutions into adult prisons once they have reached
the age of 18. We seek to remove that subsection from the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="07012352000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before 2000, the
law required that 18 to 20-year-olds be held in young offender
institutions. Approximately 9,000 young adults aged between 18 and 20
are now in prison in England and Wales. The Government attempted to
reduce the minimum age of imprisonment 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column199" />Column number: 200</div>to 18 in section 61 of the Criminal Justice and Court Services Act 2000.
Perhaps in the light of pressure from interested parties that were
rightly concerned about the standard of provision for young people in
adult prisons, that section was not brought into effect. The Home
Office has called in interested groups to consider the specific needs
of the 18 to 20-year-old age group, including standards for the
management of offenders in custody and in the community. I should be
interested to know the Minister&#146;s feelings about that
consultation and the views of those who were consulted.</div>
					<a name="07012352000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government are attempting
to enact an idea to which many groups, such as Rainer, the Prison
Reform Trust and the Howard League for Penal Reform, are opposed. I
cite the views expressed by Her Majesty&#146;s chief inspector of
prisons in her 2004-05 annual report, which stated:</div>
					<a name="07012352000276"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Our reports continue to
document the inadequate provision for young
adults&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07012352000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">Is prison the
best place for 18 to 20-year-olds? This age group suffers severe
difficulties and therefore requires special attention. The Prison
Reform Trust found that 78.4 per cent. of young men released from
prison in 2002 were reconvicted within two years of
release.</div>
					<a name="07012352000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have heard
about the general problems of mental health from which young people
suffer proportionately more highly than others. To deal with the
problems of education and training as well as mental health problems,
special provision is needed to accommodate such needs. Reducing
reoffending in this age group requires us to prepare young offenders
for the world and to teach them skills that we often take for granted,
such as how to organise personal finances and how and where to look for
employment. We have often discussed such needs in the Committee.
Without being taught those skills and receiving other treatment for
drug abuse and mental health problems, young adults will remain as
likely as ever to reoffend. Crucially&#151;the Minister showed his
personal commitment to this in his evidence to the Welsh Affairs
Committee&#151;that cannot be done in
prisons.</div>
					<a name="07012352000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">The 2004-05
report of Her Majesty&#146;s chief inspector of prisons
stated:</div>
					<a name="07012352000277"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
poorest provision at present is to be found in establishments that hold
young adults within an adult
population.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07012352000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">Different
age groups have different needs, but there is inadequate funding in
prisons to take account of such needs. The Prison Reform Trust report
&#147;A Lost Generation: the experiences of young people in
prison&#148; revealed that far too many 18 to 20-year-olds were being
moved around an overcrowded system and experiencing impoverished
regimes involving long hours locked up without the support and
supervision that they require, causing disruption and
distress.</div>
					<a name="07012352000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the
provision as drafted make the situation worse? Will it not be a case of
having no room for young adults in secure training centres because
resources are a big issue, which means that they will be put into
prisons instead? The Minister knows that there is a problem in Wales,
as his evidence to the Welsh Affairs Committee showed. The hon. and
learned Member for Harborough referred to the matter in his
contribution on mental health issues. Can the Minister 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column200" />Column number: 201</div>assure us that the measure will not be used as an excuse to free up
space in the already overcrowded youth custody
system?</div>
					
					<a name="07012352000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07012352000330"></a>Mr.
Garnier:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman may be reassured that the
measure is not being put in place to relieve overcrowding in the young
offender detention system by placing such offenders in the adult prison
system, because the adult prison system is itself overcrowded. One does
not cure one bit of overcrowding by further overcrowding an already
overcrowded adult prison estate.</div>
					<a name="07012352000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a young offender
institution and an adult prison in my constituency, and I have visited
several young offender institutions and adult prisons in the past 18
months or so. Young offender institutions take people up to the age of
21, and there are often people of 19 or 20 in those institutions who
look about 13 or 14, yet some people aged 16 or 17 in custody look 25.
Some foreign nationals in young offender institutions do not have
accurate records of when they were born, so they may be over 21.
However, I am told by people who work in young offender institutions
that such detainees often say that they are under 21 in order to be
imprisoned in the young offender institution rather than the adult
prison. There is a huge problem of actual age as compared to maturity,
and the slightly lesser problem of older foreign prisoners being housed
in the young offender estate.</div>
					<a name="07012352000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am concerned about what
considerations the Secretary of State takes into account in deciding
whether a person who is 18 but not yet 21 is to be considered for
detention in a prison as opposed to a YOI. Clearly the Secretary of
State will not personally make that decision. I do not imagine that
even the Minister with responsibility for prisons will make that
decision; it will be delegated to people within the Prison Service or
in the private prison estate. We need to be extremely careful that
prisoners who are vulnerable young people in some respects&#151;yes,
they have committed serious crimes, otherwise they would not be in
custody; I do not shed a tear about that&#151;are not pushed into the
adult estate when they are not suitable and could not cope either
physically or mentally with the conditions of an adult
prison.</div>
					<a name="07012352000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">Prison is not
a nice place to be. Young offender institutions are not nice places to
be. I am afraid that sometimes people have to be sent to them because
they have committed serious crimes, but we need to be careful about
treating people badly within the prison system by sending unsuitable
youngsters into the adult system, for example, because it could lead to
more damage than the Minister would want.</div>
					
					<a name="07012352000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07012352000331"></a>Mr.
Sutcliffe:
						</b> I am grateful to the hon. Member for Ceredigion
for speaking to the amendment and for the comments from the hon. and
learned Member for Harborough. I wholeheartedly agree that we have
tobe careful about this issue. I want to reassure the
Committee and, I hope, the hon. Member for Ceredigion that we are
seeking a contingency for the reasons that he outlined. Clearly there
will have to be a great deal of discussion, and I will come to some of
the things we are already doing in terms of adult offenders and what
needs to happen.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column201" />Column number: 202</div>
					<a name="07012352000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">A project was set up as part of
the National Offender Management Service offender management programme
to look at management and standards for young adult offenders by March
2007. It is talking to the stakeholders that the hon. Gentleman quoted,
including Rainer and a variety of bodies. The project has carried out
four reviews of matters relating to young adult offenders: age range;
legislative arrangements for their management; custodial estate
provisions; and community provisions. Each review was informed by an
examination of recent publications, analysis of statistical data,
workshops and focus groups, and in addition meetings were held with
operational staff and offender policy leads, the voluntary community
and private sector, leading interest groups, inspectorates and the
prison and probation ombudsman. The team also visited a number of
prisons, youth offender institutions and probation areas, including the
north-west pathfinder for offender management. The project has worked
closely with the Youth Justice Board throughout.</div>
					<a name="07012352000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">The age range review has
examined the practice across all Departments, good practice overseas
and research evidence in relation to offending patterns and maturity.
There is an emerging argument in favour of looking to realign our age
definitions in line with other agencies, but the full implications need
further exploration before any firm recommendations are put to
Ministers. As yet, no firm decision has been made. Decisions on
legislative changes, if necessary, will be made once any change options
have been decided; for example in respect of YOI age range
definitions.</div>
					<a name="07012352000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
custodial and community reviews have been based on an assessment of the
way forward on the key characteristics of the young adult offenders age
group and, consequent on those, the development of a regime to reduce
the reoffending. The review of the custodial estate has identified
options for the future management of young adult offenders. The
priorities of public protection and reducing reoffending while ensuring
that vulnerable offenders are protected will determine the preferred
option, dependent on the offender need profile and the outcome of the
cost-benefit
analysis.</div>
				
					
					<a name="07012352000283"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.30
am</div>
					<a name="07012352000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
that underlines what the Government are trying to do with young adult
offenders and young people provision across Government, focusing on
prevention and then dealing with reoffenders. I have been impressed
with the work of organisations such as SmartJustice, in the deflections
that they are trying to achieve in the development of young offenders.
We are attempting not to put 18-year-olds in prison but to enact a
contingency that is required under current
legislation.</div>
					<a name="07012352000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection
(5) allows detention and training order trainees who become 18 during
the course of their sentences to be placed in an adult prison, which is
a necessary provision for a situation that might arise when section 61
of the Criminal Justice and Court Services Act is brought into force.
Section 61 abolishes the sentence of detention in a young offenders
institution that is currently available for 18 to 20-year-olds.
Following that change, if we then decided that young offenders
institutions would no longer be provided for 18 to 20-year-olds, that
would create a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column202" />Column number: 203</div>
						problem for the under-18 estate, because moving an
18-year-old trainee to a young adults institution would no longer be
possible. Clause 25 would instead enable him or her to be placed in an
adult prison.</div>
					<a name="07012352000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">I might
be asked why 18-year-old DTO trainees cannot stay in the juvenile
estate until the end of their sentences. There is no difficulty in a
trainee remaining for a reasonable period, but an offender who is just
under 18 at the time of conviction may be over 18 by the time sentence
is passed and may then have to serve up to 12 months in custody. He or
she could then well be over 19 by the end of the custodial period. An
even more extreme case would be if the trainee was then released from
custody but subsequently breached the terms of the notice of
supervision. He or she could be sent back to custody by the court. By
that time, the trainee could be over 20.</div>
					<a name="07012352000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">Forcing the Youth Justice Board
to place 19 or 20-year-olds in the under-18 estate, where they would be
mixing with 15-year-olds and so on, is clearly not desirable. There are
obvious safeguarding implications. As I have tried to make clear, the
policy on young adult offenders in custody is currently under review
and no decision on the way forward has yet been taken. We are listening
to the groups&#151;experts in the area&#151;that the hon. Member
for Ceredigion asked us
to.</div>
					<a name="07012352000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">If and when there
is a need to place DTO trainees in prison, policy guidelines will be in
place to ensure that the transfer to prison happens only in appropriate
cases, with due consideration to the requirements of the Human Rights
Act 1998 and to meeting the needs of individual vulnerable people. I
should emphasise that, unless detention in a young offenders
institution is abolished and the age of adult imprisonment consequently
reduced to 18, we have no intention of placing DTO trainees in adult
establishments. The subsection is purely a contingency arrangement.
With that explanation and commitment, made in Committee and Select
Committee, the hon. Member for Ceredigion knows what we are trying to
achieve and should be able to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

work here, but my hon. Friend the Member for Cheadle and I wanted to

					<div class="Column"><a name="Column203" />Column number: 204</div>
					<a name="07012352000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">In moving the amendment, my hon.
Friends, the two hon. Gentlemen from the Liberal Democrat Benches and I
wish to highlight a troubling matter, which I discovered on my prison
visits over the last 18 months or so&#151;the transport of young
offenders from court to prison or to young offenders institutions or
other place of secure accommodation. To cite an example, I went to
Hollesley Bay, which is in Suffolk, just beyond Ipswich, and is, to all
intents and purposes, a humane and well-run young offenders
institution. At the time there was a thoughtful, intelligent governor,
although he may have retired by now. Within the estate, there was also
a very secure unit for long-term young offenders, which I thought was
an excellent establishment. Next door, there is Warren Hill, a category
D prison.</div>
					<a name="07012352000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I met
the prison officers who deal with the reception area&#151;those who
receive the young offenders as they come from the various
courts&#151;I was told that they are often receiving young offenders
as late as midnight and that often the young offenders will have
travelled hundreds of miles in the vans used to transport them to the
institution, travelling from 4 pm, or 4.30 pm. I was told about one
youngster who had been sentenced at Norwich in the morning. He was held
in the cells underneath the court throughout the day and then put in a
van and driven, with adult prisoners&#151;he was not in the same
compartment as the adult prisoners, but he was in the same
van&#151;around East Anglia while the adult prisoners were dropped
off. He was the last in line to be dropped off. It was nearly midnight
when he was finally
received.</div>
					<a name="07012352000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">That example
is not one of a young offender being carried in the back of a police
car, or in a coach&#151;it is a young offender in a sweatbox. They
are called sweatboxes because they are little biscuit tins into which
individuals are placed. There are no windows, obviously; there is some
form of ventilation. There is a bench or a chair, but the area in which
the prisoner is transported is not much bigger than the top of the
table in front of me; that is the floor space in which the individual
travels. I would estimate that the top ofthat table in front
of the Minister is about 2 ft 6 in by2 ft 6 in. Inside a cube
of approximately that sizesits this young offender. When he
emerges into the reception area of the prison, he is distressed enough
as it is, having been sentenced and removed from anything that he
understands to a place that he may never have been to before.</div>
					<a name="07012352000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">One may say, &#147;It serves
him jolly well right&#151;if he had not committed the crime, he would
not have been sentenced and he would not have been transported in those
extraordinary conditions to a place far away from his home&#148;. I
accept that argument up to a point, but if we are going to treat people
decently within the criminal justice system, I am not at all sure that
putting them in a biscuit tin and shunting them around the country is
the best way to do it.</div>
					<a name="07012352000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">Glen Parva is the young
offenders institution in my constituency. I share the estate, as it
were, with myhon. Friend the Member for Blaby (Mr.
Robathan);it is partly in my constituency and partly in his
constituency. It is two or three miles south of the city of Leicester.
Young offenders who are sentenced in the north of England sometimes
have to travel for hours in these sweatboxes before they are received
into Glen 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column204" />Column number: 205</div>
						Parva late at night. I dare say that other young
offenders institutions also receive young offenders late at night after
they have travelled in those ridiculous conditions.</div>
					<a name="07012352000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is bad enough that these
young offenders institutions are taking in people who are miles and
miles away from their home, their families and so forth. That is
perhaps not germane to this debate, but if we are going to have
youngsters transported such long distances, I urge the Government to
ensure that their welfare needs are addressed during transportation. As
I understand it&#151;I may be wrong, and the Minister will correct
me&#151;there are no toilet facilities for those youngsters during
their journeys. Whether the van stops at pre-arranged times in order to
allow the youngsters to get off and go to the lavatory, I do not
know.</div>
					<a name="07012352000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">It strikes me
as strange that, in the 21st century,we transport people,
particularly youngsters, long distances in such conditions. If we
transported animals in those conditions, I suspect that people would
want to know about it and do something about it. It is not the
Minister&#146;s fault personally, but he is politically accountable
for this aspect of public policy. I urge him to ensure humane
arrangements for the transportation of youngsters, and indeed for the
transportation of adults. I say that not because I have sympathy for
the criminal as a criminal, but because we should not treat human
beings
inhumanely.</div>

Sutcliffe:
						</b> I am grateful to the hon. and learned Gentleman
for the way in which he moved the amendment. He raised issues that
clearly need to be resolved. I want the decency agenda to be further
developed from its good beginnings in recent
years.</div>
					<a name="07012352000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
clause clarifies the statutory position in relation to the journey
between relevant premises, such as courts, police stations, hospitals
and custodial establishments, that is made by young people who have
been sentenced or remanded in custody. The amendment would place a
statutory duty on the Secretary of State. Although I understand the
motivation for it, I believe that it is unnecessary, both legally and
practically.</div>
					<a name="07012352000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under
the Children Act 2004, there is a legal obligation on the governors of
secure training centres to safeguard and promote the welfare of
children in their custody. In addition, paragraph 3 of schedule 1 to
the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 places an express duty
on custody officers carrying out escort functions to attend to the
well-being of persons in their care, which includes their
transportation between premises, for example between court and youth
detention accommodation. The amendment would not go as far as the
provisions to which I have just referred.
</div>
					<a name="07012352000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment is also
unnecessary from a practical point of view. The Youth Justice Board has
been seeking to improve escort arrangements for children and young
people and has invested about &#163;5 million every year to make
separate arrangements for young people travelling to and from young
offender institutions. The board also has a separate contracting
arrangement for children and young people who are sentenced or remanded
to secure training centres or secure children&#146;s homes, which
accommodate the youngest, most vulnerable group.</div>

						While I was
listening to the hon. and learned Gentleman, I took the opportunity to
go through the contracts for escort arrangements. I will check with the
officials to see whether they can be made available to the Committee.
That will depend on commercial confidentiality. The contracts set out
what should happen in relation to comfort stops, which I accept might
not have happened on occasion. I would like to examine the issues that
the hon. and learned Gentleman has raised.</div>

Garnier:
						</b> I do not want to know anything that will
interfere with proper security and I do not want the Minister to make
announcements in public that would compromise prisoner transport
security. Generally, escapes take place not from within the prison but
during transit, either between prison and hospital, as we saw the other
day, or between court and prison. The Minister need not worry. I do not
need to know the terms of the contract, though it is kind of him to
offer me that opportunity. I want to be assured that he, as the

Brokenshire:
						</b> I rise briefly to seek clarification on
clause 28. We have obviously discussed the breadth of the powers vested
in the Secretary of State and the additional ability for further orders
and regulations to be made that might widen and extend the scope of
those powers. I have two technical questions for the Minister. First,
how was it decided which order-making powers would be dealt with under
the affirmative resolution procedure, rather than the negative
resolution procedure? Secondly, will he clarify the order-making powers
under clauses 4(1) and 33?</div>

							<a name="07012352000339"></a>Mr.
Sutcliffe:
						</b> As the hon. Gentleman said, the clause sets out
the level of parliamentary scrutiny for orders and regulations made
under the Bill. It does not apply to orders establishing probation
trusts or to commencement orders, which are not subject to
parliamentary procedure.</div>
					<a name="07012352000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of those orders to which clause
28 applies, the following three are subject to the affirmative
procedure: first, orders made under clause 10(2)(g), which allows the
Secretary of State to add to the list of persons with whom data may be
shared; secondly, orders made under clause 10(7), which provides the
Secretary of State with the power to amend an enactment that prevents
the sharing of data permitted under the clause, and thirdly, orders
made under clause 30(2)(a), which relate to consequential or
transitional provisions amending or repealing primary legislation. All
other regulations will be subject to the negative resolution procedure.
Our memorandum for the House of Lords Delegated Powers and Regulatory
Reform Committee sets out in more detail our thinking on such
matters.</div>
					<a name="07012352000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">Last
Tuesday, during consideration of clause 4, concerns were expressed by
my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford about the lack of parliamentary
procedure for orders establishing trusts. I explained that in due
course a trust might need to be established or dissolved for commercial
reasons&#151;for example, to bid for a contract or because a contract
had been lost to another provider. It would be inappropriate to subject
such commercial processes to parliamentary procedure. I undertook to
consider further the points that he raised and I shall do so. Perhaps
that is why the order-making powers in clause 10(2) to amend the
definition of listed persons are subject to the affirmative resolution
procedure.</div>
					<a name="07012352000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
10(2) defines the list of persons with whom the Secretary of State, and
others defined in clause 10(1), acting through the National Offender
Management Service, can share information on a reciprocal basis. That
power enables the Secretary of State to prescribe additional bodies by
order. The order-making power is subject to the affirmative resolution
procedure. We think that that is the appropriate level of scrutiny,
given the ambit of the power. Although I did not make reference to the
particular clause, I hope that the hon. Gentleman understands our
reasons for using those procedures. I hope that I have been of help to
the
Committee.</div>

The Secretary of State shall by regulation, make provision for

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07012352000347"></a>Mr.
Garnier:
						</b> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second
time.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column208" />Column number: 209</div>
					<a name="07012352000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">Proposed subsections (1) to (3)
fall to be discussed together; I shall come in a moment to subsection
(2). It seems to me to be logical that, just as the Secretary of State
currently makes sure by regulation and various other arrangements that
the probation service hits certain targets, meets certain standards and
employs people of sufficient calibre and qualifications, he should also
ensure that the new providers of probation services comply with those
standards. There should not be one set of regulations or standards that
applies to the probation service and its employees, and different sets
of standards that apply to third sector or private providers.</div>
					<a name="07012352000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">It seems to me that such an
approach would be fair and provide clarity, as well as the necessary
public confidence that, if we are to have non-state providers of
probation services, they comply with proper standards. This is a matter
of some practical importance because the number of providers of
probation services could well be enormous. A number of small charities
already help out with the resettlement of offenders, and a number of
small groups that go into prisons and help with learning and reading
skills. There are also a number of individuals who make themselves
available to assist in what I would loosely call probation work, albeit
that they are not official probation service employees or
officers.</div>
					<a name="07012352000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">Equally, if
we are going to look at the supervisionof community punishment
offenders by private companies, individuals or charitable groups, the
public must be assured that those involved are acquainted with the law
and will ensure that the individuals in their care and in their charge
will behave properly, turn up on time, do the work that they are
required to do to a sufficient standard and not disappear before the
time set by the court for the scheme that they are
on.</div>
					<a name="07012352000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">My concern in that
respect was increased in earlier sittings when the Minister was not
sure whether the standards that might be found in the contracts made
between the regional offender manager, the probation trust or the
Secretary of State and the third party or private provider would be the
same as the standards set by the Bill when it was enacted. I gently
chided him for suggesting that there might be any confusion between the
statutory and contractual terms, which should be
identical.</div>
					<a name="07012352000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">That point
is allied to the issue raised in proposed subsection (3). What will
happen if private providers&#151;especially the large plcs, which
have the money and want to make a profit&#151;fall below the
standards that the public expect of them? Surely penalty clauses should
be built in. If a private provider falls down in its work, the
Secretary of State, through the probation trust, will have to find
someone else to do it, and there is no reason why the taxpayer should
suffer a loss as a consequence of the incompetence or inadequacy
ofa probation provider. That matter requires careful thought,
and I appreciate that the new clause does not set out the model
regulation or standards that need to be followed. None the less, the
principle behind proposed subsections (1) and (3) is clear and
self-explanatory.</div>
					<a name="07012352000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">Proposed
subsection (2) relates to court reporting&#151;not journalism, but
the provision of reports for the court so that it can apply the proper
sentence to the case and the defendant. At present, in a magistrates 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column209" />Column number: 210</div>court or a Crown court, when a defendant has been found guilty, the
court will often order a pre-sentence report, which usually takes about
three weeks to prepare. In central London, three weeks is about the
minimum time that it takes for a probation officer to prepare a
pre-sentence report. If the case is more complicated and requires the
consideration of the defendant&#146;s mental state, it can take
longer to produce the report because the advice of medical and mental
health practitioners has to be sought.</div>
					<a name="07012352000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">By and large, the probation
service provides the magistrate or Crown court judge with a set of
recommendations based on the assessment of the officer who has made the
report of the facts of the case, and the matters relating to the
defendant and his history, in its widest sense. There is no question of
the probation officer who makes the report having any personal interest
in the sentence. The pre-sentence report may state that there is no
option other than custody for a particular offender and his offence,
given his history and the damage he has caused the victim.</div>
					<a name="07012352000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">The probation officer may
report that several community punishments are available and would be
suitable, and he might recommend various activities that should be
attached to the sentence. It is my experience that if more than two or
three activities are added to the community punishment the
sentenceloses its value. The defendant&#146;s mind needs to
be concentrated on doing one, two or three things well rather than on
doing half a dozen things inadequately. Many community sentence
defendants are not the brightest and they are not very good at
timekeeping. If they are loaded up with all sorts of requirements, they
will simply fall down and the sentence will have no effect. The
expertise of a probation officer is needed to provide guidance on that,
and he or she will also say what options suitable to a defendant are
available in the area of a court or where he lives. The probation
officer has no personal or commercial interest in the
outcome.</div>
				
					
					<a name="07012352000285"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12
noon</div>
					<a name="07012352000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">We may be
about to move into a set-up wherein private probation services supply
court reports. If we are not careful the consequence, witting or
unwitting, may well be that a private provider suggests to a sentencing
court that a service that his company provides would be the best
sentence or disposal of the case. Contractual terms or regulations
should be crafted to make it impossible for a private provider to skew
his advice so as to benefit his company commercially. That strikes me
as sensible and uncontroversial. The Government should welcome it, and
I am sure that they
will.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07012352000348"></a>Mr.
Sutcliffe:
						</b> I am grateful to the hon. and learned Gentleman
for proposing the new clause, which provides an opportunity to debate
the crucial matter of standards under the arrangements set out in the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="07012352000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">Proposed
subsections (1) and (2) would require the Secretary of State to set out
in regulations the standards to be achieved by providers of probation
services, particularly but not only in relation to the provision of
reports to courts and the Parole Board. The new clause would also
require regulations to provide for the imposition of financial
penalties on providers who fail to meet the standards.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column210" />Column number: 211</div>
					<a name="07012352000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of course I understand the
concerns behind the new clause. We agree fully on the need for
standards to apply to providers and for penalties to apply if standards
are not met, but we do not believe that the legislative approach is not
the right way to go about it. The overall priorities for the delivery
of probation services will be set out each year in a published national
commissioning framework. The national prioritiesin the
framework will underpin the regional commissioning plans, which will
also be public documents. The priorities will be informed by the
consultation process that we discussed under clause
2.</div>
					<a name="07012352000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">In delivering the
priorities, providers will be required to meet national standards,
which are already in place and set out what we expect all providers to
achieve. They do not have legislative status, and that is right. They
are operationally focused and we need flexibility to amend them as
necessary. A requirement to meet the standards will be set out in
contracts and failure to meet them will incur penalties. The action to
be taken in the event of such a failure will vary according to its
seriousness and the reasons for it. Incentives and sanctions are being
designed and agreed and they will, in time, include financial
penalties. However, they are a matter for negotiations with
providers.</div>
					<a name="07012352000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
and learned Gentleman&#146;s concern about court reports has been
expressed previously. We believe that there will be no conflict of
interest for private companies writing pre-sentence reports, which will
be done under the strict guidelines that are already in place. If
concerns are raised or an anomaly is noted, they will be dealt with by
the regional offender manager. The awarding of a sentence will remain
entirely at the discretion of the
sentencer.</div>
					<a name="07012352000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
and learned Gentleman went on to discuss how private providers of
probation services mightbe held accountable for their
performance. The requirement on private providers of correctional
services, as commissioned by NOMS, to report their performance will be
the same as the requirements on the public sector. Private sector
providers will report to regional and national commissioners in the
same way as public sector providers do and as existing private sector
prisons already do. We believe that the safeguards are in place and
that they should be contract related and in the guidelines. We
certainly believe that serious failures ought to incur penalties,
including financial ones. That is the right way to tackle the
issues.</div>
					<a name="07012352000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">Legislation,
even secondary legislation, is too inflexible; we cannot respond easily
to changing needs, for example, as identified in the annual
consultationor in negotiations between providers and the
commissioner. Legislation is also centralising&#151;a criticism that
has been levelled at the Bill&#151;and would stifle local flexibility
and, potentially, innovation. On that basis, I hope that the hon. and
learned Gentleman will agree to withdraw his new
clause.</div>

amendment (a) to the proposed new clause, at end
add&#151;</div>
					<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(2) The Secretary of
State shall report annually to Parliament on the nature of these
targets and the progress made towards their
attainment.&#146;.</div>

							<a name="07012352000352"></a>Mr.
Garnier:
						</b> The new clause is designed to encourage the
Government to be more open about what they want the Bill to achieve in
relation to the providers of probation
services.</div>
					<a name="07012352000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, we
accept that the new clause might create an administrative burden for
the Government. If we move beyond one provider of probation services,
namely the probation service, to a regime in which probation services
are provided by a host of private companies&#151;charities, Church
groups and so forth&#151;the Secretary of State will be writing out a
lot of targets for a lot of people. None the less, the underlying
principle is
sound.</div>
					<a name="07012352000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of the
things to concern me and, I suspect, the wider public is the appalling
rate of reoffending among those who have been released from custody.
The reoffending rate for adult prisoners within two years of release is
67 per cent. or thereabouts and, for young offenders, is nearer 80 per
cent. That is a huge waste of public money. Housing each adult prisoner
per year costs &#163;37,500 or thereabouts, and about &#163;70,000
to house each young offender. If we put those people in custody and
they come out in exactly the same condition in terms of education, drug
addiction or social aptitude, and then they reoffend, we have wasted
the public&#146;s money. I want to the Government to deal with that.
Prisons and young offender institutions are getting fuller and fuller,
but the reoffending rate is not decreasing. It is high time that the
Government set a target for themselves&#151;let alone for anyone
else&#151;on reducing the numbers of people who are offending and
reoffending and of people who are
cautioned.</div>
					<a name="07012352000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of the
points that the Council of Circuit Judges made to the Secretary of
State&#151;about three or four weeks ago, I think&#151;was that so
many youngsters nowadays are introduced to the criminal justice system
time after time, but without going to court and, as a consequence, the
fear factor of the punishment system within the criminal justice system
does not apply. The 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column212" />Column number: 213</div>
						deterrent value of the court system simply
existing,let alone sending youngsters to do community
punishments or into detention, has gone by the time many get to the
point of being sent into
custody.</div>
					<a name="07012352000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think one
of the less bright Ministers&#151;I cannot remember which one, which
is perhaps just as well&#151;said that that was because judges are
unduly lenient and that if judges did their job properly and did what
Parliament required of them, they would bang those youngsters up much
earlier. Actually, judges do their very best to comply with the law as
Parliament directs them and that is why the prisons are overcrowded.
The present Government have required more people to be sent to prison
for longer. Surprise, surprise&#151;more people are sent to prison
for longer. Surprise, surprise&#151;prisoner numbers have gone up.
The only surprising thing&#151;although I have given up being
surprised by it&#151; is that the Government failed to anticipate the
consequence of their policy and failedto provide sufficient
places to put those additional prisoners
in.</div>
					
					<a name="07012352000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07012352000353"></a>Mr.
Sutcliffe:
						</b> I hear what the hon. and learned Gentleman says
but surely he accepts that, in line with the Criminal Justice Act 2003,
which provided for indeterminate sentences for dangerous prisoners who
pose a threat to the public, it is right that such people are held in
prison until they can prove that they do not pose such a threat. Does
he think, particularly with his experience, that at the lower end of
sentencing, people who would once have been fined are now being given a
community sentence, and that that ratcheting up has contributed to the
problem?</div>
					
					<a name="07012352000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07012352000354"></a>Mr.
Garnier:
						</b> I am glad my hon. Friend the Member for
Hornchurch is here because that is a point that he drew our during our
evidence session. The evidence from that session is now available to
the Committee and is on the table. The point that he made is that the
continuous low-level interface between youngsters and the criminal
justice system has not had the desired effect of deterring them from
crime, so by the time they get to a point where they have done
something that may require them to go inside, they have lost any fear
of the criminal justice system. If my hon. Friend wishes to intervene
on me to explain that point rather more eloquently, I would be happy to
give way to
him.</div>
					
					<a name="07012352000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07012352000355"></a>James
Brokenshire:
						</b> The point I made has been taken up by the
Council of Circuit Judges. Minor offending is the breeding
ground&#151;the council&#146;s words&#151;for more serious
offending. As my hon. and learned Friend will agree, we need to be very
careful not to create a system that inures offenders to the criminal
justice system, such that when they arrive in prison or in custody or
they are given more serious sentences, it is much harder to reform and
rehabilitate them and therefore to stop them reoffending, especially if
that reoffending is of a more serious
nature.</div>
					
					<a name="07012352000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07012352000356"></a>Mr.
Garnier:
						</b> There is the answer to the Minister&#146;s
question and I hope he will take that on board. I know that he will
have studied the evidence session that we had a couple of weeks
ago.</div>
					<a name="07012352000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">That suggests to
me that we need an intelligent approach to reoffending, but it is not
something to which the Government have applied their mind. They are
very good at passing Acts of Parliament and very 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column213" />Column number: 214</div>good at demanding longer and harsher sentences for this, that and the
other but what they are not so good at is reducing reoffending. That is
why it is important, given the opportunity of the Bill, that providers
of probation services should be set the task of explaining what it is
that they can do and the Secretary of State should tell them what he
expects them to do. If they are not prepared to meet our expectations
they should not be given the task.</div>
					<a name="07012352000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not think that is at all
controversial, but I notice that the hon. Member for Ceredigion wishes
to amend my otherwise entirely perfect new clause by suggesting the
Secretary of State should report annually to Parliament on the nature
of these targets and the progress made towards their attainment. Again,
the more we know about what the Secretary of State is doing the better.
I say that particularly about the present
one.</div>

Williams:
						</b> In the absence of my hon. Friend the Member for
Cheadle, I was tempted to withdraw the amendment. However, on the basis
of the kind remarks by the hon. and learned Member for Harborough, I
shall reaffirm briefly what we said earlier: inspiring public
confidence in the system will be a huge job. It manifestly does not
enjoy a great deal of public confidence now. On that basis, we see no
logical reason why an annual report should not be presented to
Parliament.</div>
					
					<a name="07012352000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07012352000358"></a>Mr.
Sutcliffe:
						</b> The new clause highlights a key aim of the
proposals on which we all agree&#151;to reduce reoffending. The
Committee will know that the Home Office has set targets to reduce the
rate of reoffending by 5 per cent. by 2008 and 10 per cent. by 2010,
compared with the 2003 figures. We have always said that the targets
are ambitious and that the measures in the Bill are needed alongside
many others to meet them, and we have talked about ways of doing that
that involve the wider community. I do not think, however, that the
approach proposed in the new clause is the way in which to measure
success against the targets.</div>
					<a name="07012352000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the hon. and learned Member
for Harborough admitted, there are difficulties with holding individual
providers to account in respect of reoffending because more than one
provider of a custodial or probation service is involved in the
management of an individual offender. That is not a product of the
arrangements in the Bill&#151;it occurs now and is one of the reasons
that Lord Carter said in his report that the commissioners, rather than
individual providers should be held to account for performance on
reoffending.</div>
					<a name="07012352000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">In fact,
responsibility extends beyond criminal justice agencies. Reducing
reoffending is a shared task and extends to agencies with
responsibilities for housing, training, benefits and so on, as we have
discussed. That is because the likelihood of reoffending has as much to
do with whether an offender has a home, job, training, benefits and so
on as it does with probation staff offender management and
intervention. It is difficult to see how we could allow for that in a
contract with an individual probation provider. Contractual targets
should be consistent and aligned with the Government&#146;s plans for
reducing reoffending, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column214" />Column number: 215</div>
						and not just targets to reduce reoffending per se.
We intend to agree targets with all probation service providers for
services that contribute to a reduction in reoffending.</div>
					<a name="07012352000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment (a) to the new clause
states that the Secretary of State should report annually to Parliament
on progress towards those targets. I do not think that that is
necessary. We will continue to report overall progress, as we have been
doing for some years. It is not necessary to put that requirement in
statute. I understand the concerns of hon. Members, and hope that on
the basis of my explanation the hon. and learned Gentleman will
withdraw the
motion.</div>

							<a name="07012352000362"></a>Mr.
Gerrard:
						</b> The new clauses deal with the supervision of
people convicted of sex offences, especially those involving children.
The Home Office has been conducting a review of how it deals with
children sex offenders and as part of that there has been a lot of
discussion, over the past year or two, about whether there should be
more disclosure. I know that the Minister went to the US to examine
what is known as Megan&#146;s law as one way of trying to protect
children. In this country, however, most of the organisations involved
in child protection, including the National Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Children and Barnardo&#146;s, are not in favour of
going down that road and are much more in favour of examining other
ways to ensure that child sex offenders are properly supervised and do
not become a danger to children again. The new clauses are directly
relevant to that
process.</div>
					<a name="07012352000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">A pilot
project has been run. The new clauses appeared, more or less as they
are now, in a Bill that was published by the Government in the 2004-05
parliamentary Session. That Bill began in the House of Lords, but it
never completed its passage because of the 2005 general election, which
meant, of course, that all the Bills at that time fell. When I examine
the current Bill, I do not understand why the new clauses, which were
in the Bill that was introduced before the 2005 general election, have
disappeared, particularly when a pilot project has been run, using
polygraph tests and involving 347 sex offenders who were monitored
between September 2003 and September 2005.</div>
					<a name="07012352000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those tests were used to assess
the offenders&#146; compliance with their licence conditions, whether
they were behaving suspiciously and whether they were adhering to
treatment plans and programmes. It seems that the findings of that
pilot project were quite positive. In quite a significant number of
cases, the offenders made some disclosures during the polygraph tests
that were relevant to their behaviour, supervision or treatment that
allowed case managers to make adjustments to their supervision or, in
cases where it appeared that there might be an immediate risk, to take
some action. It also appears that the probation staff who were involved
in managing the pilot and acting as case managers during it found that
the information that was gained from the polygraph tests was helpful in
assessing and managing risks. It therefore seems right to examine those
measures and to determine whether they should be inserted into the
Bill. Perhaps the Minister will explain why it was felt appropriate to
include them in the Bill that was introduced before the 2005 general
election&#151;presumably on the basis that the pilot project had
appeared to work reasonably well&#151;and not include them in the
present Bill.</div>
					<a name="07012352000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">Organisations such as
Barnardo&#146;s, which has run a number of projects to help children
who have been sexually abused or assaulted and their families, support
the new clauses and think that they are a much better way of getting
better supervision of child sex offenders who are released on license
than going down the road of wide disclosure. There is evidence from the
US that that process of disclosure does not work particularly well. Not
as many child sex offenders in the US stay in touch with supervision as
do here. There is also a quite serious risk in disclosure&#151;one
that is not often pointed out. Although there are obviously some
extremely 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column217" />Column number: 218</div>unpleasant cases where children are sexually assaulted by strangers,
often the greatest risk of sexual assault and abuse of a child comes
from a relative or someone else who is already known to the child or
their family. That risk must be borne in mind, because the disclosure
of the identities of offenders could lead, in some cases at least, to
the victim also being easily identified. The route suggested in the new
clauses is worth considering as a better way of getting supervision,
particularly of child sex offenders who are out on licence, than some
of the suggestions that have been
made.</div>

							<a name="07012352000363"></a>James
Brokenshire:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman rightly touches on the
important and sensitive issue of how best we can protect children from
sex offenders. I, too, was struck by the briefing materials produced by
a number of children&#146;s charities stating their thinking on that
point and on how to ensure that the offenders who might put children at
risk are properly monitored, scrutinised and assessed on a continuing
basis so that potential threats are examined. The hon.
Gentleman&#146;s new clauses reflect language that appeared
previously in a Bill that did not find its way on to the statute book.
It is well worth asking how the Government&#146;s thinking has moved
on since that then and what it currently is. I know that the Minister
takes a particular interest in the
matter.</div>
					<a name="07012352000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Home
Office has received information on the pilot study on the use of
polygraph information, and I note that Professor Don Grubin&#146;s
study<i class="I"> </i>concluded that 94 per cent. of probation staff involved
found the information gained helpful. However, that is only a pilot
study, and the information and results appear to be recent. Further
debate, analysis and review will therefore be required to assess their
import and the likely impact of a wider roll-out of any such scheme. I
certainly welcome the debate that the new clauses offer, and I shall
listen with great interest to how the Government intend to proceed how
they believe children and other vulnerable members of our community can
best be
protected.</div>

						</b> I thank my hon. Friend the Member for
Walthamstow for raising the issue, and I also thank the hon. Member for
Hornchurch. There is genuine concern about how to respond to the
challenge of sexual abuse in our communities. Meeting that challenge is
not easy, but the Government give a high priority to the protection of
the public and particularly the safeguarding of children. The Home
Secretary, who used to be a spokesman on children for the Labour party
many years ago, is close to the issue today&#151;more of that later
when we discuss the
review.</div>
					<a name="07012352000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have taken
action in a range of Departments, and we intend to continue and expand
on that work so that it has a real impact on reducing sexual violence
in all its forms. In particular, we have taken firm action on sex
offenders. Our starting point is that serious child sex offenders
should remain in custody for as long as they present a risk to the
public. That was why we introduced the indeterminate public protection
sentence, which will result in indefinite detention unless the risk has
been reduced. We have taken further measures to strengthen both
sentencing and offender management.</div>

					<a name="07012352000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">As my hon. Friend the Member for

a review of the management of childsex offenders. Its
principal aim is to enhance child protection by focusing on two linked
objectives: strengthening sex offender management and empowering people
through increased public
awareness.</div>
					
					<a name="07012352000287"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.30
pm</div>
					<a name="07012352000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">The four
elements of the review include the multi-agency public protection
arrangements, which are unique to the UK in bringing together the
responsible authorities in dealing with the management of sex offenders
in the MAPPA categories. I am very grateful for the amount of work done
by MAPPA officers across the country. The review is looking at the
consistency of the MAPPA across the existing 42 areas and at getting
the right level of buy-in to ensure that the MAPPA work successfully.
Unfortunately, we have seen the arrangements not working recently and
serious offences taking
place.</div>
					<a name="07012352000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second
element of the review is treatment, and making sure that we do
everything that can bedone regarding treatment of sex
offenders, where appropriate or possible. A great many issues, some of
which are highly emotive, will be looked at. For instance, what goes on
in Denmark in terms of chemical castration and associated issues will
cause highly emotive discussions on
treatment.</div>
					<a name="07012352000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">The third
element is approved premises, and whatwe will do about our 104
approved premises. Are suitable arrangements in place for dealing with
the management of sex offenders? We talked previously about the issue
of resettlement. The fourth element is disclosure, which my hon. Friend
the Member for Walthamstow said was more controversial, although I
think all the issues are controversial, and what we should do about it.
He is right that in the majority of child sex offender
cases&#151;more than 80 per cent.&#151;the perpetrator is known to
the victim, either as a member of the family or a closely associated
responsible adult. However, 20 per cent. of cases involve predators who
operate in a particular way, usually getting alongside a vulnerable
single mother, after which the grooming takes place. The review will
focus on what information the individual mother should be able to
access.</div>
					<a name="07012352000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">Information
is already available through current legislation. Responsible
authorities that hold information can give it to relevant bodies,
whether they are schools, local authorities or whoever. The review will
focus on where individual responsibilities lie. I went to America to
look at Megan&#146;s law, and I am on the record as saying that it
would be highly inappropriate for the UK, for lots of reasons. People
on the sex offenders register automatically going on to a website is
clearly not what is required. Unfortunately, an individual on the sex
offenders register was murdered by someone who got access to the
register. We are talking here about the most difficult offenders,
however, and I was interested in what happened when the child
exploitation and online protection centre, under the leadership of Jim
Gamble, put on its website people who were not complying with the
requirements. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column219" />Column number: 220</div>Five people were put on the website and three of them have been caught
and arrested, because they appeared
there.</div>
					<a name="07012352000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">Disclosure and
what we do with information are difficult issues to deal with. I am
going back to the States in a couple of weeks&#146; time to finalise
our response. I think that my hon. Friend is right about the variety of
stakeholders involved in the consultation who have been looking at all
the issues. Polygraph testing, which I will come to in a second, is a
key element, but it is not better than some other approaches, but
should be considered alongside them. Disclosure should be appropriate
and accessible two ways, and there should be penalties for improper use
of the information.</div>
					<a name="07012352000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again, the process is not party
political. I know that hon. Members from all parties will be interested
with what we come up with. We will discuss further what we all want to
see: the right solution to meet our requirements. The overriding issue
has to be education and making sure that parents know how to safeguard
their children from difficult
situations.</div>
					<a name="07012352000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.
Friend talked about the role that technology will have in helping to
protect the public, including satellite tracking and the use of
polygraphs with sex offenders. The report will be out shortly, but as
he said, a major pilot study of polygraph testing was conducted by the
probation service between September 2003 and September 2005, the
results of which were published in December 2006. Almost 350 sex
offenders agreed to take polygraph tests as part of their supervision
and treatment process. They were asked about adherence to licence
conditions and their response to risk factors that were particular to
each individual. The importance of the polygraph examination was not in
whether it detected deception, although it did in many cases, but in
achieving the disclosure of new information by offenders before and
after the
examination.</div>
					<a name="07012352000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">Using
their knowledge of a case from probation records, and after discussion
with probation officers, the examiners concluded that new disclosures
that were relevant to treatment and supervision were made in79
per cent. of first examinations and 78 per cent. of retests, regardless
of whether the test was passed, failed or inconclusive. Nearly 30 per
cent. of such disclosures took place in the post-test interview, when
offenders were challenged with the results. Probation staff
overwhelmingly found those results helpful in the risk management of
offenders. We wish to listen to those views and give all possible
support to those who have the difficult job of managing sex offenders
in the community.</div>
					<a name="07012352000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the hon. Member for Hornchurch said, there are a number of problems
with the research, which limits the usefulness of the findings.
Offenders were self-selecting. On average, 43 per cent. of those
eligible volunteered for testing; we need to be concerned about those
who did not. My hon. Friend the Member for Walthamstow is aware that to
make polygraph testing mandatory, we require legislation. The
Government introduced clauses to that effect in the 2005 Bill, with
which this new clause appears to have a remarkable similarity. The
Government are sympathetic to the new clause, but we require time to
consider the category of sex offender for which the polygraph test
would best be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column220" />Column number: 221</div>used. The new clause uses the previous criteria of those sex offenders
who are on release from a prison sentence of 12 months or longer. That
may well be the preferred option, but we need to consider whether it
should be widened to test all high-risk sex offenders regardless of
supervision status, for example.</div>
					<a name="07012352000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">We must also consider how to
pilot mandatory testing. In the earlier Bill, the Government made a
commitment to pilot in a number of regions before bringing back before
the House the question of extension of polygraph examinations to other
areas. The new clause makes no reference to such a commitment. We
believe that if we are to take forward the use of polygraph tests, we
should do so cautiously, learning from small-scale implementation. That
will give us the opportunity to assess any problems of process and to
be clearer about the expected
benefits.</div>
					<a name="07012352000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">Mandatory
testing will be a new requirement for the management of sex offenders
and will require clear procedural guidance from the Secretary of State.
We will also seek to set guidance on the qualifications needed to
conduct polygraph examinations and the form that examinations take. In
assessing the risk of serious child sex offenders, we do not envisage
using the type of examination that takes place in popular light
entertainment programmes.</div>
					<a name="07012352000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">We consider all the issues as
matters of urgency. We are sympathetic to the new clause and we will
carefully consider it before Report. With that assurance, I hope that
my hon. Friend will be satisfied that we want to achieve a suitable
solution. I am sure that the review that we will undertake will meet
the requirements of all hon. Members. On that basis, I hope that he
will withdraw the motion. We will return to the matter when we are able
to do
so.</div>

							<a name="07012352000365"></a>Mr.
Gerrard:
						</b> I thank my hon. Friend for his positive reply; it
was more positive than the replies that I usually get in Committee. I
understand the points that he made. The pilot scheme was
self-selecting, so there are questions as to how it would work if it
were mandatory. I also take his point about the definitions that would
be needed. If we were to go down the road of mandatory testing, the
sensible approach would be to do so gradually with the introduction of
pilots. I accept that the new clauses do not allow for that, but I
thank him for his positive reply. Hopefully we will be able to return
to the matter on Report and get some changes to the Bill along the
lines suggested. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
motion.</div>

which you have handled our deliberations. I also thank the Clerks, the

with the smooth running of our Committee. The Bill is important, and it
has caused some controversy and will continue to be discussed in its

					<div class="Column"><a name="Column221" />Column number: 222</div>
					<a name="07012352000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">I wish to put on record my
thanks to the spokespeople of the Opposition parties, the hon. and
learned Member for Harborough and the hon. Members for Hornchurch, for
Cheadle and for Ceredigion, for their constructive involvement. There
are many issues that we must reflect on and return to. The Committee
has been good-natured and has dealt with the issues in great
detail.</div>

hon. Friends for their involvement, particularly my hon. Friend the
Member for Walthamstow, who has expressed concerns that are shared by
many Labour Members. I also thank Opposition Members for their active
involvement, the usual channels for their sterling performance in
ensuring that we meet our requirements and the Home Office officials
who have supported the Committee. I have learned a lot about
people&#146;s concerns about the details of the Bill.</div>
					<a name="07012352000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thank the Under-Secretary of
State for the Home Department, my hon. Friend the Member for Gedling,
whom I nearly forgot. He is known in the Home Office as Mr.
Big, for many reasons, but particularly because of his performance last
week in dealing with serious crime issues. I look forward to the
progress of the Bill through its remaining stages and I thank you for

Mr. Bayley, the Clerks and <i class="I">Hansard </i>staff and the
police who have kept an eye on our
proceedings.</div>
					<a name="07012352000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister kindly said that we have been constructive. There may come a
time when we shall become deconstructive, and I assure him that the
Bill remains controversial. It got its Second Reading thanks to the
official Opposition, so we hold him on probation and we shall be
looking for constant reports. We expect his targets to be met and we
expect him to return, having made his reflections, with an improved
Bill on Report. As I said on Second Reading, the support that we gave
then, which he seemed pretty reluctant to accept&#151;he was almost
content to let the Bill fall&#151;was conditional. Those conditions
have yet to be met, so the Bill is by no means safe, but then very
little in the Home Office
is.</div>

Minister will be adhering to an important convention that used to
operate in the Home Office when I was a Minister there from 1993 to
1997. We introduced a record number of Criminal Justice Bills&#151;a
fat lot of good it did us&#151;and Ministers always wished to thank
our civil servants and the Members and advisers who had helped us. We
used to have a drinks party at the end. It was an all-party drinks
party, because we did not wish to be accused of favouring the
Conservative party. I am sure that the Minister will wish to take
advice from his advisers on 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column223" />Column number: 224</div>the matter, and when the Bill receives Royal Assent I am sure he will
wish to pay tribute to the Chairmen, the <i class="I">Hansard </i>writers, his
excellent civil servants and lawyers and both members of the Committee
who have contributed and those who have sat in silence. That is an
important convention that ought to be
