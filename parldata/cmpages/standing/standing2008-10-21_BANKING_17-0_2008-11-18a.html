proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the
Bill.</div>
<a name="08111873000062"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111873000378"></a>The
Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Ian Pearson):</b> It is a
pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Gale, for the
penultimate sitting of this Committee.</div>
<a name="08111873000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">As clause 123
outlines the main features of the bank administration procedure, it
might be helpful if I briefly set out some of these. This procedure may
be required in the event of a partial transfer of a bank&#146;s
business to a bridge bank or a private sector purchaser. Where a
partial transfer takes place, the residual bank&#151;the part left
behind&#151;may be insolvent. In such circumstances, the Bank of
England may make an application to the court for a bank administration
order.</div>
<a name="08111873000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">The bank
administration procedure is a new and unique insolvency procedure
created to deal with an insolvent residual bank following a partial
transfer, although it is largely based on existing insolvency
provisions, specifically the procedure of administration as set out in
schedule B1 to the Insolvency Act 1986. It is designed to ensure that
any essential services or facilities that cannot be immediately
transferred to a bridge bank or private sector purchaser will continue
to be provided for a period of time.</div>
<a name="08111873000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Committee
heard the Government&#146;s case for the importance of the partial
transfer tool within the special resolution regime when we discussed
part 1 of the Bill. The Committee has also heard that the Government
are engaging closely with stakeholders to put in place safeguards to
allay any potential concerns over a partial transfer. We discussed
these safeguards last week in our consideration of clauses 42, 43 and
55. As the Committee will be aware, we are continuing to consult on
these issues, including through the expert liaison group which we have
established and which one of the later amendments seeks to provide on a
statutory basis. In the context of consultation, it is also worth
noting that key stakeholders, including, for example, the British
Bankers Association, broadly agree that if the partial transfer power
is used the bank administration procedure may be necessary and is a
sensible measure for the winding up of a residual
bank.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column510" />Column number: 510</div><a name="08111873000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">Bearing that
in mind, I will outline why the bank administration procedure is
necessary and what it is designed to achieve. Where part of a failing
bank&#146;s business is transferred to either a bridge bank or a
private sector purchaser, in accordance with clauses 10 and 11, the
residual part of the bank may be left as an insolvent entity. However,
it may be vital that the insolvent residual company continues to
provide support activities to the commercial purchaser or bridge bank.
For example, it might be impossible to transfer certain assets or
service contracts as part of the initial arrangements. These items may
be vital for the successful operation of the transferred
business.</div>
<a name="08111873000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under a
normal administration, the administrator would have no obligation to
provide support services to a commercial purchaser or bridge bank and
would be required to take actions in the best interests of creditors.
This could include taking immediate steps to wind up the affairs of the
company, selling its assets and distributing the proceeds to creditors.
Such action could threaten successful resolution of a failing bank
through a partial transfer, since it may render a bridge bank
unworkable or deter any commercial sector acquisition. Crucially then,
the bank administration procedure will oblige the bank administrator of
an insolvent residual bank to provide essential services and facilities
to the transferee. To that end, the bank administrator will have unique
statutory objectives: first, to provide support to a commercial
purchaser or bridge bank and secondly, to rescue the residual bank as a
going concern or wind up its affairs in the best interests of
creditors.</div>
<a name="08111873000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">By obliging
the residual bank to continue to provide services to the transferee,
the bank administration procedure will improve the likelihood of a
successful resolution of a failing bank&#146;s business. Once it
becomes no longer necessary for the residual bank to continue to
provide support services, the procedure would continue in a similar way
to an ordinary administration, although to keep down costs, maximise
returns to creditors and to protect the interests of creditors by
providing for a full range of outcomes, some of the existing powers of
a liquidator have been built into the procedure.</div>
<a name="08111873000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of the
main concerns raised by stakeholders&#151;which the Government have
addressed&#151;is that following a partial transfer those creditors
who remain in the residual bank will lose out. We have debated this
before, which is why the Government have put measures to mitigate the
risks in clauses 42, 43 and 55, and in the code and regulations on
which we are consulting. We are continuing to discuss the subject with
the expert liaison
group.</div><a name="08111873000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
bank administration procedure also provides that the bank administrator
will work on both objectives simultaneously, to protect the interests
of creditors. The bank administrator will be required to ensure that
essential services and facilities are supplied to the private sector
purchaser or bridge bank. At the same time, he or she will be able to
take action to rescue the residual bank or to wind up its affairs,
provided that these do not interfere with the first objective. It might
be perfectly feasible to realise some of the residual bank&#146;s
assets without prejudicing the operation of the transferred
business.</div><a name="08111873000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many
provisions of the bank administration procedure are substantially based
on the existing provisions of UK insolvency law, namely the
administration provisions of the Insolvency Act 1986, as amended by the
Enterprise Act 2002. The provisions will, therefore, be familiar to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column511" />Column number: 511</div>companies and their professional advisers. The UK&#146;s existing
insolvency regime is widely regarded as robust and well supported. In
line with the approach taken for the bank insolvency procedure, powers
are to be taken in the Bill to extend the provisions of the bank
administration procedure to building societies and credit unions, with
necessary modifications. A power is also to be taken to adapt the bank
administration procedure to deal with multiple transfers to different
purchasers.</div><a name="08111873000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
bank administration procedure is a well designed measure, for use only
in very specific circumstances, which builds on existing insolvency
procedures and forms an essential part of the special resolution
regime. It has been consulted on and there is substantial agreement
that it is necessary. The subsequent clauses have attracted very little
comment and have wide-ranging support. I hope that this brief overview
debate is helpful to the Committee.</div>
<a name="08111873000073"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08111873000379"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Gauke</b> (South-West Hertfordshire) (Con): I welcome
you to the Chair, Mr. Gale. The Minister might be being a
little pessimistic&#151;or optimistic&#151;in saying that this is
the penultimate sitting of the Committee. I do not know which way to
look at it. I know that we are enjoying it a great deal, but I fear
that we may get through the remainder of the Bill in the course of the
morning. We shall see; perhaps I am being pessimistic in thinking that
we will not have the pleasure of debating it this afternoon as
well.</div>
<a name="08111873000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall make
two points about the clause. I welcome the attempt to address the
difficulties that we face by improving the structure of administration
for failing banks. We strongly believe that administration has a large
part to play. Indeed, we advocated some kind of administration
structure in the case of Northern Rock. We welcome the
Minister&#146;s saying that this is appropriate. If I may, I will
contrast that constructive approach with the comments made by his
senior colleagues earlier this year. For example, the Chancellor of the
Exchequer, in the context of Northern Rock,
said:</div><a name="08111873000327"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Administration
would mean that control would immediately pass to an administrator who
would look to realise the value of the company&#146;s assets, which,
under current market conditions, would amount to a fire
sale.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>, 21 January 2008; Vol.
470, c.
1208.]</div><a name="08111873000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Prime Minister, two days later,
said:</div><a name="08111873000328"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Let
me just tell the House what administration means. It means a fire sale
of the assets, it means closing down the company and it means the
Government losing billions of pounds. It is the worst possible solution
and the Conservatives are not only guilty of inconsistency, but guilty
of putting the stability of the economy at
risk.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>, 23 January 2008; Vol.
470, c.
1490.]</div><a name="08111873000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">Now
we find that the Government recognise that administration for a
financial institution does not necessarily put the economy at risk,
cost the Government billions, and lead to mass unemployment and a
plague of locusts. Indeed, I asked the Minister at the beginning of
these Committee proceedings whether administration means a fire sale of
assets to which to he
replied:</div><a name="08111873000329"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It
is not right to say how the administrator would want to pursue its
duties. The administrator would certainly have objectives for ensuring
the supply of essential services and either rescue it as an ongoing
concern or wind up its affairs. It would normally want to do that in
the best possible way. If it can rescue the bank, it will want to do
that and, if it is to wind up its affairs, it will want to do that in a
responsible and appropriate
manner.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report, Banking
Public Bill Committee, </i>21 October 2008; c. 8, Q12.]</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column512" />Column number: 512</div><a name="08111873000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister puts it
very well; that is what administrators do. Some of his colleagues
appeared to be confused about the difference between administration and
liquidation. Clearly, administration does not mean a fire sale of
assets. It is one of the useful and necessary tools that need to be
available to the authorities in the case of a failing bank, and we
therefore welcome the inclusion of part 3. We will make one or two
comments on it during the proceedings, but&#151;as the Minister
says&#151;it has not produced many comments from outside bodies. We
have debated other parts of the Bill at great length, but that will not
be necessary with part
3.</div><a name="08111873000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
general observation, which could have been made about other parts of
the Bill but which could help here, is that the Government have in
mind&#151;as the Minister has stated and as appears in the
Bill&#151;that when a financial institution runs into difficulties
some of the assets will be transferred to a bridge bank, or straight to
a private sector purchaser, and that will be the good bank. The
residual bank is the bad bank. We have debated what toxic assets are,
and agreed that the issue with a bad bank is often uncertainty rather
than its being all that terrible. The Bill, particularly in part 3,
makes it clear that the residual bank is the bad
bank.</div><a name="08111873000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
our debates, the Government have argued for as much flexibility as
possible in the Bill. However, the concern has been raised with us that
the Bill to some extent closes down one area of flexibility in that, in
simplistic terms, the residual bank will always be the bad bank and the
good assets will be transferred out. Is it not conceivable that the
easiest route would be for the residual bank to be the good bank, and
for some of the bad assets to be transferred out? It is possible to
imagine circumstances in which transferring assets to a bridge bank
would trigger an event of default, or in which regulatory permission
might be required. It might be difficult to transfer the good assets,
and it would possibly be better to transfer the bad ones and leave the
good ones in the residual bank. That has not been the experience so
far; that route was not taken with Bradford &amp; Bingley. The residual
bank would perhaps normally become the bad bank, but the Government
seem to have closed off the alternative route. Tabling amendments to
address that would be hugely complicated and would, I suspect, create
difficulties even for the Treasury. None the less, it would help the
Committee if the Minister could explain why the Bill has closed off
that route. Does he consider it highly unlikely that it would ever be
useful to retain the good assets in the residual bank and transfer the
bad ones
out?</div><a name="08111873000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
conclusion, we support the need for a bank administration power. We
will raise one or two points in the course of the proceedings, but I
hope that we can make reasonably quick progress
today.</div><a name="08111873000348"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111873000380"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b><b class="B"> </b>That was fantastic. I thought when the
hon. Gentleman started criticising the Chancellor and Northern Rock
that we might get a chance to talk politics rather than debate the
technical details of the Bill. Alas, it was quite ephemeral and he went
on to the technical comments.</div>
<a name="08111873000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">Partial
transfers are important; there is a world of difference between putting
a whole bank and putting part of a bank in administration. I strongly
believe that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column513" />Column number: 513</div>the actions we took with Northern Rock and Bradford &amp; Bingley, which
were opposed by the Conservative party, were the right ones. They
benefited depositors and will prove beneficial to creditors too. I
contrast what we did there and what we are proposing in the BAP, with
the actions that the Conservative party took when it opposed the
Banking (Special Provisions) Act 2008, opposed what we did
on Northern Rock and opposed what we did on Bradford &amp; Bingley.
That is probably the end of the politics. I give way to the hon.
Gentleman and then I am sure we will revert to discussing the
BAP.</div><a name="08111873000083"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111873000381"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> Let me prolong the pleasure of discussing politics
for a moment. If the distinction the Minister is making is between a
partial transfer and then administration of part of a bank compared
with administration of the whole of the bank, would he not agree with
his initial statement to the Committee that an administrator would act
in a &#147;responsible and appropriate manner&#148;, whether it is
the whole of a bank or part of a bank? That is what administrators do.
They do not engage in fire
sales.</div><a name="08111873000084"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111873000382"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I agree that it is the responsibility of
administrators to act in a fair and responsible manner. Let me move on
to address the point that the hon. Member directly raised about
transferring out parts of a bad bank and the specific issue of whether
the residual company could be the good company. I want to make two
points. Certainly there are powers in the legislation to have multiple
transfers. Those could be transfers of good assets. They could possibly
be transfers of bad assets as well. Certainly the Bill provides for
flexibility.</div>
<a name="08111873000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">With
regard to the specific points, I do not think that it would meet the
Government&#146;s policy objectives to leave good assets under the
control of the original owner once the bank has failed its threshold
conditions. However, it is certainly perfectly possible that a decision
could be taken to take the whole of the bank into temporary public
ownership and then bad assets could be transferred out using the onward
transfer powers. That would be a conceivable
scenario.</div><a name="08111873000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the hon. Gentleman notes, part 3 has attracted relatively little
attention from outside commentators because they have recognised that
it is a necessary part of what we are trying to achieve. We shall come
on to some technical amendments, which have been tabled largely in
response to some of the outside comments and also on areas where we
need to improve drafting to make things clearer. Otherwise, this clause
is in very good shape and is widely
welcomed.</div><a name="08111873000087"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<h4 class="hs_8Clause">Clause
124</h4><a name="08111873000006"></a><div class="hs_7SmCapsHdg">Objectives</div><a name="08111873000089"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111873000383"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> The point I would like to make about this clause is
similar to one that my hon. Friend the Member for Fareham made about
bank insolvency or liquidation.  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column514" />Column number: 514</div>I know there was a debate about the terminology. My point relates to the
credit institutions reorganisation and winding up directive 2001 and
the 2004 regulations that enforced it. The purpose of that directive
and those regulations is to have some mutual recognition arrangement
within the European economic area for winding-up proceedings.</div>
<a name="08111873000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">A concern has
been raised with us that the arrangements for bank administration feel
more like regulatory arrangements than insolvency arrangements,
particularly because objective 1 takes priority over objective 2.
Objective 1 is support for a commercial purchaser of a bridge bank, so
I seek reassurance from the Minister that in those circumstances, as
far as the Government are concerned, those arrangements will be
recognised under the directive, creditors will be treated equally, we
will not run into difficulties and essentially those arrangements will
not be recognised in other jurisdictions. That means that for assets
held in other jurisdictions we will have two separate sets of
insolvency proceedings or administration proceedings, so the whole
process will become rather confused and dragged out and there will be
an issue concerning what happens to assets held in other jurisdictions
within the EEA.</div>
<a name="08111873000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will
the Minister also mention the &#147;normal&#148; administration
objective 2, which is subservient&#151;to use the Treasury
language&#151;to objective 1? Does that mean that shareholders in a
bank that is in administration will be in a worse position than those
in a company that is in normal administration because we have objective
1? We are broadly supportive of clause 124, but it might be helpful if
he could outline that to the Committee and address those
points.</div><a name="08111873000093"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111873000384"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> The clause provides that the bank administrator
has specific statutory objectives, the first being the provision of
support for the bridge bank or private sector purchaser. Once such
support is no longer required, the objective is to achieve either of
the two principal aims of an ordinary administration: either to rescue
the company as a going concern or to achieve a better result for
creditors in an immediate liquidation.</div>
<a name="08111873000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">I can confirm
to the hon. Gentleman that the bank administration procedure will fall
within the scope of the directive he mentioned as a reorganisation
measure, and shareholders in the administration will be in the same
position in the bank administration procedure as in a normal
administration procedure, so there is no intention to do anything
differently. I remind him about clause 55 and the &#147;no creditor
worse off&#148; position outlined in the Bill. We believe that there
are proper safeguards, and those in the industry, whom we will continue
to talk to, are broadly satisfied with what we are trying to

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111873000385"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> The Minister was complaining about all the
technical talk, but I have a technical question for him. The clause
relates to the grounds for applying for a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column515" />Column number: 515</div>bank administration order and states the conditions that must apply
before the Bank of England may apply for a bank administration order.
It
states:</div><a name="08111873000330"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Condition
1 is that the Bank of England has made or intends to make a property
transfer instrument in respect of the bank in accordance with section
10(2) or
11(2).&#148;</div><a name="08111873000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
7 sets out the conditions under which the powers contained in clauses
10 and 11 may apply. One of those conditions is whether the Financial
Services Authority is satisfied that certain conditions have been met.
Clause 130 says that the Bank of England may apply for a
bank administration order
if</div><a name="08111873000331"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;it
intends to make a property transfer
instrument&#148;.</div><a name="08111873000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
can make a property transfer instrument only once the FSA is satisfied
that certain conditions apply. That is what we have in clauses 7 and 8.
Clause 130 seems to allow an application to be made and clause 131
allows a bank administration order to be made by the court before
clauses 7 and 8 are satisfied, because of the words that the
Bank</div>
<a name="08111873000332"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;intends to make
a property transfer
instrument&#148;.</div><a name="08111873000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">Is
it necessary that all the conditions in clauses 7 and 8 have been
satisfied&#151;relating to clauses 10 and 11&#151;before clause 130
becomes operative? It seems that the Bank can apply before the FSA says
it is appropriate and then the FSA can subsequently determine whether
the conditions set out in clauses 7 and 8 have been met. I am sure that
is all entirely clear to the Minister but if he wants any clarification
I will try to help
him.</div><a name="08111873000103"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111873000386"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I think it is clear and I shall try to be clear
in how I explain it. The legislation is framed so that the FSA has
responsibility for deciding whether the threshold conditions have been
met. Clause 7 relates to this in subsection (1) where it
says:</div><a name="08111873000333"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
stabilisation power may be exercised in respect of a bank only if the
FSA is satisfied that the following conditions are
met.&#148;</div><a name="08111873000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have talked about this before. First, the FSA&#151;having consulted
the Bank and the Treasury&#151;decides whether the threshold
conditions are met and pulls the trigger. Then, the Bank is responsible
for deciding which stabilisation option should be taken. If the Bank
decides that one stabilisation option is a bridge bank and wants to
make a property transfer instrument, then clause 130&#151;subsections
(1) and (2) in particular&#151;would apply. The FSA&#146;s decision
to trigger the special resolution regime comes first. As I understand
it, the Bank could not decide to make a property transfer instrument
before the decision had been taken that a bank was
failing.</div><a name="08111873000105"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111873000387"></a>Mr.

administrators&#146;.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column516" />Column number: 516</div><a name="08111873000110"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111873000389"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss
Government amendments Nos. 164 to
166.</div><a name="08111873000111"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111873000390"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> This group of amendments tidies up clause 132 and
also puts in place arrangements for the appointment of a provisional
bank administrator. The amendments are similar to provisions previously
discussed under amendment No. 158 for the provisional bank liquidator
for the bank insolvency procedure, and they serve a similar
purpose.</div><a name="08111873000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 163 and 164 are straightforward tidying-up provisions to include
the phrases &#147;or administrators&#148; and &#147;or
liquidators&#148; where required in the application and modification
of existing provisions of the Insolvency Act 1986 to the bank
administration procedure. That is necessary because clause 132 modifies
various provisions of the Act in their application to the bank
administration procedure. Those provisions refer to the powers of
liquidators, as well as to the process of liquidation. The amendments
simply reflect
that.</div><a name="08111873000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 165 is another tidying-up provision, which corrects a conflict in
the drafting. Clause 132, table 1, applies schedule B1(65)(3) of the
Insolvency Act, and table 2 applies section 168(4) of the Act, both of
which allow for the payment of dividends to creditors. However, section
168(4) allows a dividend to be paid to unsecured creditors at the
discretion of the liquidator, while schedule B1(65)(3) requires an
administrator to seek permission from the court before paying a
dividend to unsecured creditors. It should not be necessary for the
bank administrator to seek the permission of the court, since that
would incur additional expenses for the creditors. Amendment No. 165
therefore removes the reference to paragraph 65(3). That
sensible approach benefits
creditors.</div><a name="08111873000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 166 is probably the most significant amendment in the group. It
provides for the appointment by the court of a provisional bank
administrator, following an application for a bank administration
order. During the brief hiatus between the application for a bank
administration order and the court hearing to make the order, it might
be necessary for the residual bank to continue to provide services to
the private sector purchaser or bridge bank. The appointment of a
provisional bank administrator will facilitate that process and will
also protect assets for the benefit of creditors in that initial brief
period.</div><a name="08111873000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">Following
the making of the bank administration application, an interim
moratorium will be in put in place to preserve the assets of the
residual company. The court will also be able to appoint a provisional
bank administrator where necessary, granting him or her powers to
protect assets and manage the residual company in accordance with
objective 1 of the bank administration procedure, which is to provide
services to the bridge bank or private sector purchaser. The
provisional bank administrator will not be entitled to pursue either
strand of objective 2, and will not be allowed to make subsequent
transfers, which means that the powers of a provisional bank
administrator will be suitably restricted. Those are the equivalent
powers that we were talking about in relation to the bank insolvency
procedure. A typical activity that the provisional bank administrator
might undertake would be facilitating access to e-mail or computer
systems.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column517" />Column number: 517</div><a name="08111873000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">In effect, the
role of the provisional bank administrator is simply to keep things
ticking over for a few hours until the full court hearing for the
making of a bank administration order. It is an important provision,
which will minimise disruption and protect assets for the benefit of
creditors, prior to the making of a bank administration
order.</div><a name="08111873000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
provisional bank administrator&#146;s appointment will lapse when a
bank administrator is appointed, although there is nothing to stop him
or her then being appointed as the bank administrator. In all cases,
the provisional bank liquidator must be a qualified insolvency
practitioner who consents to take on the role. Amendment No. 166 is a
necessary provision, which protects the assets of the residual bank and
allows for the provision of services to the private sector purchaser or
bridge
bank.</div><a name="08111873000118"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111873000391"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> May I ask a question about amendment No. 166? I
acknowledge the point made by the Minister, that the purpose of this
provision is for someone to be in place to &#147;keep things ticking
over for a few hours&#148;, as he described it, but what is the
likely time scale? He referred to a few hours, but is there a maximum
period for a provisional appointment? Can the Minister provide a firm
reassurance beyond &#147;a few hours&#148;? I acknowledge the
intention behind the amendment and it appears to be a useful addition,
but it will be helpful if the Minister
elaborates.</div><a name="08111873000119"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111873000392"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> It would not be right to put a time scale on the
face of the Bill, but clearly the policy intention is that a
provisional administrator would keep things ticking over for a short
period. I mentioned a few hours&#151;it might be a few more hours
than that, but it would not be a substantial length of time. The
intention would be to move to a proper and full bank administration
procedure as quickly as possible. Given that things can move extremely
quickly, as we know, and that property and assets can be transferred
quickly, once the decision has been made that a bank is failing its
threshold conditions and action is being taken it is right that we do
not leave a time window between a decision being taken and its being
implemented.</div><a name="08111873000120"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111873000393"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I am grateful for the Minister&#146;s response
and I understand why he does not want to be prescriptive, certainly on
the face of the Bill, or to say much more than he already has about the
length of time. As he said, objective 2 is disapplied, but will he
assure the Committee that even though objective 2 does not
apply&#151;that is, the rescue of the residual bank as a going
concern to achieve a better result for the residual bank&#146;s
creditors as a whole than if it was wound up without bank
administration&#151;the provisional administrator will do nothing to
prejudice the objective 2
requirements?</div><a name="08111873000121"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111873000394"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> It certainly is not the Government&#146;s
intention that the provisional administration would do anything of the
kind. In my opening remarks I mentioned facilitating the exchange of
e-mails and such activities to ensure that we can have the properly
functioning activities of a bridge bank and allow objective 1 to be
pursued. We have been clear about the grounds for what 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column518" />Column number: 518</div>a provisional administrator would be allowed to do, and amendment No.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111873000395"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 179, in
clause 132, page 71, leave out lines 28 to
33.</div><a name="08111873000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment relates to the applied provisions set out in the clause that
would amend section 178 of the Insolvency Act 1986. Our concern is that
the provisions amended by the Bill for the most part relate to
administration, as one would expect given that the clause relates to
administration. Section 178 of the 1986 Act relates to
liquidation and specifically gives power to a liquidator to disclaim
any onerous property. For those purposes onerous property
includes</div><a name="08111873000338"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;any
unprofitable contract, and...any other property of the company
which is unsaleable or not readily saleable or is such that it may give
rise to a liability to pay money or perform any other onerous
act.&#148;</div><a name="08111873000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">Why
should that power of disclaiming onerous property be available to an
administrator rather than a liquidator? I recognise that the power is
only to be given with the Bank of England&#146;s consent and
exercised with that consent, but it does not seem appropriate to give
the power of disclaiming onerous property to an administrator,
especially given the protection for creditors in section 178(6) of the
1986
Act:</div><a name="08111873000339"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Any
person sustaining loss or damage in consequence of the operation of a
disclaimer under this section is deemed a creditor of the company to
the extent of the loss or damage and accordingly may prove for the loss
or damage in the winding
up.&#148;</div><a name="08111873000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">With
an administration there may not be a winding-up, so that section does
not fit well with the modification to it in clause 132. It would help
the Committee if the Minister could explain why section 178 is amended
and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column519" />Column number: 519</div>why it is necessary for an administrator to be able to disclaim
property, given that as a rule administrators do not have that
ability.</div><a name="08111873000131"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111873000396"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> Amendment No. 179 would remove the ability of a
bank administrator to disclaim onerous property. I shall set out why
that ability is important and why we disagree with the
amendment.</div><a name="08111873000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">Onerous
property includes unprofitable contracts and property that is
unsaleable or not easily saleable, or that might give rise to a
continuing liability. The ability to disclaim onerous property is a
useful tool for the benefit of creditors, but it is normally
available&#151;as the hon. Gentleman says&#151;only to a
liquidator. We have applied the provision to bank administration, with
some modifications, as giving the bank administrator that power will
help to achieve the best result for creditors. Many members of the
insolvency community, including practitioners and lawyers, think that
an ordinary administrator should also be able to disclaim onerous
property, so it is sensible to apply such a provision, which benefits
creditors, to the bank administration
procedure.</div><a name="08111873000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
modifications in clause 132 are in line with the application of other
powers that are normally available only to a liquidator, for example
the ability to bring an action before the court for fraudulent or
wrongful trading and to pay dividends to unsecured creditors without
requiring permission from the court. Such provisions will ensure that a
bank administrator has all the powers necessary to fulfil his or her
objectives. The application of the liquidation powers, including the
power to disclaim, will also help to ensure that the bank
administration procedure is a cost-effective and efficient stand-alone
regime, which operates in the best interests of
creditors.</div><a name="08111873000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
thank the hon. Gentleman for his amendment because it has enabled us to
look at why table 2 applies only to section 178 of the 1986 Act, and
not the following four sections, which also deal with disclaimers. He
has brought that point to our attention and we will look into it. If
technical amendments are required to apply further provisions of the
1986 Act relating to the operation of disclaimers, we will consider how
to deal with them. Any necessary amendments will, of course, be subject
to normal scrutiny. I urge the hon. Gentleman to withdraw his amendment
because it is sensible that bank administrators have that power, but we
will look at whether we need to address in due course the issues raised
by the
amendment.</div><a name="08111873000135"></a>

inadvertently.</div><a name="08111873000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am not entirely convinced by the Minister&#146;s argument that as
some insolvency lawyers think that the power to disclaim onerous
property should apply to administrators generally we should therefore
apply it in these provisions. There may or may not be a case for
general reform. However, I will not press for a Division; the Minister
has given his explanation and it has been useful to highlight the
matter. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

provide for two things. First, amendments Nos. 167 to 172 clarify some
of the terms used in the clause in relation to &#147;original
bank&#148; and &#147;onward transferee&#148;. Secondly,
amendments Nos. 173 and 174 provide for an added level of flexibility
in relation to onward property transfers from a bridge bank. Where an
onward property transfer is made from a bridge bank to a transferee, it
may require services from the original residual bank&#151;clause 138
already provides for that&#151;but it may also require services from
the bridge bank. This is because some of the facilities may have been
transferred from the residual bank to the bridge bank. These may be
necessary to operate the business transferred from the bridge
bank.</div><a name="08111873000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111873000401"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> The clause relates to the successful rescue of a
bank and it applies if the bank administrator has pursued objective
2(a), which is the rescue of a residual bank as a going concern, and
believes that it has been achieved. It also sets out various procedural
matters. It appears that the decision as to whether a successful rescue
of a residual bank has been achieved is left to the bank administrator
and he will say, &#147;We&#146;ve made the decision. That&#146;s
it.&#148; But what happens if the FSA or the Bank of England take a
different view? Will the FSA and the Bank of England as a matter of
course examine the rescue bank and if they feel that the threshold
conditions have not yet been achieved, can they influence the bank
administrator?</div><a name="08111873000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the subject of successful rescue and the point at which a residual bank
has been rescued, we have an example of how the system works in the
case of Bradford &amp; Bingley&#151;as we have mentioned on a number
of occasions&#151;although I do not want to go into the case of the
Icelandic banks. What progress is being made on Bradford &amp; Bingley
and does the Minister ever envisage that it could be rescued as a going
concern? Does the Treasury expect that to happen and, if so,
when?</div><a name="08111873000159"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111873000402"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I do not particularly want to be drawn on
Bradford &amp; Bingley, which does not really have much to do with what
the clause seeks to achieve. Clauses 140 and 141 provide for different
ways of bringing a bank administration to an end. The approach is
consistent with the ways in which an ordinary administration can be
brought to a close&#151;the hon. Gentleman will be familiar with
them. Clause 140 is a straightforward technical clause providing a
simple way to bring a bank administration to an end where both
objective 1&#151;support for a private sector purchaser or bridge
bank&#151;and objective 2(a)&#151;rescue of the residual 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column522" />Column number: 522</div>bank as a going concern&#151;have been achieved. In those
circumstances, the bank administrator can bring a bank administration
to an end by following the process for formal administration set out in
paragraph 80 of schedule B1 to the Insolvency Act
1986.</div><a name="08111873000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
means that the bank administration is brought to an end when the bank
administrator files an appropriate notice with the court and Companies
House. To ensure that creditors are aware that the administration is
complete, a copy of that notice must be sent to all the
company&#146;s creditors and made available to them on request. As
the residual bank will have been rescued as a going concern, the FSA
must also be notified
accordingly.</div><a name="08111873000161"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08111873000403"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Peter Bone</b> (Wellingborough) (Con): The Minister said that
the clause had nothing to do with Bradford &amp; Bingley but he then
described exactly the situation that the Bradford &amp; Bingley
residual bank is in. Have I missed something? Does the Minister not
want to comment on it because of commercial confidentiality? Surely it
is exactly the situation that Bradford &amp; Bingley is
in.</div>
<a name="08111873000162"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111873000404"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I do not want to be drawn into parallels with
Bradford &amp; Bingley. We are talking about new legislation. The Bill,
as I have already indicated, parallels very closely the Insolvency Act
1986 provisions when there has been a successful rescue.</div>
<a name="08111873000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for South-West Hertfordshire asked about rescue situations. We
need to be clear that the Bank of England would already have issued an
objective 1 achievement notice and the bank administrator must be
satisfied that the residual company has been rescued. However, as I
have pointed out, the procedures are similar to those set out in
paragraph 80 of schedule B1 to the Insolvency Act 1986. Clause 140
provides an appropriate way to bring a bank administration to an end
where support for a commercial purchaser or bridge bank is no longer
necessary and the residual bank has also been rescued as a going
concern.</div><a name="08111873000164"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111873000405"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> The clause refers to the Company Directors
Disqualification Act 1986. Given our recent debate on clause 65 and the
treatment of company directors, does the Minister anticipate that
clause 65 could be used to amend that
Act?</div><a name="08111873000169"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111873000406"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> The clause establishes that the provisions of the
Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986 are applied to the bank
administration procedure. That ensures that, where appropriate, action
can be taken in the public interest against the directors of the
company. As the hon. Gentleman notes, under that Act when a company
goes into insolvency the office-holder&#151;the  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column523" />Column number: 523</div>liquidator or the administrator&#151;is required to consider the
conduct of the directors of the failed company and report to the
Secretary of State.</div>
<a name="08111873000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">Action may
then be taken, if it is considered to be in the public interest, to
disqualify a person from acting as a company director for a specified
period. The 1986 Act prescribes that a wide range of matters may be
considered in determining whether a director&#146;s conduct has been
such that action should be taken to bar him or her from acting as a
director for a period of between two and 15 years.</div>
<a name="08111873000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 142
applies the Act with necessary modifications. These are important
powers to protect the public and it is therefore appropriate to apply
them to the bank administration procedure. The provisions of the
Company Directors Disqualification Act are of long standing and will
therefore be familiar to companies and their professional advisers. The
provisions of the clause are straightforward and consistent with the
Government&#146;s overall approach that the bank administration
procedure should be generally consistent with existing insolvency law
and practice. That is an approach strongly supported by
stakeholders.</div>
<a name="08111873000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 65
could in theory amend the 1986 Act but it is not necessary in the bank
administration procedure, due to the application in clause 142. The
hon. Gentleman is right: we would want to look at whether the Company
Directors Disqualification Act powers should be used with regard to a
failing company. It would be abnormal to say that because a bank had
failed we did not want to consider whether the conduct of the directors
of the failed company had been appropriate. I hope that gives the hon.
Gentleman the reassurances he
seeks.</div><a name="08111873000173"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<a name="08111873000177"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111873000407"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> With regard to my previous question as to whether
clause 65 might be used to amend the Company Directors Disqualification
Act 1986, I was half expecting the Minister to say no because it would
be done under clause 143, which appears to be another Henry VIII clause
that enables the Treasury to change primary legislation by order. I
have no intention of repeating all the arguments of a constitutional
nature that we used about clause 65. I think clause 65 is much more
important in that respect as it raises issues of uncertainty in
important areas.</div>
<a name="08111873000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 143 is
more tightly drawn, but it is worth asking what the Government have in
mind. What sorts of orders can be made under these powers? Why are we
not trying to address them specifically in the course of the
Bill&#146;s proceedings? Do the Government have concerns about using
statutory instruments to amend Acts, given that the level of scrutiny
is much lower? I acknowledge that the affirmative resolution procedure
applies but do the Government have no concerns in this area? Why is the
clause necessary and where may it apply?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column524" />Column number: 524</div><a name="08111873000179"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111873000408"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> The clause provides a power for amendments to
insolvency legislation to be applied to the bank insolvency procedure
and provides a power to apply or amend insolvency provisions. We need
that power because the bank administration procedure is complex and the
existing UK insolvency regime is very sophisticated. Having the power
to make such amendments ensures that the Government have a suitably
limited power to ensure bank administration can continue to function
effectively. Any changes needed will of course, as the hon. Gentleman
notes, be subject to full parliamentary scrutiny through the
affirmative resolution
procedure.</div><a name="08111873000351"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.30

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111873000409"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> The Minister has been very generous in giving way
throughout the Committee. I understand the thrust of what he wants. We
are talking about uncharted waters so things may need to be changed,
but the problem with an affirmative statutory instrument is that it
cannot be amended&#151;the whole thing is either accepted or
rejected. That is a problem for scrutiny. If an important issue is
raised and we want to change the primary legislation, no one can amend
it.</div>
<a name="08111873000181"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111873000410"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I understand the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point
and I want to reassure the Committee that a lot of work has gone into
producing part 3 of the Bill, including extensive consultation. We
believe that we have an effective piece of legislation. This is a
complex area and things change. There may need to be some minor
adjustments to ensure that the bank administration procedure continues
to be effective. In such cases, a statutory instrument is normally
appropriate. The approach for the bank administration procedure is the
same as for the bank insolvency procedure in part 2, where clause 109
provides the same powers in relation to bank insolvency
procedure.</div><a name="08111873000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire talked about the powers under
clause 65. Without going back to that debate, I remind him that the
power to modify legislation in clause 65 is only when it can make the
SRR powers more effective. It is a limited power and the powers in
clause 143 are certainly very limited.</div>
<a name="08111873000183"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08111873000411"></a><b class="B">Dr.
John Pugh</b> (Southport) (LD): The Minister has mentioned
amending, modifying, altering and tweaking, but clause 143 specifically
says, &#147;provide for an enactment&#148;, which means that, in a
sense, novel legislation will be produced, as well as tweaking and
altering existing legislation. What does the Treasury have it in mind
to provide in the fullness of time?</div>
<a name="08111873000184"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111873000412"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> As I said, the legislation in part 3 is effective
as it stands. I do not have specific examples of where we want to
improve the legislation at the moment; if I did, I would have included
them in the Bill. When we make legislation, it is right that we have
the opportunity to amend it in the future, if circumstances require it,
without having completely new primary legislation. That is really what
clauses 143 and 109 do for bank insolvency procedures. They provide for
specific amendments to insolvency law, and the Secretary of State for
Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform shares the powers because of
his insolvency responsibilities. It would not  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column525" />Column number: 525</div>be appropriate to use clause 65 for that purpose, which is why we need
the powers in clause 143, as well as those in clause 109.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111873000414"></a>Ian

applying the bank insolvency procedure to building
societies.</div><a name="08111873000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">Detailed
procedures for applying the provisions of the bank administration
procedure to building societies have not been put in the Bill,
principally because insolvency legislation is complex, and building
societies have unique legal and commercial features that differ from
those of banks. It will therefore be necessary to spend time ensuring
that procedures are introduced that work for building societies and are
fit for purpose.</div>
<a name="08111873000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, it
is envisaged that the new procedures for building societies will in
practice be similar to the provision of the bank administration
procedure, and a building society administration procedure would be
used only in connection with a partial transfer of a failing building

on the strength and effectiveness of the existing insolvency regime,

it possible for an Act to specify that a statutory instrument is not a
hybrid matter? I understand that it is for the authorities of the

possible for a Bill of this sort to determine that an order made under
it is not hybrid and therefore does not involve the more complicated

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111873000419"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss
Government new clause 6&#151;<i class="I">Registration of charges:
Scotland.</i></div><a name="08111873000215"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111873000420"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> New clause 6 is technical in nature and will
enable clause 230, which relates to the registration of charges, to
operate effectively in relation to Scottish floating charges. A recent
Act of the Scottish Parliament, the Bankruptcy and Diligence etc. Act
(Scotland) 2007, will undermine certain of the intended effects of
clause 230 with regard to Scottish floating charges.</div>
<a name="08111873000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">Hon. Members
will recall that clause 230 provides that charges issued by a company
in favour of a central bank shall be exempt from the requirement to
register details of the charges that they grant at Companies House and
at their own offices. Although that applies generally, in practice it
will apply most often to charges granted by banks and building
societies in order to secure lending from a central bank.</div>
<a name="08111873000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">Part 25 of
the Companies Act 2006 means that any company that receives liquidity
assistance from the Bank of England and offers the Bank a charge by way
of collateral has to register the fact that it has done so. The
requirement to register charges at Companies House and on the companies
register could provide untimely market visibility of the liquidity
support that banks receive, so clause 230 removes the Companies Act
requirement in the case of charges to central banks. Charges granted in
receipt of normal commercial lending by other institutions will still
have to be
registered.</div><a name="08111873000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Bankruptcy and Diligence etc. Act (Scotland) 2007 will, when it comes
into force, undermine the provisions of clause 230 that relate to the
Companies Act. The 2007 Act provides that a Scottish floating charge is
not created until it has been registered on the Scottish register of
floating charges so that the act of registration itself creates the
charge. For companies whose floating charges are subject to Scottish
law, therefore, such charges would need to be registered if they are to
be regarded in law as having been created. Such registration would
undermine the intent of clause
230.</div><a name="08111873000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is also a possibility of legal ambiguity occurring, should the
Government not take the steps laid out in the amendment. In particular,
the courts could determine that the provisions of clause 230, as it
stands, mean that the registration of charges shall not be possible,
even where that is legally required in order for them to be created.
That could lead to a situation in which Scottish institutions were not
able to grant floating charges at 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column528" />Column number: 528</div>all, and the possibility of such a legal interpretation reinforces the
need for
clarification.</div><a name="08111873000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 6 addresses both difficulties and ensures that the provisions of
clause 230, which has been scrutinised by the Committee, can operate
throughout the United Kingdom. In consequence, Government amendment No.
33 would mean that clause 239 is laid with reference to Scotland
only.</div><a name="08111873000221"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111873000421"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second
time.</div><a name="08111873000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
hon. Members will by now know, in October I set up an expert liaison
group to advise Ministers on the development of the secondary
legislation that will implement the Bill&#146;s special resolution
regime provisions. When I met stakeholders they requested that that
group be formalised in legislation, and the new clause is a direct
response to that request. The clause places the Government&#146;s
stakeholder consultation group, known as the expert liaison group, on a
permanent statutory footing. It is designed to formalise the role of
this 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column530" />Column number: 530</div>important mechanism of Government consultation with the financial
services industry. The expert liaison group will advise the Government
on the development of secondary legislation related to parts 1, 2 and 3
of the Bill, such as the safeguards for partial transfers. I hope that
the expert liaison group will also be able to help the Government
review secondary legislation in the light of practical experience and
developments in the financial markets.</div>
<a name="08111873000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">The expert
liaison group will advise the Government on the permanent secondary
legislation relating to parts 1 to 3 of the Bill. It will not have
input into any specific orders such as the stabilisation powers,
compensation schemes, the resolution fund and third-party compensation
orders, as consultation on such matters would be inappropriate due to
the market-sensitive nature of such orders and the potential need to
exercise these powers on a very urgent basis.</div>
<a name="08111873000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">As hon.
Members will know, the initial focus of the group is very much on
secondary legislation on partial transfer safeguards and the group has
already contributed significantly to the development of the proposals
on which we are currently consulting. I look forward to the
group&#146;s continued engagement on this. While not mentioned in the
new clause, there could be a role for the group in wider matters such
as the development of the code of practice and, over time, reviewing
the SRR in general. As I have said before, we will consult the expert
liaison group over any changes made to clause 65 and its application to
the Banking Bill to strengthen legal certainty around that vital power.
The new clause provides for the expert liaison group to include
representatives from the Treasury, the FSA, the Bank of England and the
Financial Services Compensation Scheme. It also provides for the
Treasury to appoint persons it believes are able to represent banks and
persons who, in the Treasury&#146;s opinion, have expertise in
financial services and insolvency law. The Treasury will chair the
group which is consistent with its role in formulating Government
policy. I believe that the expert liaison group has already shown its
value in advising the Government on some of the safeguards relating to
the Bill.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111873000422"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> As briefly as possible: one, we welcome this and
two, will the minutes of the banking liaison panel be
published?</div><a name="08111873000233"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111873000423"></a>Dr.
Pugh:</b> Just to make a simple point again, does the new
clause address the concerns felt within the banking industry? Looking
at the list of people appointed, they are largely appointed by branches
of Government, or thought to be okay according to Government. I would
like the Minister&#146;s assurance that the expert liaison group is
not just another name for Government advisers under one guise or
another but genuinely reflects the wider concerns of the financial
services
industry.</div><a name="08111873000234"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111873000424"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I can certainly tell the hon. Gentleman that this
is not just a group of Government advisers. The initial meeting that I
attended with the British Bankers Association and other
representatives, who are now members of the expert liaison group, did
not give a clue that this was a cosy little grouping of Government
appointees. That is not what we want to see. We want an expert liaison
group that is representative of the industry, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column531" />Column number: 531</div>can provide us with technical import and help us initially with
secondary legislation and potentially more
widely.</div><a name="08111873000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">With
regard to whether minutes will be published, I do not see the expert
liaison group as working in the formalised way in which minutes would
be published on a website. It is more there to provide technical
advice. If the group felt it wanted to publish minutes or a memorandum,
I would not have a problem agreeing. The group may also be discussing
market-sensitive issues that it would not wish disclosed. I would be
happy to take that issue back to the expert liaison group and ask it
whether it felt that such publication were necessary. If the group felt
that that would help, I would not object to
it.</div><a name="08111873000236"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111873000427"></a>Ms
Keeble:</b> New clause 15 deals in particular with the rights
of tenants in properties that are then repossessed. The new clause
ensures that they have some rights in the process, rather than, as
sometimes happens, their being left completely unaware of what is
happening, pretty much until the bailiff comes to evict them. I am
particularly grateful to Shelter, which has repeatedly raised that
concern on behalf of people it deals
with.</div><a name="08111873000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
new clause gives discretion to the courts to delay repossession for up
to 90 days, to look at the circumstances of children living in the
property, and to consider the nature of the tenancy. It also gives
tenants a right to be heard at the hearing&#151;an important right,
which they do not have now. The new clause also sets out in more detail
the type of notice that tenants should be given and the frequency with
which they should be informed of what is happening to their home. That
is particularly important now, because one of the sectors affected by 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column537" />Column number: 537</div>the credit crunch is the buy-to-let market. A lot of private sector
rented property in this country belongs to landlords who own just a few
properties and live on the rental income. That sector is hard hit and
its tenants are particularly vulnerable to action that landlords might
take.</div><a name="08111873000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
new clause is particularly important now for a second reason. Often we
think of private sector rented housing being entirely a private sector
function, but increasingly that is not the case. Because of the
shortage of social housing, a large number of what would normally be
social tenants have been diverted into private sector rented property,
through the options interview process, while still living on housing
benefit. There are real concerns, therefore, about the level of
resources available to some tenants in private sector rented properties
and about their ability to move around and to find alternative
housing.</div><a name="08111873000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
come across that problem repeatedly, as I am sure do a good number of
other hon. Members. During advice surgeries, I have met people living
in private sector rented properties whose landlords have defaulted on
their mortgages. As a result, their properties have been repossessed
and they have been ordered to leave at extremely short notice. The
point of the new clause is not to prevent repossessions where people
have defaulted, but to ensure that when it happens, it happens in an
orderly fashion. The new clause would also ensure that, if a court
orders a delay, it has the power to determine rental levels and to put
in place arrangements for tenants to receive notice of what is
happening and to put their case in court, for the needs of the
household, especially children, to be considered and for the court to
have some regard to other housing in the
area.</div><a name="08111873000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall give an example of what can happen in the absence of an orderly
wind-down. I was visited recently by a constituent of mine who had a
tenancy in which the rent was inclusive of council tax. She was booted
out at extremely short notice, but arrangements were not made for the
proper winding down of the accounts and payments. One year later, after
she had settled in to a new property, she was presented with a
bailiffs&#146; bill for more than &#163;1,000, which was the
estimated cost of recovering one month&#146;s council tax of
&#163;195. The landlord should have paid it, but had not. No process
had been in place for sorting that out, so she was simply dumped with
the bill. A process such as the one in the new clause would ensure that
instead of just giving consideration to the owner of a property being
repossessed, proper regard would also be given to those living in it.
Proper arrangements should be in place to protect them from some of the
worst excesses of the current
system.</div><a name="08111873000254"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111873000428"></a>Dr.
Pugh:</b> I speak to new clause 16, which stands in my name
and that of my hon. Friend the Member for South-East Cornwall, but I
shall also say something about new clause 15, which seems to be an
attempt to impose sensible regulation on the timing and manner of
mortgage repossession where tenants are concerned. It sets out some
very legitimate social concerns that should be considered formally by
the courts. I have just one concern about such an amendment, although
to some extent the hon. Lady has responded to it already. We do not
want to create a toolkit for delay, evasion or the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column538" />Column number: 538</div>perpetuation of unsustainable situations by putting off the inevitable.
In such circumstances, a complex series of relationships will have been
entered into, and they should not be unpicked precipitously or without
care and thought.</div>
<a name="08111873000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">To some
extent, the same applies to new clause 16. Proposed new section 35B(1)
and (8)&#151;in many ways the shortest and most comprehensible
subsections of what is quite a long new clause&#151;address the nub
of the matter. The new clause has been developed over time. I am not
saying that it is business in progress, but obviously it could stand to
be revised in the light of any critique from the Minister. However, it
addresses an important consideration: we all agree that repossessions
by banks&#151;this Bill deals only with repossessions by
banks&#151;should take place in a considered way and by application
to courts. It is perfectly possible for that not to happen and for the
banks simply to foreclose under common law, for people not to know
their rights or to be advised on them inadequately, and for there to be
no considered and careful court process. That can be unfortunate and
lead to a bad outcome, particularly when we remember, or have it
brought to our attention, that many mortgage repossessions are prompted
by strained personal circumstances, such as divorce. That kind of thing
does not happen often. Where such big and traumatic events do occur,
when situations were entered into with care and consideration, the exit
should equally be marked with care and
consideration.</div><a name="08111873000353"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12
noon</div><a name="08111873000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
there is the option of an exchange of letters and the banks using
powers to foreclose on the deal, which is not illegitimate and is
allowed at the moment, things may not turn out perfectly or as we would
wish, and will not reflect the balance of interests between the parties
adequately. I think that the measure has the support of Shelter; I
stand to be corrected on that, but I am fairly confident that it does.
It closes a loophole in British law, which most of us are not aware of
in the first place. It would be better if it was not
there.</div>
<a name="08111873000257"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111873000429"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Members who proposed the
new clauses; they have highlighted an issue of growing concern. We know
that the Council of Mortgage Lenders has predicted 45,000 repossessions
this year and there are concerns that the number might rise next year.
There are worries that the balance between the rights of mortgagees and
mortgagors is inappropriate, particularly regarding the important issue
of repossessions occurring without a court order, which was raised by
the hon. Member for
Southport.</div><a name="08111873000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">No
doubt, the Minister will give us his assessment of whether the new
clauses would achieve their objectives. Whether the Banking Bill is the
appropriate vehicle for addressing these matters is, again, an issue
for debate. The issues touched upon by the new clauses are important,
and given the state of the economy and the likely level of
repossessions over the months ahead, it is right that we have the
opportunity to debate these matters at this stage. All serious
politicians will give a great deal of thought to them in the months
ahead.</div>
<a name="08111873000259"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111873000430"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> The Government welcome the opportunity to discuss
the important issue of the protection of home owners in arrears and
facing repossession proceedings. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column539" />Column number: 539</div>We have acted on it in a number of areas in recent weeks and months. I
stress that we want all borrowers to be treated fairly and,
particularly during difficult times, we want to ensure that appropriate
actions are taken.</div>
<a name="08111873000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">The two new
clauses both concern repossession hearings. New clause 15 concerns the
treatment of tenants in mortgaged properties subject to repossession.
It aims to protect tenants and licensees who do not have a right to
remain when a lender takes possession. Those occupiers should be
allowed adequate time to make alternative arrangements. The key
provision of the new clause is that the court should have discretion to
allow the occupier of such a property up to three months in total to
make alternative arrangements, before the date set by the court for the
possession order to take effect. The provision is supported by others
for notices to be served before and during possession
proceedings.</div>
<a name="08111873000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand
that, in practice, the proposal may be little different from the
present law, although it could help to clarify it. At present, an
occupier should receive at least 14 days&#146; notice of the
possession hearing and may apply to the court to be joined in the
possession action. The courts already have the power to allow such
occupiers a reasonable amount of time to move out if their
circumstances justify it. That is achieved without the additional
expense and trouble that would be caused by the proliferation of
notices that appear to be suggested in the amendment.</div>
<a name="08111873000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">We need to
ensure that the interests of ordinary families caught up in other
people&#146;s repossessions are properly protected. The Civil
Procedure Rule Committee, which is the statutory body responsible for
the development of rules of court, will be considering what notice of a
mortgagee&#146;s possession proceedings should be given to occupiers.
The committee is the appropriate forum in which to decide whether
further procedural protections are necessary.</div>
<a name="08111873000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new
clause provides that the occupier can be required to pay the lender for
the use of the property during the relevant period. That is only
reasonable, and it is broadly similar to the way tenants would be
treated under the current law. I recognise that there are issues raised
by the new clause tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Northampton,
North and, as I indicated, we are actively considering them.</div>
<a name="08111873000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn to new
clause 16. As I said at the outset, the Government wish to see all
borrowers treated fairly, and a key element is that lenders treat
repossession as a last resort. At present, lenders seeking to evict
borrowers from residential property will normally go to court to get a
possession order. In those cases the court has power to delay or
prevent the making or operation of the possession order, where it
appears that the borrower can pay off the arrears within a reasonable
time, while not falling further behind with future payments. That
limitation recognises that a mortgage is a debt and ultimately, if we
are to ensure that there are lenders willing to provide funds to home
owners and home buyers, the debt has to be repaid.</div>
<a name="08111873000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new
clause would remove the remedy of foreclosure from residential
properties. I understand that the remedy is little used but we need to
consider properly what the implications of closing it off would be,
before deciding that it can be abolished. The new clause would also
restrict the ability of lenders to recover the costs of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column540" />Column number: 540</div>possession proceedings and proceedings to recover money, by making such
recovery subject to the precondition of obtaining a court
order.</div>
<a name="08111873000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am sure
that we have all received letters from constituents about excessive
costs charged by mortgagees and added to the mortgage debt, so I
understand the concern driving the new clause. However, if it is the
intention that lenders may not recover their costs without a court
order, we need to be careful that the provision does not increase those
costs by requiring court action in every case. There is a danger of
generating unnecessary litigation for the parties and the courts, which
could feed through into higher borrowing costs to the detriment of
borrowers generally.</div>
<a name="08111873000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">We need to
look at all the issues together. The new clauses address only the
actions of banks, but clearly building societies and other lenders need
to be considered. In relation to new clause 16, we also need to
consider carefully how any restriction on the power of sale will
interact with existing mortgages, where the power of sale forms part of
the contractual rights of the lender. The Justice Secretary is actively
considering whether further action should be taken in relation to
repossession cases. We are committed to working with lenders,
regulators and the judiciary to ensure that timely action is taken in
response to problems.</div>
<a name="08111873000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government have already taken specific action. We have made clear our
concern for families in financial difficulty and facing repossession.
We are actively working with lenders, regulators and the judiciary to
ensure that borrowers are treated fairly. In 2004 the Government
extended the scope of Financial Services Authority regulation to cover
mortgages. FSA regulation ensures that borrowers are afforded important
protections and have appropriate means of redress. On 22 October the
Master of the Rolls approved a new protocol for possession proceedings.
It is intended to ensure that lenders and borrowers use every effort to
ensure that there is a genuine attempt to find other
solutions.</div>
<a name="08111873000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">The protocol
will come into force from tomorrow, and we will continue to provide
advice and assistance through the courts and other agencies to
individuals with mortgage payment problems. We will consider the policy
issues underlying the amendments, and with that assurance I hope that
my hon. Friend will withdraw the new
clause.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111873000431"></a>The

respond?</div><a name="08111873000271"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111873000432"></a>Dr.
Pugh:</b> I thank the Minister for his thorough and thoughtful
response, which recognised the issue and dealt with it, but indicated
some of the work that may need to be done in an amendment to address it
satisfactorily. I shall read carefully what he said and consider the
details, but I shall not press the new clause, which was a probing
provision and has done exactly what it should
do.</div><a name="08111873000272"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111873000433"></a>Ms
Keeble:</b> I very much welcome the commitment to consider the
issues, and the concern about people who face repossession of their
homes and tenants who are living in privately rented properties subject
to repossession. However, the explanation that has been provided is
wide of the reality facing many people. If a social tenant receives
notice only 14 days before the hearing 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column541" />Column number: 541</div>that their landlord is being taken to court, and the next step is to be
told that the bailiffs are coming round to evict them, it does not give
them much opportunity to try to join in the proceedings or to tell the
court what is happening. The court making the decision may not have a
mechanism for the tenant even to be made aware of what is happening
with the eviction, and might unwittingly make a vulnerable large family
with a number of children homeless when there is not much other housing
around.</div><a name="08111873000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that the review will be careful, and that I and others with an
interest can have input in some of the discussions so that we can
decide what best practice should be. However, I completely recognise
that this is probably not the time or place to press the new clause to
a vote, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
motion.</div><a name="08111873000274"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Motion

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111873000434"></a>Dr.
Pugh:</b> I beg to move, that the clause be read a Second
time.</div>
<a name="08111873000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">In some ways,
the new clause goes to the heart of the Bill, which is about remedies
for rescuing banks. We all agree that collapsing banks are not a good
thing, but it is possible that their collapse may not create a threat
to the economy. There must be a reason for interfering in a
bank&#146;s misfortunes, and powers are being taken in the Bill to
deal with those misfortunes, but for specific
purposes.</div><a name="08111873000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
purpose might be that the bank is just too large to be allowed to fail,
and its destiny may be the main or exclusive reason for worrying about
it. More significantly, people talk about the interest not just of the
bank, but of the economy beyond the bank and the various clients to
whom it lends. Clearly, it is possible that when a bank is rescued it
may recapitalise and save itself, and then punish its clients by
calling in credit or issuing new loans&#151;the reality is
confronting us at the moment. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column542" />Column number: 542</div>Anecdotal and real evidence suggests that the hardening of the
banks&#146; stance has been simultaneous with the Government&#146;s
charity to them. What we do to recapitalise banks may not achieve the
objectives that Governments have in mind, and the banks may act
contrary to what the Government
intend.</div><a name="08111873000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
solution employed by the Chancellor is simply to gather bankers
together and give them a good telling off. Obviously, that public
pillorying will have some effect, but it may not have a radical effect
or the strength that people desire. It does not by itself create an
obligation. It is simply a telling off.</div>
<a name="08111873000354"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.15
pm</div><a name="08111873000280"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 20 would put into the Bill an explanation of what we have in
mind when we capitalise a bank, which is that to some extent the
recapitalisation process should coincide with wider economic stability.
If the banks receive help they must have regard to advice from the
Treasury and thus do precisely what they are expected to do and what
they are clearly not doing in many circumstances at
present.</div><a name="08111873000281"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
give a personal critique of my own amendment, one might question
whether it is tough enough because it does not create arrangements to
monitor whether banks are doing what the Treasury thinks they should
not be doing, nor does it create a series of penal sanctions if they
fail to have regard to Treasury advice. When framing the new clause,
which is entirely in place within the Bill, we were torn between two
alternatives.</div>
<a name="08111873000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, it is
not a good idea for the Treasury to micro-manage the lending policy of
all banks. We accept that. The Treasury, qualified though it is, is not
party to all the commercial transactions that banks are involved in and
ought not itself to run the banks day to day. Equally, there is clear
and evident fear that something goes wrong if banks are left to their
own devices. There are thus two unacceptable alternatives:
micro-managing banks is bad but so is leaving them to their own
devices.</div><a name="08111873000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
new clause tries to address both concerns as delicately as possible.
One could point to the absence of sanctions and simply state in the
Bill that banks can still ignore the advice just as they can ignore the
Chancellor, although it is harder for them to do that. If the provision
was in the legislation, it would be very much part of
recapitalisation&#151;it would be incorporated in the
recapitalisation process. It would still be legally possible for banks
to flout the law and to ignore the spirit of the law, but it would be
harder to do if the Bill made perfectly explicit the basis on which
they had received funds from the state in the first
place.</div><a name="08111873000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall not press the new clause to a vote. I will listen to the
Minister&#146;s response and see if he can give a reason why we
should not proceed with it. The proposal is an attempt to solve a
genuine problem. A scheme will be enshrined in law; it has a definite
political objective&#151;to recapitalise banks in order to stabilise
the economy&#151;but nothing in the Bill obliges banks to consider
the wider interests of the economy or to heed the advice of the
Treasury, which allowed them to have the funds in the first
place.</div><a name="08111873000285"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111873000435"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Member for Southport for
tabling, speaking to and, to some extent, demolishing new clause
20.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column543" />Column number: 543</div><a name="08111873000286"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111873000436"></a>Dr.
Pugh:</b> I pre-empted
criticism.</div><a name="08111873000287"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111873000437"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I have some slightly different criticisms that the
hon. Gentleman has not pre-empted. I appreciate that he tabled the new
clause in a probing manner. Were he to press it to a vote we would not
support it for one rather important reason. If it is necessary to raise
issues of public policy, remuneration, lending or dividend policy in a
bank that has been recapitalised, the place to do so is in the original
agreement, be that the placing offer, the subscription agreement or
whatever. It is appropriate to reach agreement at that point, rather
than to claim subsequently, notwithstanding agreements that have been
reached, that there is a provision that banks must have regard to
Government policy, whatever it might be. That would create an enormous
degree of uncertainty, make recapitalisation through the process the
Government used last month very unattractive for banks and do nothing
for the long-term situation. Those things should be addressed at the
time recapitalisation is agreed, when there is agreement between the
parties.</div> <a name="08111873000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">None the
less, it is helpful that the new clause has been tabled and that we
have an opportunity to debate it, because it highlights some of the
Government&#146;s difficulties in the area. When the announcement was
made on 8 October and confirmed on 13 October, much was said about
lending policies, for example, and about returning to 2007 levels. The
Government appeared to be in a complete muddle about what that actually
meant, so we and others pursued the matter and eventually reached the
position that availability of loans would be at 2007 levels, but not
the volume of loans. That certainly was not clear initially and the
announcement was spun by the Prime Minister and the Chancellor to
suggest that we would be forcing banks to lend at 2007 levels. We
should at least have some clarity on that point.</div>
<a name="08111873000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">This morning
the Government published a written ministerial statement on the bank
recapitalisation scheme, and three points are salient to new clause 20.
Paragraph 3 states:</div>
<a name="08111873000345"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;If
the Government is to provide capital, the issue will carry terms and
conditions that appropriately reflect the financial commitment made by
the taxpayer, including in relation to dividend policy, remuneration,
lending policy and wider public policy
issues.&#148;</div><a name="08111873000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I understand it, the statement relates to future recapitalisations and
not to those that have already occurred. Reference was made in the
statement to RBS, Lloyds and HBOS, which have already
participated.</div>
<a name="08111873000291"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not know
whether paragraph 3 is an admission that, in essence, with regard to
previous recapitalisations, the Government have not properly addressed
the wider public policy issues, and that the terms and conditions
reached previously have not fully addressed that point&#151;the issue
the hon. Member for Southport sought to address. Do the Government feel
that they sufficiently achieved their objectives in reaching terms and
conditions with RBS, Lloyds and HBOS to enable them to achieve their
wider public policy concerns? I detect an admission of failure in
paragraph
3.</div><a name="08111873000292"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph
4 appears to indicate a change in policy on the price the Treasury is
prepared to pay. Paragraph 5 is interesting because it appears to
indicate a change of  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column544" />Column number: 544</div>approach for the coupon for preference shares. That has attracted a good
deal of controversy, and concern that the level of 12 per cent. for the
original recapitalisation was proving burdensome. The reference to
&#147;prevailing market conditions&#148; suggests that the coupon
may be at a somewhat lower level.</div>
<a name="08111873000293"></a><div class="hs_Para">It might be
helpful for the Committee if the Minister clarified precisely what the
written ministerial statement is about in the context of debate about
what has already occurred with regard to banks rescued under a
recapitalisation scheme and whether the Government have sufficiently
achieved their public policy objectives, particularly in the context of
the confusion over lending. I am sure that the Committee would be
grateful for further clarification from the
Minister.</div><a name="08111873000294"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111873000438"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I understand that the purpose of the new clause
is primarily to stimulate debate and probe the Government. Technically
it would apply to the Banking (Special Provisions) Act 2008, the recent
recapitalisation scheme and any stabilisation powers under the Bill,
and would require them to have regard to any policy statement by the
Treasury. Although banks will have regard to policy statements by the
Treasury and other Departments, commercial institutions must be able to
make decisions on a commercial
basis.</div><a name="08111873000295"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
a bank gets into difficulties, the authorities will want to take action
under the special resolution regime to preserve or enhance financial
stability, or to protect public funds. We have recently taken such
action, but it is not designed to replace normal commercial decision
making. It would not be in the long-term interests of the sector or its
consumers if the authorities were allowed to override all commercial
decisions. I believe that we have the right mechanisms to ensure that
the Government have sufficient influence as may be necessary in
specific
circumstances.</div><a name="08111873000296"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
we take a bank into temporary public ownership under the special
provisions Act, we have the powers of a sole shareholder to exercise
control over the company. An example of that is the competitive
framework agreed between the Government and Northern Rock. Similar
mechanisms will apply to banks taken into temporary public ownership or
transferred to a bridge bank under the stabilisation powers in the
Bill, and the Bill provides for further provisions regarding the
management of banks under public control to be put into the code of
practice.</div><a name="08111873000297"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have the
power to set the terms on which banks that have been recapitalised can
obtain recapitalisation funding. As part of the recapitalisation, the
Government have agreed a range of commitments with the banks supported
by the recapitalisation scheme. The hon. Member for South-West
Hertfordshire seemed to suggest that it had been a muddle. I entirely
refute that. He will be aware of the conditions that have been imposed
on banks accessing the recapitalisation scheme&#151;those conditions
have been published. It is important that over the next three years
banks maintain the availability of competitively priced lending to home
owners and small businesses at 2007 levels, and actively market it. The
hon. Gentleman will also be aware of the conditionality on the
remuneration of senior executives, the support for schemes to help
those struggling with mortgage payments to stay in their homes, and the
right for the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column545" />Column number: 545</div>Government to agree with boards both the appointment of new independent
non-executive directors and the dividend policy, which was also part of
the
conditionality.</div><a name="08111873000298"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111873000439"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b><b class="B"> </b>There are conflicting reports about the
dividend policy. The written ministerial statement says that the
completed documents are available in the Library. Will it not be
possible to redeem preference shares until after five years, and will
dividends not be payable on ordinary shares until the preference shares
have been
addressed?</div><a name="08111873000355"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.30
pm</div><a name="08111873000299"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111873000440"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I do not have an immediate answer. I understand
that dividends cannot be paid until the preference shares have been
paid off. I think that for tier 1 capital purposes, preference shares
have to be held for five years. Presumably, it would be up to the banks
to come back with a refinancing arrangement that would be acceptable to
the Government. However, I imagine that we would have no objection if
preference shares were paid off earlier, as long as adequate tier 1
capital was available in the banks concerned. I shall consider the
point that the hon. Gentleman has raised, however, and if I can provide
further clarification, I shall.</div>
<a name="08111873000300"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111873000441"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I intervened partly to enable the Minister to
provide that further clarification. I asked the question because there
have been conflicting reports, and the uncertainty is not helpful. If
the Minister can provide clarity this morning, it will be
welcome.</div><a name="08111873000301"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111873000442"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I am not sure that I can provide further
clarification this morning, but I shall bear in mind the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s comments and see whether I can provide it very soon.
As I said, my understanding is that normally preference shares should
be held for five years, and that has been agreed. Future transactions
might take place whereby somebody could take over the preference shares
and ensure sufficient tier 1 capital. However, I shall get back to the
hon. Gentleman about
that.</div><a name="08111873000302"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
recapitalisations that have been taking place and have already been
announced are consistent with paragraph 3 of the written ministerial
statement to which the hon. Gentleman referred. I have just received
some helpful clarification from officials who confirm what I was
saying: the Treasury will permit and, indeed, encourage early repayment
of the preference shares it holds at a price equal to 101 per cent. of
par during the first six months following closing and funding of the
equity offer, and thereafter at a price to be negotiated based on
prevailing market conditions. Such repayment would be subject to FSA
approval. I hope that provides the hon. Gentleman with
clarification.</div><a name="08111873000303"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
Members will be aware, the Chancellor recently announced the creation
of United Kingdom Financial Investments Ltd&#151;UKFI&#151;to
manage the Government&#146;s interests in the recapitalised banks
and, in due course, Northern Rock and Bradford &amp; Bingley. He
reconfirmed our commitment to managing the Government&#146;s
investments on a commercial, arm&#146;s length basis and not to
interfere with day-to-day management decisions. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column546" />Column number: 546</div>The mechanisms that we have put in place ensure that the relationship
between the banks and the Treasury is appropriate for the conditions in
which we find
ourselves.</div><a name="08111873000304"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that the hon. Member for Southport will find my answers sufficient
for him not to press new clause 20 to a Division, but if he does, I
invite my hon. Friends to vote against
it.</div><a name="08111873000305"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111873000443"></a>Dr.
Pugh:</b> I hope I did not give the impression that I moved
the new clause simply as a debating point. We are in a serious
situation. How often do we hear, during Treasury questions and on other
such occasions, that the banks are not passing on the money to those
who ought to get it, including businesses that require credit lines to
remain open? We all know that we need to do something about the
situation. Clearly, a simple telling-off from the Chancellor will not
be sufficient. The toolkit that Ministers have outlined is not working,
otherwise the telling-off would not have been necessary, so we need to
find other measures.</div>
<a name="08111873000306"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was
suggesting a light-touch but flexible measure. Perhaps it is too light,
but it certainly allows for flexibility in legislation. That was what I
was thinking of when I framed it in that way, rather than the
suggestion from Conservative Members that the agreement gets hammered
out at the start, so that the banks know exactly what the legal
conditions on their future lending policy are. I am attracted to that
alternative, but there is a weakness in
it.</div><a name="08111873000307"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are talking about emergency situations in which bankers who have moved
serious sums of money need a reasonable view of where the future of
their bank lies. If there is protracted negotiation not only about the
sum being lent to them, but about what they are to do with every pound
that they are given, that might lead to the bank failing because the
process is not concluded in
time.</div><a name="08111873000308"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
might be a cross between the Conservative suggestion and my proposal
that enables us to amend the legislation earlier, so that we can
incorporate economic objectives more rigidly and more formally into the
legislation. However, there is a vacuum and, therefore, a clear need to
do something. Having heard a critique of my new clause and the
suggestion that it may need toughening up, I shall go away and think
about how it could be toughened up.</div>
<a name="08111873000309"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111873000444"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> Is the hon. Gentleman not worried that his new
clause, even without toughening up, would create such uncertainty that
banks would try even harder not to accept Government funds and, as
Barclays Bank has done, seek finance from alternative sources? That is
the route that the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable)
was so cross about.</div>
<a name="08111873000310"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111873000445"></a>Dr.
Pugh:</b> That would be a concern if every bit of Treasury
advice on every subject that crossed the Chancellor&#146;s mind had
been incorporated and taken into account by the banks. The new clause
says</div><a name="08111873000346"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;for
the purposes of this
section&#148;.</div><a name="08111873000311"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
means strictly for the purpose of recapitalisation. There would not be
uncertainty because decrees could be issued on interest rates and so
on. As long as we narrow the scope of the Treasury advice that is
relevant to the legislation, we can produce an improved
new  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column547" />Column number: 547</div>clause which, I hope, Members will see on Report. For now, I beg to ask

Pearson:</b> On a point of order, Mr. Gale, I wish
to thank you, Mr. Hood and Mr. Illsley for the
excellent and expeditious way in which you have chaired the Committee.
I also thank the Clerks, Mr. Sandall and Mr.
Hillyard, for their contribution. I thank the hon. Members for
South-West Hertfordshire and for Fareham, from the official Opposition,
for the constructive way in which they dealt with proceedings. I also
thank the hon. Members for Southport and for South-East Cornwall, from
the Liberal Democrats, for the way in which they presented their
proposed amendments. I thank my colleagues and all members of the
Committee for the 17 sittings that we have undertaken to
scrutinise the Bill.</div>
<a name="08111873000317"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill is
an important piece of legislation and it is right that it has undergone
such thorough scrutiny over recent weeks. As we progress to Report, I
believe we have improved the Bill where necessary. In the light of some
of the contributions made during these proceedings, I have endeavoured
to think again, and Government amendments will be tabled on Report to
reflect the debates in Committee. It simply remains for me to thank you
and your colleagues again, Mr. Gale. I wish the Bill well as
it moves forward.</div>
<a name="08111873000318"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08111873000447"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mark Hoban</b> (Fareham) (Con): Further to that point of
order, Mr. Gale. I join the Minister in thanking you, and
your co-Chairmen, Mr. Hood and Mr. Illsley, for
the way in which you have supervised our proceedings over the 17
meetings. I am sorry that we have not made the 18th this afternoon,
although that might be a relief to all those involved. I also thank the
Clerks, Mr. Sandall and Mr. Hillyard, for their
help, on which Opposition Members rely in order to get amendments into
a form capable of being debated.</div>
<a name="08111873000319"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is the
first time that I have taken part in a Bill with evidence taken at the
start. One of the joys of being Treasury spokesman is that one misses
out on such things on the Finance Bill. The evidence session helped to
set the framework for debate in Committee and highlighted some of the
important issues, which we were then able to discuss.</div>
<a name="08111873000320"></a><div class="hs_Para">As well as
thanking my hon. Friends for their work, I want to highlight the extent
to which the Committee 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column548" />Column number: 548</div>benefited from the expertise brought by the four members of the Treasury
Committee, who have wrestled with the issue for 18 months and continue
to do so. Their expertise, interest and experience contributed
enormously to the proceedings. The Minister and the Exchequer Secretary
engaged in extremely constructive debate. The Minister shed light on
the operation of the Bill and we have taken away thoughts that we will
seek to explore again on Report. It has been a constructive process. I
know from talking to outside parties that they appreciated the efforts
of the Committee and the Minister in particular to set out in detail
how the Bill will work in
practice.</div><a name="08111873000321"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111873000448"></a>Dr.
Pugh:</b> When selected to serve on the Committee, I thought
the Bill might be dull. It has not always been fascinating, but it has
been highly technical and important. It has been a sharp learning curve
for me. I was helped by the tenor of the meetings, which has been
measured and thoughtful throughout, for which all
Members&#151;experts and non-experts&#151;should take credit. There
are those in the room who are expert&#151;certainly more so than I
am. Credit must also be given to the Chairmen, who have kept us going
in a businesslike and totally fair way. The Clerks, too, have been very
helpful and efficient and deserve our sympathy because they have
endured every one of the 17 meetings, as has the
Minister.</div><a name="08111873000322"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08111873000449"></a><b class="B">Stewart
Hosie</b> (Dundee, East) (SNP): I, too, thank you,
Mr. Gale, your co-Chairs and the Clerks. It is worth putting
on the record that when representing a minority party on Committees, I
sometimes do not make a huge contribution. Once those on the
Conservative Front Bench have read out briefing notes from outside
bodies and those comments have been picked up by the Liberal Democrats,
there tends to be little left for me to say. However, I hope the
contribution has been useful, and when we get to Report and beyond,
there may yet be some amendments and changes that can improve the Bill
still
further.</div><a name="08111873000323"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08111873000450"></a>The
Chairman:</b> As the Committee has been hopelessly out of
order for the past five minutes or so, let me compound the situation by
adding my own thanks to the Officers of the House, the constabulary and
those others without whom our work would be impossible. May I also
express my thanks to the Committee for the exemplary courtesy and good
humour with which these proceedings have been conducted? The Chair
appreciates it, and I only wish the general public had the opportunity
to see and appreciate it. It is not widely reported, but it is a very
good
thing.</div><a name="08111873000324"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question
