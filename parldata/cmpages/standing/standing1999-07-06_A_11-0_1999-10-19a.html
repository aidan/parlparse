<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I welcome members of the Committee back to our newly refurbished Committee Room. I hope that we shall be able to make progress in air-conditioned comfort.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory </B>(Wells): On a point of order, Mr. Atkinson. I welcome you back to the Chair after our prolonged summer recess. We all look forward to further scrutiny of the Bill.
<P>
My point of order relates to the composition of the Committee, but I shall preface it by welcoming the changed line-up on the Government Front Bench. In particular, I welcome my opposite number, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, the right hon. Member for Oxford, East (Mr. Smith). I also welcome his colleagues, the Financial Secretary to the Treasury, the hon. Member for East Ham (Mr. Timms) and the Economic Secretary to the Treasury, the hon. Member for Welwyn Hatfield (Miss Johnson). I should not forget the new Treasury Whip, the hon. Member for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen). We remember with great affection his predecessor, the hon. Member for Coventry, North-East (Mr. Ainsworth). We hope that all those new members of the Committee will serve for some considerable time, if only to ensure continuity. I feel that I am something of a founder member as regards the Bill because I was in my present job when it was announced in July 1997. On a serious point, however, it cannot be good for public policy to make too many changes to the ministerial team. That said, we welcome the new members of the Front-Bench team. As I think they know, we still have profound misgivings about the Bill; some have been partly dealt with, but others are still outstanding. That all lies in the future.
<P>
My point of order is that the right hon. and hon. Members to whom I referred appear as members  of the Committee. I understood, however, that the Committee of Selection had not met. That is not to say that we do not want those right hon. and hon. Members to be members of the Committee. For the sake of good order, however, the matter should be regularised, and the Committee of Selection should discharge the previous members and appoint the new ones. We could have been informed about how the matter was dealt with.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The changes that have been made to the membership of the Committee are a matter for the Committee of Selection. Hon. Members may, however, want to note that they were made in accordance with the sessional resolution of the Committee of Selection of December 2 last. The resolution states that the membership of a Standing Committee may, exceptionally, be changed where a member
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``has been appointed or ceased to be a member of the Government or has changed his office for another''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The changes were made formally by being recorded in the appendix to the Votes and Proceedings at the earliest opportunity, which was at 10 o'clock this morning. They will, therefore, appear in the record tomorrow. I hope that that answers the right hon. Gentleman's point.
<P>
<B>The Chief Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Andrew Smith):</B> Further to that point of order, Mr. Atkinson. I am glad that the change is in order, otherwise I would not have been here.
<P>
Like my colleagues, I am pleased to be a member of the Committee. Like my predecessor, I intend, personally, to retain a strategic overview of the Committee's proceedings. I shall take a close interest in its deliberations and the progress that it makes. We have plenty of time for sensible scrutiny. The shadow Chief Secretary described himself as a founder member of the Committee. Founder members of clubs and other initiatives have a special responsibility to see things through to a sensible and timely conclusion. The Bill is important and there must be adequate opportunity for scrutiny, including of the issues that concern Opposition Members. We must have such an opportunity so that we can make good progress and get the Bill in place. That is very much in the interests of the public and of important financial institutions. It will also ensure that we fulfil our duty to carry out full public scrutiny.

<H4><center>REGULATED ACTIVITIES</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Colin Breed </B>(South-East Cornwall): I beg to move amendment No. 166, in page 192, line 17, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`except where the investment is provided by a registered friendly society, within the meaning of the Friendly Societies Act 1974, and the assets of that registered friendly society do not exceed £10,000.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 167, in page 194, line 33, at end insert</B><P>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`except where the investment is provided by a registered friendly society, within the meaning of the Friendly Societies Act 1974, and the assets of that registered friendly society do not exceed £10,000.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Breed:</B> I add my congratulations to the Government Front Bench team and I welcome them to the Committee. I look forward to their contributions and, I hope, to their approval and even acceptance of some of the amendments that we have tabled to try to improve the Bill.
<P>
As we all know, a large number of small friendly societies still exists today. If the amendments are not accepted, costs will be imposed on those societies that will be out of proportion to their size, membership and activities. Often they have no formal insurance function, but make occasional small benevolent payments while their main functions lie elsewhere. Some small societies write insurance and so should be regulated, but again at appropriate levels to ensure that the costs of such regulation are not disproportionate.
<P>
There is room here for exemptions, Where a society does not write insurance, or writes no new business, but merely runs previously written insurance, it should be eligible for exemption. The real problem, as we have found many times, is trying to set a sensible level to comply with the arguments of de minimis, so that we can properly target those firms that should be regulated, while allowing others to be exempt.
<P>
One example I have come across--and I suspect there are many others--illustrates some of the difficulties that the Bill will cause these societies if it is not amended. In 1997 the Lonach Highland and Friendly Society which was instituted in 1823 had income from its members of £330. It received in addition dividend income of £50.22. Against that £186 was paid out in annuities to members who had reached 70 and to some widows of members. Prior to regulation the annual income exceeded the annual expenditure which meant that the fund was gradually increasing.
<P>
However, in 1997 this small friendly society was subject to costs of £30 to the Personal Investment Authority, £335 to the Registry of Friendly Societies, £411 to its accountants and £822 to its actuaries. Even on the first morning back after a long break I suspect that most hon. Members will have worked out that that somewhat exceeds the £380 that it had accumulated in the year. The fund therefore had to rely on donations from vice-presidents to alleviate the problem.
<P>
That is not an isolated case. There is a large number of similar small friendly societies and local benevolent societies that were set up in the l9th century. It could be argued that they are an anachronism and that they should come in to the real world, that they should get up to date and either grow and live within regulations or fail and close down. That would be a great shame. If they are to be subjected to inordinate regulatory costs it would not only remove from the life of many communities these longstanding friendly societies, it would discourage the setting up of any new societies. Combining two criteria, therefore, might protect existing friendly societies and would not discourage new benevolent societies.
<P>
The essence of our amendments is that a specified maximum asset level should be low enough to support the de minimis argument and that societies should not be authorised to write insurance business or, if their book is now closed, it should be run off.
<P>
Clause 34 provides the power to order exemptions of classes of persons, on which the Treasury may rely to exempt small friendly societies. The Bill ought to contain a more specific provision, enabling small societies to proceed without the burden of regulation.
<P>
I trust that Ministers will accept our amendments. However, should they not be prepared to do so, will they provide reassurance about how they intend to deal with those rather small societies that may face regulatory costs out of all proportion to the benefits and which may sometimes exceed their annual income?
<P>
<B>Mr. Howard Flight </B>(Arundel and South Downs): May I too welcome you back, Mr. Atkinson, and add my congratulations to those already given to the Ministers?
<P>
The key issues that we wish to raise in relation to the Bill pertain to the industry and are not designed to be debated for their own sake. Our role in seeking to perfect the drafting of the Bill is non-partisan.
<P>
I support the Liberal Democrat amendment, which demonstrates that certain businesses may be hit by the Bill's excessively onerous requirements. The principle of exempting a particular activity on common-sense grounds should have a wider application across the whole territory. The arguments for that are self-explanatory and self-evidently justifiable. However, the onus is on the Government to examine other areas and types of small organisation that may be excessively affected by the measure.
<P>
<B>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Miss Melanie Johnson):</B> I thank Opposition Members for their best wishes to Front Bench members. Kind remarks were made by the hon. Members for South-East Cornwall (Mr. Breed), for Arundel and South Downs (Mr. Flight) and the right hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory).
<P>
I am grateful to Liberal Democrat Members for tabling this group of amendments, which highlights how activities and investments may be specified for the purposes of clause 20 and whether and to what extent small friendly societies should be regulated. My predecessor, the current Minister for Small Business and E-Commerce (Ms Hewitt), explained the effect of schedule during our debate on clause 20. That explanation appears in the Official Report, Standing Committee A, 22 July 1999; col. 381.
<P>
Committee members will recall that the inclusion of an activity in schedule 2 does not mean that it must be prescribed for the purposes of an order under clause 20. Similarly, an activity not being covered does not mean that it may not be specified under clause 20. Therefore, the legal effect of the exclusion proposed in the amendments is not totally clear.
<P>
We propose to repeal those parts of existing legislation relating to mutual societies that currently govern how they are regulated. Under the Bill, mutual societies will be authorised persons, to the extent that they conduct regulated activities. Therefore there is reason for exempting a class of friendly societies if members and customers of the societies that form part of it rely upon it to provide basic financial services, especially where those services, when provided by corporate sector firms, give rise to a requirement to be authorised. Any such case ought to be achieved through the order under clause 20, which relates to regulated activities or through the exemption order in clause 34. The Treasury has already consulted on drafts of those orders, and Parliament will consider them in due course. Regulation of friendly societies under the Bill is, of course, an issue only for societies that carry on financial services business, and does not affect those that provide only benefits to the community. The amendments seem to relate more to the type of regulation to which small friendly societies should be subject, rather than to whether they should be regulated at all.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Authorisation should not cause the Committee concern because we intend that where a firm regardless of its legal character is currently able to carry on regulated activities, its status will be protected, and it will be grandfathered into the new regime as an authorised person. As new societies may not be registered under the Friendly Societies Act 1974, no new issue arises beyond the transitional period.
<P>
Having become a authorised person, a firm will be subject to regulation by the Financial Services Authority. I repeat that I do not see a strong case for treating small registered friendly societies materially differently from larger registered or incorporated societies, or insurance companies. An underlying issue may be concern about the cost of regulation. But, as my predecessor as Economic Secretary to the Treasury, my hon. Friend the Member for Leicester, West (Ms Hewitt) said many times during Committee debates on part I of the Bill, the FSA will be bound to regulate in a manner proportionate to the benefits that regulation will bring. Many smaller societies provide only very limited investment and insurance services, and the focus of a society's activities may be on some type of general community benefit. At present, such societies are subject to a light regulatory regime and I believe that the FSA is likely to want to apply a similarly light-touch regime in future. It will have to consult about its proposals in due course. In the light of my explanation, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his amendment.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Breed:</B> I am partially satisfied with the Minister's explanation. We wish to ensure that the continuation of the societies will not be jeopardised by the new regulations. Our suggested figure of £10,000 was not plucked out of the air: it is similar to the de minimis proposals from the Charity Commissioners for regulating a vast number of charities--many of them extremely small--which need to ensure that costs are not prohibitive.
<P>
Did I understand the Minister to say that if the provision goes through unamended there will be only one regulatory cost to the charities--that two or three different regulatory costs will not be exacted?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I confirm that there will be only one cost, and one cost only, and that it will be subject to consultation. Perhaps I have now encouraged the hon. Gentleman to feel fully satisfied with my response.
<P>
<B>Mr. Breed:</B> In the circumstances, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 203, in schedule 2, page 193, line 5, leave out paragraph (b) and insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(b) depositary of a collective investment scheme other than a unit trust scheme; or
<P>
(c) sole director of a body incorporated by virtue of regulations under section 233.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We discussed schedule 2 in detail at our previous sitting. My predecessor, my hon. Friend the Member for Leicester, West (Ms Hewitt), explained that it provides an indicative rather than exhaustive list of the types of activities that will be regulated under the Bill. Amendment No. 203 is a technical amendment to the part of the list that relates to collective investment schemes. Its purpose is to ensure that paragraph 8 uses terminology that corresponds with that used elsewhere in the Bill and which is applicable to all collective investment schemes, regardless of their legal form. Our specific concern is that current drafting might be taken to imply that depositories of collective investment schemes with legal forms other than investment companies with variable capital are not included. To avoid that, the amendment would make schedule 2 (8) (b) refer to depositories of non-unit trust collective investment schemes generally.
<P>
The amendment would also introduce a new subparagraph (c), which refers to bodies
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``incorporated by virtue of regulations under section 233'', rather than<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``investment companies with variable capital''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is necessary because, although existing regulations refer to companies with variable capital, the new regulations under clause 233 will probably also cover open-ended investment companies. The amendment would introduce a neutral term to avoid pre-judging what the regulations will say. I urge hon. Members to vote in favour of it.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 159, in page 194, line 27, after 'profit', insert '(whether capital or income).
<P>
This is a simple drafting amendment to make it clear that when a contract's purpose is to secure a profit, it refers to both capital and income.
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman's explanation of the amendment, but we have difficulty understanding its purpose. It seems to add nothing to current drafting and its effect would, if anything, be detrimental. The word ``profit'' will be afforded its usual meaning. That is our intention. Qualifying it, under the amendment, risks casting doubt on its meaning--in both this Bill and the rest of the statute book. Insider dealing explanations worked perfectly well for a decade and a half without the qualified definition of profit suggested in the amendment. There is no need for the amendment and I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> This is not a major issue. I trust that the Government are entirely happy with the current definition of profit in the Bill and elsewhere. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Dr. Vincent Cable </B>(Twickenham): I beg to move amendment No. 134, in page 195, line 6, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`Mortgages for house purchase
<P>
23A. The provision of loans for the purchase of property for residential use, where the obligation of the borrower to repay the lender is secured on the value of the property in question.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We are returning to a subject--mortgage regulation--that was extensively debated before the summer break. I recall that there was no explicit reference to the subject in the Bill. The amendment is an an attempt to deal with that.
<P>
I recognise that there have been movements and much public debate about the matter over the summer. The Financial Services Authority and the mortgage lenders have changed their position and I expect that the Government will respond to that quickly. By the end of this week, consultation will have been completed and the Government will propose recommendations. We have an opportunity now to flag some of the issues that will be debated more intensively over the next few weeks when the Government have formulated their reply.
<P>
I want to put on record some of the arguments that have been widely held for incorporating mortgage regulation explicitly in the Bill and to address some of the concerns that have been expressed in recent debates. We have been over the ground before in different contexts, but it is worth summarising the argument for building mortgage regulation into the Bill.
<P>
There are five main points. The first is the asymmetry and imbalance between the house purchaser and the mortgage lender, which can be observed in many different ways. When buying a house, people are often under great time and financial pressure. Under those circumstances, they may not be in a position to shop around and obtain the best value. They are signing up to agreements that have enormous long-term costs--redemption penalties being the most obvious of those. The lack of information for the mortgage purchaser as opposed to the lender is not addressed by the market process.
<P>
The second problem is the odd way in which the FSA now functions. It is responsible for the endowment part of an endowment mortgage, but not the mortgage bit of it. I am not making a dogmatic point about endowment policies--many people have benefited considerably from them--but there are difficulties, and because of the need for the FSA to have an active role in policing them, it is only sensible that the two parts of the financial transaction should be dealt with together.
<P>
A third problem is that there are many gaps in the Bill. We know that there are protective elements for consumers, such as consumer credit, but there are many gaps in the system that mortgage regulation would cover. A fourth point is the idea of the FSA being a one-stop shop. After all, that is what the proposed legislation was about originally. Why leave out one of the key elements in financial services and the financial market?
<P>
Lastly--a point that has been recognised by the mortgage lenders themselves--there are deficiencies in the     voluntary     code.     There     is     large-scale    non-compliance but no deterrent. Mortgage lenders have a vested interest in creating a system that suits their interests. To their credit, they now publicly acknowledge the limitations of the scheme.
<P>
The background to the politics of the Bill is that the Treasury Select Committee considered the matter and the Joint Committee on Financial Services and Markets came up with a strong recommendation for incorporating mortgages within statutory regulation. We have moved on from the summer in some key respects. To summarise, the FSA, which was thought originally to have some reservations because of its work overload, has now recommended that mortgages should come within statutory regulation. It is willing to cope with the issues, the biggest of which is a question of time rather than principle.
<P>
More importantly, mortgage lenders themselves appear to have come on board and have accepted, whether by public pressure or the limitations of their own schemes, to work with mortgage regulation. The only reservations that I have picked up concern some of the Treasury's comments in the past few days, suggesting that it has doubts about whether statutory regulation is desirable.
<P>
Two arguments are being advanced, the first of which is a little difficult to understand. The Treasury seems to be saying that if the mortgage lenders are in favour of the proposal, there must be something wrong with it because, clearly, they will capture the system. There may be some truth in that up to a point, but that is even more true of self-regulation and it is a little difficult to follow the logic.
<P>
The Treasury's other concern is about the cost of regulation acting as a barrier to new entry into the industry. The answer is partly provided by the FSA, which has now done its costings on barriers to entry and the cost of compliance. It suggests that those are rather modest; they may be big in aggregate terms, but small in relation to financial transactions as a whole. The estimate is about 15p on a monthly mortgage payment--not a big cost proportionately. We are dealing with an industry that already has a profusion of lenders and products. The problems arise not from the number of entrants into the industry, but from the inability of consumers to manage the vast quantity of information that is thrown at them.
<P>
The traditional objection to regulation, which is that it blocks new entry and creates barriers, is not appropriate in this case. I shall be interested to hear whether the Minister will rehearse those concerns and tell us how the issue will be handled.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The Committee is well aware that clause 20 empowers the Treasury to regulate mortgages, so technically the amendment is not necessary. What is the Government's policy? A paper was published last summer and I thought that it had been announced at the Labour party conference that the Bill would regulate mortgages. That was how it came across to the public. Yesterday, however, Mrs. Diggle from the Treasury suggested that the code of practice should be given time to work and said that the earliest opportunity for regulation would be 2002.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
As we know, the big fish in the mortgage industry support regulation, as does the Consumers Association. Those who support regulation claim that it is needed to improve consumer confidence. I acknowledge that there are some scams in the industry but we should remember that over the past 30 years the mortgage lending industry has accommodated millions of people reasonably satisfactorily in helping them to buy their own houses, in a way that has not occurred in other parts of Europe. I question the assertion that there is a major crisis of confidence.
<P>
It is claimed that regulation would help consumers to understand the complexities of mortgage lending. That may be so, but people's needs vary over time; a mortgage product that may be appropriate for people aged 25 may not be appropriate for them when they reach 35.
<P>
It is argued that mortgages are currently regulated by a voluntary code and under the provisions of the Consumer Credit Act 1974, and that regulations could merge those protections into one package. That sounds fairly persuasive, but I am not sure whether the argument is bona fide, and I would welcome the Government's view. It is also argued that mortgage dealings should be taken out of the hands of the Office of Fair Trading, and that the financial services ombudsman scheme would be a valuable support to those consumers who feel that they have been wrongly treated.
<P>
Another important factor is that mortgage advisers are seen to be similar to other financial advisers; and, on the question of polarisation, consumers are not necessarily sure whether advisers are tied or independent, and, if tied, whether they are tied to more than one mortgage lender.
<P>
The Government have announced their CAT standard proposals. However, I note that the financial services consumer panel was somewhat wary of CAT standards and firmly suggested that it was not an alternative to regulating the sales and marketing process. Indeed, the industry is worried that CAT standards would drive mortgages into being either good or bad--CAT being good and non-CAT being bad--and that many mortgage packages appropriate for particular sorts of borrower would not qualify for a simple CAT standard.
<P>
The Opposition have resisted more regulation on principle. Our main concern is to point out the problems that regulation may bring. If there is universal desire in the industry for regulation, it will obviously happen. It is alleged that it would cost only l5p a month. That is 0.012 per cent., which does not seem too bad, but it is a cost and it is said that the FSA would have to employ another 250 staff to manage it. One worries about the increase in size of that body.
<P>
The Opposition's main concern is that the arrangements could reinforce oligopoly. Treasury officials make the very real point that for the large lenders who make up about 80 per cent. of the market regulation would be an advantage, but that it would be a potential disadvantage to those smaller lenders who can provide greater flexibility.
<P>
The main common-sense issues are whether to have a fixed or floating rate mortgage, whether to have low repayments; and whether to have straight mortgage repayments or endowments. Some mortgages will be suitable for people when they are earning specific incomes, and some will be suitable at later times in their lives.
<P>
There has been some naivety in debate on the subject. Complaints have been made that people took out fixed rate mortgages and were unfairly treated when they found that interest rates had fallen and they could not repay without penalty. I cannot accept that that is realistic. If the reverse had happened, people would not have complained that they had benefited from their fixed rate borrowings.
<P>
There is no alternative but for consumers to understand the sophistications, as no regulation will automatically deliver the correct answer to individuals. It is debatable whether formal or voluntary regulation is the answer. There is certainly a need to tighten up. There are many notorious little practices by mortgage lenders to earn extra income, including not making all the terms fully clear. In my daughter's case, one mortgage lender said that another would take at least three months to do the paperwork for the higher rate mortgage repayment and would deliberately hang on to the business for as long as possible. That was exactly what happened. If we do not move to some form of regulation, there is a case for the publication of a list the so-called scams that are well known.
<P>
Will the Minister tell us what the Government's position is? Is it in line with Mrs. Diggle's announcement of yesterday?

<P>

<B>Mr. Tim Loughton </B>(East Worthing and Shoreham): May I join the fray? On the Burns committee I took the line that the case for mortgages being fully regulated under the FSA had not been made. Despite the great shifting of sands and fine tuning of the positions of various people and vested interests, I still have many concerns. I shall raise them as questions to the Minister.
<P>
The mortgage market is a large and complicated one, worth £460 billion and transacting 1.4 million mortgages a year. It is unfortunate that the Government's hands are tied behind their back in discussing the amendment because the consultation period does not end until Friday.
<P>
When might we see some progress? As my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs said, Paula Diggle of the Treasury seems to be pushing the time scale further out. Yesterday she said that to include mortgages in the FSA represented a crossing of the Rubicon. Students of classical history will remember the great civil unrest and blood-bath that followed the last crossing of the Rubicon. She also said that she was aware of only ``patchy evidence''--I think that was the term--that borrowers suffered under the current regime.
<P>
I take the view, ``If it ain't broke, don't fix it.'' No evidence was offered to the Burns committee--I want to see details of what evidence there is--as to why the voluntary code of the Council of Mortgage Lenders has not worked. It is relatively young and can claim many successes in introducing throughout the mortgage industry a comprehensive set of standards, which did not exist before in what was, I think all hon. Members would freely admit, an imperfect market. The process of properly conducting mortgage sales has been given greater definition, and the actions of intermediaries are subject to greater accountability.
<P>
An independent redress scheme has been introduced it is advertised in leaflets that are made available to anyone who is interested in taking out a mortgage, and I understand that 6.5 million copies have been distributed. Several mortgage intermediaries that were not up to scratch and that should not have been offering the mortgage advice that they offered have been deregistered, and further moves in that direction are promised. So far, more than 4,000 mortgage-selling staff have obtained mortgage qualifications through the CML, and we are promised a training competence requirement for all mortgage-selling staff covered by the code and a much more open process for the disclosure of fees, among other things.
<P>
The code seems to have achieved a great deal in a fairly short time and to be proceeding along the right lines. My question, therefore, is, exactly what has not worked for the entire voluntary code to be so soon turfed out of the window as unsatisfactory? If Paula Diggle   can   describe   the   evidence   for   possible   mis-selling as only ``patchy'', what exactly is the weight of the evidence available? How many of the 1.4 million mortgages sold each year do not meet the code's standards?
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs mentioned, an awful lot of people do not like their mortgages. I should not like a fixed-rate mortgage that was fixed a year or so ago at 10.5 per cent. against a floating rate that can be achieved now of about 6 per cent. However, I would not have been mis-sold such a mortgage, had I taken it out; it would have been right for me at the time, and times change. If interest rates rise--and they still might under this Government--to, say, 15 per cent., a 10.5 per cent. fixed-rate mortgage might be an attractive choice. How is the code not working so far?
<P>
I should also like further details about how the ubiquitous CAT marks are supposed to be applied to mortgages. They have not proved a success as applied to the ISA market. How do the Government intend to avoid giving the impression that CAT marks constitute a guarantee of suitability in an imperfect market?
<P>
It will be problematic to include mortgages in the FSA's responsibilities. In the Burns committee, Howard Davies and members of the financial services consumer panel were not keen on including mortgages in the FSA framework for the simple reason that the FSA already has the most enormous job--some Opposition Members would say too much of a job--to undertake with a stretched staff of up to 2,000, including, at the latest count, 200 vacant positions; an enormous rule book still under construction; and the most enormous gamut of financial service products and firms to regulate. Before it is even properly up and running with the teeth that the Bill will provide, we are considering imposing an enormous raft of new work.
<P>
It has been estimated that the inclusion of mortgages will require an extra 250 staff and may cost the FSA up to £50 million. How will it be paid for? Many mortgage firms already, presumably, subscribe to the FSA. Will the additional subscription fees received from mortgage companies that will now have to sign up to the FSA cover that extra cost? If not, the impact of including mortgages in the FSA's responsibilities will affect the entire financial services community, the costs on which we debated in the weeks leading up to the summer recess.
<P>
Originally, I took the view that ``if it ain't broke, don't fix it'', as many mortgages are already covered under the FSA remit for endowment mortgages. Also, I think that the Consumer Credit Act 1974 covers mortgages of up to £25,000. In many instances, therefore, mortgages are already covered by the existing regulatory framework.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I do not want to reopen an interesting debate that took place at the end of the previous Session, but I should mention mortgages on the internet. Many Committee members will be aware that the great Rupert Murdoch has set up an internet mortgage business, in association with a Japanese firm, which sells mortgages into the United Kingdom market. Before the recess, hon. Members identified many problems in the regulation of financial services and products sold from other countries through electronic media. As such problems will increasingly arise in relation to mortgages, the FSA will have to take on a raft of new work. Has the Minister considered that?
<P>
The hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable) mentioned the vested interests of mortgage lenders. I should like to deal with the hon. Gentleman's point slightly differently. The mortgage companies that have most keenly welcomed regulation under the FSA are, in the majority, big firms on whose profit margins the costs of a bit of extra regulation will not impact substantially. We should consider companies such as Halifax, a highly reputable mortgage provider--it provides my mortgage--which already has 20 per cent. of the mortgage market.
<P>
Choice, diversity and value for money for the consumer should be encouraged. That is what the Bill should be all about. I fear, however, that the big mortgage lenders will use extra regulation to drive out smaller players who want to come into the market legitimately and who live up to some of the voluntary standards promoted by the CML.
<P>
How does the Minister intend to achieve a balance between encouraging competition and not giving an advantage to the big boys? Such an advantage could enable them to crowd out smaller players with every right to be in the market and whose success can be judged on their market success and on the market share that they take to their customers. During the summer, it became evident that some mortgage companies think that they can come under the respectability--if that is the right word--of the FSA umbrella without being fully regulated under the rules applied to many other financial product companies. Such companies think that a softer touch regulation will apply under the FSA umbrella, while it gives them a statutory respectability not provided by the CML voluntary code. That worries me. Surely, if companies are regulated under the FSA, they will be fully regulated with all the rigours of the various comprehensive powers in the Bill.
<P>
Will the Minister deal with some of those genuine concerns about how the Bill will work in practice? Many people seem to be warming to the idea that mortgages within the FSA will be a good thing, but I am still a sceptic. Will the system work in practice, and will the customer get a better deal?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I rise in support of my hon. Friends, who have asked for clarification. During the summer, the Treasury indicated that it wished in principle to bring the mortgage industry under the Financial Services Authority, although it was uncertain about the timing. The Treasury consultation process finishes at the end of the week. The Financial Services Authority was known to be rather more cautious in the knowledge that it had a great deal to do to make sense of its existing and inherited obligations. It doubted whether taking on additional staff, with the management time that that would entail, was necessarily wise at this juncture. However, it has now been reported in the press that the situation has altered. The Treasury is cautious, while the Financial Services Authority, as reported in The Independent, has
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``backed calls for statutory regulation''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Minister should tell us exactly what is going on: what is the colour of the smoke coming out of the Treasury chimney? Like my hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Mr. Loughton), I am cautious because regulations are usually big-business-friendly and small-business-unfriendly and it is sometimes in the interests of very big market players to raise the cost of entry into a market. Mrs Diggle of the Treasury made that point in a Treasury-sponsored conference on the subject. She also said that evidence of widespread mis-selling or abuse is patchy. She would not have made that comment without at least some knowledge of the responses to the consultation paper, so it seems that the Treasury is going cool on the notion of taking in the new area of financial regulation.
<P>
We do not require a definitive answer today and the Minister will undoubtedly take refuge in the fact that the consultation exercise is still underway. However, it is not right that the market, the public and the press should be told about matters of which the Committee is left in ignorance. It would at least be courteous for the Committee to be told what is happening as is its right.

<P>

<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I thank Opposition Members for their contributions. It is clear from their comments how many arguments exist and how balanced the many sides of the debate are. Opposition Members who were not, as I was, present at the seminar yesterday will not be surprised to learn that Treasury officials made no announcements yesterday. As is normal practice, we merely opened up the debate. I shall attempt to answer the main points made by Opposition Members
<P>
The amendment seeks to clarify the inclusion of mortgages within schedule 2. The hon. Member for Twickenham has ably put the case in favour of the regulation of mortgages by the FSA. However, the amendment is unnecessary. Paragraph 23 of the schedule refers to loans secured on land and clearly covers house purchases. The Treasury therefore has the discretion to include that form of lending in its regulated activities orders, when the Bill comes into force, or in the future.
<P>
However, the hon. Gentleman raised several points about why mortgages should be regulated, to which I shall respond. <P>
As hon. Members will know--several have referred to it--the Treasury is engaged in a consultation exercise to assess the case for regulation. A discussion document which was published in July seeks evidence of if and in what way consumers suffer damage in the present mortgage market. The deadline for responses is the end of this week, and we intend to announce our decision by the end of the year.
<P>
The Treasury genuinely wants to hear all points of view, which is why we held a public seminar yesterday, with speakers from all sides of the debate. The FSA explained what effect regulation could have on the mortgage industry and published its cost-benefit analysis. It is inevitable that costs will fall to consumers. However, the existence of the Council of Mortgage Lenders' code, to which the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham and other hon. Members referred, should reduce the costs of compliance. The cost of regulation would differ according to how light a touch was used and the methods of delivery.
<P>
The FSA also identified some benefits from regulation. They include enhanced competition, whereby improved information to consumers would enable them to see how their products compared with others. If they were not getting best value for money they would be likely to move to competitors. Statutory regulation would also reduce scope for individual consumer detriment, as ``best advice'' rules would be put on a statutory footing.
<P>
We believe that statutory regulation should not increase the cost of mortgages with the result that they are materially less affordable. Care would have to be taken to ensure that regulation delivered those benefits and did not impede competition. The Treasury is taking the FSA's analysis into consideration as part of the consultation exercise.
<P>
We also heard yesterday from the Halifax, the largest firm in the market, and one of the newer players, Direct Line. The intermediaries' concerns were explained by a representative from Allied Dunbar. Finally the National Consumer Council made the case for consumers. It was an evenly balanced presentation and debate. The seminar was a valuable exercise, encompassing the concerns of all parts of the industry and consumers. There was much informed debate and it certainly gave us much food for thought.
<P>
The mortgage market is highly competitive, with about 120 lenders selling some 4,500 products. There is also an astonishing array of products on the market. Mortgages can be standard variable interest rate, fixed rate, capped, flexible, discounted, stepped and current account. There are also mortgages for those in negative equity.
<P>
Of course that can be confusing for consumers, but it also shows the innovative and competitive market that has grown up without regulation. We would not want to over-regulate and end up stifling that vibrant market. The Treasury is also consulting separately on CAT standard mortgages. A document was published on 13 October.
<P>
For many people, taking out a mortgage loan is the biggest financial transaction they will undertake in their lifetime. Almost 11 million people now have mortgages. The institutions providing those mortgages, the banks and building societies, are already regulated as financial institutions. An increasing amount of mortgage business, however, perhaps as much as half, is introduced through financial intermediaries, many of whom are not financial services specialists. There is also legislation or regulation covering aspects of consumer lending or certain products associated with mortgage lending, such as endowment policies. The main aspect of the business--advice on and the marketing of mortgages--is at present covered by a voluntary code devised and monitored by the industry itself.
<P>
I am pleased to see the industry making efforts to protect the consumer in this area. However, with our recent experience of pension mis-selling fresh in mind, it would be shortsighted of us not to take the opportunity under this Bill to have powers for the statutory regulation of the selling of mortgages, if that proves necessary. Whether we need to use those powers will depend on whether the code is working and, if not, how the consumer is affected and how best it can be put right.
<P>
It would of course be entirely inappropriate to prejudge the results of the consultation exercise, which we are approaching with an open mind. Indeed, our debate this morning has shown how a whole range of issues will need to be weighed up. The outcome will determine whether we decide to invoke the powers we are reserving under this Bill statutorily to regulate the selling of mortgages. That is why, although we appreciate the Joint Committee's reasons for suggesting that we take a decision in principle now to bring mortgage selling within the scope of regulation under the Bill, we were unable to follow that recommendation.
<P>
However, our policy on mortgages does not end at looking at the merits of regulation. As I mentioned, we have proposed a new CAT standard for mortgages. It will be used to set standards for fair charges, easy access and decent terms and will put borrowers in the driving seat. CAT standards will be easy to understand and prevent confusing marketing and hidden charges. It is important to make a distinction between the mortgage product and the selling to which the regulation relates.
<P>
It is vital that consumers are able to choose the right mortgage. I have just said how important mortgages are in the eyes of most consumers. Our proposed CAT standards should help them make the right choice. There is no suggestion that CAT equals good and everything else equals bad, but rather that CAT means clarity, no surprises and no hidden clauses and penalties. It would be straightforward for consumers to understand what they were receiving with CAT mortgages, which we regard as a benchmark. Consumers buying them will not have to face unfair or complicated conditions that are either hidden or difficult to understand.
<P>
I should like to respond to points about the overall balancing. It is important to evaluate consumer detriment, but also to consider whether regulations should cover such detriment. The cost-effectiveness of regulations should also be put in the balance and we need to maintain throughout the principle of proportionality, which has guided all our actions to date.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I hope that that demonstrates our commitment to tackling the problems in the industry and to making mortgages easier to understand for everyone. We intend to announce by the end of the year our position on regulation. There is no smoke coming from the Treasury: we send smoke out only when we make a decision. It is not smoke of one colour or another, but no smoke at all.
<P>
<B>Mr. Breed:</B> I want to pick up on two rather similar points--one raised by the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham, the other by the Economic Secretary. The hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham effectively said, ``If it ain't broke, why fix it?'' and the Economic Secretary responded by saying that regulation would be provided only if it proved necessary. However, I am worried by our experience of the mis-selling of pensions: problems appeared only late in the day. By the time we get round to implementing regulation, more and more people may already be in the pipeline and exposed to the problem. Thinking of regulation at an early stage is a precautionary process.
<P>
We should discuss regulation now because mortgages are, as the Economic Secretary acknowledged, very different from a few years ago. There  has  been  a  great  proliferation  of  providers and products. House prices are rising and people's long-term   financial   commitment   is   large.   The   long-term nature of the contract, as with pensions, means that people can initially enter a contract in one set of circumstances--individually or in market terms--but then find some years down the line that their circumstances, or those of the market, or indeed both, have changed remarkably. People understandably want to ensure that their initial advice is right, even if they are later subjected to conditions that were not foreseen at the time.
<P>
Due to the proliferation of providers and products, the scope for mis-selling is now far greater. It makes no difference whether such mis-selling or wrong advice is deliberate or inadvertent. The suggestion that people shop around and regularly change their mortgage is not practicable. It is not easy and it can be costly to do so.
<P>
It may be right to say, ``If it ain't broke, don't fix it,'' but we do not know that in advance. If a system breaks down, we often know about it only some years into the process. The mortgage market has changed so significantly over the past few years that the case for regulation--at whatever level--must be difficult for the Government to ignore. The vast majority of people will find it strange, after so much recent debate, that the Government are not intending to act.

<P>

<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I was disappointed by the Economic Secretary's response. I appreciate that she is new to her portfolio, but we made specific comments and questioned her about the evolution of Treasury thinking. We were not asking for a definitive position, but we were surprised that she simply said that mortgages <P>
could be taken into the FSA regulatory system under the Bill--we knew that. We have read the consultation document, so we know what issues are at stake. What is new is the fact that the Treasury now appears to be more cautious than it was in the summer. It is disappointing that the Committee has been told rather less than an outside conference has been told by a civil servant. If the Government's attitude persists, our consideration of the Bill will take much too long. If we are to be expected to legislate, we must be told what is happening. If outsiders are told things that we are not, we shall start our proceedings in a most disappointing atmosphere.
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I  am  sure  that  the  right hon. Gentleman understands very well that no announcements were made to the seminar yesterday. I can only reiterate the point that I made earlier: we are still thinking about things. That is right and proper given that the consultation exercise is still under way. It would not be surprising if the Treasury were thinking about the issue as we speak. The idea that the right hon. Gentleman is missing some announcement is a mistake--none has been made. I have no specific, concrete detail with which to furnish him at this point because we are still balancing all the issues that hon. Members have rightly weighed up in our discussion this morning.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> We all appreciate the fact that the Treasury is still formulating its thinking, but has a specific assessment been made of whether the FSA can, practically, take on the work load now or in the future? Presumably, calculations have been done about everything right down to the office furniture space to determine whether the FSA could take on the whole raft of regulation. Or have none been done?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> Obviously, the detail is a practical issue for the FSA. It has examined the matter in outline. Discussion of the office furniture is a long way off because we have not yet decided exactly what to do about the issue. We are considering the results and evidence that have been presented to us. At the end of the day, it is for the FSA to decide how it responds to the practical side of things. It has made public statements about its position. Obviously, I have done the cost-benefit analysis. That is in the public domain, so I need not rehearse it here. If we decide to go down the path that we have discussed, it will be for the FSA to decide how to regulate. Proportionality will dictate how it approaches that task. Work is in progress on the issue.
<P>
On the other issues that hon. Members raised, people did not usually recognise that they stood to lose out as a result of pensions mis-selling or know how to sort the problem out. There is a real difference between mortgages and pensions in that regard. Many people understand that remortgaging is possible and often easy and that it can be done at low cost. There is, therefore, a marked difference between the two areas.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> When should we expect a Government announcement on the issue, and what form will it take?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> The hon. Gentleman needs to listen a little more carefully to what I am saying because I have already said at least twice that we will make an announcement by the end of the year.
<P>
The hon. Member for South-East Cornwall asked about the time scale. The FSA would need to authorise firms and to consult on the rules to be introduced. The date of 2002 quoted in the press is an indicative guess by someone rather than a proposed timetable, were we to go down that path. I inject that note of caution about timetable dates. The announcement at the end of the year should answer the question about timetables.
<P>
<B>Dr. Cable:</B> I want to express appreciation of some of the comments that have been made. The hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs is always thoughtful on such matters. Some of the qualifications and reservations voiced are important and must be reflected in the style of regulation, if it is introduced. I have some sympathy with the concerns but I doubt whether they amount to a case against statutory regulation.
<P>
The issue still confusing me is whether the Government have made up their mind about having statutory regulations. The Treasury, as the Minister rightly said, has not issued smoke on the subject. However, some members of the Government have spoken. On 29 September, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry said that the Government would stamp down on rip-off mortgages. He did not say how that would happen, but he did imply that his Department's powers relating to regulation were insufficient. Other members of the Government are making the running on the issue while the Treasury is holding back. As the right hon. Member for Wells said, we are a little concerned about where the Government are going on these matters.
<P>
The other matter is timing. The Minister was helpful in stating clearly that we would have an answer just before the new year. That is an advance. The question that arises over timing is, what would happen to voluntary regulation if there were a long hiatus between the announcement and the introduction of statutory regulations? The industry is criticised for being widely non-compliant, and surveys have confirmed non-compliance, but if and when a commitment to statutory regulation is made, the industry will have no incentive whatever to police its own practices, and there could be a long period during which consumers would have no protection at all from mortgage scams and other abuses. If the Government make up their mind to act, they must do so quickly and reduce the lead time to phasing-in to the FSA. Although we may have come to different conclusions, there is consensus that the way in which the system is to be regulated is an important issue. It must be done in a way that protects consumers but is also inexpensive and carried out with as light a touch as possible.
<P>
I offer a final thought. The Minister will meet some of us tomorrow afternoon about another aspect of competition in the mortgage market, and the question whether mutual building societies big and small will be able to continue competing with the banks will be significant in ensuring that there is proper competition, and that oligopoly--if there is such a phenomenon--is broken. I hope that the Government will be as forthcoming on that issue as they have been reluctant on this. I see no point in pressing the amendment to a vote because the Government will reach a decision within months, if not weeks, but I appreciate the opportunity to air and debate the issues.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> Despite the impression that the hon. Member for Twickenham intends to withdraw his amendment, I should like to make a couple of brief points. We are working across various Departments to put this proposal together. The Department of Trade and Industry is involved because of its remit from the consumer perspective and colleagues in the Department for the Environment, Transport and the Regions are also working on the matter. Our common goal is to provide for fair selling practices by mortgage lenders and an improvement for consumers in the process of house buying and selling. However, because of the way in which Departments are divided up, that has to be achieved across a number of Departments.
<P>
I am reluctant to spend much time discussing hypotheticals but I shall briefly deal with the hiatus mentioned by the hon. Member for Twickenham. The Council of Mortgage Lenders has said that it would be willing to maintain a voluntary regime if and until regulations are introduced. CAT standards would also provide a non-regulatory underpinning to the consumer's perspective.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
If the hon. Gentleman were to press the amendment to a vote, I would urge my hon. Friends to resist it. However, I understand that he is not going to do that.
<P>
<B>Dr. Cable:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 204, in page 195, line 23, leave out from `provision' to `as' inline 24.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss Government amendment No. 205 and amendment No. 179, in page 195, line 46, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(6) Any order which purports to make an activity a regulated activity which is not investment business under the Financial Services Act 1986 on the date section 17 comes into force shall cover only that activity.
<P>
(7) Any order made under section 20(1) shall contain the statement by the Treasury referred to in sub-paragraph (2) above, unless in the opinion of the Treasury it would not have the effect referred to in that sub-paragraph.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> Two Government amendments are grouped with a Conservative amendment. I shall speak to the Government amendments before expressing our thoughts on amendment No. 179.
<P>
Government amendments Nos. 204 and 205 are technical amendments that make it clear that the power under clause 20(1) to define the scope of regulated activities under the Bill may be used to make consequential, transitional or supplemental changes to the Bill and to secondary legislation made under it, as well as to other primary and secondary legislation. That is essential to ensuring that the power may be used to extend the scope of regulated activities under the Bill, if so desired.
<P>
There may be a need to make amendments to primary legislation relating to the new regulated activity and to the Bill, to make any extension workable. That will ensure that the regulatory regime works in relation to the new regulated activity.
<P>
For example, were we to make consumer credit a regulated activity--I am not suggesting for one moment that we will--it would probably be necessary to make changes to the Consumer Credit Act 1974 to avoid double regulation. We might also need to amend the Bill to reflect borrowers becoming a class of consumer. I urge hon. Members to accept the amendments.
<P>
Amendment No. 179 relates to paragraph 26 in schedule 2 and deals with a matter raised by the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire (Sir N. Lyell) when the Committee last sat. As Committee members know, our starting point--with exemptions for Lloyd's and possibly for mortgages--is broadly to produce the scope of existing financial services regulation, which is currently regulated by several measures.
<P>
Amendment No. 179 would result in one order being used to deal with matters covered by the Financial Services Act 1986, another to deal with deposit-taking and a third to deal with insurance contracts. Furthermore, should we decide to make financial services such as pre-paid funeral plans and mortgages regulated activities, it would require separate orders to bring them within the scope of the Bill.
<P>
We are trying to achieve a single up-to-date order that constitutes a definitive statement of the scope of regulated activities. I am sure that the right hon. and learned Gentleman is aware of that, as it has discussed at length during our debates on clause 20.
<P>
The schedule sets out the kind of activities that the Treasury, following a parliamentary debate, may bring within the scope of regulated activities under clause 20's order-making power. That is an important improvement to the current position. Unlike schedule 1 of the Financial Services Act 1986, which may be amended by delegated legislation, clause 20 allows us to produce a single order with a definitive list of regulated activities. Everything will be in one place, avoiding much of the confusion that has resulted from a multiplicity of orders under the 1986 Act.
<P>
The purpose of the schedule is not essentially different from that of schedule 1 of the 1986 Act, but its mechanisms are different. The latter schedule contains a list of regulated activities that can be increased or decreased, so it is not a definitive statement of regulated activity, which is determined by a combination of schedule 1 and numerous orders. We are moving towards a simpler and more user-friendly way of setting out regulated activity. Therefore, for reasons of simplicity and user-friendliness, I ask Opposition Members to withdraw their amendment.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The Bill departs from the precedent of the previous legislation, which was to have as much as possible in primary arrangements. That has been changed to having everything controlled by Treasury orders being brought before Parliament. Our amendment has been designed to improve the process of parliamentary control. We suggest that if it is proposed that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a regulated activity which is not investment business under the Financial Services Act 1986''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
should be regulated, it must be brought to the attention of Parliament rather than simply put through on a general list of orders. The insertion of paragraph (7) to schedule 2 would mean that whenever a proposed order extends the authorisation requirement by bringing in a new activity, the Treasury must state that it does so and bring into play the need for positive resolution of each House.
<P>
The Minister seems to be saying that in the interests of not having divisions of orders, it does not matter if new areas are swept in under a general list of orders. However, we believe that including a territory that has not been covered previously should be done by primary legislation. If it is to be done by secondary legislation, as proposed in the Bill, there is a powerful case for it to be done separately and in a full parliamentary manner.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> That would result in a conglomeration of orders. The problem with the 1986 Act is that it is almost impossible--except privately--to get hold of a definitive set of such things. They are messy and difficult to use. They are privately produced--I believe that there was a reference to ``open-minded'' instead of ``open-ended'' investments, which is not helpful. We believe that our proposal is the most helpful and straightforward way to proceed, so we shall resist amendment No. 179.
<P>
We have no intention of concealing what we are doing. The order-extending regulation will be subject to affirmative rather than negative resolution and all the issues will be exposed as part of the parliamentary process. I hope that that reassures the hon. Gentleman and encourages him not to press his amendment to a vote.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> On the understanding and undertaking that when new areas are brought into the Bill's remit, such intent will be made clear by the Treasury and that the matter will be given specific parliamentary time, rather than being wrapped up in a list of other orders, I shall not press my amendment to a vote.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Amendment made: No. 205, in page 195, line 26, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) Provision made as a result of sub-paragraph (1)(f) may amend any primary or subordinate legislation, including any provision of, or made under, this Act.'.--[Miss Melanie Johnson.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Question proposed, That this schedule, as amended, be the Second schedule to the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I am aware that we have debated the schedule at some length, so I shall not weary the Committee by repeating our requests.
<P>
This is an opportunity for the Government to restate their commitment to consultation on both the schedule and clause 20 because these matters have led to disquiet in the City and elsewhere. The schedule shows up the Bill's excessive reliance on secondary legislation, which is one of its worrying features. It is a framework Bill, and much of its meat will be in subsequent orders.
<P>
That is inevitable to some extent. We all recognise the need for a degree of flexibility as markets develop and new products become available, to which the legislation needs to respond. Against that, we need to know the limits of FSA powers and to define the obligations and powers that it and the Treasury have, so that financial institutions and the investing public know where they stand.
<P>
In several places in the Bill, the Treasury has wandered a little too far from defining those powers in primary legislation and gives a great deal of power to itself and the FSA to bring forward matters in secondary legislation, which we all know is seldom scrutinised and debated. It is purely at the Government's discretion as to whether even affirmative orders are ever debated. It is important to know as much as we can about the limits and scope of the Bill at this stage.
<P>
The schedule is remarkable in that it does not set out the scope of the Bill with any exactitude. The explanatory notes state that the schedule indicates
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the broad scope of activities which are potentially regulated under the Bill.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Therefore, items in the schedule will not definitely be regulated, nor is there a limit on what can be regulated. As we saw under clause 20, there is a specific power to extend regulations into any other field. I was puzzled by another sentence in the explanatory notes, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``However, the general nature of the activities set out in the Schedule serves as a limitation on the extent of the Treasury's power to bring further activities within the scope of the Bill.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I wonder whether that is the case. If it were, we would be better disposed towards the schedule. Although it does not assert that such activities will definitely be regulated, if the explanatory notes were true, it would at least set a limit on the Bill. There is a conflict between the explanatory notes and clause 20, which states the opposite--that there is no limit. Therefore, the schedule is purely illustrative. I have never met a schedule in another Bill that is simply a wish list--a general list that can be added to or subtracted from, or that will never be passed into law. It is a remarkable way of proceeding.
<P>
The Government helpfully suggested in July that there will be some safeguards, as they intend to consult on these matters. It would be useful if the Minister would restate the Government's intention to consult on changes in the scope of the Bill and assure us that the results of that consultation will be published, so that the outside world can see what the Government or the FSA intend, the responses to it and the subsequent decision.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
That consultation is intended to take place when the FSA changes its rules, which we shall come to in clause 25. However, if the Government intend to consult on this part of the Bill, it would go some way towards meeting our disquiet about a schedule that does not define or limit the scope of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> At the heart of schedule--and clause 20, to which it relates--lies a risk. Requiring Treasury exemptions and orders rather than including such provisions in the Bill may result in a different problem from the one that the Bill seeks to address. We understand the logic of taking that approach rather than continuing what has been done in previous legislation; it will avoid matters getting out of date and will retain some flexibility. We all know that the last such Bill took a long time to correct previous primary legislation. Amendment No. 118 on Treasury consultation was not accepted, so we still do not know whether such consultation will be adequate and whether its fruits will be as satisfactory as dealing with the matter through primary legislation. I shall illustrate that by reference to some of the territories that are dealt with in the schedule.
<P>
Paragraph 2 deals with investments. It would seem that a company that wishes to issue its own shares will need to be authorised. That question was raised by the industry. After laborious research, we finally found an exemption in the draft order. However, the exclusion of the issuing by a company of its own shares was not found in the text but at paragraph 162 on page 23 of the order. That matter is crucial to the venture capitalist industry, but those who need to find the rules are no better served by the new approach of burying them at the bottom of large exemption orders than by attempting to include such key matters in the Bill.
<P>
I turn to another territory. Paragraph 2 includes
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``an investment which is a contract of insurance, that includes the carrying out of that contract.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
My question relates to our earlier debate on mortgages. Do the Government propose that the Treasury should require insurance companies to advise policyholders when they terminate or discontinue a policy that they have an alternative to redemption by selling those insurance policies in the market? That is one of the claimed problems with endowment mortgages. Could that territory come within the Treasury's powers under the Bill? Are the Government thinking of doing anything about that?
<P>
Paragraph 3 relates to arranging issues in shares. No exemption is prescribed, as it was in schedule 2 of the Financial Services Act 1986, for small corporate finance angels organising money-raising for small companies with the legal issues handled by authorised persons. In our sittings before the recess, we touched on whether the business exemption would exempt Members of Parliament from potentially committing a criminal offence in that area. The position of business angels needs speedy clarification in the schedule and in clauses 19 and 20. The definition of someone ``accepting deposits'' is anyone who pays interest, on terms under which the borrowing is repaid. We found exemptions in the draft order for casual deposits, a company one-off and estate agents. What about letting agencies and travel organisations--an issue that I have raised elsewhere? Will the whole territory be addressed with regard to deposit-taking?
<P>
We are also concerned about double regulation. Paragraph 11, which deals with securities, includes in its definition of a company
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``any unincorporated body constituted under the law of a country or territory outside the United Kingdom, other than an open-ended investment company''--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
a specific open-ended investment company. That would include a venture capital limited partnership. Paragraph 16 also covers limited partnerships, under its definition of collective investment schemes. Which is applicable or are both applicable? Are the restrictions on a collective investment scheme the law? Are other double regulation mistakes hidden in the list of illustrative territories?
<P>
Under the order-making process prescribed in schedule 2, the Treasury can define as it wishes any activity of a specified kind or any investment and make what exemptions it wishes. The process of parliamentary control prescribed under the schedule could also have the practical effect of no parliamentary control. An order of 60 pages could be laid before Parliament, which will be able only to say yea or nay--not, ``We like this bit, but not that bit''. There will not be significant opportunity for debate--even though most orders will no doubt be sensible and we are assured that there will be broad consultation. However, the process is by no means democratically perfect in bringing into law items that would otherwise be primary legislation.
<P>
To conclude, there is little choice between the approach taken up to now, of using primary legislation, at least to address key issues, and that taken in the Bill, which relies very much on secondary legislation. The argument espoused for that, apart from the ones about the problems that we experienced with primary legislation last time round and about the need for flexibility, is that times and markets will change. The Treasury is not infallible and doing things in the way prescribed will cause substantial problems. Some issues may be addressed tardily and without adequate parliamentary control.
<P>
I shall end my remarks with reference to the comments of my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells. As the democratic aspects of the matter will be dealt with not by Parliament, but through consultation within the industry, the consultation process is crucial. Even though amendment No. 118, which the Opposition tabled, was not agreed to, I hope that the Treasury will follow similar arrangements to those envisaged within it.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I thank hon. Members for their questions and comments. I shall do my best to deal with the points made by the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs, although there were many of them.
<P>
The exemption in the 1986 Act on the issue of shares by a company is contained in paragraph 28 of part V of schedule 1 to that Act. The Government are managing to achieve something rather less obscure in the Bill. We do not intend to hide any matter away, but, given the complexity of the legislation and the topics with which it deals, we believe that our approach will enable us to take account of points such as those that have just been made.
<P>
The hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs referred to business angels. During debate on clause 19, which dealt with the prohibition on financial promotion, the Government made it clear that we shall consult in due course on the terms of appropriate exemption under that clause. I hope that that deals with the point to the hon. Gentleman's satisfaction.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman also spoke about the scope of the draft order. It is worth reminding him that my predecessor gave the Committee assurances in relation to his anxieties, which are shared to some degree by other hon. Members. She said that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``just as we have consulted on the initial draft scope order, we shall, naturally, consult when it is appropriate to do so. It is important to do that so that not only hon. Members but practitioners, consumers and other interested parties have an early opportunity to comment before a new order is laid. Through the normal process of parliamentary scrutiny, we shall be fully accountable for the exercise of the powers that the clause confers.''--[Official Report, Standing Committee A, 22 July 1999; c. 381.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
My predecessor has already given those important, general assurances.
<P>
I shall go into the matter in a little more depth. If the hon. Gentleman is desperate to hear it, I can give him much more detail--I have some fascinating stuff. I should give at least an outline of that detail, in response to the hon. Gentleman's points and those made by the right hon. Member for Wells. No provision in the schedule limits the powers conferred by clause 20(1). Parts I and II set out in general terms matters in respect of which provision can be made under clause 20(1). That is provided for in paragraphs 1 and 10 to the schedule, which also make it clear that the lists contained in parts I and II are not exhaustive. In that sense, the schedule does not limit the powers conferred by clause 20(1).
<P>
There is, however, a limit to those powers. The Bill does not enable the Treasury to bring any activity whatever within the scope of its regulatory regime. The schedule assists in determining the scope of the Treasury's powers by giving a general indication of the sorts of activities that Parliament considered appropriate for regulation under the Bill. Should the Treasury be minded to bring within the scope of the regulation an activity that is not described in general terms in the schedule, it will have to ask whether it can reasonably conclude, on the basis of the types of activity set out, that the new activity is of the sort that Parliament intended to be capable of being covered by the Bill's regulatory net. <P>
Thus the schedule as a whole will assist the Treasury and ultimately the courts to determine the scope of the Treasury's powers under clause 20(1). That is indicative of the four corners of those powers. I will go into detail about that if hon. Members would like me to.
<P>
The powers will work alongside one another. In the general scope of the Bill, that provides a way to be more specific about how matters will be carried out.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I was disturbed by the comments made by the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs about the fallibility of the Treasury. I do not know how he could make such remarks, and we could not agree with them.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman talked about open-ended investment companies. We published proposals for regulated activities in February, which is an indication of our good intentions and practice on the matter.
<P>
On a wider point, I shall take the opportunity to outline further proposals regarding the recognised professional bodies. I believe that hon. Members have had details from the Government about aspects of that subject already, and they are no doubt aware that we have discussed the matter with industry representatives. I should like to outline our new proposals for the regulation of professional firms. We will table any necessary amendments in due course but, in terms of the Bill's structure, it seems appropriate to mention the subject now.
<P>
In our consultation on the scope of regulated activities we have sought to define such activities in a way that minimises the need for unnecessary regulation. Our objective is entirely consistent with the conclusion of the Joint Committee in relation to professional firms. The Joint Committee's report stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``We support the Government's intention to ensure that authorisation is not required unnecessarily and urge the Treasury to ensure that its intentions are carried out.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In the light of responses to that consultation and following careful consideration of the matter, we have decided to adopt a modified approach.
<P>
We propose that accountants, solicitors and other professionals will not be regulated by the FSA for financial services when they are not carrying out mainstream financial business. There will be full FSA regulation of professional firms doing mainstream financial services business, as is the case for other financial services firms. The FSA will indirectly oversee other financial services activities carried on in the course of the legal, accounting or actuarial professions, such as the execution of clients' instructions in the purchase or sale of a company, or settlements arising from the execution of wills or divorce proceedings.
<P>
Firms that pass a series of tests will fall outside the scope of the regime. That is in addition to the exclusions that we have already proposed, such as those for professional firms that arrange deals with or through authorised third parties. The tests, which are yet to be set out in legislative form, are: that the activity be carried on by a member of one of a prescribed group of professions; that the activity be provided in an incidental manner in the course of a professional activity; that it be carried out on an ancillary and subordinate basis in the course of providing professional services to a specific client; that the professional does not receive any benefit other than from his client; that he does not hold himself out as providing regulated activities as a separate service; and that the activity does not relate to sensitive retail products such as life insurance. It is in relation to such products that the need for consumer protection is greatest, so any professional firm involved in selling them or advising on them should be authorised. I believe that that broadly reflects the tenor of existing regulation for the relevant professional bodies.
<P>
We are confident that the exemption should result in authorisation being needed only for professional firms engaged in mainstream business, such as solicitors managing clients' investment portfolios or giving discrete financial advice. It is difficult to be precise about numbers, but the FSA estimates that it will authorise about 2,000 firms. That would leave about 13,000 professional firms currently regulated by the recognised professional bodies whose activities could be subject to a lighter touch regime. Examples of relevant activities include when solicitors' advice on a matrimonial settlement involves the disposal of shares or where an accountant provides a service to a business which includes certain kinds of corporate finance advice that could fall within the financial services legislation.
<P>
On FSA oversight, many of the firms that will benefit from the exemptions will still carry out activities for which firms that are not members of the professional bodies will need authorisation. So, some FSA oversight is needed as an essential counterweight to the proposed exclusion from FSA authorisation. Therefore, we propose a new arm's-length regime, which is based loosely on the Bill's arrangements for the oversight of Lloyd's.
<P>
We intend to place a duty on the FSA to keep itself informed at a general level of the regulated activities that professional firms carry out under the exclusion. That duty will be backed by an obligation on the professional bodies to co-operate with the FSA and, critically, by reserved powers for the FSA. Those will include powers to bring classes of firms or activities within the requirement for authorisation and to prohibit members of the professions from carrying on particular activities if, in the light of experience, that proves necessary to protect consumers. The factors that the FSA will need to take into account will include the quality of arrangements for complaints handling and consumer redress. Those are important for consumers, and improvements might be needed in some cases.
<P>
On disclosure, the consumer will need to know whether a professional firm is exempt from authorisation. Firms that rely on the exemption should be required to disclose that fact, particularly to ordinary consumers. We intend the FSA to make rules that require professionals to disclose to their customers whether their adviser is regulated by the FSA. Such legislative provisions aim to allow the relevant bodies themselves to enforce the requirements.
<P>
The proposals have considerable cost advantages. The costs faced by the 13,000 or so professional firms that will benefit from the exclusion will be lower than the cost of full authorisation. The cost of the FSA's general oversight will have to be met out of a levy on the professional bodies.
<P>
The arrangements reflect our on-going approach to modernising financial services regulation--a light touch where possible, with consumer protection where necessary. Where members of the professions are engaged in mainstream financial services business, such as arranging life insurance, personal pensions or managing investment portfolios, their clients will still need--and, under these provisions, will still get--the same protection as other consumers. We will ensure that that happens.
<P>
The FSA will shortly consult in detail on its proposals for regulating members of the professions who carry on financial services business.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 181, in page 10, line 22, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(aa) that he believed on reasonable grounds that no approval was needed; or'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment is straightforward. It would add, as a defence, the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``reasonable grounds that no approval was needed''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
At present, clause 23 provides a defence against criminal charges by referring to a non-authorised person who makes a financial communication taking reasonable care to avoid committing an offence. The amendment would make it clear that such a defence would also apply where the unauthorised person reasonably believed that an exemption applied or that approval was not needed because the information that was given was not intended to lead to an investment agreement. Given that the penalties are criminal, such a defence should also lie within the Bill.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> We have come back to a familiar friend of the Committee--financial promotion.
<P>
Clause 23 deals simply with the consequences of breaching the basic financial promotion prohibition, which is set out in clause 19. I am sure that no one in the Committee wants the moving of amendment No. 181 to re-open the extensive debate that we had on that clause before the recess.
<P>
Members of the Committee will recall our lengthy debates on clause 19. Given the Herculean scale of the task ahead in the coming weeks and months, it would be a pity if our debate ranged over old ground. In any case, you would not allow that, Mr. Atkinson. I am thus trying hard to resist the temptation offered by hon. Gentlemen to spend time dwelling on the important and well received changes that the Committee made to clause 19 before the recess, when we considerably narrowed its scope on two fronts.
<P>
Hon. Members will recall that, as a result of Government amendments, the clause now more clearly catches only ``promotional'' material--material that invites or induces a person to enter into an investment agreement. It is also now limited to communications made
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``in the course of business''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Members of the Committee should also be pleased to be reminded that we intend in due course to publish draft secondary legislation relating to clause 19 to deal with consultation. That will be a follow-up to the constructive consultation paper on financial promotion, which we issued in March this year. So there will be a chance for further consultation on financial promotion, but I hope that hon. Gentlemen will agree that now is not the time to open up old debates on clause 19.
<P>
I am not persuaded that amendment No. 181 is appropriate. The grounds in subsection (2)(a) and (b) already provide an adequate defence, giving a safe harbour when a person reasonably believes that a communication has been prepared or approved by an authorised person, or that the person concerned has exercised all due diligence to avoid committing the offence.
<P>
The amendment could weaken the onus on persons to take reasonable precautions or to exercise due diligence in ensuring that they are not committing an offence. I am worried about weakening the provisions, which have been carefully designed to achieve the right balance between reasonableness and certainty for unauthorised persons, and a sufficient incentive for them to ensure that they do not break the law. We have that difficult balance just right. I notice that Opposition Members have not adopted the same stance in clause 21, which relates to a breach of the basic prohibition in clause 17 and reflects the current position on authorisation breaches under the Financial Services Act.
<P>
In that light, I hope that Opposition Members will withdraw the amendment. If not, I ask my hon. Friends to vote against it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I am not sure, but I think that I heard the Minister suggest that subsection (2)(b) covers circumstances in which a person has sound reasons for believing that an exemption applies or that the information is not intended to lead to an investment agreement, so long as those reasons are bona fide and that the person has done his homework and taken precautions. If the clause does not exclude that line of defence, we would be happy to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I am pleased to confirm that the hon. Gentleman's understanding of what I said is correct.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

No. 186, in page 10, line 29, leave out `purchaser' and insert `counterparty'.

<P>
No. 193, in Clause 26, page 11, line 33, leave out `purchaser' and insert `counterparty'.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I am disappointed that my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for North-East Bedfordshire is not with us this morning to give us the benefit of his legal input. The amendments in the group relate to clauses 25 and 26 as well as to Clause 24. They share the same objective--to substitute ``counterparty'' for ``purchaser''. First, it is inappropriate to use the existing shorthand of ``the purchaser'' to refer to someone who sells securities to a person who contravenes the general prohibition. Secondly, the amendments cover the use of the term ``provider'', although that could be just about workable. Even someone who enters into a client agreement with a firm can be regarded as the ``counterparty'' in relation to that firm because the firm is the other party to that agreement.
<P>
These are legal drafting amendments, and I hope that the Government will accept that the word ``counterparty'' is better than the word ``purchaser''.
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> The amendments seem to be largely matters of drafting. Amendments Nos. 182, 186, 189, 191 and 193 simply take one term defined for the purpose--``purchaser''--and substitute another--``counterparty''. In doing so, they conflict with amendment No. 110, which uses the term ``purchaser'', but I recognise that that reflects the fact that amendment No. 110 was tabled earlier. Either way, however, we do not recognise that the amendments would have a substantive effect.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 109 and 110 are also unnecessary. Clauses 24 and 25 make it clear that the agreements are
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``unenforceable against the other party (`the purchaser').''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The purchaser will have a right to have his money back and/or to compensation, and the courts have discretion to determine the amount of any compensation if necessary. It is therefore clear that clause 26(3) covers only enforcement by ``the provider'' against ``the purchaser''.
<P>
We intend to introduce our own amendments to the clauses, the substance of which I shall set out in the context of the next group of amendments. In doing so, we shall of course bear in mind the points that Opposition Members have raised, but in the meantime I invite the hon. Member for Arundel and South Down to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> On the understanding that, as the Economic Secretary has just said, the matter will be considered in the Government's subsequent proposals, I am happy to beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 185, in page 10, line 28, at and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`without the leave of the court'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss the followings amendments: No. 188, in clause 25, page 10, line 42, after `(b)', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`which he knows was entered into'<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 190, in clause 25, page 11, line 1, at end insert
<P>

<P>
No. 108, in clause 26, page 11, line 19, after `may' insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`determine that no compensation is recoverable and'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 135, in clause 26, page 11, line 26, leave out from `retained' to end of line 32.
<P>
No. 136, in clause 27, page 12, line 26, leave out from `that' to end of line 44 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`it is just and equitable to do so.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 111, in clause 27, page 12, line 26, after `applies' insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`or that it is just and equitable to do so where the person making the communication or causing it to be made believed on reasonable grounds that the contents of the communication had been approved by an authorised person'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Again, this is a series of legal amendments, to clauses 24, 25, 26 and 27, bracketed together and mainly raising the same issues. Amendment No. 185 would insert after the word ``the purchaser''
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``without the leave of the court''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
to make it clear that the courts can allow the agreement to be enforced, as clause 26 spells out.
<P>
There is a debate about whether the amendment is necessary, and I suspect that the Economic Secretary will argue that it is not. I am sad that my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for North-East Bedfordshire is not here to reinforce the legal arguments about its necessity. We raise the matter through a probing amendment because there is some question about whether the courts' powers should apply in such circumstances.
<P>
Amendment No. 188 would insert after ``(b)''
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``which he knows was entered into''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Clause 25 provides for an agreement made by an authorised person to be unenforceable if the intermediary that he used should have been authorised but was not. That is reasonable, but it seems unfair for clause 25 to apply if the authorised person did not know that a third party had acted as intermediary. In such circumstances, the authorised person would not have asked the intermediary to market the investment and would not have paid him, except perhaps for a general commission payable to third parties on application for units in an authorised unit trust or for a life policy.
<P>
As we see it, although it would be possible to apply to the court to enforce the agreement, it would seem much more appropriate for the provider not to have to risk a court taking a rather strange view of what had happened and refusing to endorse the agreement. Unless subsection (4) is amended as proposed, by deleting the enforcement conditions in paragraphs (a) and (b), the enforcement condition could not be satisfied unless the provider knew that a third party was involved.
<P>
Amendment No. 190 would insert the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``without the leave of the court''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Amendment No. 135 would restrict the enforcement conditions that need to be satisfied before the agreement can be enforced by the court to where it is just and equitable for it to be enforced. It should not be necessary to have to come within the circumstances currently set out in paragraphs (a) and (b). Amendment No. 136 would restrict the enforcement conditions that need to be satisfied before the agreement can be enforced by the court to where it is just and equitable for it to be enforced and it should not be necessary for it to come within the circumstances set out in clause 27(5), (6) and (7).
<P>
The earlier amendments essentially reflect the points covered in the later amendments.

<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> We will doubtless convey at some later date to the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire his hon. Friend's desire for his presence.
<P>
The amendments go to the heart of the purpose of these four clauses. The clauses deal with the enforceability of contracts where there has been a breach of the general prohibition under clause 17 or the financial promotion prohibition under clause 19. They start from a presumption of unenforceability, but provide a degree of discretion to the courts to enforce the contracts. The amendments address that role for the courts in enforcing, or not, such contracts.
<P>
In dealing with the amendments, it might be helpful if I set out some of the background and general policy behind the clauses. The Committee should be aware that the Government have been giving further consideration to the clauses and we propose to table amendments to rationalise how they work. When I describe what we propose to do, Opposition Members may conclude that their amendments should not be pressed.
<P>
Our general aim in approaching the provisions has been to rationalise the existing provisions under the Financial Services Act 1986 in keeping with the new structure of regulation and the new regime for financial promotion. The same objective would seem to underlie some of the amendments, in particular Nos. 135 and 136, so I am hopeful that we can find a way forward that will command the Committee's full support.
<P>
In seeking to rationalise, we have borne in mind the principal objective of the existing enforceability provisions, which is to reduce the uncertainty in financial markets which may result from the fact that contracts entered into by a person doing illegal financial services business are unenforceable by him at common law.
<P>
That is important. The provisions can clearly act as an additional disincentive to illegal behaviour, and would certainly give some additional pause for thought to providers outside the UK's jurisdiction. However, I would like to make it clear that we do not see them in terms of a disciplinary weapon. The principal issue is certainty.
<P>
As other members of the Committee may be aware, it is not unusual for the courts to decide that contracts entered into in contravention of a statutory prohibition, such as clause 17, are unenforceable. For example, contracts entered into in breach of section 2 of the Insurance Companies Act 1982 were held to be unenforceable prior to enactment of the Financial Services Act 1986.
<P>
The existing provisions quite rightly retain that presumption of unenforceability. People should not generally be able to enforce contracts so as to profit from their illegal activity. In addition, the existing provisions ensure that the innocent party can recover his funds or obtain compensation. However, they also provide the courts with limited discretion to allow the contract to be enforced. The basic intention behind these complex provisions is to give certainty about the circumstances in which such contracts may be enforced in an area where undue uncertainty can damage confidence in the markets.
<P>
This basic approach continues in the Bill. The presumption of unenforceability in section 5 of the Financial Services Act 1986 is retained, as it should be, but the courts will have discretion to enforce when a person can show that he reasonably believed that he was acting legally, and the courts are satisfied that enforcement is just and equitable. This also follows the approach in section 5 of the 1986 Act. We see no reason for different unenforceability provisions for illegal financial services business and the new concept of illegal financial promotion. We therefore propose to table amendments aligning financial promotion with the financial services business. This may involve some recasting of the clauses.
<P>
Broadly similar considerations apply to contracts resulting from illegal activity by a third party. However, the 1986 Act makes contracts potentially enforceable where the prospective enforcer did not know that anything illegal had taken place. This difference in approach between a first party breach and a third party breach reflects the idea that a person has a greater responsibility to enquire into the legality of his own actions than into those of others. We think that that is the right approach; we concluded that we did not have the correct balance here. At present, clause 26(4)(b) gives the court discretion to enforce where the provider
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``did not believe, and had no grounds for suspecting, that the third party was ... contravening the general prohibition''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Compared with the 1986 Act, the wording of subsection (4)(b) narrows the circumstances in which the courts have discretion to enforce. More specifically, it effectively requires authorised persons to act as the FSA's eyes and ears, and to check up on any suspicious circumstances. We did not intend the provisions to be used in that way.
<P>
We propose to revert to the wording of the 1986 Act which makes third-party contracts potentially enforceable where the provider did not actually know that anything illegal had taken place. We will table amendments to this effect in due course. These should meet the concerns underlying amendments Nos. 188 and 135. On that basis I hope the Opposition Members will agree not to press those amendments.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 136 and 111 relate to where a third party has breached the financial promotion prohibition. They align the position with that which they propose for first-party breaches by extending the courts' discretion.
<P>
In our view, that would increase uncertainty.
<P>
We have sympathy with the Opposition's desire to align the tests more closely. The focus of clause 27 on the effects of a promotion rather than the knowledge or culpability of the provider, is inappropriate. We find no justification for the current difference of approach between the provisions for contracts entered into as a direct result of illegal financial services, and illegal financial promotion. We therefore propose to introduce amendments aligning the approaches, using the actual knowledge test. We do not think that the reasonably believed test is the most appropriate test where the provider is not the person who committed the breach which would be the case if we accepted amendment No. 111. We did not think it appropriate to go the other way and rely solely on the ``just and equitable'' test. In the light of my comments and the general tenor of our rationalised approach, I hope that hon. Members will withdraw these amendments.
<P>
We have reviewed the way in which the provisions operate and made proposals for further rationalisation. I believe that the changes go a long way towards meeting Opposition Members' concerns.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I thank the Minister for a learned discourse on legal issues which have been the fruit of the lawyers who advised us. I know that the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``will revert to the 1986 Act principles''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
will be music to the ears of most of them.
<P>
As you noted, the crucial issue to which they all relate is certainty of contract. I would be grateful if the Minister could say when the Government's amended drafts are likely to be forthcoming. Will it be on Report? I understood her to say that their amendments will address most of the legal issues that our amendments raise. In the light of that promise, we are relieved not to have to press our amendments.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> Let me just confirm that we intend to introduce our amendments on Report.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 184, in page 10, line 37, after `question', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`or would be so if it were not for the exclusions (other than in relation to investments) in an order made by the Treasury under section 20'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We are concerned that, without the addition of the words in the amendment, the scope of the marketing restrictions will be substantially reduced. Marketing restrictions are supposed to protect investors and can therefore be much wider in principle than the business authorisation requirement. That is the position at the moment because investment agreements include agreements for an activity that would be authorisable if no exemption applied to it. However, the exemptions in the definition of investments are outside the marketing restrictions. The amendment's convoluted wording attempts to achieve the same result and tracks the structure of the draft regulated activities order that the Treasury has issued. Under the Financial Services Act, the extension of the definition of an investment agreement applies to the marketing restrictions that are now replicated in clause 19.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I must admit that we had some difficulty understanding the intention behind amendment No. 184. We take its aim to be to make it clear that the term ``regulated activity.' is to be interpreted as excluding any activities that are excluded from the general prohibition by virtue of an order made under clause 20.
<P>
We certainly sympathise with that aim. It should be clear that, for instance, a company that issues its own shares and which would not be required to be authorised under our proposals, should not be liable to find the sale of those shares unenforceable. So there is no difference between us on the substance. The provisions should apply only where there has been a breach of the general prohibition.
<P>
The amendment should not affect the financial promotion regime, but it should be made to clause 27.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Tyrie </B>(Chichester): Will the Minister table it?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> The hon. Gentleman invites me to do with alacrity something which I fear that I must resist. We were not proposing to accept the amendment, as I was about to make clear, but perhaps I should just finish what I was saying. I draw hon. Members' attention to the fact that the provisions should apply only where there has been a breach of the general prohibition. That is the effect of the Bill as it stands and is implicit in the term ``regulated activity''. There is, therefore, a risk that the amendment could introduce new and unhelpful uncertainty into clause 24 or clause 27.

<P>

<B>Mr. Flight:</B> rose--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman proposing to ask leave to withdraw the amendment?
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I was thinking on my feet. We are happy to ask leave to withdraw the amendment, on the basis that the Government will at least reflect on the point that it made, which had perhaps not been fully considered. I hope that they might revert to the amendment if they feel that it has any substance. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 187, in page 10, leave out line 38.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to consider amendment No. 192, in page 11, leave out line 11.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> It is unclear why an investment agreement should be enforceable if it is for deposit taking. The agreement could state that the deposit is to be repaid in six months or a year's time, and as the person with whom the deposit is made should have been authorised, surely the depositor should be entitled to get his money back immediately. Amendment No. 192 covers the same territory.
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> The amendments would apply the unenforceability provisions to contracts entered into in the course of carrying on an unauthorised deposit-taking business. Currently, such provision is specifically excluded from the scope of clauses 24 and 25, which deal with first hand and third party breaches of the general prohibition. The provisions do not, therefore, determine the circumstances in which an illegal deposit-taking contract can be enforced.
<P>
I have recently written to the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire about the issue, who is sadly not present to debate it. The right hon. and learned Gentleman asked why deposit taking was excluded, which is a good question. The Bill reflects the approach of the Banking Act 1987, which does not include equivalent provisions to section 5 of the Financial Services Act 1986. We understand that the thinking behind that approach was that the nature of a deposit-taking contract was such that it was difficult to conceive of circumstances in which the depositor would seek to challenge enforcement of the contract. After all, an illegal deposit taker will have the depositor's money, and the depositor will no doubt want it back.
<P>
In carrying forward existing provisions, we have, therefore, excluded deposit taking. However, the helpful letter from the right hon. and learned Gentleman has prompted further reflection. It appears to us that conceivable circumstances exist in which a depositor would wish to challenge the terms of a deposit contract. For instance, a depositor may wish to challenge a contract that prevents withdrawal except after a specific period or on specific dates. The exclusion of deposit taking would appear especially unfair if customers who had made other investments were able to retrieve their funds under the clause while the depositor was left locked in.
<P>
The normal presumption of unenforceability might tell in the depositor's favour, but that does not address the issue of certainty, which is the principal aim of the provisions, as I explained earlier. We have discussed the matter with the Bank of England and the Financial Services Authority, and have concluded that there is no justification for maintaining a difference in treatment. The money markets are important, and certainty is as crucial in this sector as in any other.
<P>
We shall, therefore, table amendments to ensure that deposit taking is treated in a comparable way to other regulated activities. That may require more than deletion of the two subsections that the amendments seek to remove. It may be necessary to provide explicitly for the depositor to be able to break the contract. I hope that the Opposition will agree to ask leave to withdraw the amendment in the meantime. I am sorry that the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire is not present to witness his effect on the Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I again regret deeply the absence of my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for North-East Bedfordshire. It is an especially nice note on which to conclude the Committee's first sitting after the recess to hear that the Government understand that the amendment deals with a big underlying issue, and that they will therefore address the matter rather more fully than our brief proposal. It is complicated territory, but the enforceability of agreements should include the whole money market and deposit-taking area. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 194, in line 22, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(ca) a person qualifying for authorisation under Schedule 5;'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
A UCITS--undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities--manager, trustee or depository qualifies for authorisation under schedule 5 in exactly the same way as EEA firms and treaty firms qualify under schedules 3 and 4. It should therefore be included in clause 28.
<P>
The structure of the authorisation is complicated. Under the Financial Services Act 1986, the firm applies for authorisation and is then allowed to do any investment business covered by the permission granted by the regulator. Under the Bill, however--perhaps because of the structure of the 1986 Act--the firm will have to apply for permission and it will become authorised when it receives that permission.
<P>
The part IV permission referred to in clause 28(1) is the normal permission that firms apply for to carry out one or more regulated activities. It is referred to as a part IV permission because part IV of the Bill deals with permissions. It seems that each of the permissions for separate activities under part IV are treated as a single part IV permission. After the first granting of permission, applications are made to vary the permission, and when the last remaining permission under part IV is about to be dropped, an application is made to cancel the part IV permission.
<P>
The firms that qualify for authorisation do so by reason of their status, and they have not needed to apply for permission. Instead, those firms are to be permitted to carry on the particular activity in relation to which they are deemed to be qualified for authorisation. Although it is a schedule 3, 4 or 5 permission, and not a part IV permission, schedules 3 and 4 give automatic authorisation under EU law. Schedule 5 gives automatic authorisation for the manager, trustee or depository of a qualifying investment fund; they are referred to in the 1986 Act and the Bill as collective investment schemes.
<P>
The EU UCITS directive applies to qualifying UCITS that are open-ended and authorised in their home member states for marketing to the public. The shares, units or other interests in the firm must be redeemable at the option of the investor, and it must raise its capital from the public. The UK investment funds that qualify as UCITS under the directive are authorised trusts and UK OICs--open-ended investment companies.
<P>
If a UCITS is authorised for such marketing in its home member state, and if it meets various conditions on its investment policy and borrowing powers and certain structure requirements, it is authorised under the EU UCITS directive for marketing to the public in all member states. The schedule 5 authorisation seems not to be limited to investment funds qualifying for that use of the directive, although it may be limited to them by order of the court.
<P>
That rather technical elaboration is a background to the amendment, which may overlap some mightily complicated debates on schedule 3, which I hope we may reduce at subsequent sittings.
