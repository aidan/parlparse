<P>
Question again proposed, That the amendment be made.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 137 to 139, 144 to 146, 52, 53, 147, 54, 148, 149, 55, 56, 260 and 153.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor </B>(Solihull): Good afternoon, Mr. Atkinson. I have a couple of points to make on clause 46, but I will not delay the Committee for long. Although the points are of a legal nature, I believe they are of general interest--it will be for the Committee to judge whether that is so.
<P>
I said at our previous sitting that I speak only for myself in these matters. Were I to allow myself the liberty of voting as I wished, I would probably vote against clause 46, but I know that I would be alone among my colleagues in doing so. The Government, rightly in as much as they want the Bill to go through--no one wants that more than the Minister--could not possible allow contracting out. Once they established in their own minds that they wanted a national minimum wage, they could not allow contracting out because that would be a breach of the dam and there would be a cascade of persons seeking to operate outwith the Bill.
<P>
It is interesting that clause 46 sets in close companionship matters to which the hon. Member for Wentworth (Mr. Healy) has already drawn attention in an enlightened intervention. He is clearly part of the new enlightenment in industrial relations and employment law. I hasten to assure him that I did not mean that sarcastically. There are a number of cross-party issues of interest to those who want to improve on old ways and bad practices. If the hon. Gentleman and I were having an informal conversation in another context, we might be surprised by how much we agree.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman drew attention to the treatment of those who give advice in a traditional way--on instructions from a client in return for a retainer or fee--in paragraph (4A)(a) of Government amendment No. 138 which refers to a qualified lawyer. Such a person gives advice for a fee and is liable for any consequences that may flow from that advice, in particular negligent consequences of bad advice. There is also a reference to those who give advice in circumstances where the Bill says there is no question of a payment being made, which includes law centres and citizens advice bureaux.
<P>
There is a contradistinction between the advice given for money and that given necessarily freely. Until 1963, the treatment of the advice given in each case would have been entirely different. The giver of advice given for a fee was liable for the consequences and wrongness of the advice. The giver of free advice was rendered in no way liable in negligence. Gratuitous advice was of no consequence. In other words, the advice that one did not pay for is worth what one paid for it--nothing. Then along came the interesting case, with which I know the hon. Member for Aberdeen, Central (Mr. Doran) is familiar, of Hedley Byrne and Co. Ltd. v. Heller and Partners Ltd. The learned law book says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``that decision of course remains a landmark which shattered the assumption that the tort of negligence did not extend in any circumstances to the protection of purely economic interests.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We are talking about the protection of economic interests. To some degree, the part of the Bill that concerns unpaid advice remains dependent upon that case remaining a cornerstone of English law. The case was a great surprise at the time. I was a law student in 1964, and it was considered to have turned important principles upside down.
<P>
I shall not discuss the point any further, but I offer the Government the thought that part of their Bill depends on a controversial decision.
<P>
<B>Mr. Frank Doran </B>(Aberdeen, Central): This is a simple and parochial point, from the point of view of a solicitor of the same standing as the hon. Gentleman, and one who also gave up his practising certificate 10 years ago. The hon. Gentleman mentioned that the Hedley Byrne case had come as a surprise. It did not surprise Scots lawyers. It developed the duty of care principle that had been introduced into English law by the Donoghue v. Stevenson case, which was a Scots case determined in the House of Lords. In effect, the Committee is now discussing the same principle--a duty of care that will apply to advice services. All lawyers, as advice givers, are familiar with that logical principle.
<P>
<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> That was an especially helpful intervention. The hon. Gentleman may be surprised if I say that I have always considered that Scots law is in many respects superior to English law. That opinion was reinforced when I was junior Minister to the Lord Chancellor. I must not digress into tales of Lord Chancellors, except to say that I think that Lord Atkin presided in the case of Donoghue v. Stevenson. He cited the parable of the good Samaritan in his rationale, by way of explaining what one's duty ought to be from first principle. He stopped a little short of that parable, but he certainly did not walk by on the other side.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Boswell </B>(Daventry): I have been following the debate with increasing admiration for the luminescence of the legal brains on both sides of the Committee Room. Will my hon. Friend confirm that the point about which he is anxious is that persons acting with good will, provided that they are reasonably competent, should not be dissuaded by a fear of action being taken against them?
<P>
<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> I take my hon. Friend's point. I am aware of medical negligence cases in which off-duty doctors are almost reluctant to give advice. We are perhaps straying from clause 46; my hon. Friend brings me back to the important point of indemnity.
<P>
The Shirley citizens advice bureau in my constituency, or the law centre in the constituency of the hon. Member for Wentworth, must face the prospect of having indemnity against that possibility that one of their workers might give wrong advice. Will the Minister reflect on the fact that he or his fellow Minister at the Department of Trade and Industry is the Minister with responsibility for the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux? I am sure of that, because I had that role. I seek the Minister's guidance as to whether that organisation secures collective indemnity, or ensures that individual bureaux seek that required indemnity.
<P>
It is presumptuous of me to offer advice to the Government, but I should perhaps suggest that the Minister or his ministerial colleague send a circular to people who give advice in the circumstances under discussion, reminding them of the provisions of the clause as amended and that their indemnity should be in order. Such a circular would be a good idea, particularly as the Government are determined to get this Bill, and get it they will.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> Good Afternoon, Mr. Atkinson. We enjoy your company again. I hope that you enjoy ours as much.
<P>
We have had a gentle meander, probing the issues relating to the clause. The concept, principle and structure of the proposal to extend the advisory role of people other than solicitors has all-party support, so long as their skills and knowledge have been tested and approved, there is an indemnity--a duty of care, as the hon. Member for Solihull (Mr. Taylor) said--and the advice proffered by advice centres is free.
<P>
I hope to persuade Conservative Members that the proposal is legitimate and will safeguard the rights of employers and of those seeking redress. The proposal is about solving disputes without taking legal action or going to a tribunal, either internally through company procedures or externally through the Employment Rights (Dispute Resolution) Bill.
<P>
The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond) asked why trade unions do not charge for services. Have I got that right?
<P>
<B>Mr. Philip Hammond </B>(Runnymede and Weybridge): To clarify, I said that citizens advice bureaux and similar organisations would be specifically precluded from charging whereas trade unions would be allowed to charge.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> The hon. Gentleman has misread the role of trade unions. They provide services to members for which members pay a fee. On occasion, trade unions advise people, whether they are members or not. They continue to give initial help and advice on injuries and accidents at work. We want a definition which does not allow exploitation by people charging for advice.
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Wentworth said, it must be clear in subsections (4A) (b) and (c) of amendment No. 138 that someone who sets up an advice service must not charge fees. The system is based on conciliation. The proposal is clear: advice services in respect of this defined area must be free to prevent exploitation. That does not affect lawyers, who give a range of advice or assistance and may charge a direct fee. There is an agreement between them and the Lord Chancellor's Department.
<P>
We intend to ensure that the writ for advice centres such as the CAB to give such advice is not undermined by organisations and individuals setting themselves up as advisers and claiming a fee for their advice. That would damage the scheme's credibility. The subsections are positioned to prevent that from happening.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The Minister explained that aggrieved workers could get advice from a number of possible sources including lawyers, who might charge them, and trade unions, which might not. It would therefore seem--I suspect that the Minister will want to draw this conclusion--that it is a good bet for them to subscribe to trade union membership. If so, will he confirm that the Government's proposals on trade union recognition are going forward unchanged from their manifesto proposals--yes or no?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I will answer the question in my own way, if the hon. Gentleman does not mind. When a member pays into a trade union, whether or not it has a collective agreement, whether or not it is recognised and irrespective of the arrangement with the employer, the agreement is between the member and the trade union. A member will receive all the trade union's services, irrespective of whether it is recognsied by the employer. The issue of recognition is separate and the Government have made it absolutely clear that we will bring forward recognition proposals. We said so in our manifesto and we have said so since.
<P>
The fairness at work White Paper will be produced in the first half of this year and after consultation, we will move to legislate. The issue is not whether we will do it, but when it will happen. That is the Government's position and I make no apology for it. It is critical that if we believe in people being able to join a union, and if a majority of the work force want to do so, they are entitled to do so effectively. The hon. Gentleman knew that that was our position, but it was a nice try.
<P>
The hon. Member for Ashford (Mr. Green) mentioned associated employers in a bloodcurdling way, as if it was a potential minefield for the Government. If the hon. Gentleman had contained himself for a moment and read over the page, he would have noticed that the issue is fully covered by subsection (6), which sets out the definition in detail. I do not want to read it into the record, but if the hon. Gentleman reads it, all will be revealed.
<P>
The hon. Member for Solihull asked about the consequences of advice and liability for it. The covered risk is the risk involved in giving advice. Given that we are dealing with the national minimum wage, that will be a small risk in almost all instances. However, it is a risk on which the insurance industry with its skills and knowledge will come to agreements and it will provide certificates for insurance or indemnity accordingly. No one has yet seen that as a difficulty. It is an arrangement whereby if the duty of care fails, people who have suffered a detriment resulting from such a failure are covered. It is important that when we ask people to take a new course of action to ressolve disputes in a non-contentious way, all sides are protected from a failure of the duty of care.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> The Minister is explaining his position coherently. I agree with his assessment of the scale of the risk. Does he think that it is a good idea, as the Bill comes into force, to send out a circular to the people who give that kind of advice for nothing, reminding them that their indemnity tackle is in order?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I can go slightly further than that. Once the Employment Rights (Dispute Resolution) Bill reaches the statute book, the Government intend to consult with all interested parties, including the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service, to ensure that proper advice is given about the scheme and its operation. I am certain that that will be done comprehensively. The hon. Gentleman's point was well made.
<P>
On the second part of the hon. Gentleman's point, we shall soon reach a clause that concerns resources and advertising the minimum wage, and we shall deal with how to implement the minimum wage effectively. The hon. Gentleman might want to probe me on those issues when we reach that clause.
<P>
I hope that I have been able to answer hon. Members' queries. I will finish by putting on record his colleagues' thanks for the tremendous work that my hon. Friend the Member for Wentworth has done, in co-operation with Lord Archer of Sandwell, in steering the Employment Rights (Dispute Resolution) Bill to the point of becoming law. It is unusual for new Members of the House to get an opportunity to do that. My hon. Friend has been able to do so at an early stage and on a measure that will assist thousands of people whom we might not have been able to assist under the present arrangements.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I would like to associate Conservative Members with the praise that has been given for the achievements of the hon. Member for Wentworth. He has considerable form and expertise in trade union matters, in which he has been involved at a high level. At the same time, I would like to thank the Minister of State for his constructive replies, which have been some of the best that we have had in the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I offered them without any indemnity.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Chidgey </B>(Eastleigh): I have just a few brief points. First, I have no problem with the intent of clause 46.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Atkinson. I have just checked, and I think that the Committee has approved amendment No. 143, which I have not moved formally yet. In the interests of fairness and proper procedure, can you confirm that that is the case, Mr. Atkinson?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The Minister moved it formally.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> As on the selection paper, I was expecting that amendment to come up in a separate group. I know that I am causing trouble for myself, but I should like us to be clear about this.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I was seeking advice. It was moved formally. Does the Minister have a problem with that?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> The only reason that I mentioned this is because it was separated out on the amendment paper. I did not want anyone to think that I had pulled a fast one after the amendments had been read out.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Amendment No. 140 was selected for debate, and it was moved formally with, I think, the agreement of the Opposition.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> As I was saying, I have no particular problem with the intent of clause 46 on restrictions on contracting out. I understand its intent and, in the context of the Bill, I subscribe to it. However, I seek clarification from the Minister on the way in which the first two sentences of the clause may affect volunteer workers whom we discussed earlier in our proceedings, particularly under clause 41.
<P>
Clause 46(1) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Any provision in any agreement (whether a worker's contract or not) is void in so far as it purports--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) to exclude or limit the operation of any provision of this Act''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>That is fairly clear. The Minister has already told us that he will look again at clause 41 with regard to a number of difficulties that have arisen on the definition of volunteers. He may wish also to look at another problem that could arise in that voluntary workers could have contracts. If so, they would presumably have a worker's contract and a problem could arise in the structure of the Bill. Although we might wish to provide a different form of agreement with regard to how voluntary workers have their expenses paid or receive honorariums, we would not wish the contract in itself to be voided in terms of exclusions, limitations and operation under the Act. It is a bit complicated, but I hope that the Minister can follow my line of reasoning. It is intended to be helpful, so that when the problems in clause 41 are considered, we can ensure that there is no adverse spin-off in clause 46.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I shall raise two brief points on the clause. I understand its purpose, and we have no problem with the principle that contracting out should be restricted--at least, those of us who are not legally trained do not. However, because of the Bill's overall operation and the way in which it may be possible for a contract that has been conceived not as a contract of employment between the parties to it to come within the scope of the Bill, such a contract could be treated as a contract of employment by virtue of the the extended definition of ``employee'' in the Bill.
<P>
A contract which contains other provisions relating to the settlement of disputes or contractual disagreements may none the less be caught within the scope of the Bill and the employer, if I may use the shorthand term, may find that he is subject to a double jeopardy. Because contracting out of the Bill's provisions is not allowed, he will be subject to all the procedures laid down within it, but he may still be subject to the procedures laid down in the contract, which would have been drawn up on the understanding that it was outside the scope of the Bill.
<P>
I do not know of a solution to that problem, or whether it is a real problem, but I ask the Minister whether anything can be done to ensure that when a contract, which is not on the face of it an employment contract, is caught within the scope of the Bill, either the dispute provisions within the contract or the terms of the Bill prevail, but the employer is not subject to both.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Briefly, I will deal with the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge. I suspect that the safeguard is in subsection (1), which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Any provision in any agreement (whether a worker's contract or not) is void in so far as it purports|to exclude or limit the operation of any provision of this Act''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In other words, if the provision concerning anything else of a general or commercial nature, it would not be so secure. I hope that the Minister has now received advice on that point and will be able to give a more authoritative response.
<P>
On the point made by the hon. Member for Eastleigh (Mr. Chidgey), we had a great deal of consensus on the issue of charities, so I thank him for his acuity in spotting the issue and I agree with his concerns. It is important that if an alternative regime needs to be provided for charities, it should not get caught in the Bill's claws in a way that would nullify its beneficial effect.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Lansley (South Cambridgeshire):</B> My point follows the one just made by my hon. Friend. Unlike other parts of the Bill, particularly following its amendment, the clause makes reference to ``employee or worker''. That is curious because ``worker'' is subsequently defined as including an individual who is under contract, so the reference to ``employee or worker'' seems excessive. Will the Minister explain why that reference is made? If the term ``worker'' were used throughout, it would make it clear that the Bill is intended to cover not only employment contracts but other workers' contracts, which we will discuss on clause 51.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> This will be a short debate. The hon. Member for Eastleigh raised the issue of volunteers. He mentioned that, perhaps, to get further assurance that the commitments I made on clause 41 were genuine--they are. We are taking the matter so seriously that before I met the hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) and the hon. Member for Eastleigh, as I agreed to do, we will consult voluntary organisations on how to proceed. That seems reasonable. I give further assurance that that meeting will take place and I will arrange it with mutual agreement as soon as I can. The hon. Gentlemen can then determine whether they think the Government are dealing adequately with that issue. Hopefully, we will be able to take a common approach, but if not, I am sure that the hon. Gentlemen will vociferously express their views about what the Government should do.
<P>
The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge raised the issue of contracts. Contracts will have to be amended to take account of the minimum wage, where applicable. That is part of the advice that will be given. Therefore, if a contract stipulates a rate below the minimum wage, the employer must make the appropriate amendment.
<P>
As the hon. Member for Bosworth kindly pointed out, the other issues surrounding contractual arrangements but not pertaining to the application of the minimum wage are not included in the clause. The position is quite clear. The hon. Member for Bosworth also raised the issue of volunteers.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Bercow </B>(Buckingham): He is the hon. Member for Daventry.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I apologise. I am not going to raise the issue of battles again-the note has arrived.
<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry asked about volunteers. I have dealt with that and there is nothing I can add. The hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) asked about the term ``employee or worker''. That was used for clarity of drafting. It is so clear that the hon. Gentleman distinguished both in his contribution, so the drafting has worked.
<P>
We went through the principles and it would be nonsense for me to put on record again the good reasons behind the clause. With some good grace, I shall sit down hoping that my hon. Friends and Opposition Members will agree to the clause standing part of the Bill.
<P>
Quetion put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 46, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 47</center></H4>
<H4><center>Publicity</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 236, in page 29, line 11, after `appropriate', insert `and economical'.
<P>
We have just discussed a consensus clause and I must tell the Minister of State, the hon. Member for Makerfield that I hope that that can continue. Publicity clauses occasionally give rise to ill feeling. I give him a piece of free, unsolicited and certainly unindemnified advice: I have always had to get myself into the trick of describing people by their constituency so that I did not forget it; indeed, I encouraged my officials to do the same. The Minister can think about that unless and until the procedures of the House are modified, but I seek no advantage over him.
<P>
We must address this necessary clause to which we propose a modest amendment that would give the Secretary of State another little tire to consider. The word ``economical'' could be read as mean spirited, scrimping or inadequate, which is not the intention, or as cost-effective or appropriate. I intend the latter.
<P>
The amendment probes the Minister's intention.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Is it not my hon. Friend's understanding that who undertakes publicity or advertising will be determined by the normal process of market testing?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The Minister will have to answer that question. Even if the words ``and economical'' were addded, I should be suspicious, perhaps more so than my hon. Friend, of phrases such as
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``information about this Act and regulations under it to be published by such means as appear to the Secretary of State to be most appropriate''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I was firing a warning shot. We shall hang on the Minister's words.
<P>
It would not be appropriate--I am not even sure whether it would be economical--for the Secretary of State to say, for example, that the whole emphasis should be placed in Tribune.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that not only would that be inappropriate and uneconomic, it would most likely be ineffective?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I realise that new Labour does not take much notice of Tribune, which is a pity--[Interruption.] I am smoking them out. I was seeking to move the amendment in an anodyne and middle-of-the-road way. We shall see how we get on with it.
<P>
The Minister needs to explain the term of art
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``such means as appear to the Secretary of State to be most appropriate''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We need to put it on record that there are rules about the use of Government publicity, although there are sometimes controversies about whether they are complied with. Officials and the Cabinet Office have rules, and officials have occasionally been known to cough discreetly and say, ``I don't think that you should do it quite like that, Minister'' to a Minister who intended to put all the advertising in a journal that was associated with his own party. It is important that we should have those assurances and that those procedures should be in place.
<P>
On a slightly wider point--I should stress that this is not the same point--will the Minister say a little more about how he conceives the business of a publicity campaign? He must have given some thought to that because the financial memorandum contains an estimate of &#163;2 million for the initial campaign. That figure must at least have been put on the back of an envelope; there must be some reason for its appearance.
<P>
I am interested not only in where the money goes, but in the kinds of media and, by inference, the persons whom the Minister wants to target. I would not be surprised if the Minister said that he was anxious for workers to have their rights under the Act, and I do not object to that. That is appropriate because the Act, as the Minister sees it, will be about individuals' rights, and they should be apprised of that. In certain cases, they will be told more about that by their agents and their trade union--whether recognised or not--and by local advice bureaux and the local and national press.
<P>
In fairness to Government Departments, they are no longer stuffy about the media that they use. When I was a child, there was a programme on the wireless called ``The Announcements'', which was immensely pompous, totally boring and which, I am sure, was never listened to, save by accident. In it, well-meaning persons, who probably also appeared in films that caricatured the civil service, such as ``Passport to Pimlico'', made announcements about the public good on subjects such as the level of rations for eggs or the number of tokens required for welfare orange juice. That was done in a terribly boring and old-fashioned way.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> On that theme, although I cannot promise to cast my mind back to the programme that my hon. Friend mentions, does he remember the perfectly charming individual who, in his inimitable monotone, made the announcements each morning during the Falklands war?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Indeed, I shall never forget that. In view of present preoccupations, however, neither my hon. Friend nor I will wish to dwell on that.
<P>
I simply want to say to the Minister that it is sometimes necessary to make full use of the modern media. They are not cheap and I am not saying that everything has to be put in 10-second spots on television.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> My hon. Friend makes an important point about modern media. Does he also recognise that Government advertisements and publicity tend to the drier because they are constrained to providing information and do not sell a product?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I was coming to precisely the point that my hon. Friend has made. I almost expected him to say that some Government announcements tended to the drier because they needed to cater for the South Cambridgeshire market, but that would have been unworthy and inconsistent with my hon. Friend's character. I am stirring up dissent on this side of the Committee and, as we have already nearly had a Whips' revolt, I will leave the point.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The debate is on a narrow amendment, but we have wandered to Cambridgeshire and the Falkland islands. It would be helpful if we came a little closer to home.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am coming straight to the point. I was provoked by the intervention made by my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire.
<P>
We need to know roughly why the Minister has chosen the figure of &#163;2 million for his initial publicity, how he intends to target it, and what media he will use. They will, I hope, include all the audio-visual media. He can put the publicity on the internet comparatively cheaply if he wants to, although not many individual workers will read it.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> It just occurs to me that if the Government are to make the most original use of this campaign, might it not be appropriate to write the necessary messages on the millennium dome?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> The Bill will be an Act by then.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I notice two things about that--first, the great faith of the Chair and secondly, the Minister's assurance from a sedentary position that the Bill will be an Act by the time the millennium dome is completed. That may well be the case. There are a variety of ways in which this could be done, and we need the Minister to tell us more about it.
<P>
I come now to the point about propaganda which was anticipated by my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire, who has now left the Room in disgust. I hope that there will be an information campaign; I said that I did not want it to be a stuffy campaign. We may see a figure like Hector the taxman, although he does not seem to have been as effective as he might have been. However, it is important that the Minister eschews all propaganda. In fairness, and to judge from his recent replies, I do not think that he would like this to appear as heroic workers standing up against wicked capitalists with the Government's assistance. That would be a slightly unfair encapsulation of our exchanges in Committee. The Minister will need to say that there are rights, which the Government have legislated for; they are in a certain form, and this is how workers may wish to inquire about them and make use of them.
<P>
I am conscious of the fact--and I am not getting at one Department through another--that some of the exchanges that I have seen about the Government's proposals for student finance have been somewhat partial in the way that they have been presented. However, I pass delicately on to my next point--to consider the substance of what is to appear in the publicity campaign, which is conveniently set out in subsection (2). Paragraph (a) deals understandably with
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the hourly rate for the time being prescribed under section 1 above''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Although that is important, earlier debates showed that there is a whole complex of different matters around and, to some extent, involved in determining the hourly rate, which will also need some attention. I mention two in particular: first, what are items of relevant remuneration for the purposes of computing the rate which is payable? Almost by accident the other day in the agricultural context--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We are talking about a narrow amendment relating to publicity. If the hon. Gentleman is going to wander off and discuss the clause as a whole, he will anticipate a clause stand part debate. The Chair does not really mind about that, but I remind members of the Committee that if they wander off the amendment on to clause stand part, the chances of the Chair allowing a clause stand part debate will be greatly reduced.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am most obliged, Mr. Atkinson. You have anticipated my intention, which was to speak to the amendment, which is in the widest and most general terms. It talks about publicity that should be appropriate and economical. I assure you that I am not trying to get two bites at the cherry, Mr. Atkinson, but we need to discuss the kind of campaign that the Government have in mind and also what it should be about. In that context, it is not simply about the hourly rate but about the remuneration package. It is also, critically, about pay reference periods. In both those issues--the calculation of how much is paid and the calculation of the pay reference period, which is a standard against which the hourly minimum rate is measured--there is the potential for much dissent and disagreement.
<P>
We need an absolutely straightforward situation, such as the example that the hon. Member for Stockton, South (Ms Taylor) gave the Committee at a very early stage of our proceedings. It is easy to work out the rate for an engineering firm which pays an hourly rate to employees for a given volume of work. But in the catering industry, for example, we do not yet know whether, if at all, tips are to be considered as part of the remuneration, how sick pay is to be calculated and what the relevant pay reference periods are for people whose earnings fluctuate. Those are essential to people's understanding of the legislation and it is important that Ministers give some thought to that.
<P>
There do not seem to be any comparable safeguards or publicity geared towards employers. The Minister may be able to help us on that. I do not want to be paranoid and say that because the Minister thinks that he is extending workers' rights, he is therefore not trying to help employees, but it is terribly important that employers, particularly the smaller ones, understand what is going on and can respond appropriately. As the Minister said, we want compliance rather than enforcement.
<P>
I also hope, because the legislation is complex and the Committee has discussed it extensively, that the Minister will give some thought to ensuring that some simple, perhaps step by step information is made available for lay people, particularly through employment tribunals and ACAS, explaining how their rights may be secured through legal process so that they can mark what is happening. Such help is not always available in, for example, child support cases.
<P>
Finally, the notes on clauses--ever helpful--say that the clause imposes a duly of continuing information. That is odd, because although the first part of part two of the explanatory notes say that, the third paragraph goes on to refer to the explanatory and financial memorandum's projection of a &#163;2 million one-off cost. The Minister is right--he has a continuing duty to inform, particularly if there are adjustments in the hourly minimum rate, but he has not so provided. He should at least recognise that that will form a continuing charge on his budget, and give use some indication of what that might be.
<P>
To summarise, the amendment is a probing amendment, and we hope that it will elicit a satisfactory response from the Minister. We want the publicity campaign to be cost effective and we do not want it to be propaganda. We want it to include employer's interests in compliance, as well as those of employees, and we want it to be a sensible and continuing campaign.
<P>
Mr. Bercow
<P>
: I support amendment No. 236, which strikes me as eminently sensible. I do not suggest that the Government plan to operate uneconomically, by which I mean choosing an excessively expensive agency, nor do I expect them to. Nevertheless, the amendment will flush out the Government's intentions and inquire into their intended approach. If there is general consensus in the Committee that a regard for economy should be one of the criteria by which a judgment about appropriate publicity, the materials and selection of an agency should take place, there can be no objection to the amendment's wording and therefore its acceptance. However, it is a probing amendment, as my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry said, and if the Government can offer a reassuring response, I am sure that my hon. Friends will not want to press it to a vote.
<P>
The clause is entirely unobjectable in motivation and spirit. Clearly, there must be procedures for advertising and publicising the Bill, and my track record and that of my hon. Friends on that is exemplary. There should be consensus on this--I hope that the Minister accepts that I do not disagree with him. To be made effective, the law has to be widely known. It would be monstrous if we were to operate on a skinflint basis, by not publicising a major Government measure. I do not cavil at that; it is entirely sensible and I applaud it. The thought that people might suffer through being unaware of their entitlements or that employers themselves might be unaware of their responsibilities is worrying. However, I have a number of points to raise.
<P>
First, the notes on clauses state that the publicity will deal with the hourly rate, with the method of its determination, with methods of enforcement and with the number and scope of exemptions or variations in the payment of the national minimum wage. Those matters are undoubtedly factual. It should therefore be possible for publicity concerning them to be exclusively factual in content.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will reassure the Committee that in so far as there is ever a danger of straying over the line between information and propaganda, he will have particular regard to ensuring that it does not happen. All members of the Committee can cite examples of a tendency to stray under Governments of both colours, to which the Opposition party or parties have felt reason to object. I hope that that will not happen now. There is a good case for producing straightforward, factual information about the four matters to which the Minister referred.
<P>
My second point relates to comments just made by my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry. He spoke of the section in the notes on clauses about financial effects, which estimates that likely initial expenditure will be &#163;2 million. Hon. Members are told quite specifically that that &#163;2 million, which is admittedly an estimate, but presumably an informed estimate, covers a particular period. Specifically, it spans the period just before and just after implementation of the national minimum wage.
<P>
That sum does not strike me as being especially large, when one considers that the publicity will presumably have to be on a national scale, and that it will relate to the entitlements of the vast majority of the working population and of a very large number of employers. I do not object to the calculation of &#163;2 million, although I would be interested to know on what basis it was made. Do the Government intend to use national media, regional media or local media? Do they plan to use syndicated radio to get some of the messages across? I do not know, but I should be grateful to be informed. Presumably local libraries will be part of the picture, as will citizens advice bureaux, as has been suggested. The Committee should be told what is likely to be involved in the expenditure of that sum.
<P>
Thirdly, because the notes on clauses refer to a continuing duty to publicise, I should be grateful if the Minister would explain what formal mechanisms will be set in place to determine when an increase in expenditure should be made. If, for example, the Government propose to assess the level of compliance with obligations under the legislation, when will that assessment be undertaken, and what means will be used to undertake it? If the Government intend to conduct research into the level of awareness of entitlements under the legislation, which I should regard as entirely legitimate, when will it be conducted?

<P>

<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> It is dilatory of me not to have intervened when my hon. Friend referred to the phraseology ``just before'' and ``just after''. That phraseology raises in my mind the question of whether, as my hon. Friend asked, employers will be informed sufficiently far in advance for the national minimum wage to be introduced as smoothly and with as few problems as possible.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> My hon. Friend makes a characteristically astute observation, of which I feel sure that the Minister will take note. I am not sure what ``just before'' means, but no doubt the Minister will offer his view on that. I am sure that my hon. Friend, who is a reasonable fellow, will agree that what matters is giving maximum opportunity for people to know what the legislation contains. Of course, ignorance of the law is no excuse for breaking it. Nevertheless, a reasonable person and a reasonable legislator will accept that the more information that is disseminated, and the earlier it is disseminated in advance of the effectual date of legislation, the better chance one has of ensuring that people are aware of and comply with it. I should be grateful if the Minister would explain what he means by that phrase. Specifically, how will the Government establish compliance? How do they propose to to assess the level of awareness of employees and employers of the rights and duties in the Bill? Presumably that will inform their judgment about whether to increase publicity expenditure, so it is important that the Committee be made aware of that.
<P>
I am more than willing, depending on the Minister's response, to suspend my natural cynicism about the Government's intentions, especially in relation to policies about which they feel strongly. There is a duty to publicise measures. I would be the first to protest if there were large-scale non-compliance as a result of the Government's failure to publicise its policies. The purpose of the clause is valid, but we need to know a little more about the means by which the Government intend to effect it.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Chris Pond </B>(Gravesham): I am delighted that a consensus appears to be breaking out in the Committee, but I have to confess to being a little edgy about the fact that its most recent proponent was the hon. Member for Buckingham (Mr. Bercow), so although he is able to suspend his natural cynicism and scepticism, mine have increased a little.
<P>
Amendment No. 236 requires that the expenditure shuold be appropriate and economical. One of the great advantages of the Bill is that the national minimum wage that it introduces will be comprehensive, easy to understand and, therefore, will be effective and easy to enforce. I worked for the Low Pay Unit when the wages councils were in operation, and offered free advice to individuals and employers about the way in which that system operated. It was a minefield: there were in the end 26 different wages councils, all setting different rates in different sectors and even making regional variations. The result was non-compliance in one in three establishments visited by the inspectors. Sometimes employers were wilfully ignoring the minimum rate, which was easy to do because of the complexity of the law, but in most cases they simply did not understand what their responsibilities were.
<P>
The minimum wage, because it will be applied across the board, will do much of the job for us, but it will still be necessary to ensure that individuals know their entitlements and responsibilities under the Bill. I was pleased to hear the hon. Member for Daventry talking about the information fund's purpose to ensure that employers know exactly where they stand. In assessing this relatively small sum, we need to think about the value not only to the individuals who will receive the appropriate minimum wage, but to those often small employers, who may otherwise find it difficult to understand.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman is so cynical about my motives in this matter. I hope that I can treat his remarks with a degree of levity. Does he think there is a good reason why market testing should not apply to the selection of an agency or agencies for the purposes of implementing the clause?
<P>
<B>Mr. Pond:</B> I am sure that the Government have every intention of ensuring that the money is spent in the most cost-effective way. We do not need to write that into the Bill. The Government, perhaps more than the previous Administration, are concerned about the way in which taxpayers' money is spent and I have no doubt that they will be seeking the best value for money. I say to the hon. Member for Buckingham that if the funds are not spent in the most cost-effective way, how will home workers know that they are covered by the minimum wage?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> rose--
<P>
<B>Mr. Pond:</B> I will just finish this point. How will Linda know? How will the hon. Member for Buckingham know whether he is paying Linda the appropriate rate?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am pleased to hear the hon. Gentleman placing due emphasis on the importance of educating and informing employers, particularly small employers, so that they do not inadvertently fall foul of the Bill. We have been talking about cynicism and scepticism. Does the hon. Gentleman accept that the notes on clauses specifically state:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``It is important for as many people as possible to know their entitlement and how to ensure they receive it.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Not a word in part 2 refers to people knowing their responsibilities. The hon. Gentleman rightly identified the importance of that, but the Government's attitude is given away by the tone of the notes on clauses, which talk entirely about entitlement, not responsibility.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pond:</B> The hon. Gentleman fails to recognise that firms will be a major mechanism for conveying to their employees information about how the minimum wage will work. The two are closely--
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Pond:</B> I will just develop the point further.
<P>
The financial memorandum mentions a modest sum. The hon. Member for Buckingham said that &#163;2 million is not a large sum. I would argue that it is good value. As the hon. Member for Daventry pointed out, we want compliance, not enforcement, which is expensive. If everyone knows where they stand, the &#163;2 million will be more than paid back in the longer term. The financial memorandum reminds us that the cost of an inspection carried out by comparable enforcement bodies ranges from &#163;50 to &#163;380. A back of an envelope calculation shows that 12,000 fewer inspections, if that is the result of the extra information, would cover that sum.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> The hon. Gentleman said to my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge that employers were an important source of information about employee rights. I hope that he accepts that that is not the case in relation to the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pond:</B> I think that it is, because everyone on both sides of the bargain must know exactly where they stand. The &#163;2 million--a modest sum--will ensure that. A set-top box will not prevent employers from seeing television advertisements telling people what the minimum wage will be.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Pond:</B> I shall develop the point a little further.
<P>
The &#163;2 million is good vlaue in terms of the cost of tribunals, court cases and inspection. The funding must be there. I am puzzled by the words ``and economical''. Opposition Members will remember how much was spent 10 years ago promoting family credit. I do not oppose that, but it was four times the amount that is mentioned in relation to this Bill. Conservative Members consider family credit to be their equivalent of the national minimum wage.
<P>
As recently as 1996, the previous Government spent twice as much advertising each of the Railtrack and British Gas privatisations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Pond:</B> I will just finish the point.
<P>
The sale of British Gas cost the taxpayer &#163;21 million--10 times the amount for ensuring that people know about the basic minimum wage. When answering Conservative Members' questions about how the money is to be spent, the Minister might legitimately say, ``Ask Sid''. Spending &#163;2 million to ensure that people know their rights and responsibilities is good value, especially as the national minimum wage is likely to benefit public revenues. The net effect will be that the Chancellor is better off.
<P>
<B>Several hon. Members</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Pond:</B> I am just winding up.
<P>
I hope that--
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. MacCartney:</B> My hon. Friend is winding them up.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pond:</B> I am just finishing off.
<P>
Conservative members have suggested that the information should be provided in the most factual way. I hope that it will be provided in the most effective way to get the message across, not to be the latter-day equivalent of the post-war adverts for welfare orange juice. I oppose the amendment, and the clause should stand as it is.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> The contribution of the hon. Member for Gravesham was most instructive. It has rekindled all the cynicism about the issue that Conservative Members have tried to get rid of. It was a combination of economic illiteracy and hostility to reforms such as privatisation. It ran the whole gamut of old Labour prejudices, which the hon. Gentleman tried to assure us do not exist in other parts of the jungle.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I entirely concur with my hon. Friend's assessment. The hon. Member for Gravesham started reasonably and then built up a head of steam. A froth developed and after that there was no going back--it was all deterioration. Does my hon. Friend agree that the hon. Gentleman spin-doctored his own cause by referring to the sum involved as small? He had in mind only the immediate sum and not the continuing duty and the financial responsibility that it entails.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I agree with my hon. Friend. That was just one point at which the hon. Member for Gravesham was playing around the edges of the truth. I was fascinated as I am sure that some of his former clients will be--to hear the former head of the Low Pay Unit describe &#163;2 million as a small sum. Truly, access to the public purse changes people's perception of what constitutes a large sum.
<P>
I want to draw particular attention to the hon. Gentleman's point about the revenue-enhancing effects of a national minimum wage. I refer him to his own Government's evidence, which contradicts him on this point. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The overall effect of the NMW on tax revenues will depend on the level it is set at and the response of employers and employees.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Even his own Government have blown up one of hon. Gentleman's points.
<P>
The general tenor of the hon. Gentleman's speech makes it all the more legitimate to probe, as the amendment does, how the Government will approach spending the money on advertising the national minimum wage. Clause 47 is one of the few clauses in the Bill that is all enabling. We have commented that the clauses are a curious mixture; they enable the Secretary of State to do things, but take away many of her powers when the Government do not want them. Clause 47 above all others would have benefited from such disabling, which would have prevented the possible dodgy use of the money that the Government have given themselves to publicise the national minimum wage. Conservative Members of course recognise that important pieces of legislation such as the Bill, which institute changes that will affect people throughout society, need a degree of publicity. All Governments have given legislation such publicity and I am sure that Governments will continue to do so. There is, however, a legitimate suspicion that, given the passion with which Ministers, including the Minister of State, promote the policy, they will not restrict themselves overscrupulously to the purely factual provision of information in the way that some Labour Members have tried to suggest. The Government may give full rein to the ability of the Minister without Portfolio to present matters particularly virulently.

<P>

<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> He will not want do so anyway.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Yes. In this instance, he is not desperately keen on the policy, but I am sure that he will do what he is told. Apart from the specific point about whether the money will be spent as economically as possible, there are wider points about the limits on propriety and about the way in which the information is presented. Again, the hon. Member for Gravesham was particularly instructive because he said that he did not want advertising to be restricted in factual ways. Clearly, he wants a degree of emotion and the full abilities of the advertising industry to be applied. The more he goes down that route and the more the Government are tempted down it, the more they will be tempted into impropriety. The gap between factual Government information and party-political propaganda is rendered easier to cross if a campaign is emotional. [Interruption.] Given that the Minister is now intervening from a sedentary position, I can take that as a hit. He only does that when he feels slightly embarrassed.
<P>
There is no restriction on the bodies through which the money will flow when it has left the public purse. Will the Minister clear some factual points? Does he propose that some of this public money should go to trade unions so that they can publicise the existence of the minimum wage among their members? If so, what controls will be exercised? Are the Government proposing to give some public money back to their paymasters in return for services rendered?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Perhaps my hon. Friend would care to ask whether the moneys will be accountable through the Public Accounts Committee mechanism.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I assume that they will be. I dare say that if the Government are tempted to take that route, my right hon. Friend the Member for Haltemprice and Howden (Mr. Davis), the new Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, will be more than usually busy in the years to come.
<P>
We have observed during our debates in Committee the growth of pressure groups, the regionalisation of the low pay units and the various campaigning bodies that have sprung up all over the country. Is it the Minister's intention that they too should be the conduit for some of the money which is allegedly purely for information purposes? As the Minister and his hon. Friends will know, they combine their role of providing information with a straightforward political campaigning role. If the Government are to give them public money for these purposes, the Committee is entitled at the very least to raise its eyebrows at the Government's intentions when it comes to their use of this money.
<P>
There is great potential for the misuse of public money in this instance. We have been talking about &#163;2 million--that is clearly an initial slug for the first introduction. Knowledge of Whitehall in the Committee tells us that there will need to be repeated use of public money--

<P>
On resuming--
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I was interrupted at a particularly sensitive time in that I was about to finish my speech. I shall sum up for the Minister by saying that I listened to the opening part of the debate with mild suspicion about the clause and the way in which it might be used by the Government. Everything that I have heard during the course of the debate has increased my suspicion. I hope that the Minister can reassure me on some of the detailed points that I have made that my suspicions are unworthy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> My suspicions are slightly different from those of my hon. Friend. The amendment would impose a duty of economy on the Government in conducting this advertising campaign. I am sure that that is not a sentiment from which the Government would wish to dissent, although I suspect that they may not want to see those words in the Bill.
<P>
The Government have indicated that they will have a continuing obligation and duty to publicise the effects of the Bill. The figure of &#163;2 million, which has been bandied around, is not a good indicator of the overall level of spending that we may expect.
<P>
I wish to address my remarks specifically to the issue of ensuring that employers are properly informed about their obligations under the legislation. That is not because Conservative Members feel, in a knee-jerk manner, that it is our duty to ensure that employers get a fair crack of the whip. It is for two reasons.
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
First, as I mentioned in my earlier intervention on the hon. Member for Gravesham, the notes on clauses clearly belie the Government's subliminal thinking. They refer constantly to the need to inform people of their entitlements and rights, but whoever drafted those notes clearly has in mind a campaign focused primarily on employees and their rights under the Act. One can understand the purpose of that; it is absolutely right that people who are granted rights by legislation should be made aware of them. We all know of the low take-up rates in other aspects of entitlement. Governments of all hues have subscribed to the view that there should be maximum publicity to encourage people to exercise the rights that Parliament has deemed it appropriate to bestow on them.
<P>
The second reason why there should be a focus on employers, especially small employers, is that they are the people who stand to be prosecuted and criminalised by the Act. That is not surprising or unusual in view of the Bill's structure, but I hope that the Minister will assure me as to the percentage of the publicity effort to be focused on employers, particularly small employers, and on those sectors of industry where small employers are prevalent through, for example, the specialist press. Will he also say something about his feelings on advertising in the specialist media as against the general media?
<P>
Moreover, there is the ethnic community. We are all aware of the large number of small businesses where employers may have difficulty in interpreting their obligations under the Bill. It is important that if people are prosecuted as a result of their failure to comply with the Act, it is because they have wilfully refused to do so and not because they have been unable to identify their obligations or perhaps been unable correctly to interpret how they can meet those obligations.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Ashford asked how much advance notice employees will have of the rate and the details of the regulations. Clearly, their ability to comply with the legislation will depend heavily on how much notice they have of those details and of any later changes. I hope that the Minister will allay some of my concerns about the balance between publicity directed at employees and that aimed at employers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Did my hon. Friend observe that the hon. Member for Gravesham seemed to imply that imparting information to employees and employers was pretty much the same process? In fact, employers have obligations to keep records. Those obligations need to be addressed particularly to employers in respect of all their employees, even those who may not feel themselves at all affected by the national minimum wage.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> My hon. Friend makes a strong point. The detail that needs to be conveyed to the two groups will be different. While it is obviously important that employees understand what the rate is and the broad brush strokes of how officers will assess whether that rate has been paid, they will not be interested in the fine detail of record keeping.
<P>
Will the Minister assure us that he will take into account the potential criminalisation of the employer when he decides on the balance between advertising focused on employees and employers, and that he will consider the needs of small businesses in particular? I assume that the regulations will mean complexity in calculating how the minimum wage is to be made up and paid. If so, will he consider making provision from the advertising budget for support to employers who may otherwise find it difficult to interpret the regulations in accordance with their specific case? Would he, for example, give a commitment that officers appointed under the Act could be called on by employers to support and assist them in reviewing their procedures, making the necessary calcualtions and relating the generality of the Act to their specific circumstances? We want to ensure that anyone who seeks to comply with the Act in the right spirit is given every possible assistance to do so and to ensure that they do not inadvertently criminalise themselves.
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Department of Trade and Industry (Mr. Ian McCartney):</B> I am disappointed by the tone of the debate, other than the speech of the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge, who saved the Opposition's bacon by his approach and his thoughtful questions on the amendment. The hon. Member for Daventry tried, uncharacteristically, to be frivolous; at one point he was playing trivial pursuit with the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge. His comments and flippant remarks were unworthy of the importance of the clause, for both potential recipients of the minimum wage and for employers. Unfortunately, his approach was taken up in spades by his hon. Friends, including the hon. Member for Ashford, the Mr. Micawber of the debate.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman makes increasingly hysterical interpretations of the affects of the minimum wage and sought on occasion to impugn the character of Ministers and of my hon. Friend the Member for Gravesham. It is a bit of a cheek for him to accuse the Government of seeking to misuse public funds by diverting them from their proper uses. He was one of the most vociferous publicists for the previous Government, who spent &#163;1.9 million on publishing the nursery vouchers scheme in advance of the general election. If ever there was an example of the misuse of public funds, that was it. It did not work, however, because the electorate rejected in record numbers those divisive proposals on education.
<P>
Opposition Members may rest assured that we will not continue the previous Administration's bad practices. We will use resources not only economically but for the purposes for which they were intended. In this case, those purposes are clearly set out in the Bill.
<P>
The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge asked his hon. Friend the Member for Daventry a reasonable question about whether the Government were going to circulate publicity among employees. I must point out that clause 47(1) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Secretary of State shall arrange for information about this Act and regulations under it to be published by such means as appear to the Secretary of State to be most appropriate for drawing the provisions of this Act and those regulations to the attention of persons affected by them.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Not the workers or a particular group of workers but ``persons affected by them''--employers and employees.
<P>
Secondly, the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge said that the clause was deficient, because the Bill provided no means of enhancing employers' responsibility to ensure that information is provided to the workers. The hon. Gentleman needs to look back at clause 12, which provides for an employer to give a worker a national minimum wage statement. We are not only providing information to publicise the minimum wage to employers and employees; we are providing for obligations on employers to ensure that that information is transmitted effectively in the workplace.
<P>
I have difficulty believeing that some Opposition Members have taken such a mean-spirited approach to the issue. The hon. Member for Ashford constantly says that I refer to Arthur Daley company bosses or Arthur Daley economics. The reason for that is that the hon. Gentleman has in every debate so far, made a partisan political attack on the Government's views on the minimum wage and on how we will promote it. In every instance, he supports the activities of poor employers. He never talks about the interests of good employers; he always goes down to the bottom line and gives us his views about how to protect poor employers. He has done the same this evening. Throughout his contribution, he rubbished the potential good in promoting, through public resources, advice on best practice for employers and employees in terms of implementing the national minimum wage. We know where the hon. Gentleman is coming from and that he is determined, between now and when we reach the end of our consideration of the Bill, to make no positive contribution to easing the problem of low pay in the economy.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Gravesham rightly and clearly set out the need for resources to be spent on providing information, advice and education. That is precisely what the Government intend to do. It is not the business of the Government--either with regard to the Bill or more generally--to use resources in a way that undermines their capacity to implement legislation in the most effective manner. The impetus behind the clause is to ensure that, at the end of the process, we have established the rate for the minimum wage and a date for its implementation and that we have determined all the issues that relate to its implementation--including rights, information and advice to employers. We would not have in place anything other than an effective method of providing information to employers and employees across the board in the labour market.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> The Minister referred to the effectiveness of the clause, which is crucial. Will he briefly focus on that and tell the Committee how the Government propose to establish levels of awareness about the Bill and of compliance with it? I am sure that he will agree that those must be key factors in deciding whether an increase in the publicity budget, under the continuing duty to publicise, will be required from time to time.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> Indeed. I am trying to respond to the general debate first. If the hon. Gentleman will hold his horses for a moment, I will get down to the specifics and the amendments.
<P>
The amendments undermine the process by which we want to achieve our aim. Amendment No. 236, in particular, is spurious. It is not an attempt to tease out the Government's views on how we intend to proceed. It has been used in all but one case--the contribution of the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge--to make a direct attack on the concept and principle of the minimum wage.
<P>
The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge raised several issues, and I have common cause with him in some respects. The information can be provided in all the different forms of media. We are in the information age, and the Government will use all of its forms to promote and distribute information about the minimum wage. They will also use the extensive free media that we have in this country. Alongside those, a wide range of organisations will co-operate with the Government to ensure that information about the minimum wage is passed on to their members and to associated organisations, whether they are trade unions, employers organisations or voluntary organisations.
<P>
When the Bill is enacted, there will be no shortage of people willing to be involved with the Government in their promotion of information relating to the implementation of the national minimum wage. I predict that an industry will grow up overnight to ensure that employees and employers have a clear understanding of their rights and obligations in the implementation of the legislation.
<P>
The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge raised the issue of small and medium-sized enterprises. The Government intend to be absolutely sure that information provided for people involved in such enterprises goes to the people for whom they intend it. The Government already have a good working relationship with all of the small business organisations.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I am sure that it would be in the interests of all organisations concerned to ensure that information that they provide for members, which will include information given to them by the Government, will not only inform members about rates and obligations, but will enable them to manage the process of implementation effectively and successfully.
<P>
The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge also quite rightly raised another issue about which I shall give him a commitment. Information will be consistent with languages and traditions, whether they be those of business people or of employees from ethnic minorities. I thank the hon. Gentleman for raising that issue; it is important that it is dealt with effectively, as is the case with other key matters such as home working, which involves substantial numbers of people from ethnic minority communities. The hon. Gentleman's point was not just well targeted but is worthy of taking action on. I give him a commitment that the Government will do so, through a strategic approach to the distribution of information about the implementation of the minimum wage.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman also made a point about introducing publicity. The hon. Member for Buckingham made the same point; some of his points were simply debating points, but this one was legitimate. From the outset, the Government have been keen to ensure that prior to the legislation coming to Committee, in Committee and beyond, the business community and employees organisations have maximum access to information about the minimum wage and about the Government's approach to implementation.
<P>
I gave a commitment in opposition that Labour would ensure from the outset that the process of implementation would involve the social partners, and in many respects be owned by them. That is why the Low Pay Commission is a social partnership body. The involvement of business from the outset is part of the process of determining the minimum wage.
<P>
Once the Bill is enacted, recommendations will come from the Low Pay Commission. The Government will subsequently establish the regulatory regime, and then set a date for commencement--for going live. Between that time and the vesting day for the minimum wage, it will be ensured that the maximum possible amount of resources is available for the promotion of the range of issues relevant to the minimum wage, including the wage rate, with employers and with employees.
<P>
After the roll-out and introduction of the legislation, services will provide clear information, advice and help about how to deal with the rate and related issues, and about how to implement the wage properly. That is important. In earlier debates, the Government have made it clear that the only criminal sanction relevant will apply to people who wilfully neglect or refuse to pay the minimum wage. The Government have dealt with that issue consistently. We are keen to work with employers and employers' organisations individually and collectively to ensure that no one falls foul of the legislation because he or she has not received appropriate information and advice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Will the Minister give us an indication of the minimum period between the promulgation of the regulations and the announcement of the rate and the start-up date?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> No, I cannot. I am not trying to be difficult--I do not have dates for the announcement of the regulatory regime or the start-up point. I have put on record that I, on behalf of the Government, will take great pains to ensure that the process of implementation if smooth. It is not in the interests of the low paid, never mind the Government, to have a chaotic introduction of the national minimum wage.
<P>
When we were in opposition we gave a commitment to both sides of industry that the roll-out and implementation would go with the grain of the labour market. Once we have completed the regulatory regime and established a date, we will take great pains to ensure a balanced and consistent approach to the vesting day. On the one hand, employers will be able to adjust and implement the national minimum wage and, on the other, employees will be able to enjoy their right to a minimum wage as soon as possible. We must get that balance right.
<P>
I hope that the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge will recognise that I am being genuine and not trying to hide anything--there is no secret date that I can tell him. We are following a logical process that will take us to the point where we can set a date for the implementation of the minimum wage.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Perhaps I can put my question in a different way. We are talking specifically about publicising the details of the minimum wage. In the Minister's opinion, what would be the minimum period necessary between the setting of the minimum wage and its implementation to allow that publicity process properly to take place?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> That is something that we will have to judge at the time. When we determine the final regulations, we can then set a date. I will be happy to make that judgment according to the principles that I have just set out.
<P>
As for the &#163;2 million, that is an estimate. We provided that on the basis that we believe that that investment will make savings. The more one spends on publicity and on giving employers and employees information and advice, the less likely one is to have problems of compliance.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I accept that the Minister cannot specify a minimum period at this time, but further to the inquiry by my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge, does he agree that the shorter the period, the more intense the publicity campaign will need to be?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I am certain that one thing that we will do--we are famous for it in government as we were in opposition--is get across our case. I must point out that I do not mean that in a propagandist sense, in case the hon. Member for Ashford is about to fall off his chair because he thinks he has a point on me. It is critical for the Government and, more importantly, for the companies and employees, that the publicity is effective in providing information and has widespread dissemination using a whole range of methods.
<P>
Issues that have not been raised, but which I will put on record, are those relating to people with disabilities. It is important to ensure that the information provided takes account of disabilities, whether those of employers or employees. We must take all those issues into account to ensure that the publicity is effective.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman's point was well made, but this matter requires a balance of judgment. We must set the right period of implementation, so that employers are ready, but we must provide enough resources during that period to secure for employers and employees information that is professional enough to enable them to cope with the introduction of the minimum wage.
<P>
I hope that the hon. Member for Daventry will feel able to withdraw his amendment. If not, I must ask my colleagues to resist it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am disappointed--almost mortified--that the Minister should have misconstrued my remarks as flippant. The only flippancy that I have induced in the Committee was caused by my memories of Government information campaigns which were inappropriate for the message being conveyed and by my description of the pitfalls which can beset any Government whose aim of promoting information is not well conceived.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge was entitled to point out, if not explicitly, that subsection (2) is about informing employees. While the Minister is right that persons affected by the Bill are keyed in under subsection (1), the emphasis is very much on employees. That comment is not inconsistent with the remarks of the hon. Member for Gravesham, which I did not wholly accept. He would not allow me to intervene, but my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge referred to doubt over whether employers were necessarily the right people to convey messages to employees.
<P>
We are not saying that employers should not say anything to their employees. Rather, there must be objective advice from a governmental source on which employers can draw if, for example, an employee is unwell. We do not want the Government to indulge in political propaganda or to interpret reality in a way that means that only part of the message gets across. Those are warning shots.
<P>
The amendment is probing. The Minister was, unusually, not prepared to accept our bona fides in putting it across, but I shall not reciprocate. Having received assurances and in the interest of making progress, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I shall comment briefly on the regulations clause. We have debated exhaustively the fact that the Bill is enabling. There will be no flesh on its bones until we have recommendations from the Low Pay Commission, decisions by Ministers and draft regulations for consideration in the House. Ministers have undertaken to bring them to the House and the Bill generally provides for an affirmative resolution procedure, which would require them to do that without our having to pray against them. That is an index of good faith, which we ought to accept in principle.
<P>
We will, of course, need to debate the regulations fully--given their importance, Ministers might sometimes need to table them genuinely rather than formally in draft, if I may put it that way. There should be a general debate on them in Green Paper form, as it were, and they could then be produced in a second draft for formal consideration. I put that to the Minister for his later consideration.
<P>
I want to detain the Committee on the two exceptions to the affirmative resolution procedure that the Minister has adopted. We can leave aside the Order in Council, because he has effectively turned that into a kind of affirmative resolution procedure. The two exceptions, which are specified in the clause, are clause 19, which concerns penalties, and clause 44, which relates to the operation of the Agricultural Wages Act 1948. As the Minister has helpfully provided for so many affirmative resolutions, it is unfortunate that it does not have a completely clean sheet.
<P>
The Minister will remember earlier debates on clause 19, when we expressed concern about the nature of potential escalators and their consequences. We are not entirely happy with the arrangements. I agree that most of them would be fines for offences and not financial penalties, but it is not unthinkable for the financial penalties to be set out under clause 19 to come to the House under an affirmative resolution procedure.
<P>
I happen recently to have debated briefly with one of the Minister's ministerial colleagues the consumer credit regulations, which have just come forward under the affirmative resolution procedure. We did not pray against them. They make about 100 changes--the first changes for some years--and seem perfectly sensible. I said so, and then I asked a few questions. These regulations deal with important matters affecting individuals; thay may affect particular individuals seriously. The Minister should at least reflect on whether they, too, should be subject to an affirmative procedure. It would not cause much trouble; if they were well found, I am sure that it would not take long to debate them.
<P>
Clause 44 will amend the Agricultural Wages Act 1948. A different but, if anything, even more weighty consideration applies to it. The Minister seeks powers to amend other primary legislation in order to implement the Bill. I do not know what hon. Members might say about that, but I have a feeling that those in another place would be reluctant for that to be done by negative resolution and not by primary procedure.
<P>
Given that the Minister has shown his good faith by generally providing for regulations under affirmative resolution--which is pretty unusual for the Government; we usually have to wring it out of them--I would feel happier if he would score a clean sheet or a full house by providing for an affirmative resolution procedure in the two cases that I have given as well. He would do himself and the Committee good, and I do not think that there would necessarily be any awkward consequences for the conduct of Government business. He would prove that he has nothing to hide if he brought forward resolutions that did not create any embarrasment or difficulty for him or his Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I am grateful for the opportunity to add two points.
<P>
I agree with my hon. Friend that given that Ministers have chosen to propose that the majority of the regulations should be made under an affirmative procedure, and given that the structure of the regulation-making power is circumscribed by earlier provisions, so that different provision can be made for different cases, it does not give rise to great excitement about the issues that might arise on the order-making power. Many of those that would have arisen have already been debated.
<P>
I shall make two more points. First, I appreciate that there will be limits to what the Minister can say about this, but the making of orders and the transitional provisions that relate to them are important to industry and employers. They obviously want to remain within the provisions of the Act and to maintain good order in their employment practices and the setting of pay levels. We will debate later the introduction of commencement provisions and what notice employers need to be given of the setting of the first hourly rate, which will have the greatest implications for them. Before we do so, however, it would be helpful if the Minister said that the Government will, when making orders, assume that there would be opportunities for the kind of debate to which my hon. Friends have referred. It would also be helpful if he could tell us whether there will be reasonably generous transitional provision for the orders. That would allow for the different circumstances that employers will face when making internal decisions on setting or adjusting pay rates, adjusting record keeping to accommodate differences in pay reference periods, or assessing changes in the structure of remuneration and the way in which it will fit in with the calculation of the hourly rate. It will be difficult for employers to adjust to all those things. It would be helpful if the Minister could give assurances that there will be generous transitional provisions when orders are introduced.
<P>
My second point concerns the provisions in clause 19(4), which are to be subject to a negative procedure. It is a pity that that power happens to be one which Conservative Members agreed with Ministers was modest. The relevant order-making power is of a negative character and could, therefore, obviate the agreement between us that the provision in clause 19 is appropriate and modest. I do not want to recall our debate in detail, but it was clear that Conservative Members were uncertain--the Minister could not quite assure us--about the way in which the penalty notice procedure would be applied. There may be circumstances in which relatively large number of workers are affected in relation to a relatively large number of pay reference periods. Under those circumstances, a change in the multiplier under the penalty notice procedure could have substantial implications for the scale of penalties that would be applied to employers. Notwithstanding the fact that we said that the provision was modest in the first place, we would worry if the multiplier could subsequently be changed by a negative procedure without further debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> It would be useful to put on record the reasons behind the clause and then to deal with the points that have been made, all of which are fair. I hope that I will be able to respond fairly.
<P>
The clause sets out clearly how the regulations, Orders in Council and orders under the Bill are to be made. The Government want to be open with the House and have taken steps to ensure that, with the exception of provisions that deal with minor and technical matters, the subordinate legislation under the Bill will be subject to affirmative procedures. That includes not only the main regulations that set out the rate of the national minimum wage and adjust it, but regulations on exemptions or on adding further groups to the national minimum wage regime.
<P>
Subsection (1) provides that, unless the Bill specifies otherwise, any Order in Council, regulation or order made under the Bill may provide differently for different persons and cases. No such provision may, however, be made when prescribing the single hourly rate of the national minimum wage under clause 1(3). Because the policy is that the national minimum wage is to be a single, universally applicable rate, however, the provisions in clauses 2, 3 and 4 restrict that flexibility.
<P>
The powers that are not subject to affirmative resolution procedures are those that the hon. Gentleman for Daventry mentioned. Those in clause 19 concern adjusting the multiplier that is used to calculate the financial penalty. Those in clause 44 concern consequential amendments and amendments relating to the treatment of benefits in agriculture legislation. The same general principle applies. I give a commitment to members of the Committee that the Government will consult about the regulations before their implementation. When we publish draft regulations, therefore, there will be consultation before they are brought in under the affirmative resolution procedure.
<P>
The hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire raised a practical point about the multiplier. The principle must be that before the Government implement that by regulation, proper consultation will take place. Clause 19 deals with the multiplier, which is used to calculate the financial penalty. I will consider what the hon. Gentleman said. The multiplier does not affect the concept and principle of the Bill; it is a matter of process and procedure, which is why we have dealt with it as we have. I will consider what the hon. Gentleman said about it not being in any of our interests to undermine the good working of the proposals. That is not my intention. We came to a considered view that dealing with the multiplier in this way would not undermine the principle of the regulations or prevent proper consultation from taking place.
<P>
Regulations made under clause 44(2) or (4) will amend the agricultural wages legislation. The powers are limited to changes that are needed as a consequence of the Bill or regulations made under it. As no new matters of principle are involved, there is nothing to be gained from debating the issues again. Again, this does not concern the principle of the regulations. It is normal for regulations relating to agricultural wages matters to be made by negative resolution. We are not using a new method, but continuing the previous arrangements.
<P>
The negative resolution arrangements were utilised extensively in the implementation of the Jobseekers Act 1995 by the previous Administration. I dealt with that Act in opposition. Some proposals led to the affirmative procedure being used, but substantial matters in many of the regulations were dealt with by negative resolution. We have got the balance right and we will not deal with substantial matters in that way. All the key components of principle that must be covered by regulation will be dealt with by affirmative resolution and will undergo a process of consultation before the House considers them.

<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Will the Minister clarify a point and forgive my ignorance, if that is at the root of my misunderstanding? He has been talking about regulation by statutory instruments and Orders in Council. I see no reference in clause 48 to Orders in Council. Would such an order under clause 39 be subject to the same procedure?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> Orders in Council are dealt with in other clauses as they relate to specific matters for which such an order would be required. Two specific regulations will be dealt with by negative, rather than affirmative, resolution. That does not affect issues relating to Orders in Council.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The Minister may not believe me, but I was seeking to help him. The Committee has just considered and passed an amendment that provides for a quasi-affirmative resolution procedure for Orders in Council, so I think that that point has been covered.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I think we dealt with that group of amendments this morning or earlier this afternoon--time passes quickly when we are enjoying ourselves. We tabled appropriate amendments. I hope that the Opposition are satisfied with my explanation of the process and that we can proceed with the remainder of the Bill.

I do not want to dilate on that, but will draw out several points. First, Government revenue is extremely sensitive to costs on funded or subsidised services. For example, at paragraph 88 the Government's evidence states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the average wage in the childcare industry, excluding nursery nurses, was &#163;3.85 an hour in 1997''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The clause is clearly to do with Government expenditure on functions related to the Bill, not the details of the minimum wage.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am watching that, Mr. Atkinson, but the clause provides:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``There shall be paid out of money provided by Parliament . . . any increase attributable to the provisions of this Act in the sums payable out of such money under any other Act.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I may have misunderstood, but the provision appears to be wide. The table in the Government's evidence shows that beyond the level I cited there is a rapid escalation in the cost of the minimum wage to the public sector. We discussed &#163;2 million expenditure under clause 47. Here, we are talking of a &#163;200 million hit, even on a conservative estimate, on the public sector wage bill. Those are indirect effects of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I apologise if I have anticipated my hon. Friend's next point, but the table is important. The note below it states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The estimated costs assume no restoration of differentials''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The restoration of differentials, which exacerbates the algebraic character of the trend rate, has a greater impact the higher up the national minimum wage rate scale one goes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am indebted to my hon. Friend for making the point more clearly.
<P>
Mindful of your strictures, Mr. Atkinson, I move on to say that the Government are terrified by implications of the minimum wage. Paragraph 80 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``If the minimum wage were set at a level which resulted in a fall in productive potential, then we would expect an adverse effect on net tax revenues.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That deals with the revenue side of the equation. At paragraph 97 the Government state that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``if the NMW is sensibly set, at a level where real GDP and employment are left unchanged, the net effect on the PSBR is likely to be relatively small.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
They concede that the impact is likely to be relatively small, which implies that it exists, and that the rate is crucial, which implies that it could be set at a damaging level.
<P>
I shall not dwell on the point, but the clause paves the way for significant increases in direct and indirect public expenditure. There is potential for decline in public revenues and for consequences which, for all the Minister's enthusiasm for the Bill, may not be to his liking or to ours.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I wish to add three points. The Minister should explain how the Government intend to compensate for the impact of the national minimum wage on public expenditure programmes, including the health service.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Member for Daventry was very clever about that point. I cannot see how the clause relates to anything other than the narrow subject of money paid out by Parliament for expenditure that is incurred by the Bill. It cannot be in order to speak about the wider subject of the public sector borrowing requirement. I will listen to the hon. Gentleman, to see whether he can pursue that point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I was pursuing that point in relation to clause 49(b), which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``any increase attributable to the provisions of this Act in the sums payable out of such money under any other Act.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I therefore thought that it was in order to refer to provisions for expenditure under other Acts. I stand to be corrected if I am wrong.
<P>
In any case, my points are brief. I realise that the Minister cannot reply substantively, or I hope that the Government would have stated much more in their evidence. It is the lack of substance in that evidence that is to the point. Anxieties will arise about the impact of the expenditure on public sector programmes, which is clearly not dealt with in the evidence of the Low Pay Commission, but which should have been.
<P>
Many public sector contractors are anxious about the implications of rising costs that will be caused by the national minimum wage. Many such contractors, and many Government Departments or bodies purchasing services from them under contract will not necessarily be able or willing to contemplate changes in their contract to reflect those changes in cost, for fear of prejudicing the effectiveness of their programmes.
<P>
Ministers have not adequately addressed the overall impact of the national minimum wage on public expenditure, either in the evidence of the Low Pay Commission or in the arguments about the level of the rate that have been advanced before the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> The clause is a standard clause, the purpose of which is to implement the money resolution passed by the House on 16 December without Division. It provides for expenditure under the Bill, and covers any expenditure made by a Minister, by a Department or by a body acting on behalf of the Crown. The clause is no more and no less than that, and I do not need to go any further than to ask my hon. Friends to agree to the clause.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 49 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Clause 50 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
