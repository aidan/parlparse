James Clappison</b> (Hertsmere) (Con): Having had an
opportunity to reflect carefully, I find that the amendments tabled by
the hon. Member for Rochdale are even more defective than I first
thought, but I will confine myself to my original intervention. Liberal
Democrat amendment 84 is going about things the wrong way round.
Instead of saying that regulations &#147;may&#148; make provision
for reconsideration and setting out the circumstances in which that
will take place so that everyone knows what those circumstances are and
there is clarity, and so that the claimant, in particular, knows what
the circumstances are, the amendment would do away with that&#151;and
just about do away with paragraphs (a) to (e) of subsection
(5)&#151;because it would make it mandatory to have reconsideration.
It would merely require that reconsideration shall take place at
&#147;the reasonable request&#148; of the claimant without saying
what amounts to reasonable. That seems to be the worst of all
worlds.</div><a name="09022517000035"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09022517000424"></a><b class="B">Paul

<div class="Column"><a name="Column136" />Column number: 136</div><a name="09022517000036"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022517000425"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. The hon. Gentleman cannot intervene on a
Member making an
intervention.</div><a name="09022517000037"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022517000426"></a>Mr.
Clappison:</b> I was making a short
intervention.</div><a name="09022517000038"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022517000427"></a>The
Minister for Employment and Welfare Reform (Mr. Tony
McNulty):</b> I had much of the lunch break to reflect on the
matter, and I broadly agree that the Liberal Democrat amendment,
although I do not doubt its good intentions, would not achieve anything
remotely similar to that described by the hon. Member for Rochdale when
he spoke to it. It is perverse and would require mandatory
reconsideration. Even if the adviser and the individual were as happy
with each other as they could be, there would have to be
reconsideration, which does not make much sense. The problem is worse
than the hon. Member for Hertsmere suggested because putting in the
word &#147;reasonable&#148; and agreeing to an action plan with all
the terms on the side of the individual, and then saying further that
any sanctions must already be agreed by the individual would, by
accident or design, water down conditionality to the point of
perversity and would offer nothing of substance to the
Bill.</div><a name="09022517000039"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022517000428"></a>Paul
Rowen:</b> Does the Minister accept that the Government made
much in the Green and White Papers about personalised conditionality
and a personalised agenda? Does he agree that lack of a legal right for
a claimant to have their case reconsidered runs totally contrary to
that? The Bill has 86 provisions for which regulations will specify
what will be implemented. Does he accept that what might be defined as
a reasonable request for reconsideration could be subject to yet more
regulations?</div><a name="09022517000040"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022517000429"></a>Mr.
McNulty:</b> No. The hon. Gentleman misses the point, and the
import of &#147;made&#148; versus &#147;shall&#148;. He would
condemn everyone to reconsideration whether or not that was requested.
We have said collectively until we are blue in the face that this is
about rights as well as responsibilities, and about individuals
establishing a relationship with their personal adviser that is in
their mutual best interests. The direction is not one way, with
imposition from the Jobcentre Plus personal adviser, nor is it one way
in the other direction. Although it seems that using the word
&#147;made&#148; would be radically different from using
&#147;shall&#148;, I concur with the hon. Member for Hertsmere that
that would not achieve what the hon. Member for Rochdale wants. The
hon. Member for Rochdale can reconsider the matter and try to come up
with something that gets to where he wants to be, but his amendment
does not do that.</div>
<a name="09022517000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given that
interplay, I say as gently as possible that amendment 11, which was
tabled by the hon. Member for Hertsmere, also would not do that. The
amendment would remove the words &#147;in prescribed
circumstances&#148;, but the prescribed circumstances do not refer to
the individual, the relationship or anything that we have discussed.
They refer to the prescription of those from the wider population of
lone parents to whom the circumstances refer. I do not understand what
the amendment would
achieve.</div><a name="09022517000042"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022517000430"></a>Mr.
Clappison:</b> The purpose of the amendment is not to take out
the power to prescribe circumstances, but merely to elicit information
from the Government about how they propose to use this power. As such,
it is a probing amendment.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column137" />Column number: 137</div><a name="09022517000043"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022517000431"></a>Mr.
McNulty:</b> None the less, the amendment would not achieve
what I think the hon. Gentleman wants it to achieve. I accept that the
amendment is probing, but the prescribed circumstances refer
specifically to individuals, and the thrust of the amendment is to make
mandatory on all lone parents, regardless of their circumstances, a
conditionality regime to which, as we discussed this morning, we are
quite deliberately referring only specific subsets. This is almost
Freud gone mad. Anyone with children would be caught, without
prescription, under the clause as the hon. Gentleman would amend it,
including those with young babies. I do not think that that is what he
intends. We had this discussion in our previous sitting and I would ask
that amendment 11, probing or otherwise, be withdrawn, and that the
Committee gently ignores the
others.</div><a name="09022517000044"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022517000432"></a>Mr.
Clappison:</b> I am happy to accede to the Minister&#146;s
request. I hope that I made it sufficiently clear that amendment 11 was
a probing amendment. We are not trying to take this out of the Bill; we
wanted either to elicit more information or to speed the process along.
With that in mind, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09022517000045"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,
by leave,
withdrawn.</i></div><a name="09022517000046"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022517000433"></a>Paul
Rowen:</b> I beg to move amendment 47, in clause 2,
page 7, line 5, after &#145;circumstances&#146;, insert</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022517000435"></a>Paul
Rowen:</b> I wish to speak to amendments 47, 50, 51 and 52,
all of which I tabled. They deal with certain categories of people with
mental health
needs.</div><a name="09022517000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">Any
direction relating to specific work-related activity should take
account of a person&#146;s mental health and concurrent needs. This
relates to our issues with the qualifications of Jobcentre Plus staff
and the way in which they will make directions when making decisions
regarding work-related activity. Employment advisers should take a
person&#146;s mental health into account when drawing up action plans
or programmes of activity, and amendment 47 has been designed to
protect claimants with mental health problems from being asked to
undertake an activity that might be harmful to their
health.</div><a name="09022517000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
50 relates to schedule 1. Although we had this discussion earlier, it
is clear that mental health illnesses fluctuate for many people. It
would be wrong if an individual&#146;s fluctuating mental health was
not treated as a good cause for not attending a work-focused interview.
We wish to put protection for people in that position in the Bill. Were
such a person to fail to attend an interview, one of the good causes
accepted without argument should be that that person has a fluctuating
mental health illness&#151;we think that that is reasonable. We would
expect the personal adviser to accept that and thus not to consider
applying sanctions.</div>

things that we could put in, does the hon. Gentleman agree that health
and mental health issues are really worth underlining in the
Bill?</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022517000437"></a>Paul
Rowen:</b><b class="B"> </b>I agree. As I said this morning, concerns
have been raised about various aspects of the Bill and its overarching
scope. It is important to place safeguards in the Bill so that it is
clear to both the claimant and the personal adviser what is a just
cause. It is reasonable that we should do that.</div>
<a name="09022517000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 51
would insert a provision about reasonable adjustments into schedule 1.
We support the fact that more and more people who were previously
consigned to incapacity benefit will be supported back into employment.
However, there must be an onus on the employer to take into account
that person&#146;s needs. There have been circumstances in which
someone has returned to work and found that the support that they were
promised did not materialise. We believe that it is reasonable for
someone not to continue an activity because of an employer&#146;s
failure to provide the support that was promised. That might happen
because the employer did not, in all good faith, appreciate what the
support might involve. If we are considering people with a fluctuating
mental illness, it is difficult to prescribe the support that someone
will need, because that will vary over time and due to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column139" />Column number: 139</div>circumstances. If an employer is not willing to accept that, it might be
a reason why a person is unable to continue an activity. We believe
that it is reasonable to accept that that can be a reason why a person
has had to withdraw from an activity, which is why I tabled
amendment
51.</div><a name="09022517000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
52 would insert into schedule 1 the
words</div><a name="09022517000369"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;including
that person&#146;s mental health and any specific mental health needs
that that person may
have.&#148;</div><a name="09022517000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again,
decisions to access sanctions against the claimant should take account
of a person&#146;s specific mental health needs. The Bill allows
employment advisers to sanction claimants who have failed to comply
with their requirements by withdrawing benefits. There needs to be a
very specific safeguard to ensure that a person will not be penalised
if they fail to comply because of a particular illness. That comes down
to the fact that there needs to be an understanding of the fluctuating
nature of mental illness and how although, in an ideal world, we can
set up one set of circumstances, a person might need a totally
different level of support two or three months down the line. We want
to get some sort of commitment from the Government that if it is not
possible to take account of mental illnesses that may affect
someone&#146;s ability to undertake tasks, there will not necessarily
be a sanction and a loss of a benefit. We believe that that is the
right way
forward.</div><a name="09022517000387"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.15

mental health

tabled the amendment to probe the extent to which the
Government&#146;s regulations on work activity will adequately
cover someone&#146;s health requirements. It was also tabled
specifically to consider the ability of Jobcentre Plus staff and to
determine whether, following the training that they will get, they will
have the skills necessary to take into account someone&#146;s mental
health needs themselves, or whether they would refer them to a
professional who was able to do so. I should like some clarification on
that.</div><a name="09022517000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">Mind
kindly supplied a briefing note in which it suggested new clause 5,
which I thought was worth tabling. I do not propose to press it to a
Division, but I want to explore Mind&#146;s ideas about Access to
Work. The Minister will know that Access to Work may be used by someone
once they get into work, when their employer can have an assessment
done to see what help they need. However, under the new clause, prior
to getting employment, a new ESA claimant, or an existing 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column140" />Column number: 140</div>incapacity benefit claimant with a mental health problem who had moved
to ESA, would be able to get an assessment through Access to Work to
determine what reasonable adjustments they might need to improve their
ability to get a job and, importantly, to retain it. That assessment
would have to be carried out before that claimant was compelled to
undertake any compulsory work-related activity. It would be possible to
fund any reasonable adjustments recommended in the assessment through
Access to Work, and that would give an employer the confidence that the
cost attached to taking on a person with adjustments to their working
routines, which might affect the way that they were going to employ
them, would be funded. That would be a change to the way in which
Access to Work works. I want to test the Government, to see whether
they think such a proposal is worthy of exploration, and to find out
the direction in which they might be
going.</div><a name="09022517000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">Access
to Work recently had its budget doubled, which we welcomed. The present
Minister for disabled people, the Under-Secretary of State for Work and
Pensions, the hon. Member for Chatham and Aylesford, and his
predecessors have said that Access to Work is one of the
Government&#146;s best-kept secrets and that they do not want it to
be so. New clause 5 might be a way to improve the
situation.</div><a name="09022517000066"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022517000439"></a>Mr.
McNulty:</b> I would not necessarily include new clause 5 in
what I am about to say, but, in essence, we are being asked to provide
for things that are already provided for. We already have provisions to
ensure that a person&#146;s health is always considered, so there is
no need for that to be prescribed in the Bill. We say clearly that a
person&#146;s circumstances have to be taken fully into account, and
I am at a loss to know what definition of &#147;person&#146;s
circumstances&#148; would preclude a consideration of either physical
or mental
health.</div><a name="09022517000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is important that the array of conditions is taken into account.
However, I caution the hon. Member for Rochdale about&#151;I hesitate
to use the phrase &#147;undue specificity&#148;
again&#151;specifying what he requests in the Bill. People might feel
good if they get those words into the Bill, but they would not do the
individuals on whom the policy is focused any favours. Allowing the
flexibility for a broad range of definitions of people&#146;s
circumstances to be put in regulations will afford the greatest
possible breadth of definition. I am comfortable with the Bill as it
stands, because we want that flexibility in regulation, not least
because regulations can be adjusted far more easily than primary
legislation. If we went down the road of undue specificity and put too
much in the Bill, but later found that we had left something out, we
would have to wait for another legislative vehicle before we could
alter the primary
legislation.</div><a name="09022517000068"></a>

<a name="09022517000069"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022517000441"></a>Mr.
McNulty:</b> The hon. Gentleman shakes his head, but that is a
matter of fact, unless he wants a social security Bill every year,
regardless of the circumstances, with all that would mean for what we
are trying to do to reform and simplify this area. Things should be as
straightforward as possible. There is broad consensus among Committee
members about the need for flexibility, but we cannot have flexibility
while we are trying to define such things in the Bill.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column141" />Column number: 141</div><a name="09022517000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
accept the comments made by the hon. Member for Glasgow, East about
mental illness, and I accept what others have said about having due
regard to people&#146;s experiences of domestic violence, or their
need to help members of their family, and the barriers that such
circumstances might present to work-related activities or any part of
the journey. There are, quite deliberately, a host of personal
circumstances that can and should be taken into account, but we do
future users no favours by over-defining
things.</div><a name="09022517000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am glad that the hon. Member for Forest of Dean has recognised that we
have doubled the Access to Work moneys. He will know that we are
piloting flexibility around Access to Work&#151;in London, in the
first instance. I agree with my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary that it
is one of our best-kept secrets, but going down the road of new clause
5 would be a tad impractical simply because it would be impossible to
determine what reasonable adjustments someone might need until one knew
what job they were going to do, so there is almost a circular
deficiency to the argument. Do I accept that there should be some
greater flexibility regarding Access to Work? Yes, I do, and we will
look with interest at what the London pilot comes up with. For such a
potentially vulnerable group, we should, in all practical
circumstances, do what works. New clause 5 might create extra
bureaucracy and add significant costs, so while the idea and sentiment
behind it are certainly worth exploring, I would not put it in the
Bill. I shall therefore rather tediously&#151;I might change the
record once or twice at a later stage&#151;ask hon. Members not to
press their amendments.</div>
<a name="09022517000072"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022517000442"></a>Paul
Rowen:</b> In saying that we are trying to over-specify, the
Minister has not understood the problem. The Bill gives jobcentre staff
huge powers, but does not specify the limits of those powers. We might
get regulations that set some limits, but, if experience is anything to
go by, much will be left to discretion. The amendments do not seek to
prescribe the definition of mental health, a person&#146;s
circumstances in relation to mental illness, or the circumstances that
might involve them having to leave employment. They say merely that
those things should be accepted as just causes under the Bill. I make
no apologies for tabling such amendments. In our view, recognising such
things in the Bill would be a vital protection for vulnerable
people.</div><a name="09022517000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are not saying that the amendments would define everything&#151;they
would not. I fully accept that regulations will specify the
circumstances under which mental illness will be accepted as a just
cause, but it is dangerous not to include such provisions in the
Bill.</div><a name="09022517000074"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022517000443"></a>Mr.
McNulty:</b> With the greatest respect, the hon. Gentleman is
defining things. If he were to put something in the Bill that was
separate from regulations, with all that that implies, it would prevail
over all other personal circumstances. That is precisely why we need to
leave things general and flexible, which would be in the interests of
the vulnerable people whom the hon. Gentleman seeks to
help.</div><a name="09022517000075"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022517000444"></a>Paul
Rowen:</b> I refer the Minister to amendment 47, which would
provide for having regard to a person&#146;s mental health. I accept
that that regard will come from a health professional. The amendment
would not define mental illness in the Bill, but say that that must be
taken into account. Regulations can set out the
conditions 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column142" />Column number: 142</div>under which a mental health condition would be
regarded. I would have thought that reference to advice from a mental
health professional should be the way
forward.</div><a name="09022517000076"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022517000445"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> The hon. Gentleman and the Minister are talking at
cross purposes. This discussion has been helpful because the Minister
has been able to explain to the Committee the direction that will be
taken when his officials draft the regulations and he introduces them.
To that extent, it has been helpful that the Liberal Democrats and
Conservatives have tabled these amendments, because the Minister has
been able to explain that mental health will be one of the important
factors taken into account in the regulations. We are comfortable that
that has been
encompassed.</div><a name="09022517000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister is right when he says that specifying in the Bill one set of
circumstances, but not all of them, would create the danger of putting
one ahead of the other, which I would not want. I would not want mental
health needs to take precedence over other circumstances that might be
equally important, and I think that that is how we square the
circle.</div><a name="09022517000078"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022517000446"></a>Paul
Rowen:</b> I understand what the hon. Gentleman is saying, and
we have tabled amendments that deal with other areas of concern.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022517000460"></a>Meg
Munn:</b> I am about to make the point that my right hon.
Friend the Minister made quite well in relation to undue specificity by
raising another area that I think is enormously important. I am doing
it because I specifically want to probe that the relevant regulations
will take into account the specific needs of people with a learning
disability. I would also like to welcome, in some respects, the
document, that the Minister has provided for us, on the use of
regulation-making powers. Some of the issues that I am raising are set
out within that, which is reassuring. I also want to note the helpful
exchange which took place at the third sitting of the Committee with
the Minister and his officials. I will not, therefore, be going over
that ground.</div>
<a name="09022517000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, I am
seeking reassurance that the needs of people with learning disabilities
will be properly taken into account when directions are given about
work-related activity. Along with their needs, proper consideration
should be given to their need for support, whether support is in place,
and whether it is adequate to enable them to undertake that
work-related activity.</div>
<a name="09022517000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am very
supportive of the concept of personalisation, although not the use of
that term. It needs to mean helping people in the way that is most
helpful to them. That is complex in regards to people with learning
disabilities; it means recognising their capabilities, alongside areas
where they need help. In responding to these amendments, can the
Minister for the South East, my hon. Friend the Member for Chatham and
Aylesford give me the reassurance that personal adviser will indeed be
properly trained to identify those issues, to make proper assessments
and ensure that people with learning disabilities are only directed to
work-related activities that are reasonable as far as their own
particular circumstances are concerned, and that they get the
appropriate support that that individual needs to undertake those
activities.</div><a name="09022517000099"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022517000461"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (Jonathan
Shaw):</b> I welcome my hon. Friend&#146;s
amendments.</div>
<a name="09022517000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">Following on
from the previous set of amendments regarding people with a mental
health issue, we are now talking about people with a learning
disability. It is quite right that this Committee probes and asks
questions about particular people for whom we want to ensure that we
provide the support. We do not want to be in a position where people
are unduly penalised for the wrong reason because someone, in working
with them, misses their particular condition or is not particularly
sympathetic. I am thus grateful for the opportunity to hopefully
provide some words of reassurance to the Committee and to those
following our proceedings.</div>
<a name="09022517000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">We will set
out provisions. There will be a thorough set of provisions in place to
protect people with learning disabilities. That will ensure that the
claimant understands the requirement of them and it will provide
safeguards&#151;if it emerges later that the claimant has
misunderstood the requirement. A direction can only be issued as a last
resort and must be suitable and achievable for the individual
concerned. That is especially important if someone has a learning
disability and requires specific support in order to undertake
it.</div>
<a name="09022517000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">As further
reassurance for Members on this point, I have set the safeguards around
making sure that the requirements of a person with a learning
disability are 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column144" />Column number: 144</div>appropriate. Jobcentre Plus advisers have a thorough training in dealing
with customers with a range of diverse health conditions, including
learning disability. Advisers working with employment and support
allowance claimants are also provided with specialist advice from
Department of Work and Pensions doctors, about the kinds of activities
that would be appropriate for a person to undertake through the
work-focused, health-related
assessment.</div><a name="09022517000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">Advisers
working with employment and support allowance claimants are also
provided with specialist advice from Department of Work and Pensions
doctors, about the kinds of activities that would be appropriate for a
person to undertake through the work-focused, health-related
assessment. This assessment is completed as part of the medical
assessment process at the start of the ESA claim. Every customer has
the right to be accompanied to interviews by a carer or an advocate, to
help them interpret and understand the advice and requirements being
set out to them. It is also an important point that we would expect
personal advisers, when assessing someone, to suggest or ask the
individual if they wanted to bring along an advocate, a carer or
adviser, if the personal adviser thought that individual would benefit
in terms of understanding what was required.</div>
<a name="09022517000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">As stated in
both clauses 2 and 8, any direction to an activity would have to be
reasonable, and must have regard for a person&#146;s circumstances.
Therefore, any activity that is directed by the adviser has to be
appropriate to their capabilities and the circumstances in which they
find themselves. If, for any reason, the claimant was directed into an
activity which was felt to be inappropriate, or where they had not
understood the requirements fully, the claimant could ask for the
direction to be reconsidered. Again, I can anticipate my hon. Friend
thinking &#147;well, how would they know that this activity was
inappropriate?&#148; I refer back to the previous set of amendments
which we discussed and say we are piloting these proposals. It is
important that we review them and have regard, particularly, for people
with learning disabilities, to make sure that they have the support and
understand what we are trying to do to assist them.</div>
<a name="09022517000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">All members
of the Committee will endorse the sentiment I expressed in earlier
remarks&#151;we want to see a transformation. There is a pool of
talent among people with learning disabilities who want to get a job,
and we want to help them. It is reasonable for us to say that we need
people to engage with us in order to make that possible. My hon. Friend
will know that if someone is on ESA, then they obviously have had an
assessment and support, but there are those people on JSA, where
perhaps the learning disability will not be so profound&#151;someone
could miss that particular issue. We will keep that under review but we
believe there are safeguards built in.</div>
<a name="09022517000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not
think, as my right hon. Friend the Minister for Employment and Welfare
Reform has said, that it is appropriate to have such detail on the face
of the Bill. We will&#151;as he has said and I will
say&#151;provide that in regulations. I am pleased that my hon.
Friend the Member for Sheffield, Heeley has found the document
commissioned by my right hon. Friend helpful. Indeed, we hope all
Committee members do. We do not want to stipulate support because, as
we say, it is about tailoring to individual needs. I hope I can send a
very clear signal 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column145" />Column number: 145</div>about what the Government&#146;s intention is, to
help these particular people in finding employment&#151;not having a
punitive regime, that actually trips people up, rather than one that
assists people to engage with someone. Ultimately, that is what we
want. The sanction will be there, but we do not anticipate it being
used a great deal. Certainly, from the pilots and the pathways to work
programme it was used very infrequently. However, it does provide, in
the right circumstances, a carrot-shaped stick in order for some people
to engage.</div>
<a name="09022517000107"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022517000462"></a>Meg
Munn:</b> I thank my hon. Friend for his words. It has been
enormously important to get that information on record, so that it is
clear what the Government&#146;s intention is in relation to people
with learning disabilities. On that basis, I beg to ask leave to
withdraw the amendment.</div>
<a name="09022517000108"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,
by leave, withdrawn.</i></div>
<a name="09022517000109"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022517000463"></a>Mr.
Clappison:</b> I beg to move amendment 12, in
clause 2, page 7, line 10, leave
out subsection
(3).</div><a name="09022517000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">Proposed
new section 2F of the Social Security Administration Act 1992 provides
that by direction, the Secretary of State may specify what is and what
is not to be regarded as work-related activity in any individual case.
Can I say at the outset that we welcome a personalised approach,
tailoring directions to the individual concerned? We hasten to add that
we need to see what this will mean in practice. That is the important
question, as far as we are concerned.</div>
<a name="09022517000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
subsection (3) of the proposed new section, relating to directions
about work-related activity, contains a retrospective power for a
direction of this nature&#151;what is and what is not to be regarded
as a work-related activity. It is a retrospective power to have effect
from a time before the giving of the direction in the case where it
varies or revokes a previous direction. I think I am on reasonably firm
ground in saying that this is a retrospective power, because the notes
on clauses admit that it may be so. Were a retrospective power to be
granted, it would be important to pause for a
moment.</div><a name="09022517000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is not to say that we are opposing this tooth and nail, or are seeking
a Division on it. We would be doing less than our duty of parliamentary
scrutiny, though, if we were not to raise the question of a
retrospective power, given the general approach toward those powers in
the line long of authorities on them, and a possible European dimension
on such powers as
well.</div><a name="09022517000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
do feel that it is important, wherever a retrospective power is
granted, to at least ask questions and seek to elicit more information.
In this case, what we need to know from the Government is just how this
retrospective power would be used. We note that it would be
retrospective in an individual case. Under the terms of this power, it
would be possible for an individual who had been carrying out what they
believed to be work-related activity, to have a later direction made
saying that it was not work-related activity after
all.</div><a name="09022517000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
always in cases of retrospective legislation, there is an individual
aspect to it: what individuals knew at the time, what they believed to
be the case and subsequent variations, and the question of how fair
that is to individuals. I do not want to make too much of that because
it is a general point about retrospective legislation. I just feel that
we need to give pause for a moment and ask the Government for more
information about it.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column146" />Column number: 146</div><a name="09022517000115"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022517000464"></a>Mr.
McNulty:</b> I dislike undue retrospectivity as much as I do
undue specificity. I do take the broad thrust of what the hon.
Gentleman is saying, but if we are to be, as we declared, as flexible
as possible, then we need 2F(3) to sit with 2F(1) and 2F(2). There may
be occasions where a person&#146;s circumstances have changed, and
the work-related activity they have been directed to undertake cannot
be completed&#151;because of the illness of a child, for example, or
because the childcare has fallen through. Without the catch-all of
proposed new section 2F(3), there could be an interpretation of the law
that such a person should be sanctioned regardless. So, this is
positive retrospectivity rather than negative. As a norm, the UK legal
system would decry retrospectivity in the
law.</div><a name="09022517000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
example would be where, because of a change in circumstances, a person
has agreed with their adviser to engage in activity that is not exactly
the same as they were directed into, but which nevertheless was
acceptable to the adviser as a suitable alternative. Again, without
proposed new section 2F(3), the person could be penalised. This
amendment would prevent a personal adviser issuing a revised direction
to fit the acceptable activity already undertaken.</div>
<a name="09022517000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">So by
definition, and to keep up with potential changes in someone&#146;s
circumstances, there has to be that degree of retrospectivity. As the
Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, my hon. Friend the
Member for Chatham and Aylesford, has already said, we do not want to
sanction or punish people unduly, and we will want to use those powers
in the Bill for sanctions as sparingly as possible. The process is much
more about the help and support we can afford people rather than
rushing to sanctions. Notwithstanding the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
points about retrospectivity, which I agree with, in this instance it
is important to have that catch-all to afford the adviser the degree of
flexibility which we all
seek.</div><a name="09022517000389"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022517000465"></a>The

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022517000466"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022517000467"></a>Mr.
Clappison:</b> As I hope that I have indicated already, this
is a probing amendment and I shall seek the Committee&#146;s leave to
withdraw it on the basis that I have drawn some reassurance from the
Minister&#146;s entirely appropriate remarks. Having heard the
Minister&#146;s two examples, however, I am not entirely convinced by
the aim. In the first example, he said that somebody&#146;s ill
health might prevent them from carrying out their original direction,
but I am not entirely convinced that the aim of doing justice to that
person could not be achieved by a simple variation rather than by a
revocation&#151;varying the terms of the order, so that the completed
part stood but was varied to something more suitable to the
person&#146;s current health conditions. I am not sure that variation
would not be a better way of dealing with it than revocation, when what
was directed 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column147" />Column number: 147</div>in the first place would no longer count because it
would have been revoked. However, I draw reassurance from the
Minister&#146;s explanation of the intention&#151;that, as far as
the individual claimant is concerned, the provision is intended to be
positive. In the light of his helpful remarks about that positivity and
its effect on any subsequent interpretation of the provisions, should
it come to that, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022517000469"></a>The

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022517000470"></a>Mr.
Clappison:</b> Again, amendment 13 is a probing amendment,
whereby we simply seek clarification of some possible legal issues. The
provision concerns contracting out to welfare to work providers and
their legal position&#151;where the Secretary of State has contracted
out functions to an external provider.</div>
<a name="09022517000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 21
raises the same issues in relation to contracting out in jobseekers
cases. Amendment 13 deals with contracting out of work-related activity
matters. Broadly, proposed new section 2G of the Social Security
Administration Act 1992 will enable the Secretary of State to authorise
providers to carry out functions on his behalf, while proposed new
subsections (7) and (8) concern the legal position of the Secretary of
State and the provider. Proposed new subsection (7) appears to provide
that anything done or omitted to be done by an authorised person is to
be treated as being done or omitted to be done by the Secretary of
State, so it appears that legal liability for what the provider does
will rest with the Secretary of State. However, proposed new subsection
(8) provides that that does not apply</div>
<a name="09022517000371"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;for the
purposes of so much of any contract made between the authorised person
and the Secretary of State as relates to the exercise of the
function&#148;.</div><a name="09022517000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
would like some clarification of the provision&#146;s implications.
For example, is it the Government&#146;s intention that the Secretary
of State can, by contractual terms, exclude himself from liability for
the actions or omissions of the provider? Can he thus exclude himself
from liability under the civil law? We raise that issue to seek
clarification from the Government about what proposed new subsection
(8) means. Proposed new subsection (7) says one thing but proposed new
subsection (8) appears to cater for an entirely different circumstance
and to go in the opposite direction. In case there is any question,
this is a probing amendment, however. We seek clarification, we think
it right to do so when there may be a legal issue and I wait with
interest to hear what the Minister has to
say.</div>
<a name="09022517000129"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022517000471"></a>Mr.
McNulty:</b> I understand the confusion. The Committee will
know that these laws are written in something approximating English,
but not quite English&#151;we have to allow for appropriate
distinctions. The hon. Gentleman is right to suggest that proposed new
section 2G(7) provides that anything done or omitted to be done by an
authorised person, or an employee of that authorised person, is to be
treated as if done by the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column148" />Column number: 148</div>Secretary of State. It is terribly clumsy, but we
still have to afford the Secretary of State the right to sue those who
contract out for breach of contract, or any other aspect of contract
law. The clumsy way of doing that is to say in subsection (7) that all
of what can and should be done is actually the Secretary of
State&#146;s duty, and rightly and properly so, save for those
contracted out subsequently and passed on to a contractor to do on
behalf of the Secretary of State. That is terribly clumsy, but I think
the import of them is to have the Secretary of State fully responsible
for what are clearly his duties under a raft of previous social
security legislation. Where, as in the two instances that the hon.
Gentleman has alighted upon, there is a clear contractual obligation on
a third party&#151;where duties have been contracted out&#151;there
must still be scope for the Secretary of State, notwithstanding what
subsection (7) says about his duties, to afford the proper
contractual relationship with that other body in what is the normal
contracting
practice.</div><a name="09022517000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is saying that here is the sum of the Secretary of State&#146;s
responsibilities and the Bill makes provision for part of that to be
contracted out. We must reinvent and rebuild under contractual law the
ability of the Secretary of State and the Government to sue or
challenge, at the very least, the outside contractor for those elements
that have been contracted out subsequently. Even the explanation is
clumsy, which I understand, but the interplay between subsections (7)
and (8) is
important.</div><a name="09022517000131"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022517000472"></a>Mr.
Clappison:</b> The Minister is doing a good job of giving an
explanation of this. I invite his attention and, perhaps appropriately,
his reflection, because it raises legal issues, on another aspect of
this. That is the possible liability of the external provider to a
claimant where the external provider may have been negligent in
discharging his duties to the claimant. Would this serve to exclude the
Secretary of State from liability for the same negligence where the
external provider had been negligent to the claimant? While the
claimant may have an action against the external provider, issues could
arise if the external provider, through any circumstances, came to be
in a position to be unable to meet any claim that was brought against
him by the claimant. In those circumstances, would the claimant have a
right of action against the Secretary of State, or does this serve to
exclude
it?</div><a name="09022517000132"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022517000473"></a>Mr.
McNulty:</b> Just to add to the confusion, I am told by this
magical process that enlightens Ministers every now and then that the
claimant, even in those circumstances, would sue the Secretary of
State, who, because of the interplay between subsections (7) and (8),
could then go on to sue the
provider.</div><a name="09022517000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am grateful that the hon. Gentleman has afforded me time to reflect on
these matters, but I think that the original position that I presented
of subsections (7) and (8) and their interplay being a clumsy way of
making sure that the Secretary of State is still afforded appropriate
contractual rights under contract law for those bits that have been
contracted out. I believe that the circularity still endures&#151;I
will get back to the Committee if that is not the case&#151;the
duties lie with the Secretary of State. The circumstances described by
the hon. Gentleman would mean, I think, that the individual would sue
the Secretary of State and if there was any scope to, not least because
of the existence of the part we are referring to, that would afford the
Secretary of State the ability to sue the
provider.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022517000474"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> The Minister has said several times that this is a
clumsy way of achieving this particular outcome. Is there a particular
reason why it has been done like this, or is there some elegant way of
achieving this that has somehow escaped
him?</div><a name="09022517000135"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022517000475"></a>Mr.

approached the matter in a reasonable way. I invite him to go away and

from negligence. On the basis that the Minister has said that he will

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022517000488"></a>Paul
Rowen:</b> I beg to move amendment 43, in

<a name="09022517000372"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#145;following the
presentation of a report concerning income support; and, such an order
may not be made unless a draft of a statutory instrument containing the
order has been laid before, and approved by a resolution of, each House
of Parliament.&#146;.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column150" />Column number: 150</div><a name="09022517000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
7 deals with the abolition of income support and is part of the
Government&#146;s long-term commitment to simplifying benefits. The
clause grants the Secretary of State the power to abolish income
support. In moving amendment 43, I am seeking to require him to present
both a statutory instrument and report regulations that can be fully
debated by both Houses before such a decision is taken. The question is
why I am making such a request. As hon. Members are aware, income
support as it currently stands is still available. It is a remaining
benefit for carers, lone parents and women in the later stages of
pregnancy. It is not subject to labour market conditions.</div>
<a name="09022517000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government have previously confirmed that carers will be entitled to
continue to claim income support until there is a clear and detailed
plan for the long-term reform of the benefits available to carers. We
seek to probe the Government&#146;s intentions for this clause, as we
should not grant a wide-ranging power to abolish income support without
first having in place a replacement allowance that has been properly
debated. Something that pervades the Bill far too much is the granting
of sweeping powers to the Secretary of State without any detailed
reference to conditionality and without any redress or support for
affected
groups.</div>
<a name="09022517000391"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.15
pm</div><a name="09022517000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment would mean that before income support was abolished&#151;a
power that the clause grants to the Secretary of State&#151;there
should be full discussion and agreement in both Houses of Parliament
about the replacement allowance. It would clearly be wrong for ESA, as
it is currently constituted, to be the replacement allowance. For
example, under ESA, when someone is required to attend a meeting, that
meeting cannot be deferred, but can be waived, and that is not a
statutory measure.</div>
<a name="09022517000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">We need to
see the Government&#146;s proposals in writing before income support
can be abolished. I hope, and believe, that we can all agree a way
forward that would provide carers with a better benefit and recognise
the tremendous work that they do. Under the Bill, however, there could
be a blanket abolition of income support before it had been replaced,
and we should afford people the protection of a requirement that
Parliament must approve any replacement before the Secretary of State
may exercise the power to abolish
it.</div><a name="09022517000162"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022517000489"></a>Mr.
McNulty:</b> The hon. Gentleman is right, but for the wrong
reasons. He is wrong to suggest that the power is sweeping, as it is a
single power to abolish a particular benefit, but he is right to say
that there are issues to consider, including carers and the timing of
such abolition. That is why we have made it clear that we would not
introduce an order to abolish that benefit until there were no longer
any groups that required it. That seems terribly straightforward; one
would not abolish a benefit while people still required it. We have
made it very clear that in proposing to abolish income support, we do
not propose that people who get it should receive any less money or
should be subject to requirements such as that they must look for work.
The intention is to simplify and streamline the system without making
it any less sensitive to people&#146;s needs, and clause 7 does that
appropriately. This measure, and other laws in regulation and statute,
will prevail as people move off income support and on to other
benefits.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column151" />Column number: 151</div><a name="09022517000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">For the same
reason, I do not agree that there is any value in requiring a separate
report, as the amendment suggests. By the time that such a report was
produced, it would be very clear what arrangements had been made for
each group of income support recipients, because we would not introduce
an order until we were in that position. Also, there will probably be
further consultation on at least some groups&#151;certainly on
carers&#151;as I mentioned earlier. Any report would therefore simply
be a formality saying that there were no longer any recipients of
income support and that we were going to abolish it. That would be a
complete waste of everyone&#146;s time and would do no more than
confirm something that would be apparent from a cursory reading of the
relevant
order.</div><a name="09022517000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman can and should be assured that there is no secret agenda
to rush towards the abolition of income support without dealing with
those extant groups that still require it, and no order will be
forthcoming until we are at a stage when there are no recipients of a
benefit that we seek to
abolish.</div><a name="09022517000165"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022517000490"></a>Paul
Rowen:</b> Is the Minister prepared to give an assurance that
the replacement for income support for carers will be debated through
consideration of regulations, and that if a new law has to be
introduced, there will be an opportunity for proper scrutiny? It is all
right saying that there will not be anyone claiming the benefit, but if
there will be no opportunity to discuss the replacement benefit, what I
am seeking through the amendment should be
accepted.</div><a name="09022517000166"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022517000491"></a>Mr.
McNulty:</b> In the strictest sense, there will not be a
replacement benefit. What we are trying to do for carers in the way
that I described earlier is to look radically at the whole approach to
supporting them, including with regard to benefits, across the whole of
the Government including, crucially, on social
care.</div><a name="09022517000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall not give the hon. Gentleman an assurance about proper scrutiny
without his defining what &#147;proper&#148; means in that context.
At the very least, there will be plenty of scope for scrutiny through
the Social Security Advisory Commission, at the least through the
negative procedure, and potentially through the affirmative procedure.
I am sure that there will be other times and opportunities when we will
report in more detail for such scrutiny. As has been suggested, the
importance of the role of carers in this country is far too important
for the situation to be
otherwise.</div><a name="09022517000168"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022517000493"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> I wish to speak about several issues relating to
this aspect of the Bill. At the beginning, it is worth saying that my
party supports the proposals in the Bill for a treatment allowance.
That came out clearly in the evidence sessions, but I say it again for
avoidance of doubt because the Minister for Employment and Welfare
Reform has recently stated the opposite by rather mischievously taking
a very short quotation from the former shadow Secretary of State and
missing out important words that completely changed the meaning of the
sentence.</div><a name="09022517000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am making my remarks by way of ensuring that the proposals are properly
questioned. Also, I want them to be successful, but I have some doubts,
which are based on feedback about whether they will work from sensible
practitioners in this area from whom we did not hear during the
evidence
sessions.</div><a name="09022517000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">Claimants
who are dependent on drugs are a real problem. The Minister highlighted
a real issue, and I know from my own constituents, from people I have
spoken to throughout the country and from the clear reaction of members
on both sides of the Committee when we were listening to some of the
evidence that it is an issue for all Members. For some, it is a problem
in their
constituencies.</div><a name="09022517000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
first thing that is worth discussing is treatment capacity, which came
up a great deal during the evidence session. This is one of the areas
that I want Ministers to clarify. When the Minister for Employment and
Welfare Reform was asked about it, we were talking about the number of
problem drug users who were on benefits. The number that was floating
around was 240,000. A concern was expressed about whether the capacity
would be available if a significant number of those people were
captured by the proposals and referred to drug treatment services. I
think that I am accurately paraphrasing the Minister by saying that he
pointed out that, in the initial stages, the focus would be on only
heroin and crack users, because that was where the biggest problem was,
so the whole drug problem would not be tackled.</div>
<a name="09022517000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, if
we consider the numbers concerned, there are approximately 330,000
problem drug users in England&#151;they are the heroin or crack
addicts. Two thirds of them are on benefits, but only half of those on
benefits are accessing drug treatment. It seems that even if the
Department focuses on the heroin and crack addicts who the Minister
states are the priority, there are 267,000 problem drug users. Even if
a relatively small percentage of those were to be dealt with each year,
that would represent a significant increase in the number of users
accessing drug treatment. I am not convinced that there will be the
capacity to provide that treatment. There would be nothing worse than
using the powers in the Bill to persuade or cajole benefit claimants to
access treatment only to find that that treatment was not available.
That would not help anyone at all.</div>
<a name="09022517000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
rubbished it somewhat, but the evidence provided to the Committee by
DrugScope about a response that it received from the Department of
Health suggested that an increase in drug users referred through this
process could be dealt with only by accelerating them in the queue
ahead of those who had come to drug treatment voluntarily. The Minister
needs to clarify that because that would not be satisfactory. It would
not be helpful if those who had come forward for drug 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column153" />Column number: 153</div>treatment of their own volition were moved down the queue so that people
who were there because of a threat of sanction could be dealt with. The
Minister needs to tackle the question of how many problem drug users he
expects this process to deal with&#151;the Department must have made
an estimate&#151;and what impact that will have on the available
treatment services in England. In a moment, I will deal with some
examples from Wales, where there are specific issues about the length
of time that users have to wait to access treatment services. There was
some discussion at the evidence session about the extent to which the
Department is engaging with the Scottish and Welsh Assembly Governments
to ensure that such services are
available.</div><a name="09022517000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
issue is the extent to which Jobcentre Plus advisers are the right
people to be involved in this process. That partly concerns their
skills and the training that they will have, but it also concerns the
nature of the organisations that are best placed to engage with problem
drug users.</div>
<a name="09022517000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
received feedback from Turning Point, which runs a programme in Wales
that helps some of these problem drug users to get back into work. The
information that they gave to the Government&#146;s consultation was
that because Jobcentre Plus is a statutory body that handles the
day-to-day delivery of benefits, in the minds of claimants, the
disclosure of personal information such as the use of problem drugs to
a Jobcentre Plus adviser would be implicitly linked to whether or not
they got those benefits.</div>
<a name="09022517000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">From the
experience of Turning Point, a non-statutory body would engage with
those users more successfully. For users who were parents, concerns
would be linked not only with getting their benefits, but with whether
a disclosure of problem drug use might lead to such a thing as their
children being removed by social services. It believed that the
likelihood of people making a disclosure to an independent adviser
would be much greater than that happening to a statutory body
responsible for benefit payments. Its experience from its progress2work
operations was that its workers were referring people who were not
previously known to treatment providers or known to be problem drug
users. When the Minister thinks about how this programme will be
implemented, it will be worth bearing in mind the extent to which
Jobcentre Plus advisers would be engaged in it, or whether a
significant proportion of this work could be more effective if it was
delivered by a third
party.</div><a name="09022517000392"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.30
pm</div><a name="09022517000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are also some concerns about data protection. The clause contains
proposals for information sharing between Jobcentre Plus and law
enforcement agencies. Although the Bill contains safeguards to protect
individuals from criminal liability as a result of the disclosures they
make, there are still concerns about how that information is secured
and transferred. The Minister will be aware, both from his previous
roles and in his current one, about the importance of data security. It
would be helpful if he covered some of those issues in his
response.</div><a name="09022517000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
other matter that we touched on briefly in the evidence-taking session
was exactly what the Minister means by &#147;treatment&#148;. I
think that he said during that session that he was clear that the
objective of treatment was to get someone off their drug habit, as
opposed to just managing it. I ask about that because there are two 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column154" />Column number: 154</div>issues involved. In the national treatment programme, a significant
number of people&#151;about 50 per cent.&#151;appear to be having
their drug addiction managed, as opposed to their getting off drugs.
That may be a success from a criminal justice perspective&#151;if
they are on a programme where they are receiving a methadone
prescription, that may deal with their need to commit crimes to fund
that habit&#151;but if they remain addicted to methadone, although
that is less problematic than taking heroin, it does not mean that they
are in a good, stable situation allowing them to get to get work or
remain in work. I should like some understanding of the objective of
the treatment that the claimant would be expected to undertake; is the
objective to get those people off their drug habit, albeit recognising
that that may take some time, or is it simply to manage that habit in
the long
term?</div><a name="09022517000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have already mentioned the resources issues. We will see if the
Minister can outline some of those. I should particularly like to
understand what the Department thinks the likely outcome of this part
of the Bill will be, including estimates of how many people will be
referred to a provider in first few years and how well the programme
will
work.</div><a name="09022517000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">Specifically,
picking up the issue I mentioned in respect of Wales, I have data from
Cardiff, which is effective as of this month, showing that the next
person on the waiting list for a methadone prescription from the
community addiction unit in the Vale of Glamorgan, for example, has
been on the list since March 2008. That person has been waiting nearly
a year for drug treatment. More than 500 people are on the waiting list
in Cardiff. There is a fast-track system, but at the moment that is
only for pregnant women. Conversely, the drug intervention programme
has no waiting list, but all prospective clients must have been
involved in the criminal justice system. There is clearly a resource
issue there. Those involved in the criminal justice system can get
treatment immediately, as it right and proper, but those who are not
involved in the criminal justice system appear to be waiting for a
significant period. Clearly, even if the Minister is comfortable about
how this scheme will work in England, there are issues in the devolved
parts of the UK that Ministers need to take into account when rolling
it
out.</div><a name="09022517000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have covered the issues that I wanted to raise. We are supportive of
the proposals. I am not challenging the nature of the proposals but I
want to ensure that the Minister has thought through the details and
the implementation and that they are as successful as we all wish them
to
be.</div><a name="09022517000188"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022517000494"></a>Paul
Rowen:</b> We have great concerns about this clause, which
grants the Secretary of State sweeping powers that will be reinforced
by regulation, but does not prescribe the limits of some of those
powers. Schedule 3 mentions some of the powers that are granted. In
particular, paragraph 5(1) deals with where information may be obtained
from. It grants Jobcentre Plus staff with the power to obtain
information held by</div>
<a name="09022517000373"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a police
force...the probation service, or...any other such person as
may be
prescribed.&#148;</div><a name="09022517000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
do not have in this country a statute of limitations stating what
responsibilities and rights people have, but we are granting the
Secretary of State sweeping powers to obtain information about
someone&#146;s health and wellbeing. Returning to the point that I
made this morning, that seems to run counter to the NHS constitution 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column155" />Column number: 155</div>under which the treatment that someone receives is
fundamentally for them to decide and may be offered by the
NHS.</div>
<a name="09022517000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph 2
of schedule 3 refers to &#147;a substance-relate assessment&#148;
and specifies in great detail how that might proceed. Our view is that
there is a much better way of doing that and that such detailed
regulation is better dealt with in a health Bill rather than a benefits
Bill. The two may be related, but I would be more confident if civil
servants in the Department of Health specified who might be a suitable
person than if a regulation drafted by the Department for Work and
Pensions did so.</div>
<a name="09022517000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">Insufficient
thought seems to have been given to how the provision will work. The
Minister said that there will be pilots and that the matter will be
prioritised, but what discussion has taken place with colleagues in the
Department of Health to decide how it will be implemented? In our view,
the worst outcome would be that people who are already on the waiting
list for treatment and are not receiving benefits or who are receiving
benefits but are not in a targeted group will be moved down the list to
accommodate someone whom the Bill determines should receive priority.
That is iniquitous, and not the right way of going about the matter.
During the evidence sessions, reference was made to voluntary schemes
and a proper assessment of them. Why have we not had a proper
assessment of what is already working and how it can be
extended?</div><a name="09022517000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Forest of Dean mentioned Wales. Services throughout
England vary from region to region, and different health authorities
have different levels of provision. What guarantee is there and what
discussions has the Minister had with the Department of Health to
ensure that if a policy is imposed on, for example, the north-west or
the south-west, the resources will be available to implement it and
that it will work?</div>
<a name="09022517000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
concerned about this aspect of the Bill, and how it will work in
practice, including civil liberties and the amount of information that
can be obtained from various sources, but which may not be necessary to
enable JCP staff to undertake the job with which they have been
charged. It seems to us that that would be better dealt with elsewhere
than in the
Bill.</div><a name="09022517000194"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09022517000495"></a><b class="B">Mr.
John Baron</b> (Billericay) (Con): I would like to raise a few
concerns about the clause. On the face of it, the proposal is
attractive, because it is not a welcome thought that our taxes and
welfare system are subsidising a life of addiction and perhaps even
crime. However, serious questions must be asked, and I share the
concerns of my hon. Friend the Member for Forest of Dean about whether
the capacity is in place to support the proposals, and whether such an
approach in itself will be ultimately successful.</div>
<a name="09022517000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">On capacity,
we heard from our evidence sessions that more than 200,000 drug addicts
are currently in treatment, and the capacity just about keeps pace with
that demand. These figures are easy to bandy around, so I shall ask the
Minister to clarify them if not now then later. We also heard, however,
that about 100,000 addicts currently draw benefits but are not in
treatment. It is difficult to believe that the existing services will
cope with such a big increase in demand without a big increase in
resources. When the chief executive of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column156" />Column number: 156</div>DrugScope was questioned, he clearly made the point that it would be
&#147;extremely difficult&#148; for the system to cope with any
extra demand without an increase in resources. What estimate has the
Minister or his Department made of how many extra drug addicts will
require treatment as a result of the proposals? What will be the cost
of that extra provision? And, where will the resources come from? I do
not see any additional resources tagged on to the Bill. I am sure that
the Minister is fully aware that it is all right putting such proposals
in place, but that, if we do not create the capacity to deal with the
envisaged increase in demand, the proposals will be almost
worthless.</div>
<a name="09022517000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
question of whether the general approach will be successful, all the
evidence suggests that addicts will make progress with treatment only
once they have resolved in their own mind to do so. Some addicts
persist with their habit, despite it costing them their job, health,
home or even their partner and their children, and despite the pain
that that subsequently causes. The question that we as a Committee must
ask ourselves is, are those people seriously going to take advice from,
or respond to, a nice
lady&#151;<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption]&#151;</i>or gentleman sitting
behind a jobcentre desk asking them to go for treatment? I have met
many nice people in jobcentre offices, and they can be very tenacious,
determined and gritty while being compassionate. However, they have
only certain powers of persuasion, and when addicts have caused so much
pain to themselves and, perhaps, others, and gone to such lengths to
pursue their habit, one must question whether the policy will succeed.
Indeed, the chief executive of DrugScope has said:</div>
<a name="09022517000374"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;There
is no evidence that using benefit sanctions to compel problem drug
users into treatment will be effective. Withdrawing benefits could
perversely drive some people further away from the support they need,
potentially impacting upon their families and wider
communities&#148;.</div>
<a name="09022517000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">I suggest to
the Minister that if people are forced into treatment that proves
wholly ineffective, it at best wastes valuable time and resources and,
at worst, delays the moment when they finally get serious about giving
up or about re-entering work. Perhaps worse than that, such an approach
risks diverting scarce and valuable resources from those who are more
serious about giving up their habit. What evidence does the Minister
have to suggest otherwise&#151;that using benefit sanctions to force
addicts into treatment will be effective? And, what measures will he
put in place to ensure that resources are not diverted from where they
are most needed and from people who genuinely want to give up their
habit? I look forward to hearing his responses to those
questions.</div>
<a name="09022517000393"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.45
pm</div><a name="09022517000198"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022517000496"></a>John
Mason:</b> I have a lot of sympathy with a number of concerns
that have been mentioned already. I will make a few points.</div>
<a name="09022517000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">Do we have
clear definitions of some of the terminology used in the Bill? One such
term is &#147;propensity to misuse&#148;. How many people clearly
have that propensity? How many do not? How many would be in a grey
area? Even the word &#147;dependent&#148; needs to be defined. Most
of us would probably feel that we could tell whether somebody was
dependent on drugs or alcohol, but my understanding is that when
scientific tests are taken on somebody, all they can tell is whether a
drug is present in that person&#146;s body, not whether they are a
regular user. There may be other ways of doing that.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column157" />Column number: 157</div><a name="09022517000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">Can
the Minister assure us that he will be working with the Scottish
Government, within our national drugs strategy? That has changed in
recent years from managing, as has already been mentioned, and just
giving people methadone with or without support, and now includes
tackling the drug problem that many people have. In Glasgow, and in
other parts of Scotland, there is a real drug problem. None of us is
running away from that or pretending that that is not the
case.</div>
<a name="09022517000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is an
idea that, if savings are made through benefit reductions, those funds
can go through back into the Scottish budget to give more support to
drug users. This point has already been made but it is worth
emphasising: many people on drugs are in need of help more than
anything else. Many of them probably greatly regret that they are on
drugs, but they need the motivation to come off. If they do not have
that motivation, I am not convinced that a lot of sanctions are really
going to help. Even if they do want to come off, DrugScope told us that
we are talking seven or eight years for somebody to come off heroin,
which is a serious length of time.</div>
<a name="09022517000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, what
happens to the children in families headed by drug addicts? I asked
that question to Barnardo&#146;s in the earlier Committee meeting and
its chief executive seemed somewhat stumped by it. But we are also
committed to tackling child poverty. How do we tie these in? If the
family income reduces, does that mean that the children suffer? And
where, in practical terms, does the family end up? Do they go on to
steal? Are they dependent on their grandparents, who, on limited means,
help in supporting the kids? Or does it just mean that the kids eat
less?</div><a name="09022517000203"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022517000497"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Ann
McKechin):</b> It is a pleasure to serve under you this
afternoon, Mr. Hood.</div>
<a name="09022517000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">I welcome
this debate. It is clearly on a very serious issue which affects many
of our constituencies, particularly for the three members of the
Committee who represent Glasgow seats, where we are all well aware of
the damage that it causes. The debate is on the basis that we want to
set up a new contract, between applicants on one side and the
Government on the other, about where the responsibilities lie. The aim
is to provide a more tailored package which adequately deals with the
needs of people who suffer from drug misuse. Such people are moved much
further away from the job market as a result of their drug misuse,
which permanently affects their lifestyle. Against that background, we
have decided that it is important that we first of all focus on those
who have the most chaotic lifestyles. That is why we will initially
target those using heroin and crack cocaine, because that is the group
which causes the most harm to themselves, their families and
society.</div>
<a name="09022517000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">Every year
the use of class A drugs costs society &#163;18 billion in
health and crime costs alone. Ninety-nine per cent. of that is caused
by problem drug use. So it is appropriate that we target this group
first, because it is the group with the most propensity to harm. But as
a number of Members said this afternoon, it is also important that we
carry out this pilot first and then roll out the service in a way that
allows our health services to have the appropriate capacity to
cope.</div>
<a name="09022517000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">There have
been record levels of investment in treatment for drug misuse in
England, which has led to a large expansion in capacity and dramatic
reductions in waiting 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column158" />Column number: 158</div>times. Ninety-three per cent. of drug users are
receiving treatment within three weeks of being assessed. The
Department of Health and the Department for Work and Pensions have
looked closely at likely numbers being referred into treatment from
jobcentres, and we do not believe that capacity will be an issue,
although we will monitor this very closely. We will have local drug
jobcentre co-ordinators funded by the Department of Health and in post
by spring this year. We will be keeping an eye on any potential pinch
points and drawing those to the attention of the local drugs
partnership.</div><a name="09022517000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
National Treatment Agency for Substance Misuse will be monitoring data
on waiting times and the provisions of the Bill will be piloted, so
that should problems with implementation occur pilots can be
terminated, or the system delayed in rolling out countrywide, until
these issues are resolved.</div>
<a name="09022517000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Forest of Dean mentioned the issue of queue jumping. I can
assure him that there is no question of benefit claimants queue jumping
into treatment. If, on occasion, more people need a particular type of
treatment than there are current places, it would be the job of the
local drugs partnership to make decisions on the basis of clinical
need, not the route to referral. We are quite clear about
that.</div><a name="09022517000209"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022517000498"></a>Mr.
Baron:</b> I was interested to hear the hon. Lady&#146;s
comments about pinch points. Given the numbers involved and the
estimates that came out of the evidence sessions, there could be up to
100,000 extra addicts looking for treatment. What happens if these
pinch points do occur? What action will the Government take to resolve
the situation? What measures will be in place to ensure that pinch
points do not result in long
delays?</div><a name="09022517000210"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022517000499"></a>Ann
McKechin:</b> It is important that we work on a local basis,
where we can consider the local capacity of drug services in the area.
That is why we want the staff of the DWP and the Department of Health
to work very closely together&#151;if the pinch point is in
England&#151;to ensure that, if there is a pinch point, the
appropriate steps are taken within jobcentres to make referrals out
into the health service. We want to ensure that we do not end up in the
position where there would be any significant increase in waiting times
for treatment for any person who has come through the jobcentre route
or any other clinician route. That is why it is important that there is
a degree of local control and management rather than an entirely
centralised system. That is why we will be appointing co-ordinators to
deal with
that.</div><a name="09022517000211"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022517000500"></a>Mr.
Baron:</b> If the hon. Lady cannot answer this question now,
then she could perhaps come back later, but it is no good saying that
pinch points will be monitored locally and their effect can be
minimised. If we are talking about getting anywhere near the figures
suggested in the evidence sessions, we are not talking about pinch
points; we are talking about, perhaps, an overloading of the system, at
least in certain areas. What specific measures will the Government take
to ensure that they can cope with that? I am talking about possible
additional resources being required here, because we heard in the
evidence sessions that existing capacity is only just keeping up with
demand, before this extra demand&#151;we think&#151;comes into
play. What extra resources will the Government commit to this to ensure
that this does not become a major issue?</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column159" />Column number: 159</div><a name="09022517000212"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022517000501"></a>Ann
McKechin:</b> The position in England is a very healthy one:
the average wait for referrals is three weeks. For those of us in
Scotland, we are waiting for up to 52 weeks; we would love
to be anywhere close to what there is in England. There has certainly
been no lack of commitment by this Government in putting resources into
drug treatment here in England.</div>
<a name="09022517000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman raises an important question, however; it is the very reason
why we are going to pilot this over a two-year period, and why we will
report back to Parliament on any successes or problems that may occur.
It is also why we have included a sunset clause in these
provisions&#151;so that Parliament will have another opportunity to
consider the terms of the pilot and whether it has been a success. This
gives a degree of reassurance that, as a Government, we will have to
meet the demand, but we also have to make sure that we roll out the
demand in a way that is manageable&#151;not only on a national scale
but also in terms of local health services. We are very keen to ensure
that that is the case.</div>
<a name="09022517000214"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022517000502"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> The Minister said that the pilots in England would
run over a two-year period. When the Minister for Employment and
Welfare Reform was pressed on this in the evidence session, he said it
would take that length of time to get the provision of treatment
services in Wales and Scotland to a point at which a pilot in those two
parts of the United Kingdom was a meaningful
prospect.</div><a name="09022517000215"></a>

working very closely with the devolved Administration in Wales. We

not want to burden health services in a way that causes additional
stress. We are still hopeful that we will be in a position at some

the programme in

they say is unethical, but I will come to that later when I deal with
the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column160" />Column number: 160</div>comments made by the hon. Member for Glasgow, East.
At the present time, it is clear that they do not have capacity. They
do not have an anti-drugs strategy. We do not have a time scale for
when they might reduce the waiting times and we do not know what
percentage of extra people would be needed to assist. Therefore, we
have a problem with that particular
point.</div><a name="09022517000222"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022517000506"></a>John
Mason:</b> Is it not the case that the Scottish Government
have indicated that they hope to have much improved times within two
years?</div><a name="09022517000223"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022517000507"></a>Ann
McKechin:</b> That might well be the case. I understand that
the Scottish Government initially promised a 20 per cent.
increase in their manifesto. According to their justice budget, their
spending is only up 14 per cent. However, if we look at the number more
closely, the apparent increase is only 1.9 per cent average in real
terms over the next three years. They have also failed to set up the
drugs commission, which they promised. There is no target in their
strategy for increasing the number of people receiving drug misuse
treatment, they have dropped the previous Administration&#146;s
target of increasing the numbers in treatment by 10 per cent. and there
is no target for waiting times. Unfortunately, the story there is not
very positive, but we continue to work with the Scottish Government. We
are surprised that they now want us to wait until the pilots have been
carried out in England because they are not slow to point out that
there are always differences with the devolved Administrations, which
is the very reason why we want the pilots&#151;so that we can test
the provisions against the different provisions and services that are
available in Scotland. I hope that they will use the opportunity to
reconsider that because it would be very much in the interests of their
own
constituents.</div><a name="09022517000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me return to the comments made by the hon. Member for Forest of Dean.
He mentioned the issue of the jobcentre staff and the type of training
with which they would be engaged. The role of the personal adviser will
be to judge whether there are reasonable grounds for believing a person
is a problem drug user. We will be issuing guidance to staff on how to
assess whether there are such reasonable grounds. We are certainly not
expecting them to make any medical judgments; that must be left to
specialists and will be dealt with through our contacts with the NHS.
Staff will be provided with guidance on how to spot the possible signs
and behaviours linked with drug misuse and it will be drawn up in
conjunction with the NTA. The new Jobcentre Plus drugs co-ordinators
will also have a role in raising awareness among all staff about drug
misuse, including the difficulties faced by drug users in dealing with
the requirements of the benefit system. Sadly, Jobcentre Plus staff are
not unused to dealing with drug misusers, so they already have
knowledge of that particular client group, but we want to ensure that
they work closely with the Department of Health regarding
awareness.</div>
<a name="09022517000394"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6
pm</div><a name="09022517000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman mentioned data protection. Any provisions regarding the
sharing of information will be subject to the Human Rights Act 1998 and
data protection legislation. He also asked about treatment and what it
involves. Treatment will be medically determined by specialists and
will be part of the rehabilitation plan, but will not be the only part
of it, because we are 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column161" />Column number: 161</div>looking at giving advice on soft skills, debt,
housing and skills training, all of which might form part of the
rehabilitation package. We will not force people to take invasive
treatments, and their consent will be required for such treatments. If
methadone is prescribed as a potential treatment for their condition,
their consent will be required in relation to the standard conditions
of the NHS
charter.</div>
<a name="09022517000226"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022517000508"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> When he gave evidence to the Committee, the
Minister for Employment and Welfare Reform made it clear that the
priority, in the pilots, were heroin and crack cocaine users, of whom
approximately 240,000 are on benefits. Does the Department have any
idea, from its research and evidence, of the kind of treatment required
to get someone to a position where their problem drug use is no longer
a barrier to work? The point that I am driving at is one that I alluded
to earlier: does the evidence suggest that, for most heroin or crack
cocaine users, the barrier to working will be substantially reduced
when they use a substitute such as methadone, or do they have to be
completely off drugs to work? That is not clear to me, and I wonder
whether the Department has a view on
that.</div><a name="09022517000227"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022517000509"></a>Ann
McKechin:</b> We appreciate that coming out of drug use can
take a long time. Our aim with rehabilitation plans is to stabilise
people&#146;s condition so that they are sufficiently able to engage
with labour market activity. That might mean that they are still on
methadone, or are coming off it gradually, because it can take some
time to come off. We will work closely with employers, through local
employment partnerships, to find job opportunities and give guaranteed
interviews and work placements to people who have gone through that
kind of rehabilitation plan, so that there will be an outcome for them
at the end of the day. People will not necessarily be totally off drugs
when they re-enter the standard JSA regime.</div>
<a name="09022517000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Rochdale was concerned about sharing information with the
police force and probation service. Those details are still being
discussed with our colleagues in the Home Office and Ministry of
Justice, but the regulations will provide for information sharing that
is proportionate to our aims. Many people who suffer from heroin and
cocaine use will have been through the criminal justice and prison
systems, and might already be in a rehabilitation programme as part of
their probation programme. It is important that we have relevant and
correct information from the criminal justice system to ensure that we
are co-ordinated and are aware of what is happening under both the DWP
and criminal justice systems.</div>
<a name="09022517000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">Information
from the probation service will include details of individuals who are
subject to rehabilitation requirements as part of a community sentence.
Such people will already be receiving drug treatment, and we will want
to ensure that they are included in the programme. Information from the
police is likely to include details of people who have tested positive
for drug use when arrested, have been charged with offences or have
been referred for a required assessment. Information from prisons will
include details of people who have recently left prison. The
regulations will be subject to the affirmative procedure, so Parliament
will have the opportunity to consider and approve regulations before
they are put in place.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column162" />Column number: 162</div><a name="09022517000230"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022517000510"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> On prisons, may I make a helpful point? This issue
came up when I visited the progress2work operation run by Turning Point
in Cardiff. Rather than simply have information about people who have
recently left prison, it might help if the Department got that
information in advance. One thing that has come through very clearly to
me is that if there is no arrangement in place for someone&#146;s
housing and work situation as they are leaving prison, but preferably
before they leave, and if they go back to where they used to live, they
end up associating with the same people and quickly getting back on to
drugs. That not only spoils their employment opportunities but, if they
have been off drugs in prison, it can lead to their dying or becoming
seriously ill. Notwithstanding concerns about information sharing, it
would be better to have information from prisons before or as soon as
those people leave. That would join them up with this type of programme
so that they do not fall through that
gap.</div><a name="09022517000231"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022517000511"></a>Ann
McKechin:</b> The hon. Gentleman raises an excellent point. It
is important that people coming out of prison&#151;particularly after
a substantial period and if they have already been in a drugs
programme&#151;do not start to take the drugs available on the
street, or they could be in risk of their lives. It is important that
we have a system that manages to catch people so that they do not fall
into holes. We need co-ordination between prison and probation
services, health services, and housing agencies in terms of debt
advice, because one or two issues in that package can mean the
difference between someone managing to cope and someone falling
through.</div>
<a name="09022517000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">In terms of
drug treatment, the figures show that 83 per cent. of those in
treatment are recorded receiving effective treatment that has a
long-term positive impact. In addition, 93 per cent. of those assessed
as requiring drug treatment are able to access it within three weeks.
That is critical because the scientific evidence is clear that putting
people into treatment is the best possible way out of drug
misuse.</div>
<a name="09022517000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Rochdale involved himself in an argument that I found
difficult to follow about why, if we put a piece of legislation into a
health Bill, it would be different in essence&#151;although the
terminology might be the same&#151;from one that we put into a Bill
on welfare reform. He creates artificial barriers, which we are trying
to take down. When someone leaves prison or hospital after taking a
drug overdose, they do not necessarily distinguish between a health
Bill and a welfare reform Bill; they need help, and that is what the
Bill intends to provide. It is not about a punitive regime: it is about
a regime that takes people off JSA standard conditions and puts them on
to a treatment programme that is far more appropriate for the condition
in which they are in. I hope the hon. Gentleman would welcome
that.</div>
<a name="09022517000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Glasgow, East mentioned the question of working with the
Scottish Government. I have said that we are more than happy to work
constructively with them. I bring to his attention one scheme on which
we could agree. That was mentioned in yesterday&#146;s
<i class="I">Herald</i><i class="I"> </i>and it suggests that the Scottish Government have
used the example that we are trying to use, but in the criminal justice
system; it is called the persistent offenders programme.</div>
<a name="09022517000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">A study into
the first year of that programme found that serial offending by people
involved in shoplifting, housebreaking and prostitution was cut by
almost 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column163" />Column number: 163</div>30 per cent. in four of Glasgow&#146;s police divisions. The programme
staff identify the most prolific offenders, door-knock them and give
them the choice of signing up for drugs and alcohol rehabilitation or
being targeted by officers. Sergeant Andy Brown of Strathclyde police
said:</div><a name="09022517000377"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
then monitor how well people are doing. It is not a
get-out-of-jail-free card. It&#146;s about getting people at the
right time&#151;in that wee window when they&#146;re ready to
accept
help.&#148;</div><a name="09022517000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
of the applicants on the scheme
said:</div><a name="09022517000378"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Within
half an hour they had sorted me out with a methadone programme and I
got a worker who would come out to see me every
week.&#148;</div><a name="09022517000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
think members of the Committee may be somewhat perplexed that if
someone has a continuous criminal record and is a drug misuser, that
person has an entitlement to instant treatment. However, if someone has
the misfortune of being a drug user but does not have a serial criminal
record in Scotland, that person might wait up to 52 weeks for treatment
care.</div>
<a name="09022517000238"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09022517000512"></a><b class="B">John
Robertson</b> (Glasgow, North-West) (Lab): When my hon. Friend
next talks with her counterparts north of the border, could they look
at the case she has mentioned and see if we can roll it out as another
trial in England? It sounds excellent, and in a city like Glasgow we
need all the help we can get.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022517000513"></a>Ann

to speak to the Scottish Government at any point about this particular

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022517000514"></a>John
Mason:</b> I also read the article as I came down on the train
yesterday. I think it highlights this balance between compulsion and
encouragement; would the hon. Lady agree? It does seem from the words
she read out that there was very much an element of choice and an
element of people wanting to go into these things. That is very much
the emphasis. I am a wee bit disappointed by her tone; it seems
combative with the Scottish Government. Would it be possible, while not
throwing away the principles that the UK Government hold, that there
might be a willingness to tweak things a bit in order to get on with
the Scottish Government?</div>
<a name="09022517000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, does
the hon. Lady also agree that the point is made that people have been
taken off crime&#151;I am sure we would all agree that this is a good
thing&#151;but the danger of cutting benefits for such drug users is
that we end up pushing people back into
crime?</div>
<a name="09022517000242"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022517000515"></a>Ann
McKechin:</b> I do not know what the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
experience of police is in Glasgow, but when you get a knock at the
door saying you are going to be targeted or else you will enter the
rehabilitation programme, I would say that it is a strong stick, and
fairly stark. However, it is clearly one that has worked.</div>
<a name="09022517000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is only
fair that there is another avenue of opportunity&#151;not only when
people come out of prison or are facing another charge, but when they
present themselves at the Jobcentre Plus office and are clearly 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column164" />Column number: 164</div>having problems with drug misuse. Because it is a contract between
citizen and state&#151;no one forces anyone to apply for the benefit,
but those who do apply have to take responsibilities&#151;we try to
offer people individual support and a treatment plan that is
appropriate to their needs. Actually, scientific evidence shows that
this is the best possible way to get people off the drugs, out of a
life of crime and into a situation where they can properly support
their family and children. If a person&#146;s life is so chaotic that
they cannot even sign on to a rehabilitation programme, it prompts the
question whether they are the appropriate person to look after
children. Incidentally, our experience also shows that people who have
a chaotic lifestyle are not able to cope with the standard JSA regime,
and very often can come off the rails. That is why we want to offer
them a better deal.</div>

paragraph 2, you introduce schedule A1 to the Jobseekers Act 1995. In
paragraph 2, you establish a good principle in relation to those
benefit claimants who are looking for, or having to go through an
assessment&#151;that this should only be done where there is a
reasonable view that they are drug abusers. However, when we come to
the first part of that&#151;undertaking the initial
questions&#151;it is clear from page 48, paragraph 65 of the
regulation book you provided this morning that you are already making a
distinction between JSA

<a name="09022517000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister,
in paragraph 165, is already making a distinction between JSA

<div class="Column"><a name="Column165" />Column number: 165</div>of a personal adviser, and ESA claimants, for whom it is mandatory.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022517000521"></a>Ann
McKechin:</b> Obviously, the JSA is assessing whether people
are actually ready for work, while the ESA system is assessing how
their health condition affects their ability to work. The question was
raised as that is specifically a health-related benefit. We could have
a case where a recreational drug user presents him or herself for
JSA&#151;under the standard JSA conditions that would not necessarily
be a health barrier to their actively seeking work. Due to the
different criteria used, there has to be an element of discretion in
JSA. However, in ESA we have to assess the entire health condition
because people may have multiple issues&#151;they may have mental
health issues or physical disabilities as well as the drug
use&#151;which is why we need to look at all of the health conditions
that affect them so that we can make an assessment under
ESA.</div><a name="09022517000254"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022517000522"></a>John

may be on. That is

&#163;1,570 per year for 17,400 people currently receiving adult
dependency increases. About half of the new claimants would also
receive income support or pension credit. The Government say that
carers who lose their adult dependency increases in 2020 would
potentially see a reduction in their income if they were not receiving
IS or pension credit. However, the Government say that they are
committed to ensuring that future support will be tailored to meet the
needs of individuals.</div>
<a name="09022517000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">I know that
the Minister may think that he is getting fed up of having to give
assurances. When I dealt with a statutory instrument a few weeks ago, I
learned that an assurance was given by the Minister during the last
welfare reform Bill that those on contributory ESA 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column167" />Column number: 167</div>schemes would not lose out. That ESA scheme was
introduced last October, no changes have been made, and those people
now have a reduced income. So I believe that it is a fair question to
ask: given that there will be a loss of income and that 17,400 people
are affected, the Minister should place it on the record, and hopefully
act on it and ensure that these people do not lose
out.</div>

<a name="09022517000273"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022517000529"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> Sit down, Minister. He did not want to do all
those assurances but now he seems keen to do another one.</div>
<a name="09022517000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not want
to support the amendment. I just have some questions for the Minister;
I am not asking for assurances. The justifications for getting rid of
the adult dependency increases for carer&#146;s allowance are not
primarily based around saving money, although they do. They are
primarily based around recognising the changes to assumptions about
family life that were in place when this element was introduced in
1948. Looking at the list of justifications, it is not about saving
money. Given that the Government estimate a net annual
saving from abolishing adult dependency increases for
carer&#146;s allowance, and taking account of compensating increases
in means-tested benefits&#151;&#163;3 million in 2010-11, rising to
&#163;17 million in 2014-15&#151;it would be interesting to know
whether they plan to use any of those savings for those who will, as
the hon. Member for Rochdale said, lose out.</div>
<a name="09022517000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government have acknowledged that some households will lose out. The
Department&#146;s view is that those on lower incomes will receive
additional support in their means-tested benefits, but it is not
entirely clear whether the Government expect that to be full
compensation, and it does not take account of those who are not on
means-tested benefits. It would be interesting to know whether the
Department believes that there is any way of compensating them in a
different way that would be simple and straightforward, or whether it
is just one of those things that to make the system simpler some people
must lose
out.</div><a name="09022517000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
second question concerns the effectiveness of the information that is
given to carers about the change. The Government argue that the
negative impact of abolishing the adult dependency increases for
carer&#146;s allowance can at least be mitigated by ensuring that
adequate information is available in the run-up to the change, and that
there is greater awareness of income support and pension credit to
ensure that those on lower incomes take advantage of those. It would
help if the Minister would tell the Committee what arrangements are in
place, or are planned, to ensure that carers who receive carer&#146;s
allowance are given the information and that it is made as easy as
possible for those who lose out to receive extra support from income
support or pension credit, acknowledging that the complexity of both
benefits and the fact that they are means-tested means that a
significant number of people who are entitled to them do not claim
them.</div><a name="09022517000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the Government put in place a good regime, at least those on lower
incomes will be compensated. How many people will lose out and will not
be compensated 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column168" />Column number: 168</div>because they are on lower incomes and will receive other means-tested
benefits, and what arrangements does the Department have in place, or
will it put in place to ensure that people are fully informed about the
change?</div><a name="09022517000278"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022517000530"></a>Mr.
McNulty:</b> I fully take on board the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
statement that those who will be directly affected by such changes
should have as much information and awareness as possible at the
earliest opportunity, and I shall ensure that that happens. If
information is already available, I will certainly pass it
on.</div><a name="09022517000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the hon. Member for Rochdale said, the change has a 10-year transition
period, and the average length of awards is about six years. Although
no new awards will be made from April 2010, we will not end existing
awards until April 2020. As has been alluded to, some 4 per
cent. of the total carer&#146;s allowance payments to some 17,400
people include an adult dependency increase. As the hon. Gentleman
said, about half of carers who receive the increase are no better off
because it reduces the income-related benefit payable to them in other
ways.</div>
<a name="09022517000280"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
lot to be said for the simplification, and the hon. Gentleman alluded
to that in terms of income support and pension credit. Using savings
from the change in that regard would pre-empt what we are trying to do
with the income taskforce, and all that we are doing for carers, but it
would be a useful element to consider. As the hon. Member for Forest of
Dean said, allowances for carers were introduced in 1948, and even the
densest Members of the House&#151;I am sure that there are none in
the Committee&#151;would agree that family patterns have moved on
ever so slightly since then. That is as may be, but the point about
taking something away from people without them knowing is a fair one.
None the less, simplification for all the individuals concerned and the
ability of the poorest to access other benefits outweigh the concerns
of a small number of people who potentially, depending on the length of
the award, could lose out. In that context&#151;along with the
clearer picture on the ADI for maternity
allowance&#151;simplification is a public policy goal to which
everyone should
agree.</div><a name="09022517000396"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.30

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022517000543"></a>Mr.
Clappison:</b> I beg to move amendment 16, in
clause 13, page 17, line 38, leave
out paragraph
(b).</div><a name="09022517000299"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022517000544"></a>The

amendment 55, in
clause 13, page 17, line 38, at

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022517000545"></a>Mr.
Clappison:</b> We now come to the subject of the social fund.
The clause allows the Secretary of State to make arrangements with
external providers to make social loans in place of the present
arrangements with the DWP. It is important for the Committee to bear in
mind the background to the clause, which lies in the
Government&#146;s consultation paper that was issued last November
and the subsequent Government response to the consultation that was
issued this month, which we understand to be the Government&#146;s
current position on the matter. We welcome the proposals and the
interest that the Government express in having advance payments as a
way of obviating the need for crisis loans to be made in certain
circumstances, which is worth exploring. Ministers will recall an
occasion last autumn when the Government were facilitating, by way of a
statutory instrument, the transition of lone parents from income
support to jobseeker&#146;s allowance, which left a gap in their
provision. To fill that gap, it was suggested that lone parents should
take out a crisis loan. We suggested at the time that this was not an
entirely satisfactory way of conducting things, and that it should not
be beyond the wit of Government to enable a claimant in such a
situation to receive an advance payment, rather than having to take out
a crisis loan as a result of changes that were being made by the
Government. That is worth
exploring.</div><a name="09022517000301"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
also note&#151;and this is a very interesting development&#151;that
the Government propose not to allow external providers to impose any
interest charges on those who receive loans from the social fund. That
was in the Government&#146;s original consultation paper in November,
but they said clearly in their response to that consultation that they
did not intend to charge interest on social fund loans, including any
loan scheme set up by an external provider under arrangements with the
Secretary of State, and that nor do they have the legal powers to do
so.</div><a name="09022517000302"></a><div class="hs_Para">Several
interesting questions arise from that, not least when, and why, the
Government formed that intention, but perhaps for the purposes of this
debate, it would be reasonable to draw a veil over that subject. They
have set out their position&#151;they do not intend that the external
providers should charge interest to people who are in need and receive
social loans&#151;and therefore we do not need to take the matter any
further.</div><a name="09022517000303"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
might assist the Committee if I indicate now that I will not move
amendment 17, which would require the Government to produce a report
dealing with a number of matters, including the interest charged on
loans, as we now know that interest will not be charged. Also, I will
not moving the amendment in light of the fact that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column170" />Column number: 170</div>the Government have indicated in the consultation paper that they will
take powers to allow external providers to make social loans, but that
they do not intend to use such powers yet. They will not use their
power to give external providers responsibility for providing loans.
They are setting out to undertake more consultation to develop the
plans further with relevant parties, which is perhaps another reason
why a report under amendment 17 would not be necessary.
There will be more consultation following that which took place in
November on these issues and on replacing crisis loans and the social
fund with a single
loan.</div><a name="09022517000304"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
brings me to amendment 16, which is still relevant as the Government
are proposing to take powers&#151;although they do not have any
intention of using them at present&#151;to enable external
organisations to make loans in place of the present arrangements in the
DWP. We know that if the powers were to be used, the external
organisations would be credit unions and similar organisations. We
acknowledged at the outset that they were worthy bodies and far better
than many of the alternatives available to people in
need.</div><a name="09022517000305"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is important, however, when we are considering the powers and the
possibility of credit unions and similar organisations disbursing the
loans, rather than the DWP, to remember that such organisations face
expenses, which they normally defray from interest charged. Also,
credit unions need to exceed their operating expenses. We would ask the
Minister for a little more clarity and detail on this, given that we
now know that the credit unions and other organisations will not be
able to charge interest. As the Government take their proposals through
further consultation, what are their ideas on how external
organisations will defray the expenses that they will inevitably face
through having to undertake the task of disbursing the loans on behalf
of the Government? Will the Minister say whether, at this
stage&#151;I know that this is all still subject to
consultation&#151;the Government have any ideas about how that will
be
funded?</div><a name="09022517000306"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
important aspect is the funding of the financial advice and additional
services that we apprehend from the consultation paper that the
Government still intend to provide. Financial advice is a good thing
for needy people who require social loans to provide the everyday items
that it is hard for them to pay for out of their benefits or other
income, and for people in crisis situations or facing a family or
household emergency. It is important for them to receive financial
advice and related services, but we would like to know how the
Government propose that they should be funded. They have made it clear
that the service is additional to what is already provided by the DWP,
so we need to know a little bit about
it.</div><a name="09022517000307"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
wonder whether part of the Government&#146;s thinking is that
expenses in respect of the external provider will be paid out of the
social fund budget, with the risk being that that would reduce the
amount available for lending to social fund borrowers&#151;who are,
as the Minister will accept, people in difficult
circumstances&#151;or for people borrowing through crisis loans. We
need to know whether these provisions will reduce the amount available
to such people or whether there will be some other way in which the
expenses will be met. We put that to the Minister because we want to
know the Government&#146;s thinking at this stage.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column171" />Column number: 171</div><a name="09022517000308"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
understand that, at the moment, the Government&#146;s position is
fluid in respect of these issues, which are important for many needy
people and worthy of exploration. We want to play our part in eliciting
from the Government details about exactly how they are approaching
them.</div><a name="09022517000309"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022517000546"></a>Paul
Rowen:</b> As the hon. Gentleman said earlier, in respect of
an aspect of amendment 55, we have already had an assurance from the
Government that interest will not be charged on loans. To save time
later on, I shall make some general remarks about clause 13 because it
raises important
issues.</div><a name="09022517000310"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is important to look at the time scale that the Government have used
after 10 years of inactivity with regard to the social fund. A
consultation was launched in December 2008, but people were given less
than three weeks to respond to it, which is one third of what the
Government&#146;s code of practice says should be the norm for any
such consultation. Before Christmas, an article in <i class="I">The Guardian
</i>suggested that ridiculous interest rates would be charged, but the
Government have thankfully squashed that idea. However, we now have a
situation in which the Government say that they are going to carry out
further
consultation.</div><a name="09022517000311"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
respectfully suggest to the Government that, given the complete mess
that the policy appears to be in, the most appropriate approach would
be to withdraw clause 13 completely, carry out a proper, meaningful
consultation, discuss the matter with claimants&#151;the people who
will actually be affected by such change&#151;and then come forward
in the future with proposals that will work. It is clear, given what
has happened, that the proposals will not
work.</div><a name="09022517000312"></a><div class="hs_Para">Who
will be the providers? We know that the private sector has made it
clear
that</div><a name="09022517000382"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in
the current economic
climate&#148;</div><a name="09022517000313"></a><div class="hs_Para">&#151;I
am quoting the KPMG
report&#151;</div><a name="09022517000383"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;they
would not wish to fund a model lending to a deep sup-prime
sector.&#148;</div><a name="09022517000314"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the Government were to say, &#147;We will go to non-governmental
organisations&#148;, that would have some merit in the long term, but
NGOs are saying that although they are pleased to contribute, they have
received extremely short notice and they would need longer to talk
about it. If the Government are serious about wanting other providers
to run the social fund, this matter needs to be set in context with a
set of supports&#151;whether financial advice or whether linked to
other issues&#151;before we make such a
change.</div><a name="09022517000397"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.45
pm</div><a name="09022517000315"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
could be merit in that proposal and in introducing external providers,
including NGOs and charities, and having them running the social fund,
but the proposal, as it stands, is half baked. With respect, it is a
classic example of what we heard about earlier: not putting into the
Bill provisions that could lead to complications. The Government have
not thought out what they are doing or how the proposal is going to
work, and the Bill does not include sufficient detail to make a
proposal work, should they want to introduce one. It would be far more
sensible if the Government withdrew the clause, went back to the
drawing board, and introduced a measure when they had a workable
proposal.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022517000547"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (Kitty
Ussher):</b> Good evening, Mr. Hood. As this is the
first time that I have risen to make a speech, may I say what a
pleasure it is to serve under your chairmanship, even though it is
rather late in the day to be doing so?
<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> It is never too late.</div>
<a name="09022517000317"></a><div class="hs_Para">Since we have
already, in effect, moved on to the clause stand part debate, it might
be helpful if I explain what the clause intends to achieve. I
absolutely disagree with the hon. Member for Rochdale, who says that we
should withdraw it&#151;I shall explain why. People who come to the
social fund are those whose finances are at their most precarious. They
come to us for help, and it would be irresponsible, when we have made
the policy decision to provide them with more support, not to take the
primary powers that will give us one avenue for doing so, because, as
well as requiring an emergency injection of finances immediately, each
person may be in a different situation from that of the person before
or after them. They may require a path out of debt, and that could
include, for example, information about low-cost insurance schemes that
their registered social landlord is able to provide; debt advice or
debt consolidation services; advocacy for dealing with the various
agencies, organisations or private companies that have contributed to
their situation; or flexible repayments. They may respond well to a
plan that migrates them from repaying a debt to a savings plan that
operates either at the same time that they are repaying their debt, or
after they have done so. Alternatively, they might be the type of
person for whom that would be entirely inappropriate. They could well
be the type of person who needs face-to-face support and advice, and a
number of issues might need to be considered in the round, including
more complicated things such as child
support.</div><a name="09022517000318"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
point is that we, as a delivery Department, may not be the people who,
for very good reasons, offer all those things as our core services.
However, under the Bill, we will be the people who can take a primary
power and provide those who have the most precarious finances with the
advice and support that they need from the organisations that are best
placed to help them. That is why the clause must remain in the
Bill.</div>
<a name="09022517000319"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022517000548"></a>Paul
Rowen:</b> I do not disagree with some of
the Minister&#146;s points, but I ask her to point out the
additional services that she says could be better provided, because
proposed new part 8ZA of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits
Act 1992 is all about arrangements for external provider social loans,
for the transfer of loans, for an annual report on the operation of
arrangements, for repayments of external provider social loans, for the
power to restrict to social loans, and the supply of information to all
lenders making external social loans. The new arrangements that the
Minister talks about are not provided for anywhere in the clause. There
is not even a provision to introduce regulations, which is the usual
catch-all that the DWP introduce. In view of the Minister&#146;s
limited consultation, would it not be best if the whole clause were
withdrawn, and if the Government went back to the drawing board and
came up with some arrangements&#151;perhaps in the Lords&#151;that
enabled the provisions that the Minister wants to be
introduced properly?</div>
<a name="09022517000320"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022517000549"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> The hon. Gentleman is quite wrong. Subsections (5)
and (6) of proposed new section 140ZA make it quite clear that we have
the regulation-making power to do precisely that and to specify through
contracts.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column173" />Column number: 173</div><a name="09022517000321"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps it
would be more profitable if I were to move on to the remarks made by
the hon. Member for Hertsmere. I welcome his broad support for what we
are trying to do and, indeed, I have seen Conservative party documents
stating that it supports credit unions. A letter was even sent to me
from an outside organisation explaining that it had been called in to
discuss the reform of the social fund with the hon. Member for
South-West Bedfordshire (Andrew Selous) and that it was greatly
encouraged that he was keen to explore ways of reworking the social
fund, perhaps involving partnerships with credit unions. I am delighted
that the Conservative party supports us&#151;that is extremely
welcome.</div><a name="09022517000322"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022517000550"></a>John
Mason:</b> Does the Minister agree, however, that some credit
unions are not keen to be involved in this kind of thing and that some
people in fact feel that credit unions in this country have suffered
compared with those in other countries, because they are associated too
closely with the public
sector?</div><a name="09022517000323"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022517000551"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> I accept that not every credit union wants to get
involved, but if the hon. Gentleman were to look at the consultation
responses that we published today, he would see that a large number do.
The important thing to make crystal clear is that the Bill does not
impose a requirement on credit unions, or any other type of
organisation, to provide such loans. We are simply taking the power so
that, hypothetically, we could invite expressions of interest and
publish draft contracts under which such arrangements could work. The
hon. Member for Hertsmere is correct to say that we do not intend to
use the power at the
moment.</div><a name="09022517000324"></a><div class="hs_Para">Reference
has been made to the need for future consultation, with which we agree.
I would like to clarify that there will be two further sets of
consultation. As the hon. Gentleman said, the first will simply give
more detail about the type of arrangements that may exist if we use the
power in the future, while the second will go into far more detail
about how we would like to use the social fund to advance our aims of
financial inclusion, and perhaps deal with some simplification
measures, too. Returning to the point made by the hon. Member for
Rochdale, we are today taking the necessary primary powers so that,
hopefully, we will not have to return to primary legislation. We will
consult on the other powers as soon as we
can.</div><a name="09022517000325"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that I can encourage hon. Members not to press amendments 16 and
55 to a Division. Amendment 16 would delete the paragraph enabling us
to pay the administrative costs of external providers with whom we
enter into a contract. In answer to the question from the hon. Member
for Hertsmere, we understand that, in addition to the provision of
loans, additional costs will be incurred as a result of such contracts,
and we intend to pay them. That is what proposed new section 140ZA(4)
sets out. It will not necessarily reduce the amount available elsewhere
because, of course, there will be costs for administering such loans
anyway. Furthermore, we hope that, as a result of our policy, more
people will be migrated off the social fund, which could also free up
resources. However, those decisions will be made in the round, across
Government, in order best to use taxpayers&#146; money to achieve our
public policy goals and in the overall public interest. I hope that
that answers hon. Members&#146;
questions.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022517000552"></a>Mr.
Clappison:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for her response.
She correctly set out our attitude. Our amendment was probing, as I
indicated. We want to ensure that, through legislation, social fund
borrowers get a better deal&#151;more financial advice, better
services and so on&#151;and that the same amount of money is
available for them. Those are important considerations.</div>
<a name="09022517000327"></a><div class="hs_Para">We do not
seek to put up obstacles, and we do not agree with the approach that
the hon. Member for Rochdale has put forward, or with his description
of this as half baked. If more consultation is needed, more
consultation is needed, and we hope that we can play our part in
that&#151;who knows, we might already have played it! We do not know
yet, but we might have done so constructively. Furthermore, we might
have a contribution to make in the future. However, I agree with the
Minister that it is not ridiculous for the Government to take powers
for something that they might want to do in the future.</div>
<a name="09022517000328"></a><div class="hs_Para">Whether the
Government use those powers will depend on the outcome of the
consultation and the various issues that I outlined in my opening
remarks. We might have more to say about this matter in the future but,
for the time being, we are taking a broadly constructive approach. We
want social fund borrowers to get a better deal. I am sure that all
Committee members share the view that more thinking is to come on this
matter. Perhaps some interesting ideas will come forward during our
consideration of amendment 66, which was tabled by the hon. Member for
Warwick and Leamington and which I look forward to discussing. However,
for our current purposes, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

amendment has been trailed, and I will seek to take our debate on the
social fund a little further. We know from our previous debates that
there is something of a consensus that the social fund needs reform,
and the amendment outlines one way in which to take reform further in
the
Bill.</div><a name="09022517000332"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
essence, there are two problems with budgeting loans, which is the part
of the social fund that my amendment would change. The first problem is
that this part of the welfare system is, in my view, entirely passive
in its relationship with our customers, and the second problem is that
it is clearly underfunded.</div>
<a name="09022517000333"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, to
illustrate the passive nature of the current provisions, at the moment
an applicant will approach us on the telephone or come into a Jobcentre
Plus office. Their entitlement to a budgeting loan will be considered
and, if approved, a payment will be handed out to the customer. That is
the end of the benefit system&#146;s involvement with that person.
There is no discussion with them about the causes of the financial
situation that brought them in search of a budgeting loan. We give them
no direction on where they might seek further advice to find out more
about how to handle their finances, and we offer no help with future
budgeting.</div><a name="09022517000334"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second problem is that the fund is underfunded. The Government have
increased the money available in the budgeting fund, which is welcome,
and at the moment we have around &#163;500 million circulating around
the fund&#151;it is paid out and then comes back through deductions
from benefit. However, demand in our communities for the type of
assistance that the budgeting loan gives is greater even than the
&#163;500 million to which the Government have been able to increase
the fund in recent
years.</div><a name="09022517000335"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the evidence session on 10 February, Martin Narey said:</div>
<a name="09022517000384"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
real urgency is to provide avenues of affordable credit for poor
people...If something could be done on the availability of the
social fund...it could make things dramatically easier for some of
our poorest families.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official
Report, Welfare Reform Public Bill Committee, </i>10 February 2009; c.
46, Q58.]</div><a name="09022517000336"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment is an attempt to address that challenge.</div>
<a name="09022517000337"></a><div class="hs_Para">I estimate
that demand for such financial assistance is about four or five times
greater than the budgeting loan fund is able to meet. That means that
benefit recipients and low-income families are looking to alternatives
to the budgeting loan for credit. Only about 1 per cent. of the
population have access to credit unions, which shows how small the
credit union movement is in our country. Although, thankfully, the
Government are doing a number of things to try to expand it, it is
never going to reach the capacity at which it can be a universal
alternative.</div><a name="09022517000338"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
no credit union is available, where are people going? They are perhaps
going to Provident Financial, in which case they are paying an annual
percentage rate of 189 per cent. on their loan, or they might be going
to a more recent innovation: a new sort of store that allows people to
rent an item and then own it after three years. That is another sort of
credit scheme offered by 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column176" />Column number: 176</div>companies, such as BrightHouse, but people would be
paying 200 per cent. interest on the loan. People might be going to
organisations such as Payday Loans, which is another fairly recent
company that has come to the United Kingdom from the United States, I
think. It is growing rapidly and charges 1,344 per cent. on the money
loaned. If people are not going to any of the legal options, they could
be visiting an illegal alternative working in their community: a loan
shark whose interest rate we can only guess at, although it is probably
in excess of 1,000 per cent. The repayments sometimes come with
menaces,
too.</div><a name="09022517000398"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">7
pm</div><a name="09022517000339"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me put things another way. If today has been a typical day, we, through
the DWP, have probably agreed 4,000 budgeting loans worth a total of
&#163;2 million to those who received them. We are asking them to pay
us back &#163;2 million, with no interest, through deductions from
their benefits. Again, if today has been typical, 16,000 people on low
incomes or benefits will have taken out another form of non-bank loan,
the total of which would have been about &#163;8 million. However,
unlike the budgeting loan, under which they would have to pay back
&#163;8 million, they will have to pay back &#163;22
million. That shows the significance of the shortfall and explains why
we need to look at ways in which to expand and recapitalise the
budgeting
loan.</div><a name="09022517000340"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022517000554"></a>John
Mason:</b> I agree with the hon. Gentleman that arrangements
with no interest are better than paying back huge, horrific amounts of
interest. However, does he agree that people on benefits would be
better off receiving grants rather than
loans?</div><a name="09022517000341"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022517000555"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:</b> As the hon. Gentleman knows, there is a grant
element in the social fund. Thankfully, the Government have been able
to expand the facilities that are available to fund the grant part of
the scheme. In our previous debate, we covered the grant elements of
the social fund, but I want to expand the budgeting loan part, which
sits alongside the grant-giving capability of the social fund. If we
are really to address the target that we are about to give ourselves in
statute to abolish child poverty over a given time, increasing the
supply of affordable credit will be a crucial step in achieving that
ultimate objective. When asked, most of the child poverty campaigning
organisations say that the key thing that needs to be done to achieve a
step change in the process towards abolishing child poverty is to
expand affordable credit in our communities. I know that the
Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, my hon. Friend the
Member for Burnley, recognises and understands that already. I welcome
the fact that, through the Bill, social fund reform is under way and
gathering
momentum.</div><a name="09022517000342"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the Under-Secretary said in the evidence session on 12 February, the
Bill is</div>
<a name="09022517000385"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;only the
beginning of the journey&#148;.<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official
Report, Welfare Reform Public Bill Committee, </i>12 February 2009; c.
74, Q120.]</div><a name="09022517000343"></a><div class="hs_Para">By
tabling the amendment, I am trying to put wind in her sails and to
increase the speed of the journey. I am not trying to put a detailed
scheme in place&#151;that would not be right&#151;but I have set
out a framework for a scheme that deals with the two big problems of
the existing scheme&#146;s passivity and lack of funding. I envisage
that, instead of how the system works at the moment, the
claimant&#151;when going to Jobcentre Plus in search 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column177" />Column number: 177</div>of help&#151;would be enrolled into a social fund
account. A relationship would then immediately be built with the
individual, and we would not just remain passive towards that person.
The account would give them access to budgeting loans exactly as they
currently exist&#151;I am not proposing that that be
changed&#151;but it would also give them access to free and impartial
financial advice, which it is important to have. Pursuing my suggested
route for bringing in additional capital from an external provider
would give the opportunity for applicants, if appropriate, to take out
an affordable
loan.</div><a name="09022517000344"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the additional capitalisation came from the Treasury, for example, we
would be simply expanding the budgeting loan resource as it is at the
moment. Realistically, however, we will not see another &#163;2
billion or so coming from the Treasury in the foreseeable future. The
additional funding that I am seeking might come from another external
provider&#151;the clearing banks, for example, might agree to grant
it to the Government as a long-term loan, which the Government might at
some point eventually repay, allowing the additional funds still to be
interest-free. However, we might not get a deal on such terms and the
external provider might want money back for giving us the loan, in
which case I would expect that the kind of loans that would be granted
in that way would carry a rate of interest, but one comparable to those
applied to credit union
loans.</div><a name="09022517000345"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is important to stress that the existing interest-free element of loans
remains in my amendment, but we would be giving people the opportunity,
if the business model worked, which would of course be conditional, to
gain access to affordable credit in addition to any budgeting loan
scheme. That would have the effect, if the business model worked, of
putting the loan sharks out of business and probably also putting many
of those other organisations that are charging exorbitant interest
rates out of business, which I would welcome. Of course the business
case has to be made, which is why my amendment sets out only a
framework into which a scheme could be dropped, rather than attempting
to design it in any detail. However, it is important that we take the
primary powers to enable us to pursue that route and seek the
appropriate working business
model.</div><a name="09022517000346"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am simply asking the Minister to go further on the journey of which she
spoke. Many vulnerable families desperately need our help. We could put
a framework in place and then pursue a business model. That it is what
many of the groups that have been speaking to us for many years are
urging us to do, and that would make a dramatic difference to the
prospects for many low-income
families.</div><a name="09022517000347"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022517000556"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> I am extremely grateful to my hon. Friend for his
amendment. He speaks with considerable policy experience and knowledge
in this area. In some ways, we could characterise the amendment as
ahead of its time, which makes my hon. Friend a visionary for putting
it forward. We agree with the spirit of what he is saying but, as I
shall explain, I am not sure that it is the appropriate vehicle for
addressing his policy
proposal.</div><a name="09022517000348"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
agree with my hon. Friend that we need to do more for people whose
finances are precarious, as I said earlier. His description of a system
that needs to move from being passive to being active is entirely
right. A crucial part is providing financial advice and a broader
variety of services, whether through external providers 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column178" />Column number: 178</div>or, where we can, ourselves. He talked of saving
gateway accounts&#151;I do not want to be pedantic by pointing out
that that Bill is not yet an Act and has certainly not been
implemented. That might be one small way of saying that he is ahead of
his time. Certainly, once that measure is enacted, there will be many
ways for the Government to promote saving gateway accounts to the type
of people who may be applying to us for crisis or budgeting
loans&#151;indeed, there will be a large overlap in those two
cohorts, I am sure&#151;by signposting and so
on.</div><a name="09022517000349"></a><div class="hs_Para">Part
of my hon. Friend&#146;s suggestion was to allow for outside capital
to come into the social fund. Free money is great; I would be
absolutely delighted if anyone externally wanted to capitalise a social
fund and give us a pot of cash that we could lend out without charging
interest and preferably never have to pay back. At this point I am not
convinced that there is a business model that will do that, but if he
can come to me with an organisation that will provide that money, I
will be delighted to receive it, and if he knows more than I do, I will
be happy to hear how that would
work.</div><a name="09022517000350"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is better for us to be able to enter into an agreement with an external
organisation as we already propose, because, to be frank, it will be a
financial institution and will have greater capital available, perhaps
to migrate people from having a debt to being able to save, which is
the spirit of what my hon. Friend is proposing. I agree that that is
one of the areas in which we are missing a trick at the moment. Our
ultimate goal is for people to be able to put enough money away,
difficult though that of course is on low incomes, or to have other
measures, such as insurance, to avoid the need for a debt in the first
place. However, if they do require a debt, we need to be able to
support and advise them through that
process.</div><a name="09022517000351"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am asking my hon. Friend to withdraw the amendment. However, as a
direct result of his tabling the amendment, I will take it upon myself
to ensure that the suggestion that he has made&#151;that people with
social fund debts or any other affordable credit debt should be
encouraged in any way possible by the Government to migrate that into a
savings account, current account or saving gateway account&#151;is
taken on board in the appropriate cross-Whitehall discussions that are
taking place on, for example, a people&#146;s bank. He can rest
assured that he has had an effect. I hope that that will be sufficient
for him to withdraw the amendment at this stage and enable us to
continue discussing this worthwhile policy in the months and years
ahead.</div><a name="09022517000352"></a>

She has been quite warm about what I have suggested and agrees with the

appreciate what she has said about some aspects of it. She may be right
that there could be other means of pursuing those ideas and yet
achieving exactly the same end that I suggested this amendment could. I
hope that other parts of it, which she has not picked up at this point,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022517000558"></a>Paul
Rowen:</b> I should like to ask the Minister a few questions
about the clause, because it provides the Secretary of State with the
power, where a social loan external provider exists, to enable existing
social fund arrangements not to apply. One of our concerns is that a
situation will be created in which, depending on whereabouts people are
in the country, there are different arrangements and different
provision. The worst situation might be one in which in one part of the
country a very generous arrangement was operated by an external
provider, but in another part of the country the arrangements were not
as generous. In taking on this power, which restricts the type of loan
that can be provided to just an external provider loan, what steps is
the Minister taking to ensure that there is a level playing field and
that regardless of where someone is in the country, the same support or
same type of loan will be available? It is not clear from what has
already been published or from clause 14 how the Department will ensure
that. We would have great concerns if we were to see an uneven playing
field and certain parts of the country being treated better than
others.</div><a name="09022517000399"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">7.15

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09022517000559"></a>Kitty
Ussher:</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for his questions,
which are valid. If we were to enter an arrangement with an external
provider, it would be because we thought that would help us to meet our
public policy aims more effectively. In a sense, the client in that
area might, by definition, have access to a more holistic service than
one in an area in which there was no such contract. However, that is
better than retaining the current situation, because it would bring an
improvement for some people, although we would like everyone to have
that improvement. Let me reassure him on the general point that if and
when we enter arrangements in certain geographical areas, those
arrangements will have broadly the same eligibility, and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column180" />Column number: 180</div>there will be no attempt to change eligibility for two identical
customers who live in different places. This is precisely the type of
issue that we will consult on further when we have more detail as to
how those contracts might work. The clause is important because it
would be unduly complex, and would not help the situation, to run two
parallel schemes in the same area, with one being provided centrally
and the other being provided by an external provider.</div>
