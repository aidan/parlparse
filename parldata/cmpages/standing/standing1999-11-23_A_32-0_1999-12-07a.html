<B>The Chairman:</B> Before I call the next amendment, I should like to advise the Committee that I have received a letter from the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable), who is the Liberal Democrat spokesperson on the Committee. In view of early-day motion 141, it is only proper that I should read it to the Committee. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Dear Sir
<P>
Financial Services and Markets Bill
<P>
I am writing to apologise to the Chairmen for non-attendance at Standing Committee meetings on the Financial Services and Markets Bill. Our Lib Dem Treasury team has been reassigned to other responsibilities which make attendance very difficult: I to be our Shadow Spokesman on Trade and Industry; Colin Breed on Agriculture, for example.
<P>
I had hoped to have replacements in place but in the latter stages of a long and complex Bill this is difficult.
<P>
I hope you will convey to the Committee that no disrespect to them is intended.
<P>
Yours sincerely

<P>
<B>Mr. Howard Flight </B>(Arundel and South Downs): Clause 269 sets out the procedures that must be in place before the FSA can give directions under clause 267 or make a revocation order under clause 268. For some reason, the usual warning notice and decision notice procedure have not been included in clause 269. Amendment No. 871 would include the protection provided by such a procedure. During the period in which representations may be made to the FSA, it should give access to the information and documents on which it has relied in deciding its proposed action. That is spelt out in relation to warning notices given under clause 338.
<P>
We tabled amendment No. 872 because there is no provision in clause 269 committing the relevant investment exchange or clearing house to refer any matter to the tribunal. We cannot divine any special reason why a reference to the tribunal should not be permitted in such cases. Our amendment would therefore require the FSA to inform the relevant recognised body that it may refer the matter to the tribunal.
<P>
I turn to amendments Nos. 273 and 274. Clause 269(8) allows the FSA to take action other than that which it originally proposed to take in the notice issued under the clause. That is permitted, provided the FSA has followed"
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Let us check the numbers of the amendments that we are discussing. We should be discussing amendments No. 872 and 873.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I am discussing amendments Nos. 871, 872, 873 and 874.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> That is right. However, the hon. Gentleman referred to amendment No. 273 earlier.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I apologise, Mr. O'Brien.
<P>
Amendment No. 873 would add a proviso that, before taking alternative action, the FSA must consider the suitability of such action in the light of representations made to it in accordance with subsection (3). When it takes the action it should notify the recognised body of the reasons for taking it.
<P>
Finally, amendment No. 874 would require the FSA, in subsections (7), (8) and (9), to inform the recognised body concerned that it may refer the relevant matter to the tribunal.
<P>
<B>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Stephen Timms):</B> I welcome you back to our deliberations, Mr. O'Brien.
<P>
This is an interesting group of amendments, and I sympathise with the intention behind some of them. However, I hope that I shall be able to persuade hon. Members that the amendments are inappropriate in the context of the procedures that the clause sets out and the decisions that we have taken.
<P>
Recognised bodies are different animals from ordinary authorised firms. They have their own regulatory functions and make rules. As we confirmed last week, they enjoy statutory immunity for their regulatory responsibilities. Their regulatory provisions and practices are subject to competition scrutiny. They are part of the system of regulation that the Bill establishes.
<P>
Therefore, it is appropriate in cases where the FSA proposes to give a direction under clause 267 or to make a revocation order under clause 268(2) that the procedures in clause 269 should be different from those that apply when the FSA imposes requirements or withdraws permissions for an authorised firm. It would be inappropriate, for example, for such a proposal to be referred to the tribunal. Recognition establishes a different relationship with the regulator from that which exists between the regulator and the authorised community. The arrangements in the Bill take account of that. The proper forum for a recognised body and its members to challenge such a decision after they have had an opportunity to make representations is in the courts, by way of judicial review. That is broadly consistent with the approach under the Financial Services act 1986, which continues to be appropriate under the new arrangements . I hope, therefore, that Opposition Members will not press amendments Nos. 872 and 874, which refer to the tribunal.
<P>
I have sympathy with the intention behind amendment No. 871, which would require the FSA to give access to the information and documents on which it had relied when it decided on its proposed action. The recognised body is clearly entitled to know on what basis the FSA proposes to act. In reality, however, the information and documents on which the FSA relies will almost always already be in the hands of the recognised body; indeed, it will frequently be the source of that information. In any case, a notice under subsection (1) must already state why the FSA intends to give the direction or to make its proposed order. If the recognised body needs further clarification or documents, the FSA will normally treat a request favourably. We do not need to make special provision in the Bill.
<P>
Amendment No. 873 proposes two requirements. First, the FSA must consider the suitability of alternative action in the light of representations to it. However, the clause already contains that qualification, and subsection (5) clearly states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"In deciding whether to"
<P>
(a) give a direction, or
<P>
(b) make a revocation order,
<P>
the Authority must have regard to any representations made in accordance with sub section (3)."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That requirement applies as much to an aternative direction or order"the formal sanctions that are available in respect of a recognised body"as it does to the original direction or order.
<P>
Secondly, the amendment proposes that the FSA should be required to give its reasons for taking alternative action. I agree that that would be good practice, particularly if the FSA decided to take substantially different action from that which was originally proposed. In most cases, however, its reasons for taking alternative action will be clear from the original proposals and reasons and from the representations to which it will have had to have regard. the Bill should not formally require it to give further reasons at the decision stage.
<P>
I hope that that clarification is helpful in the light of the concerns that the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs (Mr. Flight) raised. I hope that he will feel able to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I apologise for not also welcoming you back to the Chair, Mr. O'Brien.
<P>
It is obviously correct, with reference to  our amendments Nos. 872 and 874, that exchanges are not in a position analogous to that of trading firms.  I am slightly concerned that the Minister should say that the remedy is judicial review, given the problems standing in the way of that in many cases.  It is worth considering whether the tribunal could play a role.  However, we are happy to withdraw the amendments, which substantially reflect the points that have been made.
<P>
We see no objection  to amendment No. 871, which clarifies the relevant matter without getting in the way of anything else.  With respect to amendment No. 873, the advice on giving notice to the recognised body has been read into the record and we accept that the first part is broadly covered by the Minister's wording, so we shall not press the amendment.  However, we do want to put amendment No. 871 to the vote.

<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 875, in page 137, line 32, at end insert 'in the United Kingdom'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 876 in page 137, line 35, leave out 'investors' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'consumers within the meaning of section 12(5)'.
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr Flight:</B> We have moved into the competition chapter of the Bill, without having said anything further on clauses 270 and 271. Amendment No. 875 reflects the fact that the rules and practices of recognised investment changes and clearing houses are to be subject to competition scrutiny. Clause 272 is an interpretation provision for the purposes of those competition provisions.
<P>
 Clause 272(2) deals with the meaning of the phrase 'significant anti-competitive effect'"which is one that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'has, or is intended or likely to have, to any significant extent, the effect of preventing, restricting or distorting competition.'
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The amendment would limit the significant anti-competitive effect to that of distorting competition in the United Kingdom. It is basically a probing amendment to determine whether the Government intend to limit matters to the United Kingdom, given that the rules and practices under consideration may be those of an overseas entity.
<P>
Amendment No. 876 relates to clause 272(3), which deals with "permitted purposes". Broadly speaking, rules and practices may be allowed to have an anti-competitive effect where necessary for one of those permitted purposes. Protecting investors is one of them, but investor is not a defined term. The Bill intends to refer to particular categories of consumers.  The amendment would change protecting "investors" to protecting 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"consumers within the meaning of section 12(5)".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Such consumers are defined as any persons, including authorised persons, who
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"use, or are or may be contemplating using, any of the services provided by any person in the course of carrying on regulated activities"
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
or
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"have rights or interests derived from, or otherwise attributable to, the use of any such services by other persons".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In that context, consumers includes professional as well as non-professional participants.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> As the Hon. Gentleman said, the clause and the following clauses create a competition scrutiny regime for recognised bodies. They are similar in form to the competition scrutiny mechanism created for the FSA by part IX of the Bill. There is already a competition scrutiny mechanism for recognised bodies under section  119 of the Fiancial Services Act 1986. There are some similarities with that regime but there are also differences given the different functions of the FSA and the recognised bodies.
<P>
As with the FSA competition mechanism, the scheme will create special arrangements for the examination of the competition effects of rules, guidance and codes"collectively referred to as "regulatory provisions""made by recognised bodies. The arrangements will also apply to the practices of those bodies"how they carry out their regulatory functions"and to the trading practices of their members or, in other words, the business practices that members will be obliged to adopt as a result, for example, of a rule made by a recognised body.
<P>
As in part IX, the mechanism will involve the examination by the Director General of Fair Trading of the regulatory provisions and practices to establish whether they have a significant anti-competitive effect. If they do, there will be a further stage of examination to decide whether the rule is nevertheless justified as having an anti-competitive effect no greater than necessary for the achievement of one of several permitted purposes. If that effect is considered unjustifiable, action may be ordered to remedy the problem. At present, the Bill provides that the second stage of the process should be carried out by the Treasury. However, following Don Cruickshank's recommendations, we propose to put the procedures for recognised bodies on a comparable basis to that for the FSA. The Competition Commission will carry out that task, subject to a ministerial power to override its decision, which would be used only in exceptional circumstances. We shall table amendments to achieve that in due course.
<P>
There are several differences, as I said, between  this regime and the FSA competition scrutiny arrangements, of which two are particularly significant. First the recognised body regime provides for competition scrutiny at two stages. When a new body applies to the FSA for recognition, its proposed rule book will be scrutinised for any anti-competitive effects. Having achieved recognition, the body will be subject to continuing scrutiny to ensure that it does not, for example, make new anti-competitive rules.
<P>
The second difference between these clauses and part IX is that they provide that regulatory provisions and practices should be scrutinised not only for any significant anti-competitive effect, but to see whether they might result in an abuse of a dominant market position by a recognised body or its members.
<P>
I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for explaining that amendment No. 875 is a probing amendment. It seeks to make it clear that this part of the Bill is concerned only with significantly anti-competitive effects that take place in the UK. While I can understand that that may be aimed at ensuring that the protection that competition scrutiny provides should be available to UK consumers and businesses, it would not have that effect in practice. It would cut back unhelpfully on the available protection.
<P>
Let us suppose that a UK-recognised exchange made a rule that was anti-competitive but which had an impact only on foreign stockbrokers. If the Director General of Fair Trading could not scrutinise that rule, what would be the result? First it is likely that those firms would take their business away from the UK to another market. If they stayed, it is likely that they would pass on the cost of the disadvantage to their customers, who might well include UK consumers. Finally, allowing circumstances to arise in which foreign firms were discriminated against in that way might put the UK in breach of its international obligations. As we would all agree, none of those outcome would be desirable.
<P>
Amendment No. 876 questions, whether "investor" is the right word to use here. The hon. Gentleman is right that "investor" is not defined, although it is intended to include authorised persons. I am not quite sure that the term is precisely the same as the one used in clause 12(5), but I am happy to look again at how the provision is worded. We have said that we want to ensure the consistency of reference to consumers throughout the Bill and when we carry out that exercise we will consider whether that term would be better here than "investor". With that assurance, I hope that he hon. Gentleman will withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The essential point in amendment No. 876 was the inclusion of "professional" as well as "professional participants". We are therefore happy not to press it.
<P>
As for amendment No 875, the Minister will recall that when we discussed the parallel arrangements in relation to the FSA, we made the point that in accordance with clause 2(3), the Office of Fair Trading and the competition commissioner should rightly address the international aspects of the operation of the FSA in terms of supporting the competitive position of the UK. We are pleased to note that that is precisely what appears to be intended in relation to exchanges and the OFT must therefore be competent to assess the relative rules of UK exchanges versus their international competition to determine what might damage international competitiveness. if the Government perceive the international parameter as being covered in relation to exchanges, will they please go back and cover the international parameter in relation to the FSA too? I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Under clause 275, the Director General of Fair Trading must consider the rules and regulations proposed by an applicant seeking to become a recognised investment exchange or clearing house. The director must, as constituted at present, report to the Treasury on the competition issues. We understand that this will be amended to "report to the Competition Commissioner". Does the Office of Fair Trading report to both at the same time, which means that the Treasury will have notice, or is the intention that the Commission will pass things to the Treasury only if relevant?
<P>
Under subsection (3), if the directors general's conclusion is that one or more provisions would have a significant anti-competitive effect, he must give details of what the effect is, or is likely to be. Our amendment would add a further requirement that the director general report on whether the anti-competitive effect is greater than necessary for a permitted purpose. We consider it appropriate that if the director general is reporting on whether rules and regulations have a significant anti-competitive effect, he should also consider whether that effect is necessary for a permitted purpose. That is reflected in clause 272.
<P>
Amendment No. 878 would require the Treasury to provide for the relevant applicant a copy of the report made by the director general. This would be necessary anyway to allow an applicant to make representations to the Treasury of the competition commissioner pursuant to clause 279(a)(i).

<P>

<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The clause provides that when a body applies for recognition as a recognised exchange or clearing house, the Director General of Fair Trading must prepare a report for the Treasury on whether its proposed regulatory provisions"its rules and guidance"will have a significant anti-competitive effect. The report must also state whether the regulatory provisions are likely to result in an abuse of a dominant market. Amendment No. 877 is intended to make it clear that when the director general considers whether a regulatory provision would result in an abuse of a dominant market, he should also consider whether this abuse would be greater than is necessary for one of the permitted purposes listed in clause 272. I understand what the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs is driving at, but I think that the amendment is inappropriate.
<P>
While the director general will, of course, be able to take account of factors that are mentioned in the permitted purposes, such as the protection of investors, when deciding whether an abuse exists, it does not make sense to require him to directly balance the abuse against them.
<P>
The permitted purposes concept was devised to allow a balancing act to take place between anti-competitive effects of rules against the regulatory outcomes that they were intended to achieve. It is not appropriate simply to transfer this across to the provisions dealing with an abuse of a dominant market. It would enable the director general to reach the somewhat odd conclusion that an abuse existed but was nevertheless justified. A preferable analysis would be that if conduct that appears at first sight to be abusive was on further consideration, judged to be justified, that conduct would not have been an abuse. When preparing the Bill, we considered that approach, but concluded that it would not be right to introduce into law the idea of justifiable abuse, especially as the concept is not in the treaty of Rome, from which the notion of abuse was initially derived. We are confident that the present formula will allow the director general to examine all relevant factors when considering whether abuse exists. On that basis, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his amendment.
<P>
I can see the intention behind amendment No. 878, and I agree with it. Indeed, it is implicit in clause 279, which provides that the Treasury must have regard to representations made by recognised bodies on these reports, that they will be sent a copy. However, I will consider whether such a change would make this clearer and if, on reflection, we think that it would we shall table an amendment later. On that basis, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> We are happy not to press amendment No. 878. The Government must table amendments to reflect the introduction of the competition commissioner, and they can tighten up the clause with them.
<P>
In respect of amendment No. 877, the Opposition feel that it is immensely healthy for it to be publicly stated that an abuse exists but was justified by regulatory objectives. Not allowing such matters to be in the open is ducking the issue. What flow of material did the Government intend? Will the Treasury get everything at the same time, or will it have to await the competition commissioner? Will the Minister make it doubly clear whether the commissioner will have real power? The intent of the Bill is that if the commissioner sees fit he will be able to override the FSA and the exchange and change their rules if they are severely damaging competition. Presumably, the Treasury will be dragged in only when the competition commissioner cannot make up his mind or when the issue at stake is sufficiently major that such involvement is felt appropriate. The statements made a few weeks ago, which presumably apply to such a procedure, did not make it entirely clear whether the introduction of a competition commissioner is merely the addition of another person into the loop. We are unclear on whether responsibility for material matters will remain with the Treasury, or whether the commissioner will have statutory power.
<P>
The Opposition feel that the amendment is healthy and should be adopted.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell </B>(North-East Bedfordshire): I am grateful for the Minister's remarks on amendment No. 878. However, it is not absolutely implicit in clause 279 that a copy of the report should be given in the way that he described. It would usually be fair to do so, and I hope that the Minister will reconsider the matter sympathetically.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I shall certainly do so.
<P>
Picking up on the points made by the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs, it would be odd if the Government were to introduce the idea of justified abuse. Clearly, practices that could be regarded as anti-competitive might sometimes be appropriate, but I am cautious about the use of the term "abuse" to describe a good thing. Such terminology would get us into rather odd linguistic territory. We must ensure that the concept of abuse does not diverge from the meaning that it has in article 82 of the treaty. It is clear from the case law on such matters that the balancing act between anti-competitive effects and justification is wrapped up in deciding whether conduct is abusive rather than in a two-stage process. We want to ensure that that approach is mirrored in the Bill. 
<P>
I assure the hon. Gentleman that the Competition Commission will have a substantial and influential role. The Government will table amendments to bring the commission into the process in due course, and hon. Members may then debate these matters more fully. As part of those changes, we will give careful consideration to whether the director general should report to the Treasury and to the Competition Commission at the same time. We have not yet formed a view about that, but that approach seems to me to be the most sensible and it is likely to be reflected in our amendments.

<B>Mr. Timms:</B> As members of the Committee know, we intend to re-examine the extent to which the Bill as a whole should make it explicit that duties and tasks should be carried out in a reasonable way.

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The clause provides definitions that apply in this part of the Bill. It is a purely technical provision. The amendments provide that a body can only be an overseas-recognised exchange or clearing house, or can only apply for recognition on such, if both the head office and the registered office are outside the United Kingdom. If either the head office or the registered office is here, it should apply for recognition under the regime for domestic clearing houses and exchanges. The current drafting, which would allow an application if the registered office were in the UK, is inconsistent with the investment services regulations on regulated markets. Regulation 49 provides that a United Kingdom-regulated market is a market for which the UK is the home state.

<P>
Part XVIII is complicated unlike the rest of the Bill because it plugs gaps to bring the Society of Lloyd's and those operating in the market within the FSA's regulatory powers under the Bill. This special approach is needed to reflect the unique nature of the market.
<P>
The Bill gives the FSA some discretion over how it discharges its obligations for the regulation of Lloyd's.
<P>
Clause 285 provides that the society"a body corporate"is to be authorised to carry on certain regulated activities. The permission will be defined by the FSA, as if it had been granted under part IV. Primarily, the permission will cover making arrangements which enable members to carry out contracts of insurance. The permission does not include carrying out contracts of insurance, which is done by the society's members, not the society itself.
<P>
The activities of managing and members' agents, or underwriting agents, will be specified in an order made by the Treasury under clause 20(5) and so will be regulated activities for the purposes of the Bill. Underwriting agents will need to be authorised and have relevant permission under parts III and IV. Therefore, no special arrangements for such agents are needed here.
<P>
As authorised persons, the Society and underwriting agents will be subject to the full range of the FSA's powers under the Bill. On the other hand, members of Lloyd's"both the traditional names and newer corporate members"will benefit from an exemption from the need to be authorised in relation to their insurance business at Lloyd's. None the less they will be subject to regulatory arrangements as directed by the FSA under powers contained in this part and to the powers of the Council of Lloyds. The FSA will be able to issue directions in one of two ways: either under clause 286, which will apply directly to members, or under clause 288, which is aimed at the council and which allows it to direct the council to impose reuirements on members.
<P>
There is an extra dimension to regulation of Lloyd's which the FSA does not have in relation to authorised persons generally. Not only must it consider the need to exercise its powers in pursuit of its regulatory objectives and in accordance with the regulatory principles, but the FSA must also take into account the role of the Council of Lloyd's under the Lloyd's Acts and form a view about the extent to which it needs to intervene by regulating activities itself, or alternatively use its powers to make directions under this part of the Bill.
<P>
This is a fundamental element of the regime that is being created for Lloyd's. On the one hand, it recognises that Lloyd's is unique; on the other, it gives the FSA powers to supervise and regulate the society and the regulated activities carried on by its members and their agents. To an extent, the approach will be governed by provisions in the single market directives that relate to insurance, but a good deal of scope is left for the FSA to exercise its judgment.
<P>
This is a balanced approach. It will help to deliver continued protection to policyholders, but it will also help to deliver higher standards of regulation for the protection of capital providers to the market, in whatever form, and the integrity of the market as a whole. At the same time, it will enable the FSA to be sensitive to the special needs of Lloyd's and avoid the possibility of the Society and its members having to face unfair and unnecessary regulatory burdens.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
On amendment No. 887, clause 284 is intended to encapsulate some of those ideas and set a context for FSA regulation. As drafted, the Bill simply requires the FSA to keep itself informed of
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>" the affairs of Lloyd's and the activities carried on at Lloyd's".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
 That duty is expressed in very broad terms and could cover almost anything at Lloyd's. For example, it could require the FSA to keep itself informed about voting arrangements in elections to the council, charging policies of underwriting agents and, theoretically, the contents of the lunch menu at the Lloyd's restaurant.
<P>
The FSA might have a particular interest in some of those cases from time to time. For example, it will be interested in whether the people who are elected to serve on the council are fit and proper to perform that function. Indeed, the employee approval arrangements in part V could apply to appointments to the council. Normally, however, the FSA will not have a direct regulatory interest in the society's internal constitution.
<P>
The amendment clarifies matters about which the FSA must keep itself informed, and there are two strands to that. The first relates to the way in which the Council of Lloyd's regulates the market. The council's actions will influence the FSA's decision about the extent to which it can take a hands-off approach to regulation and leave day-to-day regulation to the council, subject to FSA oversight. The first strand is aimed at the practical arrangements that are in place. The second strand relates to the more specific supervision of the conduct of business in the market. That will include, in particular, supervision of the overall solvency of the society's underwriting members, collectively and individually. Such insurance supervision is required by the single market directives and the Insurance Companies Act 1982. Given the extension of the scope of regulated activities under the Bill to cover investment business relating to Lloyd's and the activities of underwriting agents, members and managing agents, the FSA will need to keep itself informed of those areas, at least in general terms. That is implicit in paragraph (a), but the amendment removes any doubt.
<P>
The second element of the amendment explains more clearly the powers that the FSA is to consider exercising in relation to the market. It may exercise its powers of direction under clauses 286 and 288 or consider exercising its powers in relation to the society, which will be an authorised person, by virtue of clause 285. I comment the amendment to members of the Committee.

<B>Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory </B>(Wells): I beg to move amendment No. 881, in page 145, line 6, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'but only in relation to Case C'.
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I listened carefully to the Minister's comments because they are also relevant to clause 285 and to several of our amendments. The Government are wise to draw back a little from giving the FSA too wide a supervisory remit, which could cover just about everything. It is probably better to focus that supervisory function slightly more. We noticed elsewhere in the Bill that if the Treasury gave the FSA wide responsibilities, the FSA could lay itself open to criticism if things went wrong. We commented on that particularly in regard to the FSA's powers and responsibilities to authorise and approve firms' employees at the middle management level, although the issue was not resolved entirely to our satisfaction. The Government would be making a mistake if they put the FSA in a position in which it could lay itself open to criticism for having taken on responsibilities that it could not easily discharge in practice.
<P>
Obviously, it is important that the FSA has a watching brief in the case of Lloyd's. I am still a little interested in exactly how many staff will be employed in that regard. On the one hand, the FSA's supervisory role could be very extensive and intensive if Lloyd's got into difficulties again. On the other hand, if Lloyd's prospers, supervision may be light. Such matters cannot, of course, be set out in the Bill. However, that raises important questions about what resources will be available, what fees will be levied and the qualifications that FSA staff will be expected to have in relation to such matters.
<P>
Amendment No. 881 relates to the status of the Society of Lloyd's as an authorised person and how and under what circumstance the authority gives that permission. That pertains to part IV, especially clause 40, which gives the authority powers to vary or cancel a part IV permission in cases which are lettered alphabetically as cases A to D. Several of those cases are not appropriate to Lloyd's, and we wish to narrow the provision so that only case C, relating to the protection of consumers or potential consumers, may be applied. That may be the underlying motive for the entire Bill, which primarily protects the public, especially investors and consumers.
<P>
The authority may vary or cancel a part IV permission given to Lloyd's in several other eventualities. Case A is not relevant, as Lloyd's is not subject to the normal qualifying conditions for authorisation. It is therefore rather difficult to envisage how case A would, in practice, be applied.
<P>
Cases B and D would be a nuclear option, involving cancelling an authorisation. Lloyd's is not a single organisation, but covers a vast number of firms trading collectively as Lloyd's. I question whether cases B and D are appropriate for a body of Lloyd's size and standing. Therefore, our amendment would narrow the provision to case C, which is certainly appropriate. That would clarify matters and would be in line with what the Minister is doing, focusing exactly what Lloyd's and the FSA's powers and obligations are under the clause. That is the spirit in which we wish our amendment to be accepted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I am grateful to the right hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) for generally welcoming our changes. I shall run through the four cases in clause 40 to which he referred, describe how they are relevant and suggest why we are not likely to be interested in case C alone.
<P>
Case A allows the FSA to vary or cancel permission when the authorised person concerned no longer meets the qualifying conditions. That may be an important ground when considering the potential exercise of that power. Like any other authorised person, the Society of Lloyd's will have to comply with the qualifying conditions under schedule 6: that is one reason for bringing it into the mainstream authorisation arrangements. Given the important central role played by the society through the council"its governing body"it is vital that it maintains adequate resources to perform those functions and has suitably competent management in charge of it.
<P>
Case B allows the FSA to vary or cancel permission when an authorised person contravenes a requirement under the Bill, or is likely to do so; when an authorised person knowingly or recklessly gives false information to the FSA; or where the person has not carried on any of the regulated activities for which it has permission for a period of 12 months or more.
<P>
We shall take a further look at the detail in the light of changes to part XII. We want consistency between the two, but there seems no reason in principle for treating Lloyd's differently from other authorised persons with part IV permission. Any change to clause 40 would feed through automatically to FSA powers in relation to the Society of Lloyd's. It is right to ensure that the FSA can exercise its own initiative powers in cases A or B.
<P>
Cancellation and, indeed, variation of permission is not the most obvious course of action for dealing with a regulatory breach. It would probably be an abuse of power if the FSA were to seek to withdraw permission from any authorised person simply because they had submitted a return a couple of days late. If there has been a material breach of those requirements, or in the case of consistent breaches, it is proper for the FSA to have appropriate powers including, in the last resort, the ability to cancel a permission. The Bill introduces important safeguards to ensure that these weapons are used properly.
<P>
Neither of the other grounds"in cases C and D"are particularly relevant to Lloyd's. Regarding case C, the Society of Lloyd's"the society incorporated under Lloyd's Act 1871"does not have many customers and those that it has are not generally customers of its regulated activities, but of the central services that it provides, such as office space and heating in its buildings in Lime street and Chatham. The society also provides services to its members, but it is far from certain that they could properly be regarded as its customers. I do not rule that out, but it is, as I say, far from certain.
<P>
The real concern is that Lloyd's policyholders should be protected, but their insurance contracts are not underwritten by the society, which is not an insurance undertaking: members carry on the insurance business in their own names. Giving members preferential protection at the expense of policy holders"which might be the effect of the amendment"would run contrary to existing regulatory arrangements, which we are seeking to enhance.
<P>
On case D, I accept some of the points made by the right hon. Member for Wells. It may not be relevant to the society, which is not licensed to accept deposits in the Banking Act sense or to carry out business regulated under the Consumer Credit Act 1974. It is unlikely that the society would ever seek to carry on such business, but it would be unhelpful to rule out the possibility of exercising the powers if they ever became relevant, which they conceivably might under certain future circumstances.
<P>
I am grateful to the right hon. Member for Wells for raising the issues and providing me with an opportunity to explain more fully how we envisage the operation of the powers. He also asked how many staff would be involved. The number of staff engaged primarily in regulating Lloyd's will be increased from the present five to around 20 or 30 people. The likely regulatory costs for Lloyd's will be in the region of £1.2 million a year, significantly higher than the current £200,000 for regulation under the Insurance Companies Act 1982. The increase partly reflects the fact that Lloyd's has not been charged the full regulatory costs in the past. Lloyd's agrees that the additional costs are appropriate. They will be levied on the society as a whole and on underwriting agents, who will be authorised persons. Where necessary, staff involved in other specialised functions, such as conducting investigations, will also be deployed.
<P>
I hope that I have explained why narrowing the grounds on which the FSA can exercise its powers solely to case C would produce the wrong result.
<P>
I accept that the grounds in clause 40 may not always be relevant to the society, but the provisions work in their current form in the Bill. If the grounds in any of the four cases do not apply, the FSA will not have grounds to exercise its intervention power under them. I hope that that is a satisfactory explanation.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
{**p42**}Mr. Andrew Tyrie (Chichester): In this part of the Bill on Lloyd's, we seem to be giving the FSA the power to obtain information and to intervene by exercising its considerable powers of direction under clauses 286 and 288. What will happen if Lloyd's is embroiled in another scandal? We have just been told that the FSA will have 20 to 30 staff and £4 million or £5 million per annum to keep an eye on things in Lloyd's from its position slightly at one remove.
<P>
The FSA is immune from the kinds of actions that have been brought by Lloyd's members against the institution itself, so there will not be any of those lawsuits. But morally and legally, once the Bill is on the statute book, the FSA will become fully responsible for what happens at Lloyd's. As the scandal develops, the calls will come not to Lloyd's or parts of Lloyd's to take action to deal with it, but to the FSA and to the Government. They will be told: "You are responsible for this. It is clear from the statute book that no one else is responsible. You have the powers to collect information and the powers to intervene if you see anything that you think is amiss. You are charging a substantial fee for supervision and regulation and what have you done about it?" The Government will be very much in the firing line.
<P>
I should be grateful if the Minister could explain why the Government think that that is the right position with respect to Lloyd's. I listened carefully to what the Minister said a moment ago. An alternative approach is to amend the Lloyd's Act, and I should be interested to know why the Government did not take that approach. Mr. Agnew, a former council member of Lloyd's, in his evidence to the Burns Committee proposed an amendment to the Lloyd's Act. The Association of Lloyd's Members, on the other hand, opposed that idea. Partly because the preparatory work for the Bill was done in such a rush, the Burns Committee concluded that as it had not had the opportunity to take further evidence on the issue, it was unable to make a recommendation.
<P>
Presumably, since then the Government have thought about this carefully. I should be grateful for the Minister's view and an explanation of the decision to leave quite a few loose ends where the Government may be responsible and yet"unlike in every other part of the financial services industry"unable to take action that might be considered appropriate by many members of Lloyd's.  There also seem to be an element of instability about the position in which we shall place Lloyd's and I suspect the Government will feel the need to return to that before to long.

<P>

<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The hon. Gentleman said that £4 million or £5 million would be available. The figure I gave was £1.2 million for the responsibities that we envisage here. As he rightly says under these arrangements the FSA will have the powers to step in. That is what we want to achieve and the FSA will devote resources as necessary to that task. I said a few minutes ago that the FSA would have some discretion over the way in which it discharges its obligations on the regulation of Lloyd's. External regulation of the Lloyd's community by the authority is achieved by different provisions in the Bill, but there will still be provisions for the FSA to decide how that should be done. We think that the Bill provides the right balance. The Society of Lloyd's  and its council will continue to have very substantial responsibilities, but if a problem occurs, the FSA will be able to step in. This seems the right way to safeguard against future problems.
<P>
The hon Gentleman rightly said that some people have called for the Bill to be used to amend the Lloyd's Act"the four Acts introduced since 1871. We considered this carefully, taking account of whether it was possible to use the Bill to bring about the amendments, either directly or by taking a power by order. The proposed changes to the private Acts governing Lloyd's cover the way in which the society is constituted as well as the way that it is regulated, but they would also affect the private relationships between the society and its members, agents and brokers. We concluded that doing that would expand significantly the range of matters covered in the Bill and would make it a longer Bill. We felt that it would not be appropriate to take a power in the Bill to change those relationships, or to do this by secondary legislation. As with many of the matters that we are considering in these debates, a balance has to be struck, and I suggest to the hon. Member for Chichester (Mr. Tyrie) that the balance we have achieved is about right. Lloyd's may, in future, wish to make its own proposals for change.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his answers. Perhaps I can put one of my questions slightly differently. Who does the Minister think will be blamed if and when there is another Lloyd's scandal, given that the clauses will eventually be on the statute book? That seems to be a critical question. If the Minister tells us that when the Bill is enacted the Government will take the blame if anything goes wrong, the instability of the clauses becomes a relevant cause of concern for all of us.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> Our aim with these changes is to try to ensure that there will be no further scandals like those of recent years. All members of the Committee wish to avoid repetition of those problems.
<P>
For the Government's part, the FSA will be accountable to Treasury Ministers for the way that it exercises the powers. We do not think it appropriate for the Government to regulate Lloyd's on a day-to-day basis any more than we think it appropriate to regulate other financial institutions. The Government have always had an oversight role for Lloyd's but it will in future be exercised by the FSA, which will be accountable to Ministers. I believe that we are making prudent arrangements to ensure that those problems do not recur, and that if they do the FSA will be able to step in and take appropriate action. I cannot speculate about every conceivable eventuality but I hope that hon. Member for Chichester agrees that these arrangements contain a good deal more in the way of safeguards than previous measures.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I thank the Minister for his comments. I am partly reassured; I had read the Bill as stating that Lloyd's would not be subject to the qualifying conditions that will apply to normal authorised persons. I assumed that because the clause states boldly:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Society is an authorised person."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Perhaps wrongly, I therefore assumed that the full part IV qualifying conditions as laid out in schedule 6 would not apply to Lloyd's. However, the Minister confirmed in his reply that Lloyd's would be subjected to full qualifying conditions. Part of my objection to case A, as set out in clause 40, therefore falls.
<P>
I think that I heard the Minister say that clause 40 was to be further amended on Report. I must put a marker down, and tell the Minister that the Opposition are becoming a little alarmed at the extent to which the Bill is to be rewritten after the points in question have been considered. I hope that the Government will table amendments in plenty of time, if they have not done so already.
<P>
I should like to make a more general point, picking up on the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester. The Bill obviously tries to prevent regulatory failure, including a recurrence of the problems in Lloyd's. We all hope that the terrible problems recently witnessed in Lloyd's will not happen again. They did almost irreversible damage to its reputation. Happily, it is recovering, but I think that it has a smaller share of its original market. In the real world, however, these problems will happen again. The Treasury thinks that it has abolished the trade cycle; I can tell the Chancellor that he has not done so. All such things happen again, and, as I think that my hon. Friend suggested, the danger is that next time it will not be Lloyd's"which is making the decisions and mistakes"that is blamed, but the regulator. It will be no defence for the FSA to say that it was interpreting its powers rather loosely and going in for light-touch regulation. People will refer to the Bill and say that it could have done a lot more.
<P>
The Minister said that the authority would have various powers, and that we cannot determine now at which end of the spectrum it will operate"whether it will deploy tight supervision or give Lloyd's a looser rein. That may be decided in the light of experience, but if its approach is found retrospectively to be incorrect, it will not be saved from justified criticism. That is why we believe that it is for the protection of the authority and of the Government to get the maximum precision and definition into the primary legislation. Time and time again, such precision is not to be found in the Bill, and the Government return to the mantra that it will all be done reasonably at the time. Doubtless that is the intention, but I am not sure that the legislation is good because of it.
<P>
Comments were made about the reserve power to effectively shut Lloyd's down. Frankly, use of the power would be an almost inconceivably disproportionate response to any problem, especially if the authority is properly discharging its watching brief and can therefore anticipate problems before they arise. The complete withdrawal of Lloyd's authorisation would be a sign of the failure not only of Lloyd's but of the authority. 
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I do not intend to press the amendment to a Division. The Minister's response was reasonably helpful. I am grateful to receive the likely regulatory cost which will be sueful to Lloyd's and all who trade there. We are anxious to keep the cost as low as possible. The  Minister explained that there had been some cross subsidy. I cannot argue with the desire to make the cost more explicit, but we will be concerned, both here and elsewhere, to maintain a downward pressure on all regulatory costs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Is Lloyd's happy with the arrangements, or are there outstanding issues? It appears to be remarkably quiet territory.

It is not expected that members of Lloyd's will need to be authorised and have permission to carry out contracts of insurance at Lloyd's. This means that members, or names, will have the benefit of an exemption from direct supervision by the FSA, for so long as they are members of the society in relation to any insurance business that they carry on there. Because names will not for the time being be authorised persons, we need to provide alternative mechanisms to allow the FSA to impose on them the requirements that it considers necessary. For example, the FSA will need to ensure that members comply with the solvency requirements as set out in the single market directives that relate to insurance. However, the FSA will not be limited to imposing requirements under those directives. It will be for the FSA to decide the extent to which it needs to impose its own requirements, or whether it is satisfied that the arrangements under Lloyd's byelaws are adequate for the purpose. Clauses 286 and 288 give the FSA the appropriate powers of direction that it may use to impose such requirements.
<P>
The power under clause 286 enables the FSA to make two kinds of direction. First, it may make a direction that applies the general prohibition to members of Lloyd's. If it were to do that, names would need to become authorised in order to continue to carry out contracts of insurance. Once they are authorised persons, with a part IV permission under the Bill, the other regulatory powers of the FSA would be available in relation to them. 
<P>
It is not proposed that such a direction should be made at this stage. However, the FSA will need over time to keep under review the need to exercise that power, whether in relation to specific members, categories of member or to all members of the society. The other kind of direction would be an "insurance market direction", that is, a direction applying to members of Lloyd's the core provisions of the Bill, as set out in clause 287. We will need in due course to ensure that the appropriate powers are specified in clause 287 and we may have to amend that clause in due course.
<P>
Clause 288 provides an alternative mechanism for the FSA to impose requirements. Under clause 286 the direction applies directly to members; clause 288 would enable the FSA to make a direction to the society or to the Council of Lloyd's requiring it to use its powers to impose relevant requirements on members of the society. A direction under clause 288 could also require the society or the Council of Lloyd's to impose requirements on managing agents and members' agents. The advantage of making a direction under this power, where the FSA thinks that is an appropriate approach, is that it would enable the FSA to specify requirements in fairly general terms and leave it to the council to make detailed arrangements for its implementation.
<P>
A direction under clause 288 will also have the advantage that it will be easier for the FSA to enforce the direction since it would need only to take enforcement action against the society as whole. It would be for the Council of Lloyd's to use its powers to enforce compliance by market participants.
<P>
In our debates on part IX, especially clause 125, as amended in Committee, we explained that that clause would be the model procedure for the authority to follow when making rules and equivalent provisions. Now that we have reached part XVIII we can take the opportunity to bring procedures forward in new clause 9, which will apply a broadly equivalent procedure to the exercise of either of the direction powers under this part, modelled on what we agreed in clause 125.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 891 and 896 are essentially drafting points, which remove the procedural requirements in the relevant clauses of the Bill. In addition, amendment No. 896 makes it clear that if a direction is given under clause 288 it must be given in writing.
<P>
Amendment No. 882 would require the FSA to have regard to any representation made to it in the light of consultation before making a direction under clause 286. As I have already said, new clause 9 would replace paragraph (d) of clause 286(4) and align the process for consultation to that under clause 125 on rules. The new clause will include an express reference to the need to have regard to responses. I hope that that is helpful.
<P>
The other effect of the amendment would be to prevent the FSA making a direction without consultation. There may be circumstances when consultation would not be appropriate. Under new clause 9, those circumstances are the same as in clause 125, namely that the delay resulting from complying with the consultation requirements would be prejudicial to consumers. That is much narrower than the exception in the Bill and I hope that Opposition Members will agree with that approach.
<P>
I hope that members of the Committee will agree that the changes proposed in the amendments and in new clause 9 are desirable, and that amendment No. 882 is not necessary.

<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> On a point of order, Mr. O'Brien. I welcome the Liberal Democrats to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> Yes, we are on new territory, Mr. O'Brien: there is a Liberal Democrat listening, if not contributing, to our proceedings, so we hope that there will be a change of gear and that scrutiny of the Bill will reinforce our criticism. I am slightly alarmed to hear that further amendments will be tabled to the clause that we are considering. I hope that that will be on Report, incidentally, and not in another place, which would be a further complication to the Bill. However, as I have said, we are satisfied.

<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
A direction under clause 288 is a direction to the society or the council, requiring the relevant body to exercise its powers to impose requirements on members of Lloyd's and, where relevant, managing or members' agents. The amendment would make two changes to the direction power. First, we think it unnecessarily restrictive that the Bill allows the FSA to exercise the relevant power only as an alternative to the power of direction under clause 286. There might be circumstances in which the FSA would want to impose requirements directly on names, but at the same time want the council to make a byelaw supplementing the requirements under a direction. For example, a direction under clause 286 might be made in respect of members taken all together, to maintain, for example, a margin of solvency as required under the EC insurance directives. A direction under clause 288 might specify the basis on which the members individually should provide their share of the solvency margin, and impose requirements on them and their agents to provide reports on their financial position. The amendment would allow the FSA additionally to impose requirements directly on the council.
<P>
The FSA will, after requirements have been imposed, need mechanisms to ensure that it receives reports confirming that they have been met.
<P>
The amendment substantially improves on the existing powers for making directions under the relevant power. It will ensure that the FSA will have the necessary powers to regulate the market effectively and efficiently.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 895, in page 146, line 10, leave out 'managing agents or members' agents' and insert 'underwriting agents'.

This is a technical improvement. The terms

<P>
which are used in clause 288 (2) are well recognised and understood in the Lloyd's community. They feature widely in Lloyd's byelaws, for example, but they are not defined in primary legislation, so we decided that on balance it would be preferable to substitute the words "underwriting agents", a term which is defined in section 2(1) of the Lloyd's Act 1982. It is a generic term encompassing both managing and members' agents.

<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take Government new clause 10"requirements imposed under section 289.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The Insurance (Lloyd's) Regulations 1996 (SI1996/3011) were introduced some years ago to create a regulatory regime under the Insurance Companies Act 1982 to ensure that the Secretary of State had powers to regulate former members of Lloyd's for so long as they had outstanding insurance liabilities. Those powers have since transferred to the Treasury and are exercised by the FSA under contract.
<P>
The regulations had to be introduced because following the substantial underwriting losses suffered by Lloyd's names in the period 1988 to 1992"a total of some £8 billion"and the subsequent reconstruction and renewal arrangements, very large numbers of names resigned their membership.
<P>
During that process, it became clear that policy holders could be placed at a serious disadvantage if the reinsurance arrangements that were put in place during reconstruction and renewal were to fail. One option would have been to prevent members resigning from the society, but many members were anxious to leave. The regulations provide a mechanism to allow members to resign, while ensuring that the necessary powers are available should the relevant members ever become liable again to meet claims from their policy holders. So far, the only requirements that have been imposed are that former members are required to keep the FSA informed of their current address, and to confirm their address from time to time.
<P>
Equitas, the company that was formed to reinsure names liabilities, has performed well and the risk of further regulatory action looks remote. However, the risk that was identified was of sufficient concern that we need to maintain suitable arrangements for the future"not only in case Equitas were to become weaker, but in case similar problems ever returned to Lloyd's in future. We hope, as I have said, that that will not be the case.
<P>
The Bill, provides for former members of Lloyd's to be authorised persons. We received some comments about that. There was a concern that authorisation placed too heavy a burden on former names. We also had concerns that by virtue of this authorisation, former names would not be committing an offence if they carried out other forms of regulated activity, such as giving advice on pensions and investment. We tabled amendment No. 897 to create a special regime to ensure that the FSA has appropriate"but tailored and lighter"powers to impose requirements on former names. We believe that that is a valuable improvement to the Bill.
<P>
New clause 10 introduces procedures for exercising this power. It is similar to the notice procedures that have been examined by the Committee many times as we have scrutinised the Bill. It varies slightly because we propose some improvements to the procedures: it should provide a model for the new arrangements and we intend to review other provisions to make them consistent with it. The arrangements in the current grouping are not complete and further provision may be necessary. The powers to impose requirements under the clause by virtue of amendment No. 897 will enable the FSA to impose specific requirements on particular former names. We will also need to provide for the FSA effectively to make rules in relation to former names, such as a requirement under existing arrangements to keep the FSA informed of contact addresses.
<P>
The change was viewed as sufficiently important to justify tabling the amendment and new clause at this stage, so that the Committee had the opportunity properly to examine them. I am sure that Opposition Members will agree and I hope that they approve of and support the change.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I should like to make a few further remarks relating to Lloyd's.
<P>
If the Minister looks at appendix 17 of volume II of the Burns report, he will  find a devastating critique of the Government's original proposals for the clauses before us. I am not enough of an expert on Lloyd's to know whether the Government's approach is the right one. However, the memorandum in appendix 17 not only reveals the devastating failure of self-regulation at Lloyd's, but states that under the Government's provisions
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"there may be a dangerous combination of responsibility without effective powers."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
To paraphrase the memorandum, that would leave the FSA unable to regulate the market.
<P>
The memorandum, which is from the Association of Lloyd's Members, goes on to say that it is tempting to adopt the simple solution of leaving the council to get on the with job and for the FSA to have a degree of oversight. That is pretty much what the Government have proposed in the Bill. The memorandum goes on to say that the
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"implications of this decision would, however, be very hard to justify...This would mean that at Lloyd's, alone in the FSA's domain, one would perpetuate the inappropriate practice of the regulated employing and controlling the regulators."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Why have the Government almost completely rejected that clear advice from the Association of Lloyd's Members and gone ahead with an intermediate form of regulation?
<P>
I shall not detain the Committee on the issue now.  I do not know what the right provisions for Lloyd's would be, nor do I have an answer to the hybridity problem of requiring a private Bill to sort out the Lloyd's Act 1982. However, I have heard no convincing arguments for suggesting that the provisions that we are putting in place are likely to endure. Nor has a convincing case be made in regard to how the Government and the FSA will react in the event of another awful collapse or scandal. The Minister suggested that the Government were making regulations so that there would be no scandals at all. The whole criminal law was put in place in the hope that there would be no crime, but we make laws in areas where we think that they will eventually be broken. Similarly, we make regulations in areas where we think that there might be breaches. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells said, there will be another scandal at Lloyd's one day, just as there will be another downturn in the business cycle.
<P>
I am not convinced that the issues that needed to be carefully thought through have been thought through. No convincing arguments have been made to deal with the concerns that several parties raised in evidence to the Burns Committee.  I am disappointed, of course, that that committee did not have time to come to a clear view about how the matter should be handled. Its members ended up saying, 'We don't know what the answer is, but we know that there is a problem'"that is clear from its evidence on page 28 of volume I of the report. I should be grateful if the Minister could take this opportunity to give us another explanation of the Government's decision to reject the ALM's advice and to stick with the provisions in the Bill.

<P>

<B>Mr. Timms:</B> As the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs said, this has been a relatively quiet part of the Bill and there is no great controversy about our proposals. The Association of Lloyd's Members agrees with them. It has concerns about constitutional matters, such as voting arrangements in council elections. However, our general approach is broadly accepted as the right one. I am certainly not aware of any major party in those discussions advancing an approach that is fundamentally different from ours. Abolishing Lloyd's and removing the role of the council altogether would not be sensible; I do not imagine that the hon. Gentleman thinks that it would be. Instead, we are giving an oversight role to the FSA. That is appropriate; indeed, it is quite hard to engage in a discussion in the absence of alternative proposals from anyone. The arrangements can certainly give us a high degree of confidence about the future.
<P>
The provisions confer the FSA with adequate powers to regulate the council, the society and individual members. We have just agreed amendments that will enhance those powers. As we have done throughout, we have listened carefully to what everyone has to say about the proposals. We have been through a lengthy consultation process, and, especially in this matter, have come up with an arrangement that commands general acceptance.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> A different financial services landscape opens up in this clause. Will the Minister explain what industrial and provident societies are? The clause lists a number of Acts, many of which were passed before I became a Member of Parliament so, luckily, I may be forgiven for not knowing them in detail. I realise that many of them were probably designed to regulate forms of society which have, perhaps, been overtaken by events and merged or changed their names or activities. As we are transferring societies' functions to the Treasury or the authority, I would be grateful if the Minster would say a little about what they are and the sort of assets they own"in other words, their size and importance. Will he say more about what will be transferred to the Treasury or the authority? The explanatory notes give one or two examples, but are not especially illuminating, so it would be helpful if the Minster said a little about the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> May I also crave your indulgence, Mr. O'Brien? Our debate is, in a sense, on part XIX, which tidies up of a lot of old law on building societies and other mutuals. There is also a lot of old law on banks, including the frequent requirement that banks get a private Act of Parliament when merging businesses. Will amendments be tabled to tidy that up in relation to the Bill?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> Like other clauses in part XIX, clause 295 confers powers on the Treasury to amend legislation relating to mutual societies. It deals with provisions applying to societies incorporated under the Industrial and Provident Societies Act 1965 and the Credit Unions Act 1979. They are largely cooperatives of various kinds, including credit unions and some others that carry out insurance business.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The functions relating to registration under the 1965 Act, as supplemented by the other Acts, referred to in paragraphs (b) to (e), are currently exercised by the chief registrar and the Central Office of the Registry of Friendly Societies, in the case of societies in England, Wales and the Channel Islands"known as the central area"and the assistant registrar for Scotland for societies located there. After the relevant functions have come into force, those functions will be exercised by the FSA. The FSA already exercises a number of the functions of the registrars under the Credit Unions Act 1979 on a contractual basis.
<P>
The current separate registration areas for the so-called central area and for Scotland will not continue as the relevant functions will all be vested in a single corporate body. As a result, societies will no longer need to notify the registrar when a society located in one registration area proposes to carry on business in the other. Societies will still be subject to general local legislation, for example in relation to property, which will apply depending on the location of their registered or main office. Again that simply maintains the present position.
<P>
To the extent that the chief registrar is currently able to make the regulations supplementing the requirements and arrangements under the enactments relating to industrial and provident societies, those powers will be transferred to the Treasury. The Treasury will therefore have the function of defining the requirements imposed on these societies and the FSA will be responsible for ensuring that societies comply with them. Again, that follows the same approach as that adopted for building societies and friendly societies in the earlier clauses.
<P>
The hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs asked me a question which I do not think arises from this clause or the earlier ones. If I am mistaken he will doubtless raise the matter again. Returning to the questions raised by the right hon. member for Wells about the nature of the sector we are dealing with here, there are approximately 11,000 industrial and provident societies. Their assets amount to £47 million, plus £123 million for credit unions. To the extent that  we have started to discuss the earlier clauses that we have already agreed, there are approximately 3,500 friendly societies and 70 building societies. The hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs is right that we have received representations on his point and we are considering whether the Bill would be an appropriate vehicle. If it is and we think it appropriate to make those changes we will bring forward amendments in due course but no decision has been made about that yet.

<P>
Part XX deals with the appointment of auditors and actuaries. Our amendment is a modest regulatory proposal which would ensure that small independent financial advisers were not subjected to unnecessary regulation. The background is the companies Act 1985 which limits the audit requirements for small companies. I recall that small companies are required only to file a profit and loss account, not a full set of accounts. That was greatly welcomed at the time, and it continues to apply.
<P>
The clause appears to provide that the FSA can require authorised persons to undergo a full audit. That conflicts with the Government's stated wish to try to relieve unnecessary burdens on businesses. Every now and then the Prime Minister has a deregulatory spasm. He had one only the other day when he said that he realised that in some respects business were labouring under unnecessary regulatory costs. He sent a message to Lord Haskins asking him to step up his efforts on better regulation. It is a good example of the Government saying one thing but doing another. Even as the Prime Minister utters those words, the draftsmen are busy in the opposite direction, imposing extra regulation from which businesses cannot escape. Our amendment would bring the Government's actions into line with their rhetoric and ensure that the provisions of the Companies Act 1985 appeared in the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The amendment is interesting. I share the right hon. Gentleman's concern about the regulatory burden on small and medium companies. However, I hope to persuade him that there are already sufficient safeguards in the Bill for him to be able to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
This part of the Bill, and clause 297 in particular, relates to the appointment, duties and responsibilities of auditors and actuaries, who already play a key but varied role in confirming the reliability of the financial reports and other regulatory information supplied by the different classes of financial institution, both large and small, which are brought together by the Bill.
<P>
The amendment would extend the current exemption for small and medium companies from the reporting requirements under the Companies Act to the FSA's financial reporting rules under the bill, as the right hon. Gentleman said.
<P>
The exemption is not available, even under the Companies Act provision cited in the amendment, if the company is a bank, insurance company or authorised person under the Financial Services Act 1986. 
<P>
There is good reason for that. Small authorised firms can still be responsible for large amounts of clients' money, and their true financial exposure may not be fully reflected in conventional measures of balance sheet or turnover. Even if the Companies Act exemption applied to financial services firms, I do not think that it would be necessary or appropriate to make an amendment under these legislative proposals. The FSA's rules will have been made for a regulatory purpose"principally the protection of consumers"rather than to enhance the accountability of companies to their shareholders. If the Bill contained specific provisions for the financial reporting requirements of every class of authorised person, including single market requirements, it would be much longer, less flexible and would need frequent amendment. We have therefore left such matters to be dealt with by FSA rules, which are to be made in accordance with its general duties.
<P>
The FSA will have to think about what degree of protection is appropriate for customers of smaller firms. It will have to have regard in making its rules to the principle of proportionality and to ensuring that burdens on small firms are not excessive in relation to benefits. We have also promised to strengthen the competition aspects of the FSA's general duties, so that it must have regard to the need to minimise the anti-competitive effect of its rules on, for example, small firms. Those duties will be backed up by the improved consultation and cost-benefit analysis provisions and by the enhanced competition scrutiny that we have announced in response to Don Cruickshank's recommendations, which have been referred to a couple of times this morning.
<P>
Those safeguards will fully equip the FSA to tailor its financial reporting requirements appropriately to particular classes and sizes of authorised firms, whether they are limited companies, partnerships or sole traders. I made the key point at the outset of my remarks, which relates to the scope of the existing Companies Act 1995 exemption. I hope that the right hon Member for Wells will ask leave to withdraw the amendment in the light of that explanation.

<P>

<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I listened  carefully to the Minister, especially after he got over the political ding dong about the substantial regulations that built up over 18 years. It is the task of Governments of all complexions to try to tackle such regulations. That must be especially true now, as another 2,700 regulations have been produced during the past two and a half years.
<P>
One of the big worries about the Bill and the structure that it sets up applies to all regulatory systems, including the Financial Services Act 1986. That worry is that systems will be set up not merely to protect consumers"an acceptable objective"but to protect the regulators' backs, so that they do not seem to be to blame when something goes wrong. That is why I listened with particular interest to the Minister's remarks about the FSA's duty to consider proportionality and competitiveness. Will he clarify those important points? I have forgotten whether the FSA will have any statutory obligation to have regard to proportionality in considering its regulations. Will the Minister remind me whether any cost-benefit analysis has to be carried out in relation to the proposed regulations, as opposed to the burdens they place on the businesses that are being regulated? It is the Opposition's continuing complaint that competition is not set as an objective in the Bill, and that it should be. While I was glad to be told by the Minister that the Government are taking steps to strengthen the importance of competition, I should like him to remind us what will happen in the context of the clause and what effect it is likely to have.
<P>
In almost every field where one can venture into business"I admit to being a lawyer and not a business man, although I have a minuscule farming enterprise and some other business interests"one notes the enormous burden of regulation. Questionnaires and booklets drop through the letter box. If businesses are VATable, enormous bodies of regulations fall on to their tables. No one can afford the time to read them and business men have to take out membership of industry-wide bodies for guidance on the regulations.

<P>
Could the Minster briefly rehearse the substance of the points on proportionality and competitiveness to which he referred in his reply to my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells? Will he confirm that the FSA will bear in mind that its job is not to cover its own back, but merely to provide enough regulation genuinely to help consumers and no more?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> My question to the Minster is similar to that of my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for North-East Bedfordshire. I want to be told exactly where the duties on the FSA are to be found. I was initially encouraged by the Minister's reply, as he referred to the desirability of respecting the competitive position of mall businesses; he also referred to the proportionality principle. However, earlier in our proceedings, we tabled an amendment to require proportionality in the FSA's approach and it was not accepted. I am therefore intrigued to know where the safeguards are to be found.
<P>
The Minister used the future tense when he said that the FSA 'would' do this and 'will' approach the matter in a certain way. That is perhaps better than nothing, but there is no substitute for it being in black and white in the Bill. Perhaps the Minister will enlighten us further about where the assurances are to be found in writing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> We all agree with the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire's points about the extent of the burdens on small businesses. As we were reminded a few minutes ago, the noble Lord Haskins is working vigorously on these issues, which form an important task for the Government.
<P>
The principle of proportionality is in black and white in clause 2(3)(c). It is an important element in the list of matters to which the authority must have regard in setting about its work. I referred earlier to the FSA's requirement to consult and to carry out cost-benefit analysis. There will be cost-benefit analysis of the rules in this part of the Bill because the procedures set out in clause 125 will apply to rules made here as well as to those made under part IX.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Economic Secretary gave a detailed account of the proposals that we will introduce in response to Don Cruickshank's interim report to which we devoted clause 129 and chapter 3 of part IX as a whole. We shall return to the matter when amendments are tabled.
<P>
I hope that I have reassured the Opposition Members about our intention and about the extent to which we have provided for our intention to be fulfilled in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> As always, the Minister is helpful in parts, but he has not completely taken the trick. I accept his good intentions; we have commented many times that doubtless the Minister and those presently running the FSA are reasonable people, but they will come under pressures, including political pressures. There is no substitute for including in the Bill, at every possible opportunity, restraints on discretionary powers and the costs that can be levied on the private sector. It will be all too easy for the regulator to regard the costs not as his own but as a private sector responsibility because they will not show up on his expenditure budget. The Lord Haskins of the day will, if he is doing his job properly complain, but he will be told that the costs are necessary for reasons of public policy. If Lord Haskins really was worried, why did he not say something when the Bill was drafted? Did his Committee study the Bill? Once laws are on the statute book, it is a Herculean struggle to push back the tide of over-regulation.
<P>
Although the Minister's intentions are partly reassuring, we are missing an opportunity to include a reference to part XX to the need to protect the smaller end of the financial services market from the regulatory tendency. For that reason, I ask my hon. Friends to vote for the amendment. I accept that the 1985 Act may not be applicable, but the amendment is a marker that our concerns have not been fully met.

Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
</FONT><B>Mr. Flight:</B> I want to raise an important issue that relates to auditors and actuaries. Actuaries are extensively involved in providing financial advice, both to pension schemes and their members. Many pension consultants are actuaries. Nothing in the Bill appears to state that actuaries should be authorised persons in their role as providers of financial advice.
<P>
Bearing in mind the pension problems of the past decade, it is important to recognise that a territory has remained hidden. The reorganisation of many company schemes often results in members suffering when final salary schemes are converted to company money purchase schemes at transfer values"which were advised by actuaries at the time"that are, in retrospect, unfair and inappropriate. One reason why the Government have not pursued actuaries in this territory is that they are not authorised persons and financial legislation does not enable them to be challenged for giving wrong advice. Do the Government intend to require actuaries providing financial advice to be authorised persons? If not, why not?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> As the hon. Gentleman said, this part of the Bill deals with the appointment, duties and responsibilities of auditors and actuaries. They already play a key and varied role in confirming the reliability of financial reports an other regulatory information supplied by the different classes of financial institutions brought together by the Bill. 
<P>
Many authorised persons will be limited companies, which are already required by the Companies Act to appoint auditors to report on their financial statements. However, their duties do not extend to financial reports required by the regulator. Other firms, such as partnerships and sole traders, are not obliged by those Acts to appoint an auditor at all. Insurance companies are required under the Insurance Companies Act 1982 to appoint an  actuary to report on their long-term"that is, their life insurance"business. That Act is to be substantially repealed; provision for actuaries' appointment and duties must be made by the Bill.
<P>
Clause 297 will give the FSA a rule-making power for the appointment of auditors and actuaries by authorised persons, and for the duties and responsibilities that must be conferred on them. it will also allow the FSA to make rules necessary for the proper operation of that power. For example, the FSA will be able to specify the professional qualifications, experience and other qualities that auditors and actuaries must possess to be eligible for appointment, to specify what tasks they must conduct, and to give them the powers that they need. It will also be able to make rules regarding the relationship between the authorised person and the auditor or actuary. It will be able to provide that an appointment is made within a given period and, if it is not, to step in and make the appointment. It may also make rules in respect of the terms of service and remuneration of the auditor or actuary. 
<P>
The Financial Services Act 1986 already makes such provision for auditors, but not for actuaries. As insurance companies are to be regulated, we have decided to extend the regime to cover actuaries. The hon. member for Arundel and South Downs asked whether actuaries would need to be authorised to give financial advice.

<B>Mr. Flight:</B>I asked with specific regard to pension fund advice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for that clarification. They will need to be authorised unless they benefit from a relevant exemption. As my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary said, we shall introduce provisions dealing with the treatment of the professions. It will be appropriate to address the issue then.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> If I may be absolutely clear, accountants may provide investment advice; likewise, actuaries may manage money for people. Specifically, within the gamut of the financial services industry falls a large industry, predominantly of actuaries who give pension advice. They routinely advise companies and members of pension fund schemes on matters such as changing schemes and new schemes, especially when pensions schemes are reorganised. The industry providing financial and pension fund instruction advice is big and it is growing. I am unclear whether that activity, rather than activities such as auditors' giving investment advice, will be covered. It would be extraordinary if it were not, for the reasons I have given.
<P>

<P>
In the past, how such things were handled resulted in many problems and losses, although, no doubt, there were benefits as well. However, it is not clear whether the Minister's reply covers pension fund advice, as opposed to professionals giving investment advice or investment management advice, in relation to whom the Government are introducing measures.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The hon. Gentleman's concerns are valid and it will be appropriate to consider them when we introduce provisions dealing with the treatment of the professions. As he said, the matter is interesting, important and wide. However, it will be appropriate to consider it later.

<P>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendment No. 783.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> We now move to the matter of public records and disclosure. The clause requires the authority to maintain a record of people and things, including people who are authorised under the Bill. However, something is missing, as the Bill set up a categories of authorised and approved persons, the latter being those who are deemed fit and proper to perform controlled functions for an authorised person. Therefore, the sub-category of approved persons is important, especially for those in the outside world doing business with a firm via an approved person working for an authorised person, although that may not be obvious. Therefore, having a record of approved persons via the authority is an important safeguard for the public, and our amendment would repair that apparent omission.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> Clause 304 requires the FSA to maintain a public record of certain categories of person. The most important record is that of authorised persons, as it will enable consumers to check that they are dealing with authorised firms. However, the record includes several other people and bodies, such as recognised investment exchanges subject to oversight under the Bill.
<P>
Amendment No. 783 cross-refers definitions for certain terms relating to collective investment schemes with those in part XVI. I hope that the Committee has no problem with that.
<P>
I listened to what the right hon. Member for Wells said about amendment No. 898. However, it is not necessary. Clause 304 does not limit the information that may be included in the public record, but simply sets out the minimum that must be made available publicly. The FSA wants to set up a record containing  relevant information about approved persons. However, there are some concerns about the practicalities of setting up a public record of approved persons, at least early on. The other persons referred to in subsection (1) will, for the most part, already be established and included on the current register. It is reasonable to expect the public record to be in good shape when the provision comes into force. It is not so reasonable to assume that the public record of approved persons, which will be different from currently available records, can be up and running so quickly. If the FSA can overcome those difficulties and establish a public record of that information, the further question of keeping it up to date will arise because the information will need constant revision. Changes to entries for other persons mentioned in subsection (1) will not change on such a regular basis, so those same concerns will not arise.
<P>
I am not too sure that the need for the public register is, in any case, so great with respect to approved persons. We expect consumers to take reasonable care to ensure that the firm with which they are dealing is an authorised person, or within one of the other categories specified in subsection (1). However, I would not normally expect them to check regularly that the employees of such firms have been approved under part V.
<P>
It is the FSA's intention to make available publicly the sort of information mentioned by the right hon. Member for Wells. If it overcomes the practical difficulties, I am sure that it will do so in the way suggested. However, I caution the Committee about placing on the FSA an obligation that it may be unable to fulfil.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I thank the Minister for telling us that it is intended that the FSA should provide such information, but once again the provision is all too woolly. If the FSA wishes to establish a category of approved persons, the least we can expect is that the authority should know who they are and be prepared to list them. The FSA will be taking on an obligation"the Bill insists that there should be this category of approved persons"but the Minister seems to be admitting that it may not know exactly who they are as they will be changing all the time. That is not good enough. It amounts to saying that the FSA is taking on a job that it cannot adequately discharge. Earlier provisions relating to approved persons are explicit and onerous. If someone trades or behaves in a certain way without being an approved person, they will be in contravention of the Act. It should be a minimal requirement that the FSA publish a full list for interested members of the public.
<P>
The Minister says that, in practice, not many people will wish to avail themselves of that information because they will be dealing mainly with authorised firms, but that is not always the case. They will be dealing, in practice, with an individual who will visit them, offer certain products or perhaps offer advice, and there could be a barrier between the customer and the authorised body. If a member of the public or a consumer has a suspicion about the status of a particular person, it should be possible to contact the authority and establish the facts. I am not reassured by the Minister and, unless he is prepared to beef up the requirements on the FSA, I am inclined to press the amendment to the vote.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The right hon. Gentleman has slightly misrepresented what I said. He would acknowledge difficulties at the outset, because much information has to be gathered which is not held by the FSA or any of its predecessors. The point is not that the FSA will not know who is approved, but, as the Committee will realise, that it will be impossible to put a central public register in place early on. I recognise the desirability of making information public as early as is practical, and I am sure that the FSA will. However, I should caution the Committee against including in the Bill arrangements that it might not be possible to introduce in practice, at least not in the early days.

<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> Amendment No. 84 is a probing amendment, We want to make sure that the record will be made available to authorised persons as well as the public. I appreciate that authorised persons will constitute the public in some respects, but including the words in the amendment would put the matter beyond doubt. Authorised persons will be corporate bodies, but companies, partnerships and the rest are not usually thought of as members of the public. Will the Minister confirm his intention in the clause?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I can give the assurance that the right hon. Gentleman seeks in respect of amendment No. 884. It would be difficult for the FSA to make the record available to the public in a way that excluded authorised and approved persons. In any case, one could argue that such persons were part of the public. I hope, therefore, that the right hon. Gentleman will not feel the need to press amendment No. 884 to a vote.
