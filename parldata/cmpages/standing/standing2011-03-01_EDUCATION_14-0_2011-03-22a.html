person is charged with an offence under section 136B, it is
a defence for the person to prove any of the matters mentioned in
subsection (2).(2) The matters
are—(a) that, at the
time of the alleged offence, the person was not away, and neither
suspected nor had reason to suspect, that the publications included the
matter in question;(b) that,
at the time of the alleged offence, the person was not aware, and
neither suspected nor had reason to suspect, the allegation in question
had been made;(c) that the
person who is the subject of the allegation had given written consent
to the inclusion of the matter in question in the
publication.(3) Written
consent is not a defence if it is proved that any person interfered
unreasonably with the peace or comfort of the person giving the
consent, with intent to obtain
it.”.’.<p class="tabbed">

                        <p class="tabbed">As
I was saying, anonymity is crucial for all staff working in schools.
Someone does not have to be a teacher to have their career, their
family life and, indeed, their whole life destroyed by false
allegations. Why should greater protection be given to teachers when
other staff are even more vulnerable to accusations—for example,
staff who are doing personal care, such as toileting children and young
people; staff who are working one-to-one; and staff who are working
outside the classroom? Of course, the teaching unions and professionals
working in schools agree with us. Schools are places where teams of
people work together, and they should all be afforded the same
protection.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000030">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">This is not
just an issue for schools; it is an issue for sixth-form colleges and
colleges of further education. The settings may be different, but the
issues remain the same. As was said earlier, we have many young people
of statutory school age studying in colleges of further education.
There are also young people of ages at which they can misread the
actions of staff and feel slighted when they are rebuffed—a
situation in which allegations of improper behaviour are liable to
occur. I truly believe that the amendments will strengthen the Bill and
I cannot see why the Government would not agree. I therefore hope that
they will be bold and accept the amendments, which would protect all
staff in all institutions.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000031">&#160;</a>

these amendments because, like my colleagues, I am keen to understand
the purpose of these clause overall and why they have been drafted as
they have. Clearly, one of the issues we have been looking at in more
detail is why teachers are mentioned and not other members of staff.
However, I would also like the Minister to say a bit more about the
justification for proposals that appear to be quite wide in terms of
their long-term implications.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000032">&#160;</a>

I understand entirely the issues that hon. Members from all parties are
concerned about in terms of staff members having an allegation made
against them spuriously and in a way that has significant implications
for the person concerned. However, I would like to understand how the

as you were not here earlier, I should say that I asked at the time
whether there would be a clause stand part debate. I was told that that
would depend, so I am obviously concerned not to lose the opportunity
to raise matters that are of considerable concern. However, on that
basis, I am happy to leave the issue here. I want to understand the way
in which the clauses proposed by the Government will work. We need to

pleasure to take part in this debate, Mr Williams. I will speak
primarily about new clause 5, which has been grouped with clause 13.
New clause 5 would include further education lecturers in the
restrictions on reporting alleged offences by teachers. As we know,
clause 13 gives teachers accused of a criminal offence the right to
anonymity until they are charged with a crime. Such protection is in
line with the recommendation in the Government’s White Paper,
which makes it clear that once they are made public, even false
allegations can end a teacher’s career.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000036">&#160;</a>

would extend that protection to further education lecturers, who
should, as hon. Members have said in interventions, be entitled to the
same safeguards as teachers in schools. I do not believe that treating
education professionals differently in that regard makes any sense when
we consider that 63,000 young people aged 14 to 15 spend one day a week
or more studying or training in a college and the rest of the week in
school. Some thousands of young people of 14 and 15 attend colleges
full-time. Why should teachers and schools be given such protection
while those teaching the same students in a college are not?<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000037">&#160;</a>

13 was not taken lightly. The legislation balances carefully the need
to protect the rights and reputations of teachers against the
importance of protecting the freedom of the press
to report on matters of public interest. I am sure that the Committee
will agree that it is a sensitive matter.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000055">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I think that
there is a broad consensus in the room about the rationale for
providing protection for teachers against false allegations. Teachers
are lead professionals, being responsible for the discipline of pupils
in the classroom and the school. On occasion, that includes the need to
use reasonable force to prevent pupils from committing criminal
offences, injuring themselves or others, or damaging property, in order
to maintain good order and discipline. The increased vulnerability of
teachers requires increased protection.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000056">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
perception among a small minority of children is that they can make
false accusations without any thought to the consequences for the
teachers concerned. The reputational damage to teachers of being named
in the press before ever being charged with an offence can destroy
careers, even when they are later exonerated. Teachers are special in
that they have a clear leadership role in the classroom, and that is
where we want to get to grips with
behaviour.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000057">&#160;</a>

that is why we have gone this far and not as far as the hon. Lady and
her hon. Friends would like. She is right to raise the point, but
before I come to it I want to say why we need this protection for
teachers in particular, because the evidence suggests it is teachers
who are most affected, not other
groups.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000059">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Crucially,
the rationale is supported by a range of evidence. The ATL conducted a
survey in 2009, in which 50% of members questioned reported that they
or a colleague had had a false allegation made against them. The
general secretary of the ATL
said:<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000061">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“We

                        </p>
                        <p>In
response to the Children, Schools and Families Committee investigation
into allegations against school staff in 2009—I think my hon.
Friend the Member for Beverley and Holderness was a member of that
Committee—the NASUWT provided evidence showing that since 1991
the number of allegations had increased, and that the majority of
allegations made against teachers were false or
malicious.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000062">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
85 and new clause 5 seek to extend protection to lecturers in further
education institutions, and amendment 85 also extends that to teachers
in sixth-form colleges. Only a small number of sixth-form colleges are
16 to 19 maintained schools, as opposed to college corporations. Those
that are maintained schools would be covered, along with those that are
the sixth form of a school. All other sixth-form colleges are
sixth-form college corporations, which is a form of FE
institution—not a school—and therefore will not be
covered. As my hon. Friend the Member for South Holland and The
Deepings said in his timely intervention, we will consider any evidence
that teachers in sixth-form colleges are facing the same behavioural
challenges as in schools.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000063">&#160;</a>

the lack of evidence, and if it is forthcoming we are very happy to
look again at whether we can do something, either in another Bill or in
due course. It is very important that we have ample evidence, and at
the moment we do not have that in sufficient quantities to enable us to
take action, notwithstanding the important example raised by the hon.
Member for Bolton West involving security staff. We are very
sympathetic to individual cases cited, but there is not yet sufficient
evidence of systemic problems to merit interfering with the freedom of

not yet brought forward equivalent evidence in relation to non-teaching

this, as the Labour party found in government. That is why we did not
have such a clause in the Education and Skills Act 2008, the
Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Act 2009, or the
Education and Inspections Act 2006, all of which went through the House
and a Committee such as this. Without the evidence, both an important
press freedom and human rights legislation are curtailed. The evidence
is important because it makes the issue proportionate. If it is
difficult to cite more than one or two anecdotal cases, that does not
give a Minister or the Government confidence that they are proceeding
with the right degree of caution in respect of the wider law and the
important

                           </strong> In that case, I will turn now to
amendment 61, which would introduce an order-making power to
allow the future extension of the provision in clause 13. Although the
offer that the hon. Gentleman has made is tempting, on careful
consideration I have decided to resist it because of the importance of
the provision. It would be more appropriate for any such extension to
be 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 555<a class="bkMark" name="Column555">&#160;</a>
                           </div>made in primary legislation. Normally, the Opposition say that something
should be in primary and not secondary legislation; this time they have
moved the other way, and the Government are taking the view that it
should be in primary legislation. That power would be an important
curtailing of freedom and should therefore be introduced by primary
legislation, along with the appropriate level of scrutiny and advance
notice to the newspaper
industry.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000069">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
86 seeks to extend the provision to include allegations made by former
pupils. The extension would not be limited to those who had recently
left the school but would cover any former pupil, as long as the
teacher remained at the school. I recognise that there are examples in
which such an extension would appear reasonable, but to cover
allegations from such a potentially wide group of people would
significantly increase the extent to which we restricted reporting. It
is less relevant to the key issue that clause 13 is designed to
address: supporting teachers in the classroom with day-to-day
responsibility for the discipline of their current
pupils.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000070">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> There does not seem to be a great deal of logic
in the Minister’s point. Is he saying that there is no evidence
that allegations come from past pupils just as readily as from current
ones, including those who have been excluded? Is he saying that
teachers are unlikely to be suspended on the basis of such allegations,
or that such allegations are less likely to be published if they are
made by ex-pupils rather than current ones? I do not think that that is
so, and it is certainly not borne out by the evidence we have received
from stakeholders interested in the clause. Will the Minister develop
his argument a little
further?<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000071">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Again, it is about being proportionate on a
difficult issue that his Administration found too difficult to deal
with. We have given it a lot of consideration and are proceeding
extremely cautiously. I understand the point that excluded pupils are
the kind of children who might well want to make an accusation against
the teacher who caused their exclusion. However, given that we want to
confine the provision to as narrow a range of episodes as possible, and
that, in theory, it could be never-ending—a pupil remembers
something that happened x years ago—we felt that, because the
clause is designed to tackle discipline in the classroom, it was better
at the moment to confine the provision to existing
pupils.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000072">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am now going to argue against my own side. If I
understand the Minister correctly, the situation is that false
allegations are more likely to arise in response to an existing
situation, and that a pupil who left some years previously would be
less likely to make a false allegation—they might raise an issue
related to abuse that happened when they were a pupil. The
circumstances, therefore, are entirely
different.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000073">&#160;</a>

sector, and expanding on what my hon. Friend the Member for South
Holland and The Deepings said, the Department has commissioned a survey
to look at the day-to-day experiences of how allegations are handled in
schools and local authorities. That research on support staff and the
FE sector will begin at the end of March and finish by the end of
August. We are taking that step, and dealing with the measure, very

hon. Member for North West Durham made a point about child protection
and safeguarding. The fact that an allegation made against a teacher
will not be publicised should not affect how it is handled by the
school and the police, who will still take seriously any such
allegations and investigate them fully. Schools already have a
statutory safeguarding duty. They have a nominated child protection
lead, and all staff receive child protection training. While it is
important that we give teachers the right protection from false
allegations, there is absolutely no debate about the fact that genuine
victims of physical, sexual or emotional abuse must be able to disclose
the abuse they have suffered, and the perpetrators must be brought to
justice.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000076">&#160;</a>

anonymity and protection against reporting applies only up until the
point when the teacher is charged. The moment of being charged is, of
course, when the police can advertise for any other instances of that
case. There is an argument for keeping protection until the point of
conviction, and that would lead to the problems highlighted by my hon.

                           </strong> I acknowledge, as the Minister said, that this is
a difficult issue. As we have discussed before, I suspect that he finds
it more difficult in government than he did when he was in opposition.
I am sure that that is a reason why previous Ministers did not
legislate on this issue. He is legislating in a limited way, and in
a

			Column number: 557<a class="bkMark" name="Column557">&#160;</a>
                           </div>cautious way, as he put it. The issue raises fundamental questions about
freedom of speech, press freedom and so on. I accept that there is a
difficult balance to be drawn. It could be argued, by singling out a
particular group of professionals for this kind of protection, that we
are crossing a boundary into an area that impinges on freedom of speech
and of reporting. There may be some contributions that try to tease
that out in the clause stand part debate. I am fairly sure that, as the
Bill progresses in the months ahead and as the autumn leaves begin to
fall—the Committee stage will be over by then I hasten to
add—and as it reaches the other place and perhaps comes back to
us at some stage, the clause may, in all seriousness, attract the
attention of people more erudite and noble than ourselves, who may have
a particular interest in its implications. There may well be further
debate on the difficulty of the measure and its implications for
freedom of speech, freedom of expression, newspaper freedom and so
on.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000081">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
understand the Minister’s dilemma, as he made a pledge over many
years that he wants to fulfil, but, having looked at it in detail and
having examined all the advice, he perhaps understands why it was filed
in the too-difficult-for-now box for quite a while by the previous
Government. It was no more than that, because there are real issues to
tease out and to try and solve. I hope that he has got it right in the
proposals.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000082">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Nevertheless,
as I said at the outset, the Opposition are in favour of trying to give
teachers and professionals protection from false allegations and their
reporting. I welcome the work that the Minister is having done on the
way in which allegations are investigated, which is timely and
appropriate. Such things should be investigated much more quickly.
Teachers should not have their lives and careers put on hold and left
under a cloud—to mix too many metaphors—for a long time
while the allegations, which could often easily be disposed of, are
investigated. I offer the Minister the Opposition’s support for
that
work.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000083">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
am, however, a little concerned. I can perhaps understand why the
Minister is resisting, at this stage, our extending the measure further
in the Bill to offer protection to other members of staff in schools.
It is a little less clear, however, why he is reluctant to extend it to
teachers in other institutions, such as sixth-form colleges, which are
technically designated as part of the FE sector, but to all intents and
purposes they are similar institutions to sixth forms in schools and to
sixth-form colleges that are designated as maintained schools. That is
a bit trickier to understand. If he is prepared to acknowledge the
status of qualified FE teachers as equivalent to that of teachers in
maintained schools with qualified teacher status, do they not deserve
the same protection? Outside the Committee, it will be hard for people
representing those professionals and the professionals themselves to
understand why they are not being afforded the same protection afforded
to teachers more broadly, but I understand his
caution.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000084">&#160;</a>
                        </p>The
Minister rightly identified amendment 61 as an offer from the
Opposition. We do not normally go around saying, “Why
don’t you do this in regulations? Fill your boots, get on with
it and make whatever laws you want,” but on this occasion there
is a case, and the Minister made it himself. He is
sympathetic—the White

			Column number: 558<a class="bkMark" name="Column558">&#160;</a>
                        </div>Paper said this, too—to the extension of the protection to other
professionals, but he is just not sure that he has sufficient evidence
at this point to justify it. His reaction to that is to wait for
another suitable vehicle of primary legislation to come along. If the
evidence emerges that this protection should be afforded to the other
professionals and members of staff we are talking about, when will an
appropriate piece of legislation come along?

Government’s position. As we will discuss in the stand part
debate, we are talking about limiting the freedom of the press.
Therefore, to put in primary legislation the right for Government
Ministers to infringe a basic liberty and foundation of our democracy,
without first providing the evidence, would perhaps be the wrong thing
to do. I think Ministers are showing due respect by refusing to take
what on the face of it looks like an opportunity to fill their boots,
as the shadow Minister says.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000085">&#160;</a>

                           <em>]</em> I can occasionally read the mind
of the Chair of the Education Committee. The point I was making was
that we could have parliamentary protection around that. For example,
if further evidence were collected and examined by the Education
Committee and the Minister introduced proposals, they could be disposed
of legitimately by the affirmative resolution in regulations.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000086">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Introducing
this proposal is an attempt to give the Minister an opportunity to go
away and consider the evidence carefully and ensure that it is
evaluated. He can then return to the House with a statutory instrument,
which we could debate on the Floor of the House if we felt that
protection were needed because fundamental freedoms were involved. The
Government have the power to enable that to happen. It would then make
it possible for the Minister, on the basis of evidence, to extend the
provisions to others working in schools and colleges as appropriate. On
that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment. However, I
would like to hear if the Minister has anything further to say on
amendment 61, and whether he might consider as the Bill progresses
whether that sort of provision might be appropriate for inclusion in a
Government
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000087">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I do not wish to prolong the debate. I am not
persuaded by the issue. I think the matter needs to be included in
primary legislation and we need to have evidence. In addition, we are
going to continue to see how the clause works to enable us to evaluate
the impact of the measures, and use those conclusions to decide whether
it would be appropriate to extend the provision further. That is a
balanced approach, and therefore I do not see the necessity for the
inclusion of such a regulation-making power in the Bill. Those things
need to be taken cautiously and over time. On that basis, I ask the

                           </strong> Diolch yn fawr, Mr Williams. These are two
probing amendments that seek to find out more about the
Government’s thinking in relation to the reach of the new
restrictions, and to clarify what Ministers believe is workable in
terms of applying them. The National Union of Teachers has told us that
it is concerned that the definition of “publication” is
too broad at present and that it may not be clear enough to be properly
enforceable. It also says that, if properly examined, the term may not
survive the Bill’s progress. It is obviously concerned about the
issue, despite its support for the general
measure.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000115">&#160;</a>

                        <p>Can
the Minister give us examples of exactly what that means? Does it cover
a letter, e-mail or text message that a parent might distribute to
other parents? Would a discussion at the school gates or in the school
playground be captured, or is a parent not considered to be a
“section of the public”, as defined by the clause?
Exactly what is captured if conversations take place? We all know that
they take place at the school gates, particularly 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 560<a class="bkMark" name="Column560">&#160;</a>
                           </div>at our primary schools, where parents gather to collect their children.
Are they likely to be captured by the clause? Similarly, would any
publication of letters, e-mails or leaflets be captured? We have
discussed the fact that, these days, we have to talk about cyberspace
and social networking sites. Will discussions on sites such as Facebook
and Twitter between parents, pupils and others about allegations
against teachers be captured under the provisions?<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000117">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
provisions have been broadly welcomed by teachers. I think that the
concern being expressed is not to criticise the intention, but to
ensure that what is being proposed is workable. If it is not workable,
it will provide teachers with no protection against false allegations.
Will the Minister give us a bit more clarity about what exactly is
captured in this definition? This is a probing amendment and I hope
that he can enlighten us a bit
further.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000118">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The definition of “a publication” used
in this clause is the same as that used in a number of similar
provisions, for example, the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 1992,
which restricts the publication of information identifying victims of
certain sexual offences, notably rape, and the Criminal Justice
Act 2003, which allows for an order to be made restricting
the reporting of proceedings in the interests of justice. The drafting
is designed to make as clear as possible the breadth of types and forms
of communications that we intend the provisions to cover. We live in a
world in which technology is used daily by mainstream media as well as
by private citizens and pupils and parents. They can easily publish
allegations that they wish to make against teachers via the internet
without media involvement, so it is particularly important that the
provisions make clear that such forms of communication are covered.
Amendment 87 might well serve to make this less clear and lead to legal
uncertainty.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000119">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The Minister may be coming to this and I do not
want to take him too far ahead in his speech, but may I ask him about
enforceability? Imagine that one is sitting in a classroom and the
particularly witty and difficult child at the front causes the teacher
to lose it completely and hit the child. I imagine that, given the
nature of young people today, they would all be going on Facebook later
to talk about the fact that they watched their teacher clock mouthy
Kevin—to pick a name. From an enforceability point of view, it
is rather hard to imagine that shocked children in a
class watching one of their brethren, however
deserving—of remonstration, not of being hit—should find
themselves criminalised by putting it on
Facebook.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000120">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Let me clarify: private conversations are not
covered by this. If you look at things like letters and Facebook
entries, it will depend on the details, though in theory, they could be
covered.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000121">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
88 would, arguably, exclude from the provisions allegations made on a
website that was accessible only to specified members of the public who
were able to subscribe to it—for example, a trade union
website—or in a free local paper delivered only to a section of
the public. It is important that clause 13 covers such 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 561<a class="bkMark" name="Column561">&#160;</a>
                           </div>publications. Since the Committee may be concerned that, without
amendment 88, the provisions would criminalise private conversations,
as my hon. Friend has just raised, I can assure them that this is not
the effect of clause 13 as it appears in the Bill. Any publication
would need to be addressed to a section of the public, rather than
private individuals. I think that that covers all private
communications between individuals, whether by text, e-mail or private
conversations.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000122">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Many schools do not require young people to hand
their telephones in and I imagine that, during the interim between the
clocking of naughty Kevin and the arrival of another teacher to take
over, many pupils will already have gone on to Twitter and announced to
all and sundry that they have just watched Kevin being clocked by the
teacher. Quite a number of people could do that in the class—are
they all going to be guilty of a criminal offence under this provision
and, if so, will he talk us through the
implications?<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000123">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Private conversations are not covered by these
provisions. The legislation is intended to cover any publication
addressed to the public, or a section of the public, whether this is on
the internet, on a social networking site or otherwise. If only friends
can see the comment, I suspect that a court would not find that to be
covered. It is when it extends beyond what could be regarded as a
private conversation that the problem exists. It is newspapers in
particular that teachers are most worried about because they are
permanent records and have wider
circulation.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000124">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Actually, newspapers can issue a correction, but
it is often difficult to get a correction for something on the
internet. Returning to the Minister’s point about the definition
of a private conversation and what addressing a section of the public
is, he seems to suggest if something published on a social networking
site was visibly only to “friends”, which has a different
definition on Facebook than in common parlance, he is confident that
that would be unlikely to be captured by the
clause.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000125">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> It is unlikely to be caught by the clause. We are
proceeding with caution. We cannot have pupils using the internet to
post public false allegations about innocent teachers. That is what we
are trying to tackle. Therefore, the difference between the domain of
private conversation between individuals, conducted through
conversations at the school gate, text messages, e-mail or social
networking sites, and the domain of public posting is a subtle and
important one. It is the latter that we are trying to tackle, and
ultimately the courts will have to deal with it.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000126">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I do not
think it is right to say that we cannot criminalise any children. It is
right for such offences to be criminal matters. If children are using
the internet to post public false allegations against innocent
teachers, the clause does and should

                           </strong> The trouble is that the clause does not say what
the Minister has just said. If a false allegation were put out and
spread about, I suppose it would be libel; I am no expert in this area.
However, we are

			Column number: 562<a class="bkMark" name="Column562">&#160;</a>
                           </div>talking about someone who has witnessed something. In my example, the
teacher has just hit the pupil, and others are saying what they truly
saw, and they would all be criminalised. They have not made a false
allegation; they have made an entirely true one and put it on Twitter.
I do not know about the Minister, but I think I have 1,500 friends on
Twitter, and unlike the shadow Minister, every one of them is one of my
closest. Children have hundreds of friends on Facebook and Twitter. We
could do with clarity on whether they would be committing an offence if
they told the truth about what they had
seen.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000128">&#160;</a>

instance. Ultimately, whether a child or parent is prosecuted will be a
matter for the Crown Prosecution Service, which will want to take into
account whether prosecuting someone in those instances is in the public
interest. If an allegation is true and the police charge the teacher
with the offence, the restriction will automatically be lifted by the
provisions. I think I have covered all the issues raised by hon.

the clause, which is to protect innocent teachers from publications
printing allegations against them before a charge is brought. That is

                           </strong> Just to reiterate something that I said at the
beginning of this debate, the definition of publication used in the
clause is the same as the one used in several other similar provisions;
for example, the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 1992 and the Criminal
Justice Act 2003. There have been many years of interpretation of the
definition since those dates. If the hon. Gentleman needs further
details, he should look at the interpretations over those
years.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000135">&#160;</a>

will accept that the development of technological changes in
communications is very much a moving staircase. It is always worth
ensuring that we understand the implications of any provisions of this
kind in relation to publication, and I am sure that new case law will
develop around things such as Twitter and so on. It is right that we
should discuss the implications of social media for provisions such as
those in clause 13 which deal with the publication of allegations about
teachers to members of the

the Education Act 2002. That offence could apply to ISSPs based in the
UK or in other member states providing services to the UK. This engages
the European e-commerce directive, and we must take steps to ensure
that the clause is compliant with those obligations. Reporting
restrictions in clause 13 cover allegations made on the internet and
apply to those publishing them, which could include the individual
placing material on a website, the website owner and/or the internet

e-commerce directive and consequently this amendment relate only to
ISSPs, the definition of which will cover those providing services
normally provided for remuneration via the internet. This amendment
does not affect any potential liability under the original clause for
individuals publishing information by way of sites on the internet,
those publishing information via other forms of publication, such as
television or newspapers, or those services providers not within this
definition—for example, where the service is one that is not
normally provided for remuneration. An individual in England and Wales
using a service established abroad to publish information in breach of
the clause will still be committing an offence under clause 13. The
purpose of the amendment in implementing the directive is to ensure
that if an ISSP established in England and Wales commits an offence
under clause 13 in another EEA member state, but not in the UK, they
will still be liable for that offence. Equally, provision is made that
an ISSP established in an EEA member state outside the UK is not liable
for an offence under this provision but will be subject to its own
domestic law of that European country. This country of origin principle
is intended to apply so that, save in exceptional cases, a business
operating across the EEA has to comply with the law in the country in
which it is established and not with the law in each individual country
in which its website might happen to be available.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000143">&#160;</a>

French ISSP will not be liable for prosecution under clause 13. That is
deliberate. The purpose of the directive is to prevent an ISSP, which
may be a very small operation in a member state, having to swot up and
understand the different intricacies of the law in all 27 member states
plus the EEA member states, which would be a restriction on being able
to set up an internet business. The purpose

am content to say nothing further about the new schedule to the Bill.

                           </strong> The Government are committed to ensuring high
standards of discipline in the classroom and giving heads and teachers
the powers that they need to ensure discipline and promote good
behaviour. As part of that commitment, we have considered the problem
of pupils making false allegations against teachers.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000153">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As I have
said, a recent survey by the Association of Teachers and Lecturers
showed that 50% of school staff questioned reported that a pupil had
made false allegations against them or a colleague. In addition, NASUWT
data collected since 1991 demonstrated that the number of allegations
had increased and that most allegations made against teachers are false
or malicious.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000154">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Clause 13 is
intended to provide teachers in schools with protection from false
allegations by restricting the public reporting of allegations against
teachers of criminal conduct made by or on behalf of pupils at their
school. The restrictions will remain in place until the matter has been
investigated and the teacher has been charged with an offence,
minimising the destruction wrought by false allegations. The provisions
impose reporting restrictions on the media, preventing the publication
or broadcast of any information likely to identify the teacher
concerned. Publication covers any communication to the public or a
section of the public, and may therefore include social networking
sites.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000155">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">At
present, there is no provision in legislation preventing the media from
publishing information identifying teachers against whom allegations
have been made. Teachers who work intensively with children are
responsible for maintaining discipline in their classrooms and schools
and are inherently vulnerable to false allegations by pupils, and there
is a perception that children can make such allegations with impunity.
The reputational damage

			Column number: 566<a class="bkMark" name="Column566">&#160;</a>
                           </div>to teachers of being named in the press can destroy their careers, and
indeed lives, regardless of whether they are later found completely
innocent of any wrongdoing.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000156">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In addition
to introducing the clause, the Government are undertaking work to
emphasise the need to eradicate all unnecessary delays at every stage
when handling such allegations, and ACPO has signed up to it. We are
making it clear that suspending staff facing allegations should not be
the default option, and ensuring that schools provide effective
support, including a named contact, for anyone facing an
allegation.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000157">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The clause
will not affect children’s rights to make allegations against
their teachers to the appropriate authorities. Of course those who
abuse their position must face the full force of the law, but we want
to ensure that children are not deprived of good teaching by the
consequences of false allegations. We believe that the provisions will
protect teachers’ reputations while allegations are properly
investigated and shield them from the damage done by false accusations,
which undermine the profession as a whole. I welcome the fact
that the provisions have been broadly supported across the Committee as
well as by teacher unions.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000158">&#160;</a>

extended to cover other professionals and school
staff.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000159">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">A
couple of other issues with the clause need to be debated. My hon.
Friend the Member for Sheffield, Heeley will probably want to say
something about a point that the Minister made earlier. We must not
lose sight of the fact that abuse sometimes takes place. Occasionally,
true allegations are made against teachers and others who work in
schools. It is extremely important to ensure that we acknowledge that.
In no way does the inclusion of the clause in the Bill suggest that
there are never occasions when adults do not abuse their positions of
responsibility in relation to children. We know only too well through
experience that a general acceptance of that position, which I know is
not the position of anyone on the Committee, can lead to disastrous
consequences in terms of the wide-scale abuse of children. By
supporting the clause, we are in no way suggesting that that should be
the mindset in considering allegations against teachers. As the
Minister put it, it is simply a case of making sure that appropriate
investigation is done in a timely way out of the spotlight of
unfair publicity, which can ruin someone’s life and
career. That does raise the question of what is the suitable penalty
for breach.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000160">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I understand
that the Minister intends to introduce a penalty of potentially
£5,000 for the breach of the provision. Was any consideration
given to whether it is possible—it might not be—for there
to be a differential penalty depending on the breadth of the
publication? A £5,000 penalty for a small local publication is a
very different kettle of fish from a £5,000 penalty for News
International, for example. Some people have expressed concern that the
amount is too low. A national newspaper would pay sums far in excess of
the fine that it being talked about for breach of the provision for a

think that the Chair of the Select Committee might be about to say a
few words about the matter as well. I am grateful to him for drawing
the Newspaper Society’s submission to my attention. The views
submitted by the Newspaper Society are worthy of consideration at this
stage in discussing the clause stand part. It has made points about the
existing protection in law for people against whom false allegations
are made in relation to libel law and so on. The Newspaper Society is
concerned about how the measure will impact on local newspapers and
about whether a complaint could be made by or on the behalf of pupils
against teachers that could not be reported, even if the allegation
were investigated and upheld. In the absence of any prosecution, that
teacher might still be able to prevent the publication of the
allegations. Does the Minister have any comments on the points raised
by the Newspaper Society in its official written submission to the
Committee? On that point, I will sit down and allow others to make
their contributions on clause stand
part.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000162">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Before I come to the substantive point that I want
to make, to which my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff West has
already alluded, I shall ask the Minister again whether he has much
evidence of allegations being reported in the press at an early stage.
I am not sure whether he provided that information—he may well
have done so when I was not paying sufficient attention, which
sometimes happens. I understand the point he is making about the
surveys conducted by trade unions and others about the level of false
allegations, but I am not clear whether there is significant evidence
that allegations have been reported at an earlier stage. I have done a
brief search on that and found reporting of false allegations at a
subsequent point, but not at a very early stage, in local newspapers,
so although I understand that there are issues about discussions in the
locality, which in themselves can be damaging, I am not aware of
widespread reporting of allegations at an early stage. I may be wrong,
but I just wanted to ask the Minister about
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000163">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
welcome the tone of today’s discussion, because this is a
complex area. The Minister has already said, rightly, that it is
important that children who have been abused should be able to disclose
that. However, I have wider concerns that our general discussions in
this Committee have suggested an overall trust in professionals that
perhaps goes beyond what is reasonable. We must always be aware that
any professionals may abuse that trust. Indeed, people who want to
abuse children will target professions where they have ready access to
children and will become teachers and head
teachers.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000164">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">You
saw me earlier today in the Library, Mr Williams, where I was doing a
quick search—it was indeed a quick search—for a few
examples. It is not hard to find examples. I found a reported case of a
paedophile priest who was a teacher and an appointed principal of a
college who abused children over 40 years and was 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 568<a class="bkMark" name="Column568">&#160;</a>
                           </div>convicted of many sexual offences. A former head teacher of a school in
Suffolk was jailed after admitting abusing young boys over many years.
A former teacher from Northumberland was jailed for nine years for
abusing boys and girls whom he taught. I have several more examples.
Such cases do exist—teachers and head teachers do abuse
children.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000165">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
other point that we need to bear in mind when talking about the complex
area of allegations is that children find it enormously hard to
disclose abuse. When I was learning about this as a social worker, I
was trained that I could not rely on children to disclose abuse. So a
child who gets up the courage to say something and perhaps does not say
it very clearly or loudly does not need to be met by an adult who
assumes that it is a false allegation. I entirely accept that false
allegations are made, but good investigation should take place without
an attitude of disbelief. In my experience, good investigation is
prompt, examines the whole range of issues and, when done properly, can
very quickly uncover a false allegation, which has probably been made
in the kind of context that the Minister described, involving issues of
discipline and other matters in the classroom. Good investigation
should take place without undermining the child who has at last plucked
up the courage to tell someone that something is not
right.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000166">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
plea that I am making is, as much as anything, about providing the
balance that we must strike in these situations and putting it on the
record that we will not put in place any more hurdles than there
naturally already are for children disclosing abuse, because as has
been widely recognised, although false allegations wreck lives, abuse
of children without question wrecks lives and has far-reaching
consequences. We all need to be very aware of
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000167">&#160;</a>

that it is easier for a child who is not being abused to make a

                           </strong> I am not sure where my hon. Friend is leading me
with that. Children make malicious complaints for a number of reasons.
Children who have been abused need to be confident that an adult to
whom they disclose the abuse or, indeed, a friend to whom they disclose
it—that is sometimes the route through which disclosures
come—will take it seriously. That is my plea.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000169">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There is
nothing worse, as I know from experience, than hearing that children
tried to disclose, but the abuse continued; only subsequently were they
believed and someone put an end to the abuse. The abuse does not stop
there, because we know that it involves not just the physical
implications; the severe psychological consequences may continue. The
circumstances that we are talking about involve not just physical or
sexual abuse but abuse of
trust.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000170">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> That is my point, particularly given the
traumatic effects that genuine abuse would have on a child. They would
be much more reluctant to come forward than someone who had not
suffered any psychological trauma because no offence had occurred. A
child might have a grudge against a teacher and want to make such a
complaint maliciously.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000171">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Indeed. My point is that prompt and professional
investigation of any form of allegation can usually identify whether
there are other reasons why a child might be making a complaint, such
as the circumstances, and the details that they are giving. Again in my
experience, it was fairly unusual that a false complaint would reach
social services, but that did happen occasionally, and I was somewhat
reassured that the social workers in my team felt uneasy about it from
the start, and that it did not ring true for various reasons. Although
we accept that false allegations are made, a position of belief does
not prevent good investigation which gets to the bottom of it. I should
be grateful for the Minister’s comment so that we can try to get
a difficult balance as right as
possible.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000172">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">My
final point relates to the point at which knowledge about allegations
may become more public. The Minister said that that would be at the
point of charge. That comes back to a point that the Chair of the
Select Committee made earlier that the police may be investigating what
seems to be a genuine allegation against a teacher, and may want to
give other pupils and former pupils the opportunity to raise any
concerns. In my experience, that is done not by putting an advert in
the paper—that would not be the best way of doing
that—but by approaching pupils directly and asking them whether
they have any concerns or issues. That was done in a situation in which
I was involved some years ago when a child was asked whether the head
teacher had ever done anything that the child was unhappy about, and
the child said that he given him out at cricket when he was not LBW. A
genuine opening question to a child who has not been abused
will give rise to a simple, straightforward response, but it might give
the opportunity to say otherwise. How does the Minister see that
working in such a
situation?<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000173">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
want to protect against false allegations, and I have known teachers
who have faced malicious allegations. Equally, it is sometimes only
when allegations have been made by more than one child that the police
can be confident that there is a pattern, and that there is
sufficient evidence to proceed with a charge. That may need to take
place before an alleged perpetrator is charged, and I shall be grateful
if the Minister will respond to that
point.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000174">&#160;</a>

in certain institutions. In the East Riding of Yorkshire, there was a
school—which I will not name but which received much
publicity—at which one, then another, and possibly even a third
teacher was found to have had relationships with under-age pupils. It
is important that the local public should know what is going on. No
member of the Committee would want to discover that those who were
abusing their position of trust and abusing young people could continue
to do so because it was not possible to communicate suspicion to the

we moving towards the principle that, if a person was particularly
vulnerable to allegations being made against them because of the nature
of their employment, it should be presumed that legislative protections
would be put in place? Are we slowly unpicking the basis of our open
and free society? However much we as politicians may be frustrated with
its inaccuracies and may rage against the way that it sometimes reports

death, unless the teacher gave written consent, which is unlikely, or a
court agreed to dispense with the restrictions in the interests of

every action that could be criminally prosecuted necessarily leads to
criminal prosecution. It is possible that somebody has done something
wrong and they are not prosecuted. However, their offence, which they

are taking with the measure. As hon. Members from all parties have
said, the matter is problematic, in that it is a step forward in a
direction that members of the teaching profession have been seeking for
some time. However, I accept that, as was debated in relation to one of
the groups of amendments, others may feel that they should also be
afforded the

all that can be said to them is that if the Committee approves the
clause—and I hope that it will—a principle has been
established that can be explored if further evidence comes to light
giving grounds for extending the measure to other
groups.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000199">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
in many of the other areas we have already explored, and as I said in a
previous debate, we have a continuum. We want to ensure that, as the
hon. Member for Sheffield, Heeley said, young people feel they have
absolute protection in coming forward to disclose anything that is
unfair that could be attributed to a teacher. The clause will ensure
that while such investigations are taking place, nothing could unfairly
be attributed to a professional who is working with those young people.
Of course, we can explore the matter beyond the confines of the Bill
with regard to all sorts of allegations—I think the hon. Member
for Preston was seeking to raise that possibility. There are particular
concerns about how the teaching profession has to engage with groups of
and individual young people. The evidence suggests that the provision
is necessary for them, which is why I am happy to support the clause
and I hope that other members of the Committee will be minded to do the
same.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000200">&#160;</a>

for his support, and it is a pleasure to follow on from that. I shall
run through some of the issues raised as quickly as I can. The hon.
Member for Cardiff West made the important point that we must not lose
sight of the fact that real abuse occurs. If he looks at the evidence
from the NASUWT, he will see that it cites the figures on all the
allegations made since 1991. To pick a more recent year at random, in
2006 there were 185 allegations, and in 171 cases no further action was
taken. Fourteen cases went to court, and in five instances no further
action was taken after the court case; however, in eight cases there
was a caution or a conviction. We should not lose sight of the fact
that there were eight such cases in 2006, and the hon. Member for
Cardiff West was right to make the
point.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000201">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am sorry to be pedantic, but it is hard to get
convictions, particularly of sexual abuse, so I would not want the
Minister to make the point that there were only a few convictions.
There may well be a larger number of cases. Clearly, from the point of
view of someone saying that a person was convicted, those are the
figures, but one abused child is one too
many.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000202">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> That was my point. The hon. Lady is misinterpreting
why I cited the figures. I did so to demonstrate that the number is not
zero, and that eight is a large number, albeit a small proportion of
185, which is why we are introducing the clause. None of us should lose
sight of the fact that there were eight cases in just one year. That is
important.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000203">&#160;</a>

penalty in the clause is in line with other similar
provisions—for example, breach of restrictions on newspaper
reporting of family proceedings; and, under the magistrates courts
legislation, the offence of identifying information about a child
involved in proceedings under the Children Act. We discussed this while
the clause was being developed, and we are satisfied that the level of
fine and the reputational damage that will be caused by

publication of information, but such issues will be

                        <p class="tabbed">Convictions
for libel and defamation are all well and good—my hon. Friend
the Member for Beverley and Holderness cited the Newspaper
Society—but they are too late because the damage has been done,
and no amount of compensation or apology can make up for that damage to
a reputation. The hon. Member for Sheffield, Heeley asked where the
evidence is and where the stories are in local newspapers, saying that
she could not find any when she went on the internet to look for them.
I picked out three relatively recent ones, but I will not cite them
because I do not want to commit the very offence that we are trying to
close down; however, <em>The Telegraph and Arg</em>

                           <em>s</em>
reports that a teacher has been told to stay away from a school after
being accused. Another story is that in Liverpool, a teacher was
suspended after being accused. Another in Lancaster is that a senior
teacher has been suspended amid claims. Those are all recent stories,
and I am sure that with more time one could find more to match the
numbers from the

the difficulty of disclosing abuse, we must not put in place hurdles
for children to clear in reporting it. There is of course no room for
any child abuse in schools, and all allegations must be treated
seriously, but outside the glare of ill-informed publicity, which may
skew perceptions and introduce bias. On the question of whether
reporting restrictions would prevent witnesses or other victims from
coming forward, if the police believe that in certain circumstances
there is a public interest argument for a suspect’s identity
being disclosed prior to being charged, they may apply to the court to
have the restrictions lifted, but in most cases there would be
sufficient time to publicise the case when the charge has been made,
and there will be time between the charge being made and the court case
to find out whether there are other
victims.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000206">&#160;</a>

appropriate, and the police may apply to the

shall briefly respond to some of the issues raised by my hon. Friend
the Member for Beverley and Holderness. He said that the Newspaper
Society is worried that the clause could be exploited by schools to
avoid public examination and criticism. No, because when charges are
brought there is no restriction and the school would be subject to all
the scrutiny that the newspapers would want to bring. It is worried
that there will be no pre-legislative consultation, but this was a
six-year, long-standing commitment, reaffirmed in “The
Coalition: our programme for government”. I am willing to meet
the Newspaper Society; however, although I understand its
concerns, I do not share them. It appears to be out of step
with the feeling among MPs and the teaching profession. I mentioned
earlier that we are mindful of the need to

reassured by the measured approach we are taking, despite having been

precisely because of the concerns expressed by the newspaper

primary legislation on the TDA—the Education Act 2005. Section
75 of that Act
states:<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000219">&#160;</a>

their functions are to contribute to raising the standards of teaching

of all routes into the school workforce, and to secure the involvement

                        <p>All
those functions are important, and should not be allowed to slip off

those functions will be exercised.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000220">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The winding
down of the TDA this year has meant that its promotional
campaigns—successful and effective campaigns—to attract
new entrants to the profession have been axed. That was at least part
of the reason for the fall in teacher training applications this year.
According to the latest graduate teacher training statistics, almost
10% fewer students are applying to become secondary school teachers in
2011, compared with the same time last year. Some subjects are
witnessing a fall of nearly 40%. That runs contrary to what one might
expect in the economic cycle. When the economy is contracting, there
tend to be more teaching applications. We are not seeing that in the
current downturn that the Government are presiding over and
exacerbating. In the NASUWT’s written submission, it stated in
respect of the abolition of the TDA that removing the power to impose
conditions will<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000221">&#160;</a>

about the future of initial teacher education following publication of
the White Paper and the late announcement of funding for initial
teacher education in 2011-12 has also not helped recruitment. Abolition
of the TDA will have the additional consequence of dropping important
targets for increasing the number of black and minority ethnic teacher
trainees. Again, assurances would be welcome on where this function
will sit, and that the targets will be
restored.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000223">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Equally
important is the active engagement of all schools in ITE. The
Government’s new initiative—this is a key part of their
White Paper—of teaching schools may overshadow the importance of
involving all schools in training for the benefit of the individual
trainee, the host school and the education system as a whole.
Restricting training to teaching schools would limit the experience of
trainee teachers as only a small number are in challenging
circumstances or the inner
cities.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000224">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
White Paper mentions in several places that the professional standards
framework for teachers will be revised, particularly in terms of the
standards for trainee teachers, advanced skills and excellent teachers.
We have touched on that on a number of occasions in terms

                           </div>of professionalism and enhancing the status of teachers, but there is no
mention of the Secretary of State taking on that work directly
following abolition of the TDA. The TDA has been responsible for
leading on the last two revisions to the framework, and that important
aspect of its functions should not be left to regulation alone, as it
influences both ITE and continuing professional development, as well as
shaping career progression and performance
management.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000225">&#160;</a>

probing amendments allow the Minister to put on the record the
possibility of greater clarity. Following the abolition of the TDA,
what will happen to those functions? Will they continue, should they
continue, and what was the thinking behind the decision to abolish the
TDA, which seemed to be working well and effectively in helping to
enhance the status of teaching and attracting more recruits into the
teaching
profession?<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000226">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I understand that the hon. Member for Hartlepool is
worried that with the abolition of the Training and Development Agency,
its current functions, specifically on maintaining the quality of
trainee teachers, and promoting teaching as a high-status profession,
will not continue to be performed effectively. I assure him that that
will not be the case. The TDA has made a significant contribution to
delivering improvements in teacher training and development, and to
standards of education. In particular, it has taken on important work
to drive forward improvements in recruitment and the quality of
teaching.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000227">&#160;</a>

have stated previously that the key functions of the TDA will continue
to be carried out by an executive agency of the Department directly
accountable to Ministers and through them to the House. Abolition of
the TDA will not, therefore, stifle plans to encourage more
high-quality applicants into teacher training, and to promote teaching
as a high-status profession. In fact, abolition of the TDA is a vital
step in ensuring that we deliver on these plans. It will remove
functions given to an arm’s-length body, and devolve as many
decisions as possible to the front line while increasing transparency,
making the Secretary of State directly accountable for those key
functions that need to continue
centrally.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000228">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Gentleman need not wait for us to lay before Parliament a report
setting out how we will maintain the standard of entry to initial
teacher training, because the White Paper “The Importance of
Teaching” sets out clearly our plans on those issues. They
include raising the bar for Department for Education-funded initial
teacher training for graduates with at least a 2:2 degree, and
reviewing the current basic skills test and other aspects of the
selection process. We also plan to encourage the best and the brightest
into teaching by providing funding to double the size of Teach
First and develop new programmes, including Teach Next—a new
employment-based route to attract high fliers from other
professions—and the troops-to-teachers
programme.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000229">&#160;</a>

the active promotion or marketing of the teaching profession, there
will, of course, be a continued need to promote teaching as a career to
undergraduates, graduates and careers changers. We envisage that, in
the future, the marketing and promotion of teaching will form part of
the remit of the new executive agency of the Department, which, as has
been mentioned, will take over the TDA’s key functions. The new

                           </strong> Does the Minister recognise that, according to the
Central Office of Information, the TDA is the most efficient recruiter
in Government? The teacher recruitment campaign provided a return of
£85 of benefit for every £1 spent on marketing, which is
an astonishing return. Will the Minister give a commitment that that
will
continue?<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000231">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I have said that we will continue advertising. In
fact, as the hon. Gentleman knows, advertising has resumed. Although
the recruitment for teacher training places opened a month later this
year than in previous years, catch-up has taken place and overall
applications to initial teacher training are currently only 3.9% lower
than at this time last year.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000232">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There is
more, however, to promoting teaching as a profession than a marketing
campaign. The White Paper’s title, “The Importance of
Teaching”, shows our commitment to making changes across the
education system to improve the status of the teaching profession and
thereby the quality of teachers and teaching. The White Paper sets out
many ways in which we are seeking to achieve that. We have already
discussed some of them, including dealing with bad behaviour and
violence, which is a common reason why some graduates choose
alternative careers. We have, therefore, proposed measures to remove
barriers that are blocking heads and teachers from taking decisions to
address those issues in the classroom. I hope that I have addressed all
of the issues raised by the hon. Gentleman, but, if he wants to
respond, I will try to address any that I might have missed
out.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000233">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I thank the Minister for the manner in which he
explained the reasoning behind some of his thoughts, but I am not sure
that he has properly set out the reasoning behind the abolition of the
TDA. It is a successful organisation and model that is helping to
raise, enhance and increase recruitment to the teaching profession. It
does not seem to be broken. Other than centralising powers into the
hands and the authority of the Secretary of State, I do not understand
the reasons behind the decision. I had hoped that the Minister would
explain the reason for the abolition. It might be an issue for the
clause stand part debate, but I am not certain what your ruling would
be in that regard, Mr
Williams.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000234">&#160;</a>

would like to know why the decision has been made, given the massive
increase in the success of the TDA’s work in recent years, and
given the statistical dimension of £85 of benefit for every
£1 spent on recruitment. That astonishing return would be the
envy of any sort of investment appraisal. I do not understand why the
Government feel the need to abolish the TDA. It would be useful if the
Minister could explain why, or will he wait until the clause stand part

                           </strong> I am happy to do that now. We had a review of all
the arm’s length bodies, in line with the Government’s
commitment to increase accountability and, where appropriate, to
rationalise and reduce the numbers of

                           </div>arm’s length bodies and overall costs. We concluded that the
TDA’s continuing functions should be carried out by an executive
agency of the Department that was directly accountable to Ministers.
There has been a proliferation of arm’s length bodies in recent
years, with 17 in the education and children’s sectors alone.
Those organisations, including the TDA, have done much valuable work,
but, frankly, there are just too many of them. Furthermore,
arm’s length bodies are expensive and, by removing
responsibility from Ministers and handing it to unelected officials,
they reduce Parliament’s ability to hold Ministers to account.
We are therefore clear that where functions need to be taken at the
national level, we are properly accountable for them. That is the
reasoning behind abolishing the TDA and moving its functions to an
executive agency of the
Department.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000236">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I beg to move amendment 99, in
clause 14, page 22, line 4, at

                        </p>‘(2) The Secretary
of State shall ensure that all teacher training data collected by the
TDA prior to its abolition is safeguarded and
maintained.’.<p class="tabbed">I
suggest that amendment 99 is as attractive as the ice cream of the same
name. Of course, on the part of the Opposition Whip, we even have a
flake to go with it. The amendment would ensure that data on teacher
training collected by the Training and Development Agency for Schools
will be safeguarded and maintained when the agency is abolished.
Earlier in our discussions, I raised the issue of ensuring that data
that are held by such various arm’s length bodies will be
retained where valuable. I have already said that we must not throw the
baby out with the bath water, and that remains
true.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000240">&#160;</a>

Front-Benchers—this view may not be widespread among Labour Back
Benchers—are opposed to the streamlining and the reduction of
costs of the various quangos, the proliferation of which they presided
over with such enjoyment. However, I am glad to say that I and the
Education Committee agreed that a rationalisation of the number of
quangos was a good thing. It is a reasonable step. I support the
decision, but I want to ensure that everything of value is retained. As
I have already commented, I am delighted that Ministers have said that
they are taking great care to ensure that that which is of value in
arm’s length organisations is retained.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000241">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
purpose of the amendment has to do with teacher training information. I
will not rehearse the arguments on the importance of teaching, which is
the title of the White Paper and something on which there is complete
agreement across the House and the Committee. We must not lose any
useful research that the TDA has put together in that regard. Advisers
to the Education Committee told us that there were useful data
globally, and, in particular, the TDA collected excellent data on
teacher training, published annually as the teacher training profiles.
I would be delighted if the Government accepted the amendment, but
assuming that they do not, I seek further assurances that the
Government and the Minister will do everything possible to ensure that
the information is
retained.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000242">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
have one further request of the Minister. I accept his assurances and
am delighted to hear of the understanding of that which is valuable and
that the effort to ensure that it is not lost is being
conducted and taken seriously by the Department and by Ministers.
My question is: how can the Education Committee, for
instance, best scrutinise that action? How do we ensure that not only
is the intent there, but there is a way of providing parliamentary
scrutiny of the effectiveness, so that we can make an evaluation of
whether we feel that the Government have made the
right choices when they carry out their
assessment, as all of us would wish to see? We all know that
parliamentary scrutiny helps to ensure a better Government, and if we
have that, we are less likely to make mistakes and throw away things of
value.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000243">&#160;</a>

Beverley and Holderness with regards to amendment 99. In
doing so, may I quote from something he takes very seriously:
“The Good Teacher Training Guide 2010”? There are a
number of glowing references regarding the quality of the teacher
database in that document, for
example:<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000245">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“England
has assembled through the Training and Development Agency for Schools a
very rich database. The teacher training system can be described with
some precision and changes over time charted. The data available is an
excellent evidence base for policy
making.”<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000450">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>That
document also points out and pleads with the
Government:<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000246">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“we
would also urge it against attempting to make savings on the Training
and Development Agency’s database. England has probably the best
data in the world on the running of its teacher training system and it
is an invaluable resource for policy making. It would be even better if
it were extended to include entry to teaching from the employment based
routes.”<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000451">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>On
that basis, given the language that has been used by a very respected
guide, I hope that the Minister will look favourably upon the hon.
Gentleman’s

                           </strong> The amendment would place a legal requirement on the
Secretary of State to preserve all the data that the TDA collected
prior to its abolition. There is a range of data that the TDA currently
collects in relation to the initial teacher training process, such as
the details of all applicants for teacher training places and those who
go on to undertake teacher training, together with the results of
surveys of newly qualified teachers that seek their views on the
quality of their training courses. I have seen some of those surveys
and they have been very helpful in developing quality in the
Department.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000248">&#160;</a>

hon. Friend the Member for Beverley and Holderness that we fully
recognise the importance of maintaining those records and of continuing
to understand the background of those who are training to become
teachers. It is of interest not only to the Department, but to schools
and heads alike. However, it would be premature to require us to retain
or, indeed, continue collecting all the data that the TDA currently
holds before we have had an opportunity to review our wider data
requirements for the future. Schedule 5 allows the Secretary of State
to make property transfer schemes, under which we will be able to make
provision for the transfer of any data that the TDA holds to the
Secretary of
State.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000249">&#160;</a>

the second part of my hon. Friend’s amendment and the
maintenance of those data, we are looking at all our current and new
sources of data, including a new school work force census, in defining
what will be needed by schools and the Department for the needs of the
system before we make decisions about what data to gather in the
future. We will consult with the profession and consider demand
alongside the need to minimise burdens on teachers and schools and to
deliver value for money for the taxpayer. We need to consider that
alongside related issues on all work force data held by the Department
and all its arm’s length bodies, not just the TDA. We need to
consider what data should continue to be held centrally and in what
form. I would be very happy for my hon. Friend to contribute to the
consultation process, so that we can hear first hand his views about
what his Committee thinks should be retained by the new work force
agency that is being established to replace the
TDA.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000250">&#160;</a>

anticipate the hon. Gentleman, I am sure that hon. Members will
appreciate that I am unable at this stage to give a view on how many
staff from the TDA will transfer to the Department, but I assure them
that detailed discussions with the TDA are taking place and are,
obviously, at a sensitive point. There is no need to wait for us to set
out what we will do, as it is all in the White Paper. I ask him to
withdraw his amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000267">&#160;</a>

given what else is going on within the Department and the large-scale
centralisation of many functions of different agencies into the hands
of the Secretary of State, I am concerned that the good work that the
TDA has been doing will be lost. As for the criteria for success or
failure, we have seen already, as a result of some of the first
decisions by this Department for Education, a tail-off in teacher
recruitments, which goes against the tide of what has happened in
previous years and of what we would expect in respect of the current
economic cycle. On that basis, there has been a bit of failure with
regard to the transfer of functions.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000268">&#160;</a>

that higher education and initial teacher training is twice as likely
to be good or outstanding in higher education institutions than in
school-based provision. Secondly, the Institute of Education report,
which clearly identified that the more time a pupil spends with a
support assistant and the less time with a qualified teacher, the less
progress that child will make.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000271">&#160;</a>

current arrangements and future plans for financial assistance for
initial teacher training students. As hon. Members will be aware,
financial assistance for teacher trainees is not distributed according
to the type of school in which these teachers will do their work. As
with all undergraduates, student loans cover tuition. Living costs,
funded by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, are
available to all trainees through Student Finance England, while
grants, also available through Student Finance England, are distributed
on the basis of income. On specific financial assistance for initial
teacher trainees, the TDA currently distributes bursaries for teacher
trainees according to the subject that they specialise in regardless of
the school in which they are training or any future school in which
they will teach.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000276">&#160;</a>

trainees undertaking ITT in the priority subjects of physics,
chemistry, engineering and maths will receive a £9,000 bursary,
while those training to teach biology, combined general science and
modern foreign languages will receive a £6,000 bursary. As
previously stated, this financial assistance is not based on the
institution in which they are training. The White Paper set out clear
plans for the future financial assistance for trainee teachers,
specifically how we will use these financial incentives to raise the
quality of entrants into the profession. It set out the
Government’s intention that in order to receive funding from the
Department, anyone starting PGCE teacher training will need to hold at
least a second class first degree from a UK higher education
institution or an equivalent qualification.

“The Importance of Teaching: The Schools White Paper

equality and the duties to which schools must adhere under the 2010

the Committee about where that function as regards equality and BME
trainees will now sit. The equality impact assessment does not refer at
all to the importance of a diverse teacher work force in providing
positive role models for children from more disadvantaged backgrounds.
Increasingly, teacher trainees and NQTs do not feel properly prepared
to support pupils who have English as an additional language, and they
are concerned about not being adequately trained to work in
multicultural classrooms.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000286">&#160;</a>

audit, which included information from more than 200 courses involving
11,000 staff in 2007-08, found an inconsistent picture. It found very
limited provision for EAL early professional development. Some evidence

behind the amendment, which the hon. Gentleman has articulated with his
usual style. He will know that the 2010 Act imposes on public bodies
the obligation to comply with the general equality duty, which will
commence on 5 April this year. To be clear, for the benefit of the
whole Committee—the hon. Gentleman will know this
anyway—section 149(1) of the 2010 Act defines that general duty
as the requirement to have regard to the need to “eliminate
discrimination”, to “advance equality of
opportunity” and to<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000289">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">However, the
hon. Gentleman has made an additional point about different groups
being unrepresented in the profession. I emphasise that we take that
situation seriously, and I have listened carefully to his comments. We
have made it clear that the new agency will continue the salient work
of the TDA. The principles that he described, of ensuring that
unrepresented groups in the teaching profession carry on being
advanced—BME groups for example—will continue under the
new agency. It is absolutely right that in the selection, training and
regulation of teachers we have a mind to that under-representation and
to what we can do to address it. The function of the TDA in those terms
will continue under the new arrangements, and the Secretary of State
will have the duty, under the Equality Act 2010, to make clear what he
has done to comply with the Act. I know that the hon. Gentleman will
understand that that existing obligation for the Secretary of State to
publish information annually on how he is meeting his duties under the
2010 Act, as well as the commitment that I have given today to continue
that work in respect of the new agency, will satisfy the hon.
Gentleman’s perfectly proper concerns. We are not neglecting the
responsibility that we have for equality or the underlying principles,
and I hope that on that basis the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the

the abolition of the TDA, the Secretary of State, as I understand it,
will directly fund the Higher Education Funding Council for England for
the provision of initial teacher training, for entry into the teaching
profession. Proposed new section 23, which the Bill would insert into
the Higher Education Act 2004, appears to enable the Secretary of State
to impose a condition on HEFCE relating to the provision of grant,
loans and other payments, which it in turn must impose on universities
and other relevant institutions. Is that correct, and if so will the
Minister give examples of conditions that might, through HEFCE, be
imposed on higher education institutions? For my own benefit rather
than the Committee’s, I would be grateful if the Minister could
give a clear and simple explanation of the proposed new section, so
that I can understand exactly what the Government
intend.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000298">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The amendment would remove from the Bill an
amendment to the Higher Education Act 2004 that is consequential on the
abolition of the Training and Development Agency for Schools. The
amendment to the 2004 Act is required to remove the TDA from existing
legislation that deals with the capping of tuition charges for
university-based initial teacher-training courses, and to require the
Secretary of State to impose a condition of a maximum tuition charge on
the grant that he provides to institutions specified in the 2004 Act,
which will include university initial teacher-training provision. The
part of schedule 4 that the amendment would remove is simply a
consequence of the abolition of the TDA under the Bill. I assure the
Committee that it does not change the policy on tuition charging for
university-based initial teacher-training, or for any undergraduate
higher education course. The ability to charge the higher fee will
remain, subject to the institution having in place a plan approved by
the Office for Fair Access. Section 23 simply reflects the abolition of
the TDA. I hope, therefore, that the hon. Gentleman is reassured that
this part of the Bill is simply consequent on the previous
clause.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000299">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Again, I will be brief. I want to press the
Minister on this matter, as I did in respect of the General Teaching
Council for England. In particular, there are three main aspects of the
clause, and they relate to staff, property and liabilities.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000304">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The Minister
has already mentioned not being able to provide any degree of
certainty over compulsory redundancies, voluntary redundancies, and the
redeployment of the 300 or so staff from the TDA. I want to press him
on that: can he provide any degree of reassurance? Will there be
compulsory redundancies? I understand the sensitivity of negotiations,
but it would be helpful both for the Committee and for wider
stakeholder involvement, particularly in terms of staff, to get a
clearer indication of what is going on.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000305">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On property,
I understand from reading the TDA’s annual report from last year
that it recently moved to an office in Manchester, which has been
refurbished, presumably at some considerable cost to the taxpayer. What
will happen to that? Will the functions of the agency still be carried
out in that Manchester office? Will any lease relating to that office
be the responsibility of the Department? It would be helpful if the
Minister indicates to the Committee what is going on there.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000306">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That leads me
to my final point, which is about liabilities. From the balance sheet
of the TDA, I know that it has a net liability of about £4
million. Presumably, the Department will have to take that on board.
Has that been taken into account in respect of the impact assessment,
where it states that there will be a slight benefit from the abolition
of the TDA—a saving of about £2.4 million per annum is
estimated? To what extent has the £4 million liability on the
balance sheet been addressed?<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000307">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Clause 17 introduces schedule 5, which is about
schemes for the transfer of staff, property, rights and liabilities
from the TDA to the Secretary of State. Given that it is our intention
to abolish the TDA and transfer its continuing functions to the
Secretary of State, it becomes technically necessary to enable the
transfer of any staff and property from the agency to the Secretary of
State. Once the legislation that established the TDA has been repealed,
we will have staff and property that, in principle, belong to a body
that no longer exists. That is really the purpose of the clause and the
schedule.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000308">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">To address
the hon. Gentleman’s specific questions, the changes we propose
to make to staffing are still a year away, so we are not yet in a
position to provide the detail that he is looking for. I can assure
him, however, that we are working very closely with the TDA on all
issues relating to staff and premises, with a view to ensuring that the
transition will be as smooth as possible. There will, of course, be
implications for staff, but it is important to remember that we expect
many of the TDA’s functions to continue. The Department and the
TDA, therefore, will work closely to ensure that appropriate
implementation planning takes place, redundancies are

                           </div>minimised and that staff are treated fairly and sensitively. The TDA
will also work closely with its union and it will consult staff,
involving the DFE as necessary.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000309">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Gentleman also asked about Manchester. Where best to locate any ongoing
functions will need to be considered, but decisions will need to be
made in light of a separate review of the Government’s overall
estate. We will work closely with the TDA to minimise redundancies and
ensure that staff are properly treated.

helpful if, as the Bill progresses, the Minister could keep us informed

that he wants the functions to continue, and that he wants the existing
staff to be able to continue to exercise those functions, but that the
efficiency of the Government estate would best be served by having them
do it in London, or possibly even Darlington, where the Department has

                        <p class="tabbed">If
the Government are intent on abolition, amendment 101 at least tries to
restore some sanity to the situation. We want to delay abolition by 18
months, not to drag our feet nor in some hope that the body might be
rescued, but because there is a good case to argue that, if the
Government insist on abolition, the body should at least be allowed to
deliver on the job profiles that it was set up to produce.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000323">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">One of the
Chancellor’s announcements in last year’s Budget was that
a £250 payment should be made to lower paid public sector
workers, including support staff. We know that that payment will be
made to teachers who fall into that category, but there is no guarantee
that it will be made to support staff. If the School Support Staff
Negotiating Body were kept in place, there would perhaps be some chance
that that payment could
happen.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000324">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
School Support Staff Negotiating Body was set up with the support of
teachers, head teachers’ organisations, governing bodies and
parents’ organisations, which are all aware of the value of
support staff and the contribution they make to improving standards and
the learning environment in our schools. Ofsted’s fifth report
evaluating the impact of school work force reform, which was published
in 2010, found that 80% of schools visited provided evidence that the
wider work force had contributed to improved learning outcomes. Ofsted
also identified several areas in which it had concerns about the wider
work force and, in particular, how effectively they were being managed
and developed. Page 5 of the report
states:<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000325">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
body identified more than 100 support staff roles with profiles that
schools could use as benchmarks to assess their own jobs. A
school-based job evaluation scheme had been designed and a pay and
conditions model was under discussion, including a working time
formulation that would help schools to arrive at appropriate pay levels
fairly and consistently. Before the Government’s announcement,
the job profiles had reached the testing-in-schools stage, a handbook
of minimum conditions

                        <p class="tabbed">The School
Support Staff Negotiating Body agreement should have been finalised by
January 2011 for phased implementation by April. It would have
recommended a national framework and provided guidance to
schools—I stress this point—without prescription. It
would have reduced the burden on self-governing schools of having to
create their own job descriptions and pay structures and would have
significantly reduced the exposure of schools and local authorities to
future equal pay
claims.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000329">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> My understanding is that the profiles had reached
the stage of being tested in schools. Given that all the work has been
knocked off kilter by the Secretary of State’s announcement last
autumn of the abolition of the negotiating body, whether they are fully
developed is a moot point. That is why, if abolition is the
Government’s intention, extra time is required to complete the
body’s work. Abolishing the body is a wasteful thing to
do.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000331">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Government have identified the value of pay review bodies, including
those for teachers and head teachers. In the abolition of School
Support Staff Negotiating Body, the Government have made school support
staff, who are predominantly women working in the local economy, an
exception to the right to have a negotiating pay review body. There is
also a legacy of equal pay liability. Around 35% of local authorities
with schools have not carried out a pay review and face an equal pay
bill of at least £214 million for their school support
staff.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000332">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In addition,
last year, the Chancellor announced a two-year pay freeze in the public
sector, but he promised that all staff earning less than £21,000
would receive at least £250 in each year. The Secretary of State
has submitted evidence to the School Teachers Review Body recommending
that that should be paid to any teachers earning under that threshold,
but he says that, despite having the power to direct, he has no way of
delivering that to school support staff. That is a potential problem
that could have been resolved by the School Support Staff Negotiating
Body.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000333">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">A
lot of Government rhetoric about wanting to help hard-working ordinary
families and about supporting equality for women will ring hollow if
they do not even allow the body to complete the first phase of its work
before its abolition. It is beyond the resources of most individual
schools to develop and collectively bargain pay structures and job
evaluation processes that will recruit and retain professional staff.
For that reason, academy chains, and a significant number of local
authorities and sixth-form college employers, have been waiting in the
wings to draw on the SSSNB job profiles and evaluation system, and
local authorities will continue to be vulnerable to equal pay
challenges.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000334">&#160;</a>

staff will feel that the long-awaited acknowledgement of their
professional contribution, which has almost arrived with a fair and
consistent award, has been taken from them by this measure. The
amendment would ensure that their hard work does not go to waste. We
therefore intend to oppose the abolition. If the Government are intent
on pursuing this line, they should at least delay it for sufficient
time to allow the SSSNB to complete its
work.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000335">&#160;</a>

disappointed and despondent that the Government propose getting rid of
this body. They are generally low-paid workers, predominantly women,
and they feel very let down by the Government. Before a vote is taken

will miss if we do so.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000336">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Concern has
been expressed over a number of years by workers and employers that a
common framework was needed to deal with job roles and pay for school
support staff. If we consider the evolution, and even the revolution,
of school support staff over the last 10 years, we see that
there was an even greater a need for some structure. The need was
identified, and a group of workers got the Government and employers to
agree to set up a national negotiating body—no easy task. That
proves that there was a need for the body.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000337">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There has
been a rapid growth in the range and depth of skills and
responsibilities being exercised by school support staff. They were
crucial in delivering the remodelling changes to teachers’
contracts. They were the key to providing extended services for schools
and professionalising the running of schools. The deployment of school
support staff varies widely in the different institutions. Some schools
have gone too far, and classroom support staff are regularly teaching
whole classes. That is why we need to ensure a standardisation of
roles. There is also confusion as to who is responsible for school
support staff. Is it the local authority, the heads or the governors?
There was a growing recognition that the national joint council for
local government services was not suitable to deal with school staff.
The job evaluation system and the pay structure for local authority
staff are not designed to meet the needs of school staff, or of those
working with children and young people.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000338">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In 2003, we
had the remodelling agreement for teachers in schools. In 2005, the
Government set up the schools staff working group with a remit to come
up with proposals for a structure on pay and conditions. In
2006, the working group reported to Ministers, recommending the
development of proposals for a new negotiating body and the recognition
of facilities. In 2007, the working group presented its findings and it
was agreed to set up a national body. In 2009, the SSSNB was set up
under the Bill as a negotiating body and a non-department public body.

I was saying, the employers' side was the Local Government Association,
the Foundation and Aided Schools National Association, the Church of
England’s Education Division, and the Catholic Education
Service. On the staff side was Unison, Unite and the GMB, in attendance
in a non-voting capacity was the Department—whatever it was
called at the various points—and the Training and Development
Agency. I would be lying if I were to say that this was welcomed by all
of the employers in the Local Government Association. However, a number
of employers—particularly the faith employers—did welcome
a framework in which to work. The Labour Government recognised the need
and the employers got on board with the work, even before the Bill was
in place.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000343">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The body has
been working on a core contract of employment to cover remuneration,
duties and working time, with a national job role profile to cover core
school support roles. It is developing and producing a method of
converting the job role profiles into a salary structure, a strategy to
implement a national pay and conditions framework in all maintained
schools. However, there was no carte blanche to increase the pay as
staff. The Government had said that there had to be regard to
minimising the additional administrative burdens and cost implications
for employers; that all agreements had to be affordable; that equality
and diversity had to be addressed and best practice adhered to; and
that there had to be consideration of the need to recruit and retain
sufficient numbers of high-quality support staff.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000344">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Contrary to
popular belief, that is not just about classroom support, as my hon.
Friend the shadow Minister said. It actually created five job
families—teaching and learning support; administration and
management; facilities; specialist and technical; and pupil support and
welfare—covering all the support staff who would be
working in a school. It has drawn up 100 role profiles. It is
an enormous piece of work: one is talking about nearly 500,000 staff
doing a variety of jobs in schools. It has made huge progress and has
drawn up 100 job role profiles. As my hon. Friend the Member for
Cardiff West said, it is now at the stage of testing those in
school.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000345">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The body also
has a working-time formula. One concern for support staff, over a
number of years, was that teachers are paid for 52 weeks, while other
staff working in schools are often paid only term-time or 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 594<a class="bkMark" name="Column594">&#160;</a>
                           </div>term-time plus, or variations of that. It has been working on a formula
for working time, to account for those differences of whether it is
term-time only or not. It has also drawn up a suitable job evaluation
system. Those people who have been involved in job evaluations will
know that there is a variety of systems, with different weightings on
different roles. Is manual the most important bit, or is
intelligence?<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000346">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The body was
due to report this April and there had been a delay. Initially, the
Labour Government said it wanted a report by last year. It was given an
extension to this April, with a view to be totally up and running. Last
May, of course, it was put on hold, when the new Government said it did
not want this body to be in place. All of that work is sitting there
but on hold. I want to ask the Government what they think will happen
now. Anybody who employs staff knows the difficulty of determining
salary. Whether in the private or public sector, one finds out the
going rate in the industry. What is the going rate for the architect or
painter and decorator? The best employers do job evaluation. They find
a system that works and do that job evaluation for themselves. The
Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority has done that for us in
the House, and it has declared a scale of pay that we are supposed to
pay our staff. With many employers in different jobs, it is up to the
employer where to pay within that scale, but one has an idea of the
value of the work.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000347">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">This proposal
means that individual schools or local authorities now have to create
this framework for themselves. The individual schools have said that
they want the framework; the ASCL has said that getting rid of the
SSSNB is a retrograde step; the academy chains were interested in the
work and wanted to see the results in order to be able to use them; and
the faith schools wanted it. Even now, Unison gets frequent phone calls
from schools and other employers to ask what they should be paying
their
employees.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000348">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
my hon. Friend the Member for North West Durham has said, employers are
now more susceptible to equal pay claims. Where are the comparators?
They were not addressed in the local government pay claims. Pay claims
will continue to be looked at. Employers were concerned about the
costs, but those costs are potentially higher without the SSSNB. A
vacuum will be left. The Opposition ask that if the Government will not
keep the body, they will at least allow it to complete its work so that
all workers can be put on a professional
footing.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000349">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
average primary school has 11 support staff, and the average secondary
school has 40. As I have said, individual job evaluation is not
feasible or cost-effective. The Government will be letting down nearly
half a million workers. As my hon. Friend has said, those staff will
not even get the £250 that the Chancellor has promised to
low-paid workers in the public sector during the two-year pay freeze,
because there is no machinery to allocate it. I ask the Government to
rethink the proposal and at least allow the body to continue its work
until a national framework exists, even if they do not want it to
impose any pay terms and conditions on local authorities or other
employers.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000350">&#160;</a>

said, 490,000 people are desperately disappointed at the
Government’s decision to abolish the SSSNB,

			Column number: 595<a class="bkMark" name="Column595">&#160;</a>
                           </div>and I am one of them. As an assistant director, I
sat in meeting after meeting with unions, head teachers and
representatives of different groups of people trying to find a way
through this, for what seemed like years. It was like walking through
treacle.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000351">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There was a
time when the local authority set all pay and conditions in schools,
and support staff were paid the same in secondary schools across the
city or the borough. All that changed when governors started to set pay
scales, and different head teachers employed different people. We now
have a range of people in schools; we have learning mentors,
technicians, support assistants, non-qualified teachers and nursery
nurses—some of whom are working in secondary schools and in
sixth forms—not to mention the cooks and the cleaners.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000352">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That has huge
financial implications, because even though the Government are looking
to move away from local authorities being employers in schools,
ultimately the Government employ all these people. Where we have equal
opportunities legislation, and where different people are doing the
same job in different situations, there will be claims, which the
Government will face as well as schools. The establishment of the SSSNB
was manna from heaven for people in local authorities who had been
struggling with such issues for years and getting no further forward.
If the Government do nothing else, for the sake of the
Minister’s sanity I suggest that he looks at allowing the body
to complete the work that it is doing. If it does not, that will come
back and bite him big-style.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000353">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I believe that all of us in this room value school
support staff and recognise and appreciate the important contribution
that they make to our education system by supporting teachers and
pupils. I am sure that those of us who visit schools have seen the high
regard in which head teachers and school governors hold the support
staff that they employ.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000354">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There is also
a degree of consensus about the need to reduce central prescription on
schools. Head teachers consistently tell us that their ability to lead
their school is constrained by the burdens of bureaucracy, legislation
and central guidance. They also say that central Government directives
constrain their ability to do what is right for their school and its
pupils within the specific and individual context of their local
environment.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000355">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In that
context, the Secretary of State decided the future of the SSSNB. He
concluded that the expected outcome of its activities, the development
of a statutory national pay and conditions framework for school support
staff, would involve creating and imposing additional rigidity on
schools. That would be at odds with this Government’s commitment
to reduce central prescription and give heads greater autonomy to
manage the resources available to them as they see fit.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000356">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Member for Cardiff West raised a couple of issues. On the £250,
we are aware that local government employers recently announced that
they do not intend to make a pay offer to their employees for 2011-12.
That decision will affect all local authority employees, including
school support staff who work in community and voluntary-controlled
schools. Obviously, I cannot comment on the position for the remainder
of school support staff in maintained schools or those working in
voluntary-aided schools. The Government set the overall policy on
public sector pay, but decisions about the pay of local government work
forces are taken at local level by councils. Central Government have no
role, but we expect them to exercise similar restraint to that applied
in the public
sector.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000358">&#160;</a>

shadow Minister; I beg pardon. Nine months in, it is still hard to
relinquish old titles. We appreciate the time and effort that has been
put into the development of a pay and conditions framework for school
support staff by members of the SSSNB. The Secretary of State has made
it clear to trade unions and support staff employee organisations that
he believes that there is a clear argument for completing some elements
of the work begun by the SSSNB, on the basis that the outputs might be
of some use to employers and

                           </strong> I welcome that comment from the Minister. When
we took evidence from a range of people, including head teachers, there

                           </strong> I am grateful for my hon. Friend’s
intervention. Those elements include the set of support staff job
profiles, for example, and the associated job evaluation scheme. Should
trade unions and employers deem that it would be a useful way to
proceed with support staff pay and conditions to continue with that
development work independently of the Government, I believe that that
would be a positive outcome. I hope that that goes some way towards
reassuring the hon. Members for Bolton West and for North West
Durham.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000361">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It is
paramount that such guidelines are developed independently so that
employers of support staff are allowed the freedom to choose to use
what any voluntary arrangement might produce. It is planned for me to
meet with trade unions and employer organisations after they have had
the opportunity to discuss further the possibility of a voluntary
arrangement. The Government have already indicated that we will
actively support such an arrangement by contributing towards any
funding that might be necessary to help enable the completion of the
job role profile and job evaluation development work. I understand that
there have been some informal exploratory talks. I am currently waiting
to hear about progress before arranging the
meetings.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000362">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The easiest
way to complete this would be to accept the amendment and to allow the
job profiles to be completed. The Minister described prescription to
schools, but no prescription is involved. As I said, the SSSNB was all
about guidance without prescription. I find his citing of a comment
about the straitjacket on teachers’ pay rather disturbing,
because it makes me wonder whether teachers are next in line for the
abolition of a national pay
body.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000365">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Obviously,
national teachers’ pay will be influenced by the fragmentation
of the education system that the Government are planning, and I rather
suspect from their approach that it will not only be support staff, but
teachers next and head teachers after that—the complete
dismantling of any sort of pay review structure in our state education
system. Describing the pay review body for teachers as a straitjacket
is a fairly indicative comment. I accept that he was quoting a head
teacher, but I presume he was quoting that comment because he felt it
fitted in with his own views. Perhaps I was wrong and the Minister
disagrees with the head teacher he
quoted.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000366">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> That is undoubtedly the case. Of
course, quoting one head teacher is one thing, but the head
teachers’ organisations are in favour, and they support the
SSSNB, so the greater number of head teachers is supportive. We see the
measure as a straightforward attack on hard-working families, low-paid
people and, mainly, as pointed out in the debate, women, who work in a
lot of the roles. In some senses, the clause is the most ideological
one that the Government have in the Bill. The negotiating body is
supported right across education, and would save time, money,
bureaucracy and legal
challenge.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000368">&#160;</a>

SSSNB created the right message about schools and the people who work
in them—the team who work in a school together, around the
child, in order to promote education for our young people. The jobs
affected might typically be described as pink-collar
ghettos—jobs done mainly by women, and often for low pay. The
negotiating body was an important step forward, but the message, loud
and clear, from the Government to teaching assistants, office staff and
the other roles my hon. Friends mentioned, including dinner ladies, as
my mother was, is that they are a second-class part of the teams
working in our

being dismantled at the whim of the Secretary of State, because of his
ideological desire to sweep away any form of national pay bargaining or
national pay structures. What is particularly offensive is that he has
picked on those at the bottom of the pile as his first target for such
an approach. The Minister earlier talked about his enthusiasm for
monetarism, and getting rid of such structures fits in with a free
market ideology. The Government will rue and regret doing so. It is

                           </strong> I am happy to say that it is a technical clause. It
remedies an omission that was made when the Education and Inspections
Act 2006 was brought into force. I am sure my hon. Friend the Minister
and I were on that Committee and I am sure we spotted it, but we
decided not to raise it.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000420">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In 2002, the
Education Act was brought into force and parts of the School Standards
and Framework Act 1998 relating to staffing matters in England and
Wales were repealed and replaced in the Education Act by sections 35
and 36. Sections 35(7) and 36(7) of the Education Act make provision
for the effect on staffing in circumstances where the delegated budget
of a maintained school in England or Wales is suspended by virtue of
section 17 or schedule 15 to the School Standards and Framework Act.

                           </div>the Education and Inspections Act 2006 meant that section 17 of the
School Standards and Framework Act no longer applied to schools in
England. We therefore propose to rectify this by amending sections
35(7) and 36(7) of the Education Act 2002 to include a reference to
section 66 of the Education and Inspections Act 2006, which
replaced section 17 of the School Standards and Framework Act in its
application to England.<a class="bkMark" name="11032321000421">&#160;</a>
