<div class="Column"><a name="Column587" />Column number: 587</div><a name="0902278000088"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0902278000554"></a><b class="B">Paul
Holmes</b> (Chesterfield) (LD): To recap, the Minister had
clarified the intention of the new clauses. One clarification, which
dealt with a number of the issues that organisations such as Justice
and Liberty have raised about youth courts and so on, was that the new
clauses will not, by and large, or at all, apply to under-18s. However,
the Minister also put great emphasis on the fact that one of the
reasons for introducing the new clauses on gangs was the involvement of
14, 15 and 16-year-olds in stabbings. That is a dichotomy that will
require further exploration when he sums
up.</div><a name="0902278000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is also an issue that, if the new clauses do not apply, by and large,
to under-18s because they would not be able to afford the fine imposed
for a breach of the injunction, some 16 to 18-year-olds do of course
work and earn money, and so could pay the fine. Will the clauses
therefore apply to a few under-18s who do work and are able to afford
the fine, or will they not apply to any under-18s? Either way, there is
much confusion, so surely the Bill should address an age limit, if
there is to be one. I hope that the Minister will discuss that in his
closing
comments.</div><a name="0902278000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
also discussed the fact that the new clauses do not offer a definition
of a gang. In his opening comments, the Minister went to great lengths
to say that the provisions will not apply to a group of hoodies on a
street corner or to football fans wearing scarves. Can we be content
with such a simple explanation? We all know of examples of legislation
being passed for one purpose, but allowing mission creep to take place,
because the police will use whatever powers they have in certain
situations. Terrorism legislation was used to arrest a heckler at a
Labour party conference, for example, as well as to stop legitimate
peaceful protesters at arms fairs in London.</div>
<a name="0902278000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">Furthermore,
on 15 November 2008, section 27 of the Violent Crime Reduction Act 2006
was used against 80 Stoke City fans, so the Minister&#146;s claim
that the new clauses do not apply to football supporters is relevant
here. The fans stopped at a pub on their way to a match. They were
being perfectly peaceful and the publican made no complaint about their
behaviour. The police, however, used the 2006 Act to round them up and
detain them for a while, before sending them 40 miles back to Stoke on
a coach. They missed the match, had no toilet facilities and were told
to pee into cups, which spilled all over the floor of the coach. The
treatment of those fans was unacceptable; they had not committed a
violent offence and the publican had not complained about them, and it
would appear that the legislation was grossly
misused.</div><a name="0902278000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are other examples that could be highlighted illustrating the same
point regarding legislation being misused for one purpose when it was
clearly intended for another. As there is no definition of a gang in
the new clauses, does that not leave open the possibility that the
legislation might be misused for purposes for which the Minister says
that it is not intended? It could be used against football fans, for
example, or gangs of hoodies on street corners and so on, even though I
accept the Minister&#146;s explanation that the intent of the new
clauses is, essentially, to target hard-core gangs involved in major
violence and serious organised activity. There has been much reference
to the dangers of such gangs, but it should be put on record&#151;as
it has been 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column588" />Column number: 588</div>already&#151;that the issue does not apply to most of the country.
However, it is a major problem in the areas to which it does
apply.</div>
<a name="0902278000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">In my 22 years
of teaching, I never came across a gang culture impinging on school
life. I have some experience of schools in Sheffield&#151;not much,
even though I went to school there&#151;and did some teaching
practice near Barnsley, but most of my teaching was in Derbyshire. Yet
I recently visited a school in an area of London with a strong gang
culture. That culture sometimes impinges on school life there, although
by and large the school is a haven of safety within the community.
There was just one incident there recently. Last summer, a gang member
inflicted serious harm on another pupil who was a member of a rival
gang with a metal bar&#151;the kind that has dumb-bell weights at the
ends&#151;and was jailed. Nobody disputes that in some of our inner
cities there are serious gang issues such as those that the Minister
has described, but that is not the experience of the vast majority of
the population in the
UK.</div><a name="0902278000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minster has not explained clearly enough why the Government feel that
the existing laws are inadequate, but I hope that he will. Those were
precisely the grounds on which the Court of Appeal rejected the
Birmingham case. It said that the available evidence was too flimsy to
lead to the injunction that had been issued. The ruling stated that the
legislation on antisocial behaviour orders was perfectly adequate to
deal with the matter. Clearly, the Government do not agree with that,
because they are introducing these strong clauses on a new offence that
could be used in such situations. However, the Court of Appeal said
that there was plenty of legislation that could have been used and that
the evidence was too flimsy. Are the Government introducing the new
clauses because they want a lower burden of proof? For an ASBO, the
criminal burden of proof&#151;that it is beyond reasonable doubt that
a person has acted antisocially&#151;is needed. In the Shafi and
Ellis case, the Court of Appeal made it clear that, given the
seriousness of the matter, the same standard of evidence&#151;the
criminal burden of proof involving the matter being beyond reasonable
doubt&#151;should be applied. The new clauses would create a new
civil order with a lower applicable standard of proof: proof on the
balance of probabilities. Is the real reason behind the clauses to
allow a lower burden of proof and make it easier to get an injunction,
or, under existing law, an ASBO? The Court of Appeal thought that the
ASBO was perfectly adequate in that
situation.</div><a name="0902278000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
proposals affect the liberty of the person. They affect the right of
association and expression and freedom of movement, and they introduce
a concept of criminality without trial and with a lower burden of
proof. That is contrary to the tenor of English law over the eight
centuries since Magna Carta. If the Government take that serious step
they will have a lot more explaining to do to convince both the House
and the other
place.</div><a name="0902278000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
well as introducing a lower standard of proof for the new offence, the
proposals also move what is basically an ASBO principle on from
prohibiting someone from doing something to requiring that they do
things as well. In that sense it is almost a control order, and we all
know the controversy that surrounds those. The Government have said
repeatedly that control orders were temporary measures, but they have
renewed them two or three times. Those measures are very controversial
and we will look at them again soon in the main 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column589" />Column number: 589</div>Chamber. It seems as though we are almost turning an ASBO into a control
order with the new clauses, and that raises serious concerns that we
will need to discuss at much greater length in both
Chambers.</div><a name="0902278000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would like the Minister, in summing up, to answer three questions. Why
are the current measures not adequate, even though the Court of Appeal
specifically stated that they were, which is why it rejected the
situation in Birmingham? The Minister discussed the problems with
having a definition of a gang and said that he would look again at the
proposals for one, but without a definition how do we stop major
mission creep or the abuse of powers that we see with other legislation
relating to violent disorder and the prevention of terrorism? Why
should we introduce a low burden of proof when an injunction would have
such a major impact on a person&#146;s basic civil
liberties?</div><a name="0902278000098"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902278000555"></a>The
Minister for Security, Counter-Terrorism, Crime and Policing
(Mr. Vernon Coaker):</b> Welcome, Mr.
Bayley, to the Committee&#146;s final sitting, and the conclusion of
our deliberations on the Bill. The debate on gangs has been interesting
and good, and I make no apology for repeating a couple of points before
turning to the specific issues that have been raised. In these
provisions, we are wrestling with what to do about a small number of
individuals who are extremely violent and dangerous, and I know that
every member of the Committee accepts that that is the case. Not only
are those individuals violent and dangerous, but they terrorise
communities. As I have said on numerous occasions, the criminal route,
where possible, is the preferred option. Leaving aside the age issue,
we would of course prefer it if criminal evidence was gathered so that
those people could be brought before the criminal courts and
prosecuted.</div>
<a name="0902278000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, the
hon. Members for Chesterfield and for Hornchurch know as well as I do
that gathering that evidence in some parts of some communities is
virtually impossible. What should we do about that? Should we shrug our
shoulders and say, &#147;There is nothing that we can do about that,
so we will just let those people act with impunity.&#148;? I know
that that is not what the hon. Member for Chesterfield is suggesting we
do, but we cannot even prove that they threaten and terrorise people,
because they intimidate the witnesses, who are so frightened that they
will not come forward. That is why we have seen changes in the criminal
justice system to take witness protection measures and use video links
or screens around a witness box, which are also serious
matters.</div>
<a name="0902278000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
alternative to taking such measures is that we would just let people
get away with it, which is not acceptable, so the criminal justice
system has adapted witness protection measures and various other
measures. We are trying to deal with all the things that the hon.
Members for Chesterfield and for Hornchurch have raised. Established
organised gangs operate on territory with the use of colours to
terrorise and threaten people, and they operate in a way that makes it
impossible to gather evidence to do anything about it.</div>
<a name="0902278000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">Birmingham
used those injunctions to try to tackle the problem and the figures
showed a drop&#151;incidentally, the hon. Member for Chesterfield
will know that the relevant cabinet member in Birmingham is a Liberal
Democrat. I know that there are issues relating to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column590" />Column number: 590</div>human rights and the proper use of powers, but I would have thought that
residents in Birmingham and across the country would look at that and
say, &#147;That is fantastic.&#148; It may have infringed the
privacy and human rights of the individual subject to the injunction,
but the human rights of countless numbers of individuals are enhanced
by the fact that someone who had terrorised the community was no longer
able to do so.</div>
<a name="0902278000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Chesterfield asked why the existing powers were not
adequate, which I will come to in a moment, but all those powers
existed in Birmingham and across the country, and it was still not
possible to tackle effectively some of the most violent individuals. We
looked at what happened in Birmingham, we saw that there was a public
policy response which made a difference, and we thought we should adapt
it, particularly following the court
judgment.</div><a name="0902278000516"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.15

reaching these conclusions we do not wish to minimise in any way the
problems identified by the council. However, we are confident that the
courts have ample powers to deal with
them.&#148;</div><a name="0902278000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister says he will return to that. If the Minister convinces us that
the current powers are not satisfactory&#151;which is why this is
needed&#151;is he saying that on the basis of council and police
supposition or belief, and without the evidence to prove it, there
should be the ultimate power under these injunctions to put three
requirements on an individual? The individual would spend eight hours
at a place of work or education; eight hours of leisure at a particular
place and eight hours of sleep at a particular place. The whole 24
hours and seven days a week of someone&#146;s existence would be
controlled without evidence presented to justify it. Is that what the
Minister is
saying?</div><a name="0902278000105"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902278000557"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> No, I am not saying that. Let me give some
evidence of what Birmingham was able to do with the use of injunctions
that it was not able to do with its existing powers. Birmingham
obtained about 30 injunctions between August and the end of December
2007, with a co-ordinated approach, intensive policing, deployment of a
mediation service and so on. I accept that cause and effect may not
have been the sole reason&#151;it may not have been just the use of
injunctions that brought these changes about. There may have been other
factors but it is still pretty stark. In the Handsworth, Lozells, and
Newtown area of the city, the number of robberies in the four months
prior to the injunctions averaged 55 per month, compared
with 33 per month while injunctions were in place. After injunctions
were removed, the figure rose again to 48. In the Aston and Nechells
area, there was an average of 11 firearms incidents in the four months
preceding the orders, compared with four for the period in which the
orders were in place. After the court judgment, the figure rose to nine
in March. In the city centre, firearms usage dropped from eight
incidents in July 2007 to one in September 2007. After injunctions were
removed, there was a rise to a peak of nine incidents in May
2008.</div><a name="0902278000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">Chief
Superintendent Paul Scarrott, who is in charge of the basic command
unit where most of the gang-related activity is focused, went on record
to attest to the value of
injunctions:</div><a name="0902278000495"></a><div class="hs_brev">The
influence injunctions have on an individual gang member&#146;s
behaviour and the gang as a whole is substantial. Many have expressed
their fear of having prohibitions placed on their activities 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column591" />Column number: 591</div>and the degree of disruption to their established methods of operation.
Both the exclusion and non-association clauses of the injunctions were
instrumental in limiting and controlling their criminal
activity.&#148;</div><a name="0902278000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
figures are astonishing. If they could be replicated through the use of
injunctions across the rest of the country, I do not think there would
be a community that would object, saying the injunctions are an
infringement of civil liberties and the judicial practice of this
country. People would see reductions in harm, firearms, threats and
intimidation while their human rights would be enhanced, such as their
ability to go out at night and wander about their community without
being threatened or terrorised. They would not be saying this is a
difficult debate about injunctions; they would be saying to Parliament,
&#147;Get on with
it!&#148;</div><a name="0902278000491"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent"><b class="B"><a name="0902278000558"></a>Paul
Holmes:</b> I see the point the Minister is making. I could
give an example from about 10 years ago, before I was an MP, when there
was a series of car break-ins on the street where I live in
Chesterfield. In the course of a week, there were about seven, and my
car was broken into on Monday and on Friday. The police knew who was
doing it&#151;he had just come out of prison and was living in a
hostel about two streets away. They could, in theory, have locked him
up and thrown away the key, but they have to have evidence before they
take action. In many cases, the police could intern the usual
suspects&#151;we would get some innocent ones, but we would also get
some guilty ones and depress the criminal figures. Surely, though, the
police have to have some evidence.</div>
<a name="0902278000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">Internment in
Northern Ireland was a disaster, because many extraneous and innocent
people were interned. The logic of the Minister&#146;s argument is
that if the police suspect that 20, 30 or 40 people are at the core of
it, they will slap injunctions on them. If the police are saying,
&#147;24 hours later this is where you must be&#148;, that is
almost a form of internment. Surely, there has to be some level of
acceptable evidence before they can do that. What is that
level?</div><a name="0902278000109"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902278000559"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman has made a
comparison with internment. I am sure that, on reflection, he will
think that that is not quite the case. I understand the point he is
making&#151;and I will answer the point about evidence in a
moment&#151;but with internment, people were rounded up and put in
places such as Long Kesh just on the basis of intelligence with no
judicial oversight. With respect to the hon. Gentleman, he might, on
reflection, think that that is not the best
analogy.</div><a name="0902278000110"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902278000560"></a>Paul
Holmes:</b> I gave two examples. Internment was one example
where, on no evidence other than police suspicion or very flimsy
evidence&#151;sometimes 30 years out of date&#151;they rounded up
the usual suspects. I gave the example of the police in Chesterfield
and a spate of car thefts 10 years ago in my street. The police said
that they knew who was doing it, but they did not have the evidence.
However, the principle is the level of evidence required, and the
Minister has just said that there would have to be some evidence for an
injunction. What is the acceptable level of evidence? The whole point
of the provisions is to drop that level dramatically from a criminal
standard to a civil standard and that is a very serious point. What is
the level of evidence, other than the suspicion of the council or the
police, to say that these are the guilty
people?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column592" />Column number: 592</div><a name="0902278000111"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902278000561"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> As the hon. Gentleman knows, with respect to the
two conditions, the evidence is the balance of probability, which is
the civil standard. Since we are now quoting case law, I will quote
another case back at him, but there are two conditions, one of which is
the balance of probability. It is not just a case of police officers
saying that&#151;the judgment has to be made by a court. Once it is
granted by the court, there is an opportunity of appeal to the High
Court, as there always is. If the order is granted, the ability to vary
the order, or to have it discharged, remains available both to the
respondent and to the applicant.</div>
<a name="0902278000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
important to look at the ASBO-civil order comparison. If someone
receives an ASBO and it is breached, it is a criminal offence. It is
not a criminal offence to breach a civil order&#151;it is still a
civil offence tried in a civil court and, significantly, there is no
criminal record, because it is a civil offence. There is therefore a
significant difference. As for the standard of proof, the breach has to
be to the criminal standard&#151;beyond reasonable doubt. There are
two conditions: a preventive civil order&#151;I know the hon. Member
for Chesterfield does not agree with that, but that is the argument
that we make&#151;and the balance of probability. However, we
recognise the seriousness the situation if there is a breach, even
though that is not a criminal offence, by moving to the standard of
proof, which is &#147;beyond reasonable
doubt&#148;.</div>
<a name="0902278000113"></a>

<a name="0902278000114"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902278000563"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> If the hon. Gentleman is going to quote McCann at
me, I will come back to that in a little
bit.</div><a name="0902278000115"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902278000564"></a>Paul
Holmes:</b> Is there a contradiction in what the Minister has
just said? On the one hand, he says that those are more serious
offences than ASBOs would normally be used for&#151;ASBOs are used
for relatively low-level disorder on the streets and street
corners&#151;because we are talking about serious gangs, crimes and
knifings. The Minister says that the same standards applied to ASBOs
apply here, but to a much more serious situation. If we are making the
comparison with ASBOs, the Minister should explain why we need these
new clauses and injunctions, with a different set of evidence criteria.
Why are we not using the existing legislation, as the Court of Appeal
says that all the existing legislation on ASBOs is more than adequate
to deal with this matter? It said that it was convinced that that
legislation was perfectly adequate.</div>
<a name="0902278000116"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902278000565"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> I will come on to the issue of the standard of
proof. There is clearly a difference of opinion. I will not read out
the Birmingham statistics again, but all the powers to which the hon.
Gentleman referred, including ASBOs, were available to the police, to
the council in Birmingham and to others. However, when they used the
power of injunction, there was a dramatic change.</div>
<a name="0902278000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">I often say
this, and it is not meant as a disrespectful point to the hon. Member
for Hornchurch or anyone else, but if the hon. Gentleman was in my
shoes and he was presented with that evidence on that particular public
policy, he would see that it was an innovative and exciting initiative
by Birmingham city council. It had an effect, and I think that it would
have a pretty good effect on the rest of the country. It would save
lives, and it would prevent people from getting into trouble in the
first place.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column593" />Column number: 593</div><a name="0902278000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have tried to include judicial oversight in this measure, which is why
I took exception to the reference to internment. All the way through
the Bill&#151;not just in these provisions but in every
clause&#151;I have tried to ensure that there is judicial oversight.
There is sometimes an argument about what the level of that oversight
should be. However, I am very conscious of the need for judicial
oversight and of the whole human rights debate; I try to include an
awareness of those issues in everything that we do. Nevertheless, the
change in Birmingham was dramatic. There are people walking the streets
of Birmingham now who would either be dead or in prison but for the use
of that injunction.</div>
<a name="0902278000119"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0902278000566"></a><b class="B">Ms
Sally Keeble</b> (Northampton, North) (Lab): Does my hon.
Friend agree that, in this instance, what he is doing is identifying
non-criminal behaviour to identify patterns of behaviour that might
lead to serious violence, whereas for the ASBO there is an unacceptable
level of antisocial behaviour already there? It is quite appropriate
that we should have different levels of proof and different processes.
If people engaged in the gang-related violence, they would be
prosecuted for the offence, whether it was a stabbing or
whatever.</div>
<a name="0902278000120"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902278000567"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> My hon. Friend is right to point out that,
essentially, we use the appropriate tool for the particular action that
we see in the community. The ASBOs that were available simply were not
having the impact in Birmingham that the injunctions were having. It is
a sign of my age, but I think that if people saw that we were not going
to use those injunctions, they would say, &#147;I can&#146;t
believe it&#148;. I shall leave it at
that.</div><a name="0902278000121"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902278000568"></a>Paul
Holmes:</b> This is my final last intervention, because
otherwise we will start to go round in circles. I cannot give the exact
quote, because I have given it to the <i class="I">Hansard</i><i class="I"> </i>reporter,
but the Court of Appeal said that the evidence that was presented was
too flimsy to justify an injunction, which has serious
implications.</div>
<a name="0902278000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">Anybody in
authority, such as a teacher&#151;I have been a teacher
myself&#151;or a policeman on the street can always say, &#147;Oh
well, if I could just act outside the law, I could round up anybody, as
I know who the suspects are&#148;. They would always want to push
that, in order to do the job. The point of making the law in Parliament
is to set the boundaries within which that process operates. That is
what we are asking for. If the Court of Appeal felt that the evidence
was too flimsy for such a serious injunction, how does the Minister
defend changing the law to allow that relatively flimsy evidence to
lead to such serious injunctions?</div>
<a name="0902278000123"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902278000569"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> I am not trying to allow flimsy evidence to
justify giving somebody an injunction under this provision and under
the new clauses. I am trying to clarify matters and to give to courts
the power to give an injunction to someone where it is demonstrated to
the satisfaction of a court that they have been involved in
gang-related violence.</div>
<a name="0902278000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman will see that the judgment that he quoted from the Court of
Appeal said that the injunction was being used to tackle antisocial
behaviour, rather than violent behaviour. Antisocial behaviour orders
tackle antisocial behaviour, but injunctions can be used to tackle
violent behaviour. Through the new clauses, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column594" />Column number: 594</div>we are trying to ensure that it is clear that the courts can impose
injunctions on individuals involved in gang-related violence. If the
hon. Gentleman rereads the court judgment on Shafi and Ellis, he will
see that it says that an injunction was used to tackle antisocial
behaviour, not
violence.</div><a name="0902278000517"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.30

sufficient and appropriate? I do not think that the Court was deciding
whether it felt that they were sufficient. As that quote indicates, it
is a matter for Parliament to consider whether the tools&#151;ASBOs,
section 222 injunctions or otherwise&#151;are sufficient to deal with
the problems that, sadly, we face.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902278000571"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> The last two or three contributions have helped to
clarify the matter. Essentially, it is about injunctions being used to
tackle antisocial behaviour, rather then violent behaviour, and the
need for Parliament to make it clear that the courts can impose
injunctions to tackle gang-related violent behaviour, which is why we
introduced the
provision.</div>
<a name="0902278000128"></a><div class="hs_Para"></div><a name="0902278000129"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0902278000572"></a><b class="B">Nadine
Dorries</b> (Mid-Bedfordshire) (Con): Sometimes it is
difficult to understand the situations within which the measure would
be warranted that the police have to deal with. On Monday in Liverpool,
a gang of boys circled the car of a district nurse who was trying to
get into somebody&#146;s house to do a dressing. They all had knives
and made it clear that they were not going to allow her to leave her
car, which they smashed and scratched when she called the police on her
mobile phone. As the hon. Member for Northampton, North said, that
shows a pattern of gang-type behaviour that, next time, could be far
worse. It is difficult for us to say what kind of evidence would
demonstrate when those patterns of gang-related behaviour, which start
at 12 and 13 years old, develop into something more serious.
A measure such as this would stop that in its tracks early
on.</div>
<a name="0902278000130"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902278000573"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> That is helpful. We are giving the courts the
power to impose injunctions where there is gang-related violence. I
shall come back to under-18s, but I want to move on to general points
and put something specific on the record.</div>
<a name="0902278000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have said to
the hon. Member for Hornchurch, but would like to reiterate for the
hon. Member for Chesterfield, that there is an issue with the
definition of gangs, and I will reflect on that to see whether we can
properly incorporate one into the Bill, if possible. There are
different definitions. Manchester defines gangs
as</div><a name="0902278000497"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
group of three or more people who have a distinct identity...and
commit general criminal and anti-social behaviour as part of that
identity. This group uses (or is reasonably suspected of using)
firearms, or the threat of firearms&#148;.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column595" />Column number: 595</div><a name="0902278000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">The London
definition is:</div>
<a name="0902278000498"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Street
gangs are relatively durable, street-based groups who see themselves
and are seen by others as a group for crime and violence which are
essential to group practice and
solidarity.&#148;</div><a name="0902278000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
was not trying to make a political point but, again, the right hon.
Member for Chingford and Woodford Green (Mr. Duncan Smith)
listed the four conditions that the hon. Member for Hornchurch has put
forward, but said that they all had to be satisfied for that behaviour
to be gang-related, but the hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendment requires
any of those conditions to be met. Clearly, we have to have more in the
Bill about the definition of a gang, but it is not easy. We do not want
it to mean, as, I think, Liberty said, &#147;just a group of
hoodies&#148;&#151;of course not. Violent behaviour and the other
things that we have talked about have to be involved. I will reflect
upon it. I hope that that has answered the general point about
definitions.</div><a name="0902278000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I have said to the hon. Gentleman, although I will not accept his
amendment, I will look at this because I know he is trying to see how
we can deal with that, what sort of definition we come up with and what
we need to put in the Bill. Similarly, I accept that there is need for
broader consultation. I need to see whether there are other people we
should consult too, such as employers.</div>
<a name="0902278000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 24
talks about the code of practice. There is a need to toughen it up. My
hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, North made an important point
about the code of practice. We will need to publish a draft and put it
before Parliament so it can be discussed. The code of practice will be
essential for the operation of these powers. Rather than just being
published by the Secretary of State, it needs greater parliamentary
scrutiny.</div><a name="0902278000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the under-18s point, I am sorry if I am not making myself very clear. I
am not trying to confuse anybody. I am laying out what the situation
is. The injunctions can be used for under-18s, but it is unlikely that
they would be used in practice because they are not enforceable. I take
the point that some people would have an income. The vast majority of
people whom these injunctions are designed to catch may have a source
of income, but it is not likely to be legitimate. A court would have to
take that into account. The breach would be a contempt of court because
it is a civil offence. It is not possible to send anyone who is under
18 to prison or a youth offender institution for a civil contempt of
court, so there is no enforceability of the injunction.</div>
<a name="0902278000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">What I have
said&#151;and nobody, including the hon. Member for Chesterfield,
disagreed&#151;is that the public will point to the 13, 14 or
15-year-olds who are out there. The hon. Member for Mid-Bedfordshire
described how her constituent was surrounded by kids with knives. I do
not know whether they were 13, 14 or 15. People will point out that the
injunctions are about trying to tackle serious gun-related violence but
do not or are unlikely to apply to under-18s. They will ask what on
earth we are doing when many people of 14, 15 or 16 are
likely to be those to whom such an injunction would apply.</div>
<a name="0902278000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
public policy gap. I have asked my officials to work with other
officials across Government to see whether there is something
proportionate that takes into account all of the legitimate concerns
everybody will have and to try to find a way forward. I have also said
that I will talk to and involve other Members on 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column596" />Column number: 596</div>this because it is so important. I know the difficulty of trying to get
it through. Without some sort of consensus it will not go through
Parliament. That will leave us with the situation where the public will
ask why we are not dealing with some of the most serious violent
individuals in our communities. That is all that I have said. I do not
know what the answer will be, but it would be remiss and an abrogation
of my responsibility to say that I will not even try to look at it when
I know it is a
problem.</div><a name="0902278000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
know that this will create problems. I know that all sorts of issues
will arise from it. But that is the price that has to be paid for
trying to do the right thing. That is what I will do. Whether it is
possible, I do not know. But that is what I will do. In the end, if we
can deliver something for under-18s, it will save lives and it will
prevent harm in communities.</div>
<a name="0902278000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was asked
whether these injunctions would stand alone or be alongside criminal
convictions. These are stand-alone injunctions. They cannot be imposed
upon conviction. Our preference is always to engage the criminal
justice system where there is sufficient evidence of a criminal
offence. That is why these injunctions are not punitive. They are
imposed as a sanction for bad behaviour. They are imposed as a
preventive measure to prevent gang-related violence. As I have said,
the injunctions will not be imposed to punish someone for what they
have done, but to prevent future gang-related violence. That is why the
two stages of the injunction test are distinct. Past behaviour must be
proved, but that is not enough for a court to grant the injunction. If
the court is not satisfied that an injunction is necessary to prevent
gang-related violence, an injunction will not be granted,
notwithstanding any past behaviour. For that reason, we can confidently
say that the injunctions are preventive
measures.</div><a name="0902278000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Chesterfield mentioned the House of Lords&#146;
decision in McCann, in which it said that an enhanced civil standard of
proof akin to the criminal standard should apply when granting an ASBO.
He will also know of when, in the case of re. B&#151;a
child&#151;that House considered the question of the sliding scale of
the standard of proof. The ruling was clear that there is only one
civil standard of proof&#151;the balance of probabilities. That is
the standard for the injunctions, as new clause 11 makes clear. These
injunctions are civil tools made in the civil courts, and breach of
them is contempt of
court.</div><a name="0902278000142"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902278000574"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> If I understand correctly, the Minister seeks
to distinguish the orders from the McCann judgment, which I think was
my point to him when asking if that was his intention. If he reflects
on the Shafi and Ellis decision, he will note that the court suggested
that the McCann standard would be applicable in those sorts of
injunctions. I wish, therefore, to understand what he is saying about
these orders. Does he see the standard here as purely the balance of
probabilities, and not the sliding scale that could equate to the
criminal standard as was suggested in McCann in relation to ASBOs, and
which seemed to be extended to section 222 injunctions in
the context of the judgment that gave rise to this
proposal?</div><a name="0902278000143"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902278000575"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> Yes, we do see the standard here as consistent
with the civil standard of the balance of probabilities and as distinct
from the McCann judgment. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column597" />Column number: 597</div>A breach of an ASBO is a criminal offence. There are all sorts of
problems with ASBOs, for example they are initially imposed for two
years with no variation or discharge possible. The balance of
probabilities is the appropriate standard of proof
here.</div><a name="0902278000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the duration of conditions, it is right to say that the requirements
and prohibitions that can be attached to an injunction can last until
further order of the court, rather than until a specified date, but it
is unlikely that the courts will grant an order with indefinite
conditions without setting a review hearing. The guidance will also
encourage the setting of review hearings for longer or indefinite
injunctions. Also, the respondent can apply to vary or discharge any
part or all of the
injunction.</div><a name="0902278000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">Injunctions
are not a criminal sanction; they are a civil tool to prevent
gang-related violence. We do not wish to criminalise respondents for
breach of an injunction and that is why there is no such criminal
offence. That is a clear difference from
ASBOs.</div><a name="0902278000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">An
injunction can be imposed if that is necessary to protect the
respondent from gang-related violence. Victims quickly become
perpetrators and vice versa, particularly in retaliation attacks. In
most cases, gang violence occurs between rival gang members. A person
subject to an injunction would be a known gang member who had
committed, encouraged or assisted gang violence. This provision focuses
on the fact that in some cases a gang member is known to be putting
themselves at risk of a reprisal attack. The hon. Member for Hornchurch
made that point. That is why we have the reference to the protection of
the individual; we are almost trying to protect them from themselves. I
will give an actual example. A young man was known to be the target of
a gang attack. He was warned of that, but insisted on continuing to
enter the area in which he was going to be attacked. In such a
scenario, we would want to prevent the gang-related violence, not just
because of the individual respondent who is at risk both of committing
violence and being the victim of violence in the event of a
confrontation, but because of the risk to innocent bystanders who all
too often are unwittingly caught up in fatal attacks by being in the
wrong place at the wrong time. We therefore feel it necessary to have
that option. The injunction is likely to be needed to prevent the
respondent from engaging, assisting or facilitating gang-related
violence, and from being a victim of such violence. The two go hand in
hand.</div><a name="0902278000518"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902278000576"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I do not know whether the Minister would care
to comment, but some police officers to whom I have spoken have
indicated that, in reprisal situations, the alternate gang will
sometimes seek to attack almost indiscriminately in the area around
which a particular gang member may reside or is seen. Am I therefore
correct in understanding that, in essence, the injunction will not only
protect the individual subject to it from harm, but will also equally
protect those around them who may innocently fall victim to an
appalling crime simply by being in the wrong place at the wrong
time?</div><a name="0902278000148"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902278000577"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> That is a reasonable point. The point of the
injunction is to protect the individual from themselves, as it were,
but, as a by-product of that, it may well end 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column598" />Column number: 598</div>up protecting innocent people in a community who find themselves caught
up in a gang-related attack. As the hon. Gentleman said, when people
seek retaliation or revenge in an area, innocent people might be
affected, so the injunction, while protecting the individual, may have
the benefit of protecting innocent people in the community, or on a
street, as a
consequence.</div><a name="0902278000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
should also, by way of conclusion, refer to new clause 9, which relates
to the end of the Bill. I would like to put it on record that it is the
Government&#146;s intention basically to accept new clause 9, but we
would like it to be withdrawn, because we need to redraft it
appropriately. It is our intention to reinstate it on Report, which
will be of interest to the hon. Members for Hornchurch and for Bury St.
Edmunds, as well as the hon. Member for Mole Valley (Sir Paul
Beresford) who is actually responsible for much of
it.</div><a name="0902278000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have had a good debate, and I have no further comments. If the
provisions are successful in relation to over-18s, and we can find a
way forward in relation to under-18s, we will significantly enhance
safety on our streets. Furthermore, we will protect people who would
otherwise be killed, prevent others from the effects of serious
gang-related violence and prevent some individuals from ending up in
prison on long-term sentences. I thank the Committee for today&#146;s
debate.</div><a name="0902278000151"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment

C</b><b class="B">ampbell</b><b class="B">:</b> The purpose of new clause 33 is to
provide for regulations to be made to enable the Government to respond
to the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in the case of S
and Marper. The Court found that the existing policy under part V of
the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 was in breach of the right to
respect for private life in article 8 of the European convention on
human rights. The Court held that the blanket nature of the powers to
retain DNA samples and fingerprints of people who were arrested but
have not been found guilty of an offence or against whom no further
action was taken, failed to strike a fair balance between the competing
public and private interests and therefore constituted a
disproportionate interference with the article 8
right.</div>
<a name="0902278000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">We robustly
defended the S and Marper case at all stages of our domestic courts and
we were strongly of the belief that what we had introduced with the
consent of Parliament was an effective and proportionate approach to
help tackle crime and bring offenders to justice. We know from research
between May 2001 and 31 December 2005 that there were approximately
200,000 DNA profiles on the national DNA database, which would
previously have had to be removed&#151;before legislation was passed
in 2001&#151;because the person was acquitted or charges
dropped.</div>
<a name="0902278000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of those
200,000 profiles, approximately 8,500 from some 6,290 individuals have
been linked with crime scene profiles, involving nearly 14,000
offences. These include 114 murders, 55 attempted murders, 116 rapes,
68 sexual offences, 119 aggravated burglaries and 127
offences of supplying controlled drugs. Therefore, as that approach was
a major contribution to the identification and detection of offenders,
we are understandably disappointed in the judgment of the European
Court of Human Rights.</div>
<a name="0902278000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">Technological
developments and, in particular, the use of DNA in investigations has
been one of the breakthroughs for modern policing in which we have led
the world. It has led not only to convictions for serious crimes, but
to the exoneration of the innocent. Moreover, it is not unreasonable to
assume that many people whose DNA was on the database may have been
deterred from committing crimes because they knew that detection was
inevitable. We continue to believe that DNA and fingerprints play an
invaluable role in fighting crime, and will now carefully consider how
best to give effect to the Court&#146;s findings.</div>
<a name="0902278000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">Part of that
process lies in informing the Council of Europe&#146;s Committee of
Ministers of progress and of final proposals for implementing the
decision. A second and key part lies in ensuring that sufficient public
debate takes place on whatever we propose and how it is implemented.
The judgment recognised the level of public interest in and, indeed,
public disquiet with the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column611" />Column number: 611</div>current retention policy. That is why we intend to publish a public
consultation paper before the summer with proposals on retention and
future governance in this important area.</div>
<a name="0902278000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">We recognise
that some people who are currently on the DNA and fingerprint databases
and who have been arrested but not convicted may feel frustrated that
their samples are not being destroyed in the light of the European
Court judgment. As the Committee will be aware, the existing law stands
until such time as it is changed or amended by the United Kingdom
Parliament. The contents of this enabling clause are drafted to allow
for a retention and destruction framework to be put in place to ensure
compliance with the European Court judgment within a reasonable time,
and for such regulations to be subject to consideration by both
Houses.</div>
<a name="0902278000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">In her speech
to the Intellect Technology Association on 16 December 2008, my right
hon. Friend the Home Secretary said that the public expect us to make
use of technology to protect them, and that people instinctively
understand that these technologies, used properly, are vital tools
against crime, terrorism and illegal immigration. But she also
recognised the absolute necessity of getting the balance on privacy
right, and that there is more we can do to strengthen the dividing line
between guilt and innocence. For those who have committed a serious
offence, our retention policies need to be as tough as possible, but
for others, including children, there is scope to introduce a more
flexible approach.</div>
<a name="0902278000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">We intend to
consult on bringing greater flexibility and fairness into the system by
stepping down some individuals over time by using a differentiated
approach, possibly based on age, or on risk, or on the nature of the
offences involved. We will also re-examine retention arrangements for
samples. We have informed the Committee of Ministers of our intention
to consult and of compliance to date with the judgment in respect of
the relevant samples of S and Marper, as well as the payment of costs
and expenses. The information will be considered by that Committee at
its next meeting on 19 March.</div>
<a name="0902278000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope Members
of this Committee will recognise that we are committed to implementing
the judgment. There are significant policing operational issues
involved in complying with the judgment, but at the core is the need to
ensure a proportionate level of public protection. This is an important
issue, which is why the approach that we are proposing focuses on open
public debate and parliamentary
consideration.</div><a name="0902278000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
purpose of new clause 34 is to ensure that regulations, which will be
equivalent to those provided for in new clause 33, can be made in
respect of material obtained by the service police in each of the armed
forces. Section 113 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 allows
the Secretary of State to apply any of the provisions in part 5 of the
Act to the armed forces, subject to any modifications that he considers
necessary in order to cater for the different procedures under which
the armed forces operate.</div>
<a name="0902278000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">Part 5 of the
Police and Criminal Evidence Act is already applied to the armed forces
by means of a statutory instrument made under section 113.
Section 113, therefore, needs to be amended to allow
regulations to be made for the armed forces which will be closely based
on the regulations provided for in new clause 33. Biometric data
obtained by the service police in each of the armed forces will
therefore be treated in the same 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column612" />Column number: 612</div>way as biometric data obtained by civilian police forces, subject to the
different circumstances in which the service police conduct
investigations. This will ensure that the UK&#146;s response to the S
and Marper judgment in the European Court of Human Rights is
comprehensive.</div>
<a name="0902278000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purpose of
new clause 35 is to ensure that regulations, which will be equivalent
to those provided for in new clause 33, can be made in respect of
material obtained by the Police Service of Northern Ireland. The regime
governing the retention and destruction of samples in Northern Ireland
is contained within the Police and Criminal Evidence (Northern Ireland)
Order 1989 and the amendment makes provision for similar regulations to
those provided for in new clause 33. This will ensure that the
UK&#146;s response to the S and Marper judgment in the European Court
of Human Rights is
comprehensive.</div><a name="0902278000193"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902278000581"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> The Opposition have consistently called for a
full debate on the DNA database, so I welcome the opportunity to
consider some of the issues in the context of the new clauses proposed
by the Government. I regret that our consideration is necessarily so
partial and focused on whether we should give authority to the Home
Secretary to make regulations governing the retention and destruction
of DNA, fingerprint, photographic, CCTV and other records. If we grant
the proposal, it would prevent and frustrate the very parliamentary
debate that we have been seeking, allowing all MPs to contribute. The
Minister for Security, Counter-Terrorism, Crime and Policing said in
his letter to the Committee that the means would be the affirmative
resolution procedure.</div>
<a name="0902278000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before I
develop the detail of the argument surrounding the proposals, I want to
start with one point of agreement with the Minister. We agree that the
use of DNA samples can be an important evidential tool in prosecuting
and bringing crimes to justice. We are all aware of cases where DNA
data have formed an important part of the case to prove guilt and
ensure that serious criminals have been put behind bars, where they
belong. The fight against crime, in particular organised crime and
terrorism, depends on the use of modern scientific techniques of
investigation and identification.</div>
<a name="0902278000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, the
status of DNA needs to be considered carefully. As the European Court
of Human Rights noted:</div>
<a name="0902278000499"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
retention of cellular samples is particularly intrusive given the
wealth of genetic and health information contained
therein.&#148;</div>
<a name="0902278000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">The use of that
technology must strike the right balance between the promotion of the
wider public interest and public safety, and the protection of
important private life interests, which is central to the debate and
the Government&#146;s proposals.</div>
<a name="0902278000519"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2
pm</div><a name="0902278000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
UK&#146;s DNA database is the largest in the world, containing
approximately 4.3 million profiles, which accounts for around 5.2 per
cent. of the UK population. The Government argue, as did the Minister,
that this country claims a pioneering role in the utilisation of DNA
technology, but in doing so it bears a special responsibility to ensure
that it strikes the right balance on what is permissible in the
potential interference in private life.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column613" />Column number: 613</div><a name="0902278000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">The central
question that the new clause seeks to address, although without
spelling out the solution, is the extent to which the Government should
retain DNA and other data on people who have been suspected of
committing a criminal offence but who have never been charged or have
been acquitted. Under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, as
amended by the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001, fingerprints and
samples, including DNA samples, can be taken from anyone arrested for a
recordable offence and detained in a police station. However, the Home
Office has confirmed that 1.1 million people on the database have never
been convicted, cautioned or even formally warned or reprimanded, as
recorded by the police national computer.</div>
<a name="0902278000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">GeneWatch has
calculated that there are records of 100,000 innocent children on the
database, and the records of 521,901 under-16-year-olds have been added
to the database since 1996. The database contains the records of around
40 per cent. of black men in the UK, compared with 13 per cent. of
Asian men and just 9 per cent. of white men. As the Minister will be
aware, one of the issues that the Court highlighted was the potentially
disproportionate impact that the operation of the database has on young
children and people from minority ethnic communities, which needs to be
considered carefully in the context of the debate on what is
proportionate and
reasonable.</div><a name="0902278000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall move on to the details of the case of S and Marper shortly, but I
would like to read out a paragraph from the Court&#146;s judgment
that puts a disturbing gloss on the Government&#146;s view of DNA
data and, by extension, the potential use of the powers that they seek
under the new clauses. Paragraph 123 of the judgment
states:</div><a name="0902278000500"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Government argue that the power of retention applies to all
fingerprints and samples taken from a person in connection with the
investigation of an offence and does not depend on innocence or guilt.
It is further submitted that the fingerprints and samples have been
lawfully taken and that their retention is not related to the fact that
they were originally suspected of committing a crime, the sole reason
for their retention being to increase the size and, therefore, the use
of the database in the identification of offenders in the
future.&#148;</div><a name="0902278000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the Court has accurately stated the Government&#146;s policy
position, which is what we need to be clear about, it is in essence
saying that there is a simple primary policy intention to grow the
database, and that even suspicion of guilt is not regarded as a
triggering factor. That might not be reflected in the current law and
seems to have been a policy statement that the Court has highlighted
from the evidence that it was given in the course of its
considerations, but it is a significant point to consider when the
Government tell us that we should rely on their
assurances.</div>
<a name="0902278000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">We need to
understand clearly the Government&#146;s stand on that, so will the
Minister confirm that they argued their case on that basis and that the
natural extension of that line of logic is that everyone is a potential
suspect? Is it now the case that one is innocent until proven guilty in
the eyes of the criminal law, but always potentially guilty in the eyes
of the DNA database? I base those points in all seriousness on that
paragraph in the Court&#146;s judgment and am not seeking to make a
pejorative or debating point. I am simple reading from the Court
judgment and interpreting from it what seems to be an intention that
was argued at the Court, because it is pretty fundamental in
understanding where the Government are coming from. If that is the
case, how 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column614" />Column number: 614</div>can we trust the Government to look after our liberties, as the measures
imply that we would seek to do, if their fundamental stating point is
that there do not necessarily need to be grounds of suspicion for
obtaining information in the first
place?</div><a name="0902278000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
that context, I wholeheartedly agree with recommendations I and J in
the first annual report of the ethics group on the national DNA
database, which was published on 21 July 2008. Recommendation I
states:</div>
<a name="0902278000501"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Consideration
should be given to further public clarification of the role of the
NDNAD and reinforcement of the message that it is intended only to be
used for criminal
intelligence.&#148;</div><a name="0902278000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">Recommendation
J
states:</div><a name="0902278000502"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Consideration
should be given to formally announcing publicly that the NDNAD will
only be used for the currently described purposes (i.e. criminal
intelligence) and will never transform into a repository for the whole
nation&#146;s DNA
characteristics.&#148;</div><a name="0902278000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will
the Minister indicate whether the Home Department agrees with those
recommendations so that we can gain a better understanding of the
Government&#146;s likely approach in the context of the order-making
powers that it seeks in the new
clause?</div><a name="0902278000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
ethics group also raised questions about DNA samples given by the
public voluntarily. Will the Minister confirm how many DNA samples on
the national DNA database have been given voluntarily? Will he also
confirm that the intended White Paper, which the order-making power
under the new clauses is intended to implement, will address the scope
of use of those samples, and the retention and process for destruction
of volunteered samples? The ethics committee suggested, in various
recommendations, that further clarification is needed. While I accept
that the law on obtaining samples suggests that there is an automatic
requirement of destruction, the fact that the ethics committee raises
such a number of recommendations about volunteered DNA data clearly
suggests that it has some concerns.</div>
<a name="0902278000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the
Minister also confirm whether the Government have any intention to
extend the authority required to take DNA samples in cases of
non-notifiable offences, as was suggested at one point? In other words,
will they extend the existing authority to take DNA samples when there
is a notifiable offence to non-notifiable offences as well, which could
lower the authority to minor offences?</div>
<a name="0902278000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have long
argued for the need to ensure that the police can retrospectively take
samples for a longer period after conviction and from those convicted
overseas, so we are glad that the Government have responded positively
to that call. Will the Minister confirm that that will also form part
of the White Paper, together with the removal of profiles for children
under 10?</div>
<a name="0902278000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">The official
Opposition believe that there should be an established procedure to
allow a person to request a statement on what information, relating to
fingerprints and samples, is being held on either them or a dependant.
We think that there should be a procedure by which a person can request
that such information held on them or a dependant is destroyed, and
that the circumstances in which such a request might be refused should
be set out. Will the Minister indicate whether he envisages the White
Paper encompassing issues of that nature and, by extension, the
application to familial links? DNA might not necessarily simply
indicate one individual, as a sibling&#146;s DNA might have similar
characteristics. Some 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column615" />Column number: 615</div>of the concerns attached to the debate relate to whether DNA can be
identified. It can, in part, be matched to one&#146;s own DNA, but it
is the familial link that applies, and a close relation might be
actually
indicated.</div><a name="0902278000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
his letter to the members of the Committee explaining why the
Government were bringing forward those new clauses, the Minister for
Security, Counter-Terrorism, Crime and Policing rightly said that their
actions had been necessitated by the judgment of the European Court of
Human Rights in the case of S and Marper. I welcome his statement, and
the comments of the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department,
the hon. Member for Tynemouth, that the Government are committed to its
implementation as soon as possible. In that landmark judgment, the
Court held that there had been a violation of article 8 of the European
convention on human rights. The Lord Chancellor, in his response to the
Court ruling, was right to highlight paragraph 119 of that
judgment. That is important&#151;I hope that you will allow me to put
it on record in the context of the debate, Mr.
Bayley&#151;as it informs the framework that the Government need to
work to with regard to the power that they are now seeking under the
new
clause.</div><a name="0902278000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the issue of proportionality and the fair balance between competing
public and private interests, the Court
said:</div><a name="0902278000503"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
this respect, the Court is struck by the blanket and indiscriminate
nature of the power of retention in England and Wales. The material may
be retained irrespective of the nature or gravity of the offence with
which the individual was originally suspected or of the age of the
suspected offender; fingerprints and samples may be taken&#151;and
retained&#151;from a person of any age, arrested in connection with a
recordable offence, which includes minor or non-imprisonable offences.
The retention is not time-limited; the material is retained
indefinitely whatever the nature or seriousness of the offence of which
the person was suspected. Moreover, there exist only limited
possibilities for an acquitted individual to have the data removed from
the nationwide database or the materials destroyed ...; in particular,
there is no provision for independent review of the justification for
the retention according to defined criteria, including such factors as
the seriousness of the offence, previous arrests, the strength of the
suspicion against the person and any other special
circumstances.&#148;</div><a name="0902278000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
apologise for reading out that somewhat lengthy extract, but it really
goes to the heart of what we are considering. As I said, the Lord
Chancellor rightly drew attention to it, and it is important in
understanding where we are all coming from. That very paragraph sets
out some of the benchmarks and indicators that we would certainly
expect to see in the detailed proposals that the Government are yet to
publish in their formal response to the particular court
case.</div>
<a name="0902278000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, given
what the Court said, I must say, with respect, that I think that the
Minister for Security, Counter-Terrorism, Crime and Policing may have
slightly missed the point in his letter to the Committee&#151;indeed,
the Under-Secretary of State might have done so too in his opening
remarks&#151;when he suggested that the Court recognised that the
retention of biometric data could be
retained</div><a name="0902278000504"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;on
consideration of the individual
circumstances.&#148;</div><a name="0902278000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Court judgment goes much deeper than saying, as that quote from the
Minister suggests, that it is a case of individual review of individual
circumstances. What the Court is saying goes to the
structure&#151;the fundamental protections and reviews&#151;that
exists, rather than saying that, in some way, this could be dealt with
by means of case-by-case consideration.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column616" />Column number: 616</div><a name="0902278000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Court was
very clear, and in many ways it was very critical. Whatever the
Government or we may think about whether the Court was right, we have
the judgment. It highlighted very clearly that England and
Wales&#151;treated as one country&#151;is the only country in
Europe adopting these procedures. Scotland has a different procedure,
and I note that an amendment tabled by the hon. Member for
Chesterfield, although not selected, alluded in some ways to the
Scottish situation. There is a different standard in Scotland than in
England and Wales. Effectively, DNA data are not retained when someone
has been acquitted. The data can be retained for three years if there
was a violent offence or a case involving a sexual offence, and that
period can be extended to five years, but in other circumstances, the
DNA data cannot be retained if there has been an acquittal or if no
charges were brought. Therefore, even in this country&#151;I use that
word to mean the United Kingdom as a whole&#151;the approaches in
England and Wales and in Scotland differ. Consequently, what the Court
said about the current system and situation that we have in this
country went quite deep.</div>
<a name="0902278000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is why we
believe that it is right that the DNA database as a whole is put on a
formal statutory footing. That goes further than simply having a power
of regulation in respect of the Home Secretary saying what the
retention and destruction issues should be. In this context, we need a
more fundamental statement about the DNA database itself. In our view,
at this stage, it is not acceptable simply to give what amounts to
almost blank-cheque authorisation under the new clauses on the basis of
the White Paper that the Under-Secretary says will be forthcoming at
some stage before the
summer.</div><a name="0902278000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
agree with the Minister for Security, Counter-Terrorism, Crime and
Policing and the Under-Secretary about the importance of this debate. I
know that the Under-Secretary said that there was considerable public
interest and public concern, and that the Minister for Security,
Counter-Terrorism, Crime and Policing said in his
letter:</div><a name="0902278000505"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This
is an area of significant importance which impacts on public protection
and
confidence.&#148;</div><a name="0902278000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
gains even more significance when we consider the potential ambit of
data sharing among parties. That is the subject of debate on the
Coroners and Justice Bill, in which a power is being sought to share
data among relevant bodies in an unspecified manner at the
authorisation of the Secretary of State&#151;the Secretary of State
for Justice in that case. Therefore, when setting the boundaries for
data retention, there should be consideration of whether, and to what
extent, those data will be shared in a wider format. I appreciate that
that is a debate for another Committee on another Bill, but it gives
context to discussions about the DNA database and the retention and
sharing of that information with third parties. Potentially, this goes
wider than the domestic
setting.</div><a name="0902278000520"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.15
pm</div><a name="0902278000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
12 June 2007, UK Ministers attending the European Union Justice and
Home Affairs Council backed a plan to extend the Prum treaty to the
whole of the EU. Can the Minister confirm that that means that all EU
member states will have automatic access to Britain&#146;s DNA
database? Is that the direction of travel? To better assess what is and
is not appropriate in the retention and destruction of data held on
that database, it is important 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column617" />Column number: 617</div>to understand the significance of the DNA database and what it may be
used for in a domestic and, potentially, pan-European setting. It is
fundamentally important to understand where we are going with this
measure.</div><a name="0902278000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given
the significance and importance of the topic, why is it being swept
under the affirmative resolution procedure? With that procedure, I
assume that it will not be possible to amend the regulations and we
will only have an hour and a half of debate in Committee on these
fundamental issues. There are serious issues of public confidence, as
Ministers have identified. The other place almost has a convention of
not rejecting secondary legislation. I have serious concerns about how
the issue is being approached. The irony is that we may have a longer
debate in this Committee on the order-making power than will
be permissible on the substantive issues of the retention of DNA and
the fundamentals that
apply.</div><a name="0902278000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister has said that he wants a debate but the impression is that,
rather than promoting debate, the Government do not want it. Instead,
they want to deny the debate that would allow all hon. Members the
opportunity to consider the proposals in detail and to make amendments
if required. It will be interesting to see how the Government put
forward the changes that they propose in the light of the Court
judgment. I assure the Minister that we will work constructively with
him on this because we recognise its importance and significance, as he
does.</div>
<a name="0902278000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">Simply to
present a set of regulations and, in essence, say, &#147;Take it or
leave it&#148; will not allow the necessary scrutiny, debate and
consideration that the issue rightfully demands. Even in seeking the
power, the Government cannot give us any indication of their
intentions. As the Minister
says:</div><a name="0902278000506"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
are not in a position at this stage to produce detailed
proposals&#148;.</div><a name="0902278000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
they make that admission, how can they expect the Committee or the
House to give an authorisation without any idea of how such authority
would be used?</div>
<a name="0902278000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">I appreciate
that issues with the parliamentary timetable are often used as
justification for the argument, &#147;Well, we have a Bill before us
now and we should use this opportunity as it may be the only primary
legislation that we get.&#148; That does not wash. The issue demands
primary legislation that can be properly scrutinised and examined, in
detail, line by line to ensure that appropriate protections are
provided.</div>
<a name="0902278000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Constitution Committee in the other place, in its recent report,
&#147;Surveillance: Citizens and the State&#148;
recommended:</div><a name="0902278000507"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Government should introduce a Bill to replace the existing regulatory
framework governing the NDNAD. This would provide an opportunity to
reassess the length of time DNA profiles are retained and the
regulatory oversight of the NDNAD.&#148;</div>
<a name="0902278000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">We agree. The use,
retention and destruction of DNA records and the oversight that sits
behind that require detailed primary legislation in their own right,
with full and detailed debate and examination in Parliament of the
proposals that the Government bring forward by all Members of
Parliament. I can assure the Minister that if he does so Her
Majesty&#146;s Opposition will work with the Government in a
constructive way in the public interest. The issues at stake are too
serious to do otherwise.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column618" />Column number: 618</div><a name="0902278000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">&#147;Trust
me&#148; was a phrase frequently used by the former Prime Minister
Tony Blair. That is precisely what the Minister and the Home Secretary
are asking us to do by virtue of this clause&#151;to trust
them&#151;as we would be approving a significant and wide-ranging
authority applicable now and in the future on a promise of the White
Paper and a promise that the Government intend to address the issues
highlighted in the recent European Court of Human Rights case. But the
nature of this subject puts it beyond questions of simple trust of a
particular Minister or even a particular Government. Once the authority
is there it remains in place and can be used in the future by any
future Government too. I appreciate that we cannot bind future
Governments, but we can signpost them. If this is in place it makes a
fundamental departure.</div>
<a name="0902278000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">In making
those comments I am not seeking to impugn the Minister, the Home
Secretary or the Government&#146;s intentions. We have to operate in
a vacuum in this context. We do not know the basic principles,
notwithstanding what may have been set up in the new clause and certain
statements that it could include this, that and the other. The
order-making power encompasses that; but we do not actually
know.</div>
<a name="0902278000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">Surely it
would be more appropriate for us to consider what changes are
appropriate in legislation once we have an indication from the
Government of their intentions. Then we can have that public debate
that the Minister has rightly said is needed and that he wants. We can
have that detailed scrutiny. We can consider what strikes the right
balance between the public interests and the protection of the private
interests that is at the heart of our debate this afternoon.</div>
<a name="0902278000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is why I
say to the Minister in clear and unambiguous terms that the proposal he
has set forward in these new clauses is utterly unacceptable and if the
Government are insistent on taking this approach we will oppose it
tooth and
nail.</div><a name="0902278000231"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902278000582"></a>Paul
Holmes:</b> When we discussed the late entry of the clauses on
gangs I made the point that it was a great shame that they were
introduced at a very late stage. They were not available to be debated
on Second Reading or at the start of our Committee proceedings. They
came in just at the start of the recess week. It has been difficult
therefore to do all the research and to have the full debate that we
need on them. Nevertheless we had a constructive debate and the
Minister said some reassuring things and we made some progress. Those
points have to be made a thousand times more on this
issue.</div><a name="0902278000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">These
new clauses are of crucial importance. They concern the DNA database
which has been a long-running and controversial issue in Parliament,
but they were introduced by the Government last Friday at the end of
recess week. They were made available publicly on Monday of this week.
A number of organisations that would normally respond on something like
this have not had time to get to grips with it. We looked at it and
tabled some amendments, but it was too late for the Tuesday midday
deadline for them to be considered here. On such a major issue that is
completely unacceptable.</div>
<a name="0902278000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not know
what the explanation will be for that very last-minute production of
these new clauses, but I do not think that it will be a very convincing
one. The Minister cannot say that the Government are surprised 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column619" />Column number: 619</div>about this being an issue and by the judgment in the S and
Marper case, or that they are surprised that anyone should regard the
DNA issue as controversial and that it came out of the blue. It has
been argued about a great deal both in and outside Parliament. My hon.
Friend the Member for Cardiff, Central (Jenny Willott) introduced a
ten-minute Bill on precisely that issue in June 2008, which referred to
adopting the model that the Scottish Executive&#151;at that time a
joint Labour and Liberal Democrat one&#151;went down the road of some
two and a half years ago. It is not exactly a new issue that has come
out of the blue. On 4 December we had the European Court of
Human Rights ruling that categorically stated that UK practice was out
of line with that of the rest of Europe, and that it breached the
European convention on human
rights.</div><a name="0902278000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
13 January I received the answer to a question that I had submitted to
the Minister about whether the Secretary of State was considering
introducing proposals on time limits for keeping various types of DNA
sample, and on removal from the national DNA database of profiles of
people who had never been convicted of an offence. According to the
Minister&#146;s answer, much as he said in his opening statement, on
16 December the Secretary of State told the Intellect Technology
Association that the Government were looking at those issues, that
there would be a White Paper and a consultation, and that the
Government would eventually introduce some proposals, which we were
told today would happen by the summer. That is not acceptable, given
how long the argument has been raging, and the amount of time the
Government have known that the issue was coming
along.</div><a name="0902278000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
Friday 20 February the holding clauses were submitted, but we could see
them publicly only from Monday of this week. The Minister made a few
welcome hints about what proposals might arrive&#151;on children, for
example&#151;but they were no more than hints and suggestions. We
will not know what the Government will propose in the measures until
much later in the year. For us not to be able to debate the concrete
substance of what the Government will or will not propose to do is
absolutely unacceptable. It is entirely wrong and unsatisfactory to ask
us to simply give the Government advance permission to introduce
regulations that would not be subject to major debate, vote and
amendment in the House but rather to the affirmative resolution
procedure. That cannot be accepted on such an important and
long-running issue, which the Government have known for a long time to
be
controversial.</div><a name="0902278000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government have grown the biggest database in the world. It has 4
million entries, which is 5 per cent. of the English and Welsh
population, and the Government estimate that by 2010 there will be 4.5
million entries. There are 700,000 children aged under 18 on it, but
many people who were entered on to the database as children will have
now moved into adulthood. A question that I asked on 6 November 2008
produced the information that 98,017 people were under the age of 13,
442,375 were aged between 13 and 15 and 606,098 were between the ages
of 16 and 18 when they were first entered on to the database. Huge
numbers of young people are having personal information intrusively
accumulated, and the European Court has judged that to be unacceptable.
The database is bigger than the one in the USA, even though the USA has
five times our population. That seems remarkable.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column620" />Column number: 620</div><a name="0902278000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
quarter&#151;1 million&#151;of those on the database have no police
record. They were either arrested and never charged, or were charged
but not convicted. Twenty-five per cent. of the people on the database
are innocent in the eyes of the law. They are the people who everyone
has been so concerned about. Two or three years ago, Scotland went down
a different route and decided to remove the bulk of those people, with
some exceptions which we will come to.</div>
<a name="0902278000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">What sort of
people go on to the database? Can we trust it? One example is three
children who built a tree-house in a cherry tree and were arrested.
Children building dens and tree-houses becomes a criminal offence that
gets them on the DNA database for the rest of their lives. That seems
remarkable. Another example is of a fight in a school. The teachers
reported to the police the two people they thought were involved and a
14-year-old boy was wrongly identified by the teachers. DNA was taken
and put on the database and although it was then explained that it was
a case of mistaken identity, the chief constable refused to remove the
DNA.</div>
<a name="0902278000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">These are
examples of people having their DNA put on the database for life, in
the way the Government have accumulated it. What is the logic of that?
The Government argue that the DNA database is very important in
catching criminals and we heard the statistics at the start of the
debate on these clauses. That is true. DNA is a great new weapon in
helping to bring criminals to justice but it is never used as the sole
piece of evidence to convict someone. There has to be other
corroborative
evidence.</div><a name="0902278000521"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.30
pm</div><a name="0902278000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the Government say that DNA is so important that we should have all
this information&#151;that we should grow the biggest DNA database in
the world&#151;logic demands that it should include the whole
population. If that cannot be done logistically, as has been explained
to me by experts in the field, the next step would be to include every
baby who is born. We will have all that for the future and build a
database that way. The ethics group already mentioned said in its first
annual report that the Government should make a formal announcement,
and that they had failed to do so at that point. For various reasons
set out in its detailed notes, it
said:</div><a name="0902278000508"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
universal database is both impractical and socially undesirable. It
would also be very expensive and of questionable value to improved
policing.&#148;</div><a name="0902278000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">So,
above all, it would be &#147;undesirable&#148;, not just because of
practical difficulties but for all sorts of ethical reasons. The
Government fallback position might be to say that they just want to
cast the net as widely as possible. I have heard it argued that people
arrested in the vicinity of an incident, even though they are never
charged or convicted, are likely to be the sort who would be criminals.
The argument is that there is no smoke without fire, that they would
not be there unless they were prone to that sort of behaviour. It is an
appalling step for the state to imply that it is going back to a
presumption of guilt without evidence, rather than the presumption of
innocence unless proven guilty which is supposed to have underpinned
British law for the past 800 years. The ethics group addressed that
explicitly in light of the S and Marper
judgment:</div><a name="0902278000509"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
ethics group remains convinced that the current policy for process and
removal puts innocent individuals at a severe disadvantage which is at
considerable variance with the principles of policing by
consent.&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column621" />Column number: 621</div><a name="0902278000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">Are the Government, by
logic of their argument, saying we want the whole population because
then we can catch all the
criminals?</div><a name="0902278000243"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902278000583"></a>Mr.
Campbell</b> <i class="I">indicated
dissent.</i></div>
<a name="0902278000244"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902278000584"></a>Paul
Holmes:</b> The Minister shakes his head. The Government may
say, let us throw out the widest net in the democratic world and get as
many people as possible, thanks to guilt by association, as there is no
smoke without fire: somebody may have been named as a possible suspect,
so we will keep their record. As for the 25 per cent. of people on the
database who are innocent&#151;that is 1 million people and
growing&#151;we will get them in the future because they are likely
to be criminals. Is that really acceptable? We certainly do not think
so, the Conservative party does not think so, and the ethics group does
not think so. In Scotland, they said some years ago that they did not
think so, and they have changed the law to take that into account. The
European Court has said it is not acceptable. Most people would say
that it is not acceptable. The Government ask what should be done about
serious crimes that are detected. In fact, only 0.35 per cent. of
serious crimes are detected as a result of information from the DNA
database, which is a tiny fraction. That was true in 2004-05, and it
was true in 2005-06, 2006-07 and 2007-08.</div>
<a name="0902278000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">Myths have
been promulgated about the role that DNA has played in some famous
convictions. Maninder Pal Singh Kohli was convicted in November 2008 of
the rape and murder of 17-year-old Hannah Foster, and his case has been
cited as an example in which the DNA database led to conviction.
However, in fact, police investigations led to his van; Hannah&#146;s
DNA was found in his van and DNA evidence corroborated evidence that
police collected in the normal pursuit of policing. That is true of
several other famous examples that keep being quoted in support of
Government policy, including the case of Mark Dixie, who was recently
convicted for the murder of Sally Ann Bowman. However, the DNA sample
that led to the conviction was taken when he was arrested for violent
affray in a pub nine months after the murder.</div>
<a name="0902278000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">No one is
arguing that the DNA of people who are arrested for that sort of
offence should not be taken&#151;of course it should. If the person
is not convicted, eventually their DNA sample should be removed.
According to Scottish law, in cases where people are arrested on
suspicion of a sex crime or a violent crime&#151;the two issues that
people are always concerned about&#151;there should be provision to
keep the DNA for three years and possibly to extend that by another two
years if the chief constable thinks it appropriate, and we support that
policy.</div>
<a name="0902278000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">Mark
Dixie&#146;s DNA swab was taken after he was arrested for violent
affray nine months after the murder for which he was eventually
convicted. Under the type of system that we suggest should be
introduced, which the Scottish Executive have enacted and the European
Court of Human Rights is talking about, that DNA sample would still
have been taken and would be run against the database. If nothing came
up and he was never convicted or charged for the affray in the pub, the
sample would be destroyed three or five years later, depending on the
view of the chief constable. There are several other examples, such as
Steve Wright and Peter 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column622" />Column number: 622</div>Tobin, where the DNA sample that was already on the database did not
lead directly to conviction but acted in a supporting or corroborative
role for DNA that was taken legitimately and kept for some other
incident, and that process would not be affected by our suggestions to
adopt the Scottish practice.</div>
<a name="0902278000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Court&#146;s ruling was clear. It accepted that the DNA profile and
sample constituted personal data and should be protected by data
protection laws. That was significant, because until now, the
Information Commissioner in the UK has argued that DNA samples do not
fall under UK data protection laws. However, the Court stated that a
sample does, and should. The Court emphasised the truly sensitive
nature of a DNA sample and described it as being of a &#147;highly
personal nature&#148;,
containing</div><a name="09022731000002"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;substantial
amounts of unique personal data&#148;,</div>
<a name="09022731000001"></a><div class="hs_Para">so it was particularly intrusive to break
that privacy. If we are to take that intrusive step, it ought to be
because we have convicted someone of an offence, and not because they
were arrested as a possible witness and we are just going to keep it
forever because of a suspicion that one day it might come in handy, as
is the case with a quarter of the people on the database. The Court
stated that</div>
<a name="0902278000510"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the mere
retention and storing of personal data by public authorities, however
obtained, are to be regarded as having direct impact on the
private-life interest of an individual concerned, irrespective of
whether subsequent use is made of the
data&#148;.</div><a name="0902278000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Court ruling was strong and clear about what is wrong with Government
policy.</div>
<a name="0902278000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Scottish
Executive&#146;s legislation is relevant, because the Court stated
that the practice in England and Wales, which allowed for the
indefinite retention of the DNA and fingerprints of unconvicted people,
breached the European convention on human rights. The Court also stated
that it considered the current retention policy in Scotland for samples
from those who are not convicted to be compliant with the convention.
Therefore, there is leeway with the Scottish case, which the Court has
stated fits in fine with the convention.</div>
<a name="0902278000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">With regard to
people who have been arrested on suspicion of violent or sexual
offences but not convicted, their samples can be kept for three to five
years under various conditions, which fits with the Court&#146;s
approach. Otherwise, the DNA of innocent people who are not charged, or
who are charged and not convicted, should be destroyed, and that is the
line of argument that most rational people outside the
Government&#146;s line of argument have taken, and that is the line
or argument that western democracies take. It is the line of argument
that part of the UK, Scotland, has taken and implemented successfully
in law, and it is certainly the approach that we think should be
taken.</div>
<a name="0902278000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government
say that they will consult, issue a White Paper and come back later in
the year, possibly in the summer, but the arguments have been well
rehearsed. There has been much research and consultation in this
country, in Scotland and in other places, and it is pretty extensive
and satisfactory. In asking us to pass the new clauses, the Government
are asking us simply to trust them. They are saying, &#147;We will
get it right and will come back with the detail later this year, which
you will not be able to amend, reject or throw out. You will have to
like it or lump it, so trust us.&#148; Unfortunately, on this issue,
we cannot do that because, as I say, the arguments 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column623" />Column number: 623</div>have been very clearly put forward at great length by many people in
recent years, and it is unacceptable to have a DNA database&#151;the
biggest DNA database in the world&#151;that breaches European rights,
when a quarter of the people on it are innocent. It is simply
unacceptable to include them, on spec, on the basis that one day they
might be guilty, so we should create as big a database as possible. We
oppose that absolutely; it is simply
unacceptable.</div>
<a name="0902278000254"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902278000585"></a>Mr.
Campbell:</b> I begin by repeating the process that we are
involved in. The Government&#151;I put this on the record
again&#151;are committed to complying with the decision of the
European Court of Human Rights. To some extent, the clock is ticking,
in that we have a commitment to respond to that decision within
12 months. Whatever else may have been said, there is a
definitive time scale here, which affects the process on which we have
embarked.</div>
<a name="0902278000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">We accept, as
the Court judgment accepts, that there is public disquiet about the
retention of DNA, but there is also, as the Court judgment also
accepts, a strong case for using DNA for public protection.
Furthermore, the Court judgment accepts that there should be a balance;
I accept that there should be a balance. The difficulty is where does
that balance lie? That is not an easy position to arrive at. We should
not simply rush to arrive at a position and we should try to involve as
many people in the process as possible.</div>
<a name="0902278000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">The next stage
of the process is to consult the public, then to introduce proposals
later this year in legislation to allow Parliament, ultimately, to
decide. The Government can introduce proposals, which will be based on
that public consultation, but at the end of the day Parliament will
decide. In case anyone is thinking of the argument, &#147;But of
course the Government will get their way&#148;, I can assure that
person that, judging from the Home Office questions that are tabled,
the letters I receive and the opinions of colleagues who speak to me,
there is a wide range of opinions about DNA. They are not all on one
side of the House; they are on both sides of the House. Therefore, I
welcome the opportunity to have a constructive debate.</div>
<a name="0902278000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me try to respond to the
points made by the hon. Member for Hornchurch. I welcome his
contribution to the debate and the way in which he made his comments. I
do not agree with some of the things that he said, but I welcome his
commitment to engage constructively. He suggested that we were somehow
seeking to frustrate parliamentary consideration. I have just been
through the process that we are involved in, and a key part of it is
public consultation. I am quite sure that Members of Parliament will
want to play a full part in that process outside Parliament. We are
committed to introducing proposals in the autumn for Parliament to
decide, but there are lots of other ways in which Parliament can make
its views clear, not just in the public consultation but through the
business of the House. There must be ample opportunity for people to
watch this debate as it goes on and to be able to make the very points
that the hon. Gentleman is making, not just to influence the
consultation itself but the process. As for the parameters
of the consultation, we need to think about Parliament in its wider
sense, because this issue is one of the most important issues that we
face.</div>

Brokenshire:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for giving way
and I am also grateful to him for making a commitment to public
consultation, which I agree is absolutely essential. What I do not
understand is why the Government appear to want to subject this matter
to the regulation and order-making approach, because it would not then
be possible for hon. Members to make amendments, even though, as he
rightly indicates, there is a broad range of views and feelings on this
very sensitive issue. If that mechanism of making amendments was
allowed, it could aid the debate in the House on the detailed
consideration of the Government&#146;s proposals, to ensure that each
of those viewpoints can be considered, so that appropriate scrutiny can
take place. I do not understand why the Government seem to have set
their face against that
approach.</div><a name="0902278000522"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.45
pm</div><a name="0902278000259"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902278000587"></a>Mr.
Campbell:</b> I understand very well the points that the hon.
Gentleman is making, and he makes them very well. They are important
points, but they relate to what I just said&#151;namely that
Parliament can play an important part in the process of helping to
shape the consultation and its outcome.</div>
<a name="0902278000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">At the end of
the day, however, if the hon. Gentleman is questioning the process,
because he thinks that the Government will introduce proposals anyway
and those proposals cannot be amended, it is valid to ask, why go
through this process? Why bother having a process at all? Why not just
respond simply to what the ECHR has said? Why have a public
consultation and make it such an important issue for public debate? Why
am I telling the hon. Gentleman that there are mechanisms in Parliament
to debate such matters? Let him talk to his business managers about how
they use their time in Parliament to see whether they can use some of
it on the issue. If it is that important, why do they not do that?
There will be a vote, after
all.</div><a name="0902278000261"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0902278000588"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Simon Burns</b> (West Chelmsford) (Con): The Minister was a
Government Whip so he understands that we can have as much consultation
as we like in Parliament, but if the Government of the day are
determined to do something, they will use their majority to force the
matter through
regardless.</div><a name="0902278000262"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902278000589"></a>Mr.
Campbell:</b> Yes, and I have told the hon. Member for
Chesterfield that there is a wide range of opinion on both sides of the
House. It would be wrong for the Government to assume that, if they
introduce the proposals to which he objects, there would not be
objections from their own side. It is important that, first of all, we
have a debate and a consultation, and that the Government listen to
what is said, before introducing the measures. The hon. Member for
Hornchurch is, of course, correct in saying that, if the measures are
introduced as a statutory instrument, it will not be possible to amend
them. He will also know, however, that a statutory instrument can be
voted
down.</div><a name="0902278000263"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902278000590"></a>Mr.
Burns:</b> Come
on.</div><a name="0902278000264"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902278000591"></a>Mr.
Campbell:</b> If the measures are, as the hon. Gentleman says,
so out of touch with what the hon. Member for Chesterfield calls the
majority of people, what makes him think that the Government side would
support such a thing?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column625" />Column number: 625</div><a name="0902278000265"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902278000592"></a>Mr.
Burns:</b> With respect, I will repeat what I said earlier.
The Minister was a Government Whip, so he knows what he is talking
about. Government members of a Committee dealing with controversial
statutory instruments will be hand-picked in order for the Government
to get their majority, unless the Government Whips Office makes a
mistake.</div><a name="0902278000266"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902278000593"></a>Mr.
Campbell:</b> I do not recognise that process at all, so I
could not possibly comment. The hon. Gentleman knows, however, that
what happens in Committee is not the end of the story. A statutory
instrument is not just a matter of what happens in Committee; it is
actually a matter for Parliament. Furthermore, it is not
just a matter for the House of Commons, but for the other place, too.
The hon. Gentleman should not be so cynical about the way in which
Parliament works and the opportunities for
scrutiny.</div>
<a name="0902278000267"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902278000594"></a>Mr.
Burns</b> <i class="I">rose&#151;</i></div>
<a name="0902278000268"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902278000595"></a>Mr.
Campbell:</b> I want to move on before we exhaust this
particular
point.</div><a name="0902278000269"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902278000596"></a>Mr.
Burns:</b> On the point about cynicism, the Labour party has
been in government for 12 years now, and its control freakery over its
own members surpasses that of the Thatcher Government. The Minister is
slightly disingenuous if he is suggesting that members of statutory
instrument Committees are not hand-picked. He knows in his heart of
hearts that I am telling the truth when I say that they are hand-picked
to minimise any danger to the Government
majority.</div><a name="0902278000270"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902278000597"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I should stop this particular debate, because
the way in which the Whips operate is not relevant to the Bill. The
point has been well made by the hon. Gentleman, but the Minister should
return to the new
clause.</div><a name="0902278000271"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902278000598"></a>Mr.
Campbell:</b> Thank you, Mr. Bayley. The hon.
Member for West Chelmsford knows that I did not comment on what he just
said. I did not make that point at
all.</div><a name="0902278000272"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902278000599"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> May I make a final point on this process? The
Government regularly introduce White Papers that result in primary
legislation. That then allows consideration in detail and debates on
the Floor of the House. While I respect the fact that Adjournment and
Opposition debates can take place in advance to allow issues to be
articulated as part of the consultation, the requirement for detailed
scrutiny to ensure that the Government&#146;s provisions are
acceptable only comes into being when a set of proposals are
introduced. The Government seem to be shying away from that scrutiny,
and that is why I am concerned about the process that has been adopted,
which means that we might not get the end result that the Minister
promises.</div><a name="0902278000273"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902278000600"></a>Mr.
Campbell:</b> I quite understand that point, because the hon.
Gentleman raised it when he questioned why this is not being done
through primary legislation. I will come back to point in a moment, but
first let me address some of the other comments that he
made.</div><a name="0902278000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman and I agree on the need to strike a balance between
public protection and the right to privacy&#151;so, too, did the
judgment. I also accept his point about accepting the responsibility of
being a country at the cutting edge in having a DNA database, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column626" />Column number: 626</div>which makes it more important that we act in a responsible
way&#151;that almost goes without saying. He mentioned, as the hon.
Member for Chesterfield did, the reference to young children. The Home
Secretary signalled, in her speech in December 2008, that children
under the age of 10 will be removed from the database and that process
is well underway&#151;in fact it is nearing completion. She added
that we want to have people on the database who are guilty of the most
serious offences, and make sure that people who are in prison for such
offences are on the database. Again, I give a commitment that that
process is
underway.</div><a name="0902278000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">Much
has been made of the Government&#146;s intention to expand the
database &#147;as much as possible&#148;&#151;I think that that
was the phrase that was used&#151;and whether that meant that it
would become a repository of the whole nation&#146;s DNA. If the
Government, or indeed Parliament, had not set a threshold, perhaps
there would be a better case for making that point. However, the
reality is that there is a threshold, which is set at the point of
people being arrested and detained in a police station. The relevant
point is that the European Court of Human Rights did not accept that
that was the appropriate place for the threshold&#151;it says that
the threshold is in the wrong place. That is what the whole debate is
about. If it says that it is in the wrong place and we have to comply
with that judgment, then what do we do not just to comply with that
judgment, but to assure ourselves that the threshold we put in place is
appropriate and proportionate?</div>
<a name="0902278000276"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902278000601"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I come back to the quote from the Court
judgment on the intention of the policy about</div>
<a name="0902278000511"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the sole reason
being to increase the size and, therefore, the use of the
database.&#148;</div>
<a name="0902278000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">Can the Minister confirm
whether the arguments before the Court were made on that basis, because
it gets to the nub of the issues that I have highlighted and the issues
raised subsequently by the hon. Member for
Chesterfield?</div><a name="0902278000278"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902278000602"></a>Mr.
Campbell:</b> Part of the argument that was made was to try
and counter the argument that the two individuals should have their
samples removed from the database. Of course, part of the
counter-argument is to justify why people are on the database in the
first place: it is about the public need for people to be on that
database and how it is being used.</div>
<a name="0902278000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I was
saying, the Government&#146;s policy is not to try and do everything
we can, in any way possible, to increase the size of the database. I
agree, that if that was the case, one could extrapolate and say,
&#147;Why not go down the route of having everybody on a
database?&#148; We have set a threshold. The fact that the Court
disagrees with the threshold means that we have to address that
particular point, but if we were simply going down the route of getting
as many people as possible on to that database, why would we have a
threshold and why would we not introduce some idea of compulsion and
make it mandatory? We have to have some sense of balance about what the
Government are trying to achieve. What is clear from the discussion
that we are having this afternoon is that the hon. Member for
Chesterfield and I disagree fundamentally about the size and the
necessity of the DNA
database.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column627" />Column number: 627</div><a name="0902278000280"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902278000603"></a>Paul
Holmes:</b> I do not disagree fundamentally about the
necessity of the database; I disagree fundamentally about the necessity
of having 25 per cent. of the people on it who are innocent. Having
guilty people on there is fine, but it is not fine to have innocent
people on
there.</div><a name="0902278000281"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902278000604"></a>Mr.
Campbell:</b> I apologise to the hon. Gentleman, almost as I
said it I thought that I was getting into the wrong place, so I am
happy to apologise on the record.</div>
<a name="0902278000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will return
to that point in my response to the hon. Gentleman. He raises points
that will be raised in the public and parliamentary debate on the
nature and scale of the DNA database. That will allow us to not only
comply with the judgment, but point a way forward.</div>
<a name="0902278000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Hornchurch raised a number of specific points. He asked how
many samples have been given voluntarily. I am still waiting for the
number but I will get it to him as soon as possible. He also asked if
the White Paper will address volunteer samples. Yes, it will,
particularly ensuring that the volunteer is made fully aware of their
rights.</div>
<a name="0902278000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman asked if there were any proposals to cover non-notifiable
offences. No. He raised a point about individuals knowing what
information on them is held and if that issue will be included in the
White Paper. The White Paper will emphasise the importance of informing
a person of their rights and entitlements. We have already indicated in
the consultation paper on the PACE review, published in August 2008,
that we will raise the awareness and understanding of the public and
detainees.</div><a name="0902278000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman raised points and questions that, frankly, are more
about the debate that will need to take place than the issue that we
are discussing, which is whether the Home Secretary should be given the
power to bring forward proposals that Parliament can decide upon after
public consultation. I welcome that wide public debate and hope that
hon. Members also welcome it, but emphasise that Parliament will make
the final
decision.</div><a name="0902278000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
data sharing and the Prum treaty, in one sense, the hon. Gentleman is
correct in saying that there will be what could be described as an
exchange of profiles. However, it is not about another signatory to the
treaty being able to access the database and sharing responsibility for
it, in case anyone gets that impression. It is about whether they can
request samples and whether we agree to share them in specified
circumstances. I hope that that reassures the Committee.</div>
<a name="0902278000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman mentioned familial links. They are an important aspect of
identifying potential suspects, as well as the innocent. We will
publish proposals in the White Paper on the use of DNA, but we do not
envisage it extending beyond the current uses set out in
PACE.</div><a name="0902278000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman made a point about primary legislation, which I promised
to come back to. I started by saying the we are involved in a process
and that the judgment made in December in the European Court of Human
Rights set a clock ticking. There were options for looking at the issue
and for complying within the 12-month time scale. We decided that we
would begin work on it but would also involve the public. I will come
on to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point about why we did not do it
sooner. I believe that involving the public strengthens our case for
when we go back to Europe and argue that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column628" />Column number: 628</div>we have complied with the judgment. It helps to clarify, in our mind,
what the future rules should be, and helps us to make our case in
Europe.</div><a name="0902278000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
would the alternative have been? Would it have been that, after
December, we, as a Government, drew up proposals, which would have to
have been consulted on anyway, brought them to Parliament at some point
and had primary legislation, which would have had to be scrutinized in
the way that he talked about&#151;an alternative system, but
scrutinized in that manner? He has been in Parliament long enough to
understand. Does he seriously believe that we could have completed that
process and complied with the judgment? I cannot agree with him. That
is a difficulty of operating within the time scale. We had to make a
choice and we have made the right one.</div>
<a name="0902278000290"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902278000605"></a>Paul
Holmes:</b> On that point, the Government have created this
hole for themselves and they should stop digging. They have had ample
opportunity to consider this issue. It has been discussed in Parliament
before. Another model has been tried and tested in Scotland. If clauses
on gangs can be tabled and brought forward for discussion in such a
short period and included in primary legislation, the same could be
done on
DNA.</div><a name="0902278000523"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3
pm</div><a name="0902278000291"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902278000606"></a>Mr.
Campbell:</b> I am disappointed that the hon. Gentleman is
suggesting that we should short-circuit the system by using primary
legislation to rebalance the matter. That would short-circuit the
public consultation that we are signed up to. We have not hidden away
and then brought forward a series of proposals on a take-it-or-leave-it
basis. We have opened up the debate to ensure that we get to a position
of compliance. We have also ensured that we can be much more confident
in the way the database is used in the future. He keeps referring to
the Scottish model. Let us talk about that as part of the consultation.
He can bring forward that model as part of his argument for reforming
the
methods.</div><a name="0902278000292"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman said that the Government should bring forward amendments
at this stage and that we should not be surprised by the judgment. The
Government did not expect that judgment in December 2008, in part
because when it was discussed in our system there was a unanimous
decision in the House of Lords. How could we have been expected to
believe that the European Court of Human Rights would make that
decision? Having decided to fight the case in Europe because we
believed passionately that it was the right case to make, what signal
would we have sent had we started making the changes that would be
needed if the decision went against us? That would have been a strange
case of putting the cart before the horse. Therefore, I do not accept
the argument that we should not be surprised. We were surprised and
disappointed because that outcome was not
expected.</div><a name="0902278000293"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902278000607"></a>Paul
Holmes:</b> I made a dual point. First, the Government should
not have been surprised, partly because we were so out of kilter with
the rest of the democratic world. Secondly, having been surprised, they
should realise the arguments have been well rehearsed over a long
period. If the Government could bring forward clauses for primary
legislation on gangs so quickly in response to the court judgment on
the Birmingham case, why could the same not have been done on DNA? This
is a well-rehearsed argument.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column629" />Column number: 629</div><a name="0902278000294"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902278000608"></a>Mr.
Campbell:</b> The hon. Gentleman started his remarks by
stating how important this issue is. I hope that he also accepts that
it is a complex issue. As I told him, the Home Secretary said in
December 2008 that children under 10 would be taken off the database. I
have assured him that a lot of work has been done on that, but that it
has not yet been completed. There are a small number of cases. It is
not a case of going to the database and simply taking them off. Many of
these cases are complex. Taking them off can be justified, but often
there is also a reason for leaving them
on.</div><a name="0902278000295"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman underestimates the complexity of the case in saying that
we should have proposals for primary legislation in February in
response to a judgment that was made in December. As I keep saying to
him, to do so would write out the other part of the equation that we
want to see, which is a full and proper debate. That was part of the
judgment in December. The court accepted that there was public concern
and that, by implication, there should be public
debate.</div><a name="0902278000296"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902278000609"></a>Paul
Holmes:</b> Could the Minister explain what that complexity
is? I am not talking just about children under the age of 10, which is
one of the lowest ages of criminal responsibility in the democratic
world, but about children from 10 to 18. The matter is not complex. If
they have been charged and convicted, they should stay on the database.
If they have not been charged or have been charged and found innocent,
they should be taken off it. The only complexity relates to a small
section at the bottom end of the database made up of under-10s who are
below the age of criminal
responsibility.</div><a name="0902278000297"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902278000610"></a>Mr.
Campbell:</b> I am delighted that the hon. Gentleman has
started to raise exceptions. Once one gets into what looks like a very
straightforward principle exceptions often emerge. It is often more
complex than he suggests. He himself, in raising issues that were part
of amendments that were not selected, started to put conditions. He
started to describe the sort of areas where exceptions would be made.
When we start on that process it is anything but easy. Other factors
often need to be taken into
consideration.</div><a name="0902278000298"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902278000611"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> The Minister has given us various reasons why
the Government are proceeding down this route. He sets great store by
the need for public consultation and public engagement, which I do not
necessarily deny, albeit that I disagree with his analysis of what
primary legislation can do. However, can he tell us what form he
envisages the public consultation will
take?</div><a name="0902278000299"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902278000612"></a>Mr.
Campbell:</b> I cannot give a definitive answer to that. I do
not think that the hon. Gentleman really expected me to say that I
could. This is work in progress. We are committed to bringing forward a
White Paper. I have told him, because some of them grow out of the
judgment itself, the sort of areas that we will be looking at. He is
well aware of the kind of issues that are involved here. We will have a
full consultation with the public on this
matter.</div>
<a name="0902278000300"></a>

<a name="0902278000301"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902278000614"></a>Mr.
Campbell:</b> The hon. Gentleman shakes his head. But in an
earlier debate when we talked about consultation on the mandatory code
on alcohol I gave him a commitment that we would share information
about who was part of the pre-consultation and what the issues were at
a very 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column630" />Column number: 630</div>early stage. If the hon. Gentleman does not have that information he
will get it extremely shortly. I can also tell him that there will be a
full consultation on that practice. Could he give us the benefit of the
doubt and accept that if a Minister stands up and says, &#147;There
will be a full consultation on this matter,&#148; we will stick to
our word? I cannot, of course, tell him exactly what the consultation
will be, but I am sure that if he and others find that it is not
extensive enough they will seek to make it so. We want the fullest,
widest consultation.</div>
<a name="0902278000302"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me return
to the other comments that the hon. Member for Chesterfield made. He
raised some pretty fundamental issues. Can we trust the database? Why
is it so large? Why should some people be on it and others be off it?
Those are precisely the issues that the consultation will look at and
Parliament will decide upon. But he and others are in danger of
ignoring the other side of the argument. Of the 200,000 profiles that
would not have been on the register had things taken a different route,
6,290 were from people involved in 14,000 offences, including 114
murders and 116 rapes.</div>
<a name="0902278000303"></a><div class="hs_Para">We all get
e-mails from people asking how they can get off the register and why
people should hold data on them. But we have a responsibility in this
House to think about the other side. We have to think about the
families of people who have been murdered and raped and the families of
people who have been exonerated by the use of this database. If we had
gone down the route that the hon. Gentleman suggested at an earlier
stage it would simply not be available to
us.</div><a name="0902278000304"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902278000615"></a>Mr.
Burns:</b> I am impressed by the Minister&#146;s impassioned
plea on behalf of the victims of crime, but there is another side to
the coin. What about those people who are innocent who have given their
DNA and are then not charged because they are innocent? Why should they
have their DNA on a register when they are totally
innocent?</div><a name="0902278000305"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902278000616"></a>Mr.
Campbell:</b> That is precisely what the Court issue was all
about. That is why the Government are bringing forward not just
consultation but proposals to change the threshold. We will address
that issue. The point I am making is that one cannot make that argument
on the one hand and then dismiss the usefulness of the DNA database. It
plays a very important part in policing in this country. I got the
impression from listening to the hon. Member for Chesterfield that if
he is not careful he will not only underestimate but underplay the
importance of the database. He listed, twice, organisations that can
tell us that we have got it wrong. He talked a great deal about
Scotland, but Scotland has a different system and a devolved
Government, as he well knows. It does not have to be the same south of
the border as it is north of it. He not only gave a list of people whom
we should be listening to&#151;whom we will listen to&#151;but said
that the majority of people, and most rational people, certainly agree
with him. He might be right, but we will test that by letting the
public have their say. Let us have a public consultation. Going down
the hon. Gentleman&#146;s route and looking at his prescription would
have denied the public their say. Let us get a sense of balance here. I
welcome a public consultation but I do not have the confidence in the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s position that he
has.</div><a name="0902278000306"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902278000618"></a>Mr.
Campbell:</b> Not at the moment, because I do not want to end
on a discordant note. The hon. Gentleman introduced a series of
amendments that were not accepted, and for obvious reasons I do not
wish to dwell on that. However, I welcome such amendments being tabled
because the ideas they contain are precisely the sort of things that
should help to form our debate. I very much welcome what the hon.
Gentleman has
said.</div><a name="0902278000308"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902278000619"></a>Paul
Holmes:</b> As I said in what I think was my opening sentence
on the issue, DNA has been a fantastic advance in helping to catch
criminals. It should, however, never be used without corroborating
evidence. In only 0.35 per cent. of convictions based on DNA is the DNA
of the innocent 25 per cent. of the 4 million people on the database
used. That is a very tiny percentage. I hope that in the promised
public consultation the Government uses the stats and not emotive
headlines. I gave four examples, two in detail, of people who are often
quoted by the Government as evidence that having innocent
people&#146;s DNA on the database leads to convictions, for murder
and so on. That was not the case in my two detailed examples. I hope
that the consultation will be based on genuine facts and not on saying
that having all those innocent people on the database is essential to
catching all these criminals. That is not effective in 99.65 per cent.
of
cases.</div><a name="0902278000309"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902278000620"></a>Mr.
Campbell:</b> Before I finish my remarks, I say to the hon.
Gentleman that the judgment in the European Court of Human Rights was
not that innocent people&#146;s DNA could not be retained. It placed
conditions on retention, stating circumstances in which DNA could be
retained. What I have tried to say throughout this debate is that the
Government will respond to the European Court of Human Rights. We will
comply with it, and in doing so the threshold will
change.</div><a name="0902278000310"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is an appropriate opportunity to look at the wide issue. The hon.
Members for Chesterfield and for Hornchurch have both accepted that
there is widespread public concern and the need for a debate. We have
discussed the issue for some time; it is a regular at questions and it
is often raised in Home Office debates. So, let us have that debate.
Our proposal is the best way, within the time scale that the judgment
gives us, to get the balance right between the rights of the
individual, which the court case highlighted, and the rights of the
rest of the community to be safe and be kept safe. Part of that is
having and using a DNA database. Despite all that has been said, we
think that our new clauses are the correct way
forward.</div><a name="0902278000311"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902278000687"></a>Paul
Holmes:</b> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second
time.</div><a name="0902278000407"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
essence of the new clause is in the first paragraph: that an authorised
officer of a local authority who has reason to believe that a person
has committed the relevant offence&#151;that is, graffiti or
fly-posting&#151;can give that person the opportunity of discharging
any liability to prosecution and conviction if they undertake
community-service punishment to rectify the damage they have caused, to
remove the graffiti or the fly-posting to make it good.</div>
<a name="0902278000408"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are two
purposes in suggesting this. The first is that it is a reflection of
the well known and well debated broken-window theory, which became
fashionable in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column636" />Column number: 636</div>New York, for example, in the early 1990s when the new mayor suggested
seizing back public places and getting the police to tackle what had
been regarded as trivial in the past when they had had to concentrate
on more serious things. The theory was that if the abandoned cars,
litter, fly-posting and graffiti were dealt with, it would help to
reduce more serious crime. Arguably, in New York it had that effect,
although analysts point out that the number of police also doubled,
which was already higher per head of population than in European
countries. Another factor was that the population was getting older
and, of course, a lot of this type of crime is committed predominantly
by young people who grow out of that pattern of low-level criminality.
There are all sorts of reasons why it might have worked but it is
certainly argued that the New York example could signpost the
way.</div>
<a name="0902278000409"></a><div class="hs_Para">Anyone who has
served on a local council or worked with one will know that the same
principle applies. If the council tackles outbreaks of graffiti
promptly it is much less likely to continue or recur in that area.
Whereas, if it is allowed to perpetuate it creates a vicious cycle. As
a teacher would know, exactly the same applies with regard to graffiti
on displays of work&#151;the sharper the school cracks down on it,
the less it happens.</div>
<a name="0902278000410"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
broken-window theory is well known although it had never really been
scientifically and rationally researched. However, an article in
<i class="I">Science </i>magazine published on 12 December 2008 describes a
number of controlled field experiments in a European country that
tested the theory. For example, an alley was made pristine but it did
not have a litter bin. To get rid of litter one would have to take it
away or throw it on the floor. When the alley was clean people would
almost universally take the litter away with them. When the alley was
already littered they almost universally dropped the litter on the
floor. A series of experiments was carried out. In another, a letter
clearly containing €5 was left on the floor near a postbox. When
the surrounding area was clean the number of people who stole the
envelope rather than push it into the postbox was tiny. When the
postbox and the small amount of money hanging out of the letter were in
an area that had been deliberately graffitied, the number of people
taking the envelope and the money rose considerably. The researchers
did about five different experiments that led to the same
result.</div><a name="0902278000411"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
research concluded that there is a clear message for policy makers and
police officers: early disorder diagnosis and intervention are vital in
fighting the spread of disorder. Signs of inappropriate behaviour such
as graffiti and broken windows lead to other inappropriate behaviour
such as littering and stealing. The result is a decline in social norms
and accepted standards, which leads to an escalation in littering,
crime and so on. That suggests that there is hard evidence that the
broken-window theory works, which backs up the famous New York example
and the anecdotal evidence that we can all give from personal
experience. That explains one purpose of the
proposal.</div><a name="0902278000412"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second purpose is to take a stance that criminalises fewer people.
England and Wales send a higher proportion of the population to jail
than any other European country. Is that effective? Most people who do
graffiti and fly-posting are under the age of 18, although not all.
England and Wales jail more children than any 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column637" />Column number: 637</div>other western European country and 76 per cent. of those children
reoffend within one year of being released. Clearly that policy is not
working.</div><a name="0902278000413"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have visited the prison systems in Norway and Canada, which are held up
as models of the opposite approach. An approach that does not
criminalise children early on for relatively minor offences has a more
beneficial effect alongside other measures such as intervention,
counselling and help. I am told that 40 per cent. of under-25s have a
criminal record of some kind, although most are quite trivial. The
evidence is that the more people are criminalised through court
proceedings, the more criminal they tend to become. It is a
self-feeding
cycle.</div><a name="0902278000414"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
well as helping to tackle the broken-window theory, the second purpose
of the proposal is to take a less criminalising approach with people
undertaking restorative justice, which all three main parties have
talked much about over recent years. Some good experiments around the
country have shown how that can
work.</div><a name="0902278000415"></a><div class="hs_Para">People
can be told that we have the evidence for an antisocial behaviour order
or court proceedings, but that we are giving them a chance to clear up
the mess they have made. They could thereby discharge any liability or
prosecution. A magistrate friend of mine said that that would bypass
the magistrates court. That is the whole point. At the early, low-level
stage we should try not to put people in the criminal system and get
them to clean up the mess they have
made.</div><a name="0902278000416"></a><div class="hs_Para">Does
the proposal give too much power to local authority officials? Again,
the point is that if the offender says that they do not want to clean
up the mess, the evidence can be used under the normal legal
procedures. If the individual says that it was them and that they will
rectify the vandalism, graffiti or fly-posting, there is restorative
justice for the community, the broken-window theory is tackled and the
person is kept off the first rung on the ladder of
criminality.</div><a name="0902278000417"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am sure that the Minister will be able to pick holes in the proposals.
I do not have the banks of Government draftsmen who could produce a far
superior version. I would be delighted if the Minister said that the
proposal will not work, but that he will take the idea and come back
with something better. I do not intend to press the clause to a vote,
but I am interested in the Minister&#146;s
response.</div><a name="0902278000525"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.30

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902278000688"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> The hon. Gentleman&#146;s point about the
importance of focusing on graffiti is relevant. There is a debate about
designing out crime. So much can and should be done to make our
communities look cleaner, such as ensuring that they are well lit.
Aspects of design can assist in ensuring that areas are safer and that
less crime is committed. He is right that we should consider the
concept of the broken-window society. If an area looks unsafe or
unkept, in some ways the problem becomes self-perpetuating and the
crime arises. Sadly, we have obviously seen this in many different
communities that we have had involvement with.</div>
<a name="0902278000419"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are two
points. There is also the cost to businesses and small shops that
perhaps have their shutters or their buildings continually defaced by
graffiti. That highlights that graffiti is not an insignificant crime.
So many businesses really struggle, because after the first occurrence 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column638" />Column number: 638</div>they perhaps cannot get the insurance to pay to deal with the problem.
The viability of certain secondary or tertiary shopping areas,
including the shops that have had to withstand some of these problems,
becomes quite marginal. Those shops feel the direct cost, particularly
when local authorities understandably say, &#147;Well, you
haven&#146;t cleared this up and we&#146;re going to issue you with
a notice to clear it up, because it is contributing to the area feeling
less safe.&#148; That puts real pressure on a number of those
businesses. I am sure that many hon. Members will have experienced that
situation in their own
community.</div><a name="0902278000420"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand and recognise the points that the hon. Gentleman makes about
the importance of not criminalising young people and not drawing them
into the criminal justice system at too early a stage. However, if
someone is going round tagging and creating graffiti, that is really
quite important, because it can be the precursor to other offending. By
simply saying that an officer of the local authority would effectively
deal with graffiti, there is a risk that these offences will be viewed
as less serious if they are taken outside of their current remit. In no
way am I suggesting that the hon. Gentleman is making that point,
because he is
not.</div><a name="0902278000421"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
absolutely agree that restorative justice can demonstrate to a
community that somebody is paying for the crime that they have
committed, that they are seen publicly in their community to be either
repainting a building or clearing up litter, and that people recognise
that somebody has received a punishment in those circumstances.
However, I fear that an unintended consequence of what the hon.
Gentleman is suggesting may be that graffiti is seen as less of a crime
and less of a threat to a particular community, because it would
obviously then be for the local authority to try to arrange the
community punishments. That would take the local authority into a realm
that it is perhaps not so familiar with, albeit that partnership
arrangements could be established with youth offending teams and that
whole aspect of the
system.</div><a name="0902278000422"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are significant issues and potential problems with what the hon.
Gentleman is suggesting. Furthermore, if we recall the debate that we
had this morning about gangs, some gangs may use tags as a mean of
identifying territory, so that there is a more sinister aspect to the
use of graffiti. We can talk about graffiti being a mark on a wall, but
sometimes, as the hon. Gentleman will know, those tags mean something;
they can have links to more serious offending. That is why the approach
of involving the police, who often log these tags and have a database
of them so that they can tie that graffiti to other offending, is quite
important.</div><a name="0902278000423"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902278000689"></a>Paul
Holmes:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman accept that there is a
quite clear distinction and it would be at the designated
officer&#146;s discretion to establish that distinction? He would be
working with the community disorder reduction partnerships and the
police. Clearly, if it is serial tagging, gang tags or that sort of
issue, why would the officer adopt this approach, unless they thought
that it was appropriate for somebody just to get involved? If it is
somebody who has just been caught spray-painting or chalking on a wall
for the first time that we know of, why start to go through the
heavy-handed legal procedures? So the decision would be at the
discretion of the relevant 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column639" />Column number: 639</div>officer. Clearly, if it was a serious matter, such as a serial offender
or repeat offender, this approach would obviously not be
appropriate.</div><a name="0902278000424"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902278000690"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> It is interesting that the hon. Gentleman
talks about the discretion of the relevant officer in this situation. I
would argue that there should be discretion for the relevant police
officer in how they deal with community safety and with offences in
their community. It may be the case that an officer in the
circumstances that the hon. Gentleman has indicated might, on a one-off
occasion because he knows the person responsible and is very familiar
with them, seek to exercise discretion in a particular way. I am just
suggesting to the hon. Gentleman that that might be a better route in
terms of being reasonable and dealing appropriately with offences in
the community. There needs to be discretion and judgment on the part of
police officers in these circumstances and that may be an appropriate
way to address this problem, through the increasing use of community
policing and safer neighbourhood teams, which I wholeheartedly support,
who have a clearer understanding of the communities and neighbourhoods
that they are
policing.</div><a name="0902278000425"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902278000691"></a>Ms
Keeble:</b> My reading of this, and one reason why I think
that it would not work, is that it involves</div>
<a name="0902278000426"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;an authorised
officer of a local
authority&#148;&#151;&#151;</div><a name="0902278000427"></a><div class="hs_Para">not
a police officer, but a council officer. The person has to confess to
the council officer that they have done it. It starts a new hare in the
criminal justice system. That is why I have difficulty envisaging how a
local council officer could be made to use a legal procedure such as
this against a kid who is doing graffiti. It is an issue for the police
officer, not the council cleaner.</div>
<a name="0902278000428"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902278000692"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I hear clearly what the hon. Lady says, but,
as she should notice, I have talked about the discretion of police
officers, working in conjunction with local authorities, which have a
key role in the crime and disorder reduction partnerships that the hon.
Member for Chesterfield alluded to. I have been to parts of the country
where, for example, community police teams work hand in hand with
council enforcement officers. Therefore, a combination of
council-related issues&#151;clear-up or using local environmental
protection byelaws&#151;and working with the police creates a
partnership approach. That is almost an alternative model that could be
adopted and, in many ways, could achieve some of the elements that the
hon. Gentleman seeks.</div>
<a name="0902278000429"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902278000693"></a>Paul
Holmes:</b> On the partnership approach, are hon. Members
aware of the pretty widespread practice, not only in Chesterfield, but
also across the country, of council officers working with the police on
many issues? Sometimes, the council officers take the initiative. In
Chesterfield, we have a system of rangers who go around the parks and
housing estates tackling graffiti and working with the police on
offenders. If the offenders are council tenants, they will serve
notices or warnings on them. There are already working examples of
council officers taking the initiative on such issues. The
police&#151;the beat officer&#151;and the council tenant liaison
officer will visit a problem family together. The police will say,
&#147;Well, if you don&#146;t get your act together, these are the
legal outcomes&#148; and the tenant liaison officer will say,
&#147;And you can be evicted as well.&#148; That double act works
very well. This is not new ground; it is already happening to varying
degrees.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column640" />Column number: 640</div><a name="0902278000430"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902278000694"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I hear what the hon.
Gentleman says, and I support close partnership working among the
police, local authorities, probation teams and the NHS to address the
issues in our communities. We see success where strong partnership
elements are working. However, I question the necessity for the new
clause in terms of where the relative responsibilities for dealing with
the issues should lie. In my judgment, we are talking about criminal
offences and if we want to debate young people in the
criminal justice system, this is not necessarily the way to do it,
although it is a valid point.</div>
<a name="0902278000431"></a><div class="hs_Para">Going back to
intelligence and potentially gang-related tags, the hon. Gentleman
talked about the discretion of the officer, but, in reality, the police
maintain the database of tags from photographic evidence and are better
able to match them up. Would the local authority officer be in a
position to make a judgment or use discretion? They would not
necessarily have all the information at their fingertips. Equally,
there is a cost impact on local authorities if they take on a new
enforcement and community punishment role that is not currently
envisaged for them.</div>
<a name="0902278000432"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman made an interesting point and, although I am not convinced,
highlighting the impact of graffiti on our neighbourhoods and
communities is relevant and valid, but I am not sure that this is the
right way to approach
it.</div><a name="0902278000433"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902278000695"></a>Mr.
Campbell:</b> I thank the hon. Members for Chesterfield and
for Birmingham, Yardley (John Hemming) for drawing this issue to the
Committee&#146;s attention, because this is an interesting amendment.
When I discussed the proposal with my ministerial colleagues, we
thought that there might be something in it. I cannot guarantee the
hon. Member for Chesterfield that I will delight him, but I might give
him a tiny bit of pleasure.</div>
<a name="0902278000434"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have wide
agreement on the broken-window theory, but I assure the hon. Gentleman,
in view of his comments, that we all take those matters seriously,
because graffiti and fly-posting are serious matters that can blight
areas. It is right that the appropriate authorities react quickly to
them and use enforcement powers when necessary. However, he begins to
bring us into a more general debate on keeping young people out of the
criminal justice system at an early stage, and he and I have some
agreement on that.</div>
<a name="0902278000435"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also agree
with the points made by the hon. Member for Hornchurch on the need to
be careful before going down that route. Making such a change or going
too far down that route would send out a message to the individuals who
might get involved in that kind of activity and the wider community.
The community expects that graffiti and fly-posting will be put right
by someone, and it is best put right by the perpetrators rather than at
the expense of the council tax payer or anyone else. I want to say
briefly where I think the Government are in that debate and reassure
the hon. Gentleman of some of the things we are
doing.</div><a name="0902278000436"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902278000696"></a>Paul
Holmes:</b> Before the Minister embarks on that explanation,
which might be a direct answer to this question, I would like to say
that we have already been in that territory to some degree in our
debate on community payback. I remember visiting one group of people
doing community payback in Chesterfield. One individual was in the army
and his career would have ended if he had had to go to prison for those
nine days, but the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column641" />Column number: 641</div>community payback allowed him to avoid that. There were other people in
the group who would have lost their jobs if they had gone to prison for
a very short spell, which actually has no beneficial effect with regard
to crime and punishment. Several people I talked to in that group said
community payback had been really helpful and avoided criminalising
them. Those were adults rather than children or under-18s, so this is
extending the same principle to an even lower
level.</div><a name="0902278000437"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902278000697"></a>Mr.
Campbell:</b> I remind the hon. Gentleman that restorative
justice is already embedded in the youth justice system, and we are
constantly looking at what more can be done to make it more widely
available to avoid some of the scenarios to which he has rightly drawn
the Committee&#146;s attention.</div>
<a name="0902278000438"></a><div class="hs_Para">With regard to
the measures already in place, the Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003
introduced fixed penalty notices as an alternative to prosecution for
certain types of environmental crime, including graffiti and
fly-posting offences and, we believe, offers an effective and less
burdensome alternative to prosecution. Fixed penalty notices for
graffiti and fly-posting offences can currently be issued by local
authorities, the police and police community support officers who have
been designated by their chief officers.</div>
<a name="0902278000439"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of the
difficulties with the new clause and the further introduction of
community service punishments is that it would have implications, not
least for cost, a point to which the hon. Member for Chesterfield
alluded. For example, what about the practical and funding problems for
probation services or anyone tasked with ensuring that the community
service was carried out? It also runs counter to the current focus on
unpaid work in community service that is often directed towards highly

serious offences, and I use the word &#147;relatively&#148; because
I do not underestimate how serious graffiti and fly-posting can
be.</div><a name="0902278000440"></a><div class="hs_Para">Other
out-of-court disposals are available to address that kind of behaviour.
For example, adult conditional cautions allow low-level, low-risk and
mainly first-time offenders in uncontested cases to be offered a
caution with conditions attached. The conditions must either be
reparative, such as the payment of compensation to a victim or unpaid
work, or rehabilitative, to address the root causes of the offending
behaviour. Later this year, we will begin testing the youth conditional
caution. The youth restorative disposal is also currently being
piloted, which will allow low-level, low-risk, first-time young
offenders to undertake reparation for those types of offences and
similarly enable their conviction to be discharged if
completed.</div><a name="0902278000441"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
idea brought forward by the hon. Member for Chesterfield is
interesting. I am sure that we have not heard the last of it. I
reassure him and other Committee members that we are satisfied that we
have a comprehensive range of disposals available and do not need to go
down this route. I hope that he will withdraw the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902278000699"></a>Paul
Holmes:</b> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second
time.</div><a name="0902278000446"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
new clause would amend the Aviation Security Act 1982. It would
introduce new powers to direct a plane crossing British airspace to
land and be searched if it is suspected of involvement in unlawful
rendition. Proposals on this issue were tabled to the Civil Aviation 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column643" />Column number: 643</div>Bill and the Police and Justice Bill in 2006, but were unsuccessful.
Given the acknowledgment since that time that planes transporting
prisoners to countries where they faced torture and inhuman and
degrading treatment have come within the UK&#146;s jurisdiction, it
is appropriate to look at the matter again. Given that we debated the
1982 Act in earlier sittings, this Bill seemed to be the relevant place
to raise the matter
again.</div><a name="0902278000447"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
new clause would require the Secretary of State to take this action if
he or she thought that people were being unlawfully rendered in planes
that cross British airspace. There is the side issue of planes that
land to refuel on British territory, whether in this country or
airbases like Diego Garcia. That discussion has been rehearsed on other
occasions. It is unnecessary to go into the allegations that have been
made or the admissions that this has happened in UK territory and
airspace. The Government confirmed that our base on Diego Garcia had
been used at least twice for flights involved in extraordinary
rendition. We are not trying to reopen the argument about what has
happened in the
past.</div><a name="0902278000448"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given
the admissions that have been made, a line must be drawn and
legislation should be amended so that the UK can take action to carry
out its obligations under human rights legislation, international law
and as a signatory to conventions on the use of torture. We should not
by passive acquiescence be seen to condone such activity or to allow it
to take place in areas under our
jurisdiction.</div><a name="0902278000449"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
new clause is self-explanatory, so I leave it to others to
respond.</div><a name="0902278000450"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902278000700"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I do not want to detain the Committee in
relation to this new clause. Serious questions have been raised over
the Government&#146;s involvement in extraordinary rendition. What
activities may or may not have taken place must be considered further.
The underlying issue is that information must be provided and
assurances over future conduct given. More than anything, the new
clause is intended to promote and provoke debate and consideration of
these important issues. It also seeks to ensure that this country
complies with international conventions and human rights
legislation.</div><a name="0902278000451"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given
the hour and the time left to the Committee, I do not wish to embark
upon a full-scale debate on extraordinary rendition. That would not be
appropriate in the circumstances. However, we will continue to press
the Government on this issue and to raise questions. I will listen with
interest to the Minister&#146;s
response.</div><a name="0902278000452"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902278000701"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport (Jim
Fitzpatrick):</b> It is a pleasure to see you in the Chair
this afternoon, Mr. Bayley. This issue was debated at length
on a number of occasions when similar amendments were tabled on Report
to both the Civil Aviation and the Police and Justice Bills in 2006, as
the hon. Member for Chesterfield
said.</div><a name="0902278000453"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
main thrust of the new clause is to give the Secretary of State a
specific power to direct an aircraft overflying the UK to land and be
searched if it is believed that it is involved in an act of unlawful
rendition. However, the Chicago convention on international civil
aviation already allows a state to require a civil aircraft to land if
there are reasonable grounds to conclude that it is being used for any
purpose inconsistent with the aims of that convention. I therefore
suggest to the hon. Gentleman that the new clause is
unnecessary.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column644" />Column number: 644</div><a name="0902278000454"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the hon.
Member for Hornchurch suggested, I do not intend to go into the whole
debate on extraordinary rendition, but I have to respond to the
suggestions in the new clause. Before commenting in more detail, it
might help if I briefly explain the current requirements regarding
permission for foreign aircraft to land at UK airports and enter UK
airspace. Aircraft registered outside the EU and the European economic
area require the prior permission of the Secretary of State for
Transport to operate commercial flights into the UK. A shorthand
definition of a commercial flight is that fee-paying passengers or
cargo are being picked up or dropped off. That definition applies
equally to scheduled and charter flights. The obligation for operators
of international commercial aircraft to seek permission to land is set
out in articles 5 and 6 of the Chicago convention and reflected in UK
legislation in article 138 of the Air Navigation Order 2005.</div>
<a name="0902278000455"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Chicago
convention also provides that flights operated on a private basis, that
is flights for which payment has not been made to the operator for the
carriage of passengers or cargo, may overfly contracting states and
stop in them to refuel, or for other technical reasons, without prior
permission. Again, that is in article 5 of the
convention.</div><a name="0902278000456"></a><div class="hs_Para">State
aircraft&#151;those used in military, customs and police
services&#151;are required by article 3 of the convention to acquire
the authorisation of the foreign state to overfly or land. In the UK,
that is a matter for either the Secretary of State for Defence or the
Foreign Secretary. The procedures required for the authorisation of
state aircraft entering UK airspace or landing on UK territory are set
out in the diplomatic flight clearance procedure, which is derived from
article 3 of the convention. Clearance under those procedures does not
provide any immunity against breaches of national or international law
or regulations, or authorise the aircraft, its crew or passengers to
act in such a way that leads the UK to breach its international
obligations.</div><a name="0902278000457"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
right to fly over UK airspace without landing is given to scheduled
international air services by article 1 of the international air
services transit agreement&#151;a sister agreement to the Chicago
convention&#151;and prior permission is therefore not required. A
right of overflight for non-scheduled air services is granted by
article 5 of the Chicago convention, but is subject to the overflown
state&#146;s right to require the aircraft to
land.</div><a name="0902278000458"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
proposed new clause seeks to introduce an amendment to the Aviation
Security Act 1982 that would provide the Secretary of State with a
specific power to direct an aircraft in UK airspace to land. Further,
it would provide a power to search that aircraft or any other aircraft
already in the UK when there was any reason to believe that incorrect
information had been given under section 32 or 33 of the Immigration,
Asylum and Nationality Act 2006, or that the aircraft in question was,
had been, or might in the future be, involved in acts of unlawful
rendition.</div><a name="0902278000459"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
of the practical problems with the new clause is that it does not
specify the level of suspicion required to trigger a direction from the
Secretary of State that an aircraft must land. That could mean that any
allegation, whether or not supported by credible evidence, would be
sufficient to allow the Secretary of State to issue such a direction.
While I recognise that the purpose of the amendment is to address a
very serious issue and that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column645" />Column number: 645</div>there are difficulties in establishing evidence that an unlawful
rendition is taking place in sufficient time to act upon it, directing
an aircraft to land is a significant step and accordingly any such
direction should be based at least upon a reasonable suspicion of
wrongdoing.</div><a name="0902278000460"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
further practical problem with the new clause is that it would allow
the entry and search of any aircraft that there is reason to believe
has been or may be used for unlawful rendition. Allegations of past
misdeeds, whether proven or not, are no evidence that acts of unlawful
rendition are taking place on a current flight. Further, all aircraft
have the potential to be used for unlawful rendition and, taken
literally, the new clause would require every aircraft landing in the
UK to be searched. I certainly do not think that is the intention of
the hon.
Gentleman.</div><a name="0902278000461"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902278000702"></a>Paul
Holmes:</b> Obviously, we are talking about the discretion of
the Secretary of State, who would not apply it to every plane that flew
over. So far the Minister has confined his comments to civil aircraft
and argued that existing legislation covers that. These provisions
would apply to the military as
well.</div><a name="0902278000462"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902278000703"></a>Jim
Fitzpatrick:</b> I am happy that the hon. Gentleman has raised
that point, as I am just coming to it.</div>
<a name="0902278000463"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new clause
provides no discretion when it comes to the entry and search of an
aircraft directed to land or already on the ground in the UK if there
is any reason to suspect past, present or future involvement in
unlawful rendition. Once such a reason had been established, there
would be an obligation on responsible persons to search the aircraft
every time it landed in the UK in future, regardless of any change of
ownership, unless or until it had been established that the aircraft
was not, nor had ever been, involved in such operations. In the absence
of any distinction being drawn between state and non-state aircraft,
that has the potential to raise particular difficulties, especially
regarding military aircraft of the armed forces of visiting
states.</div><a name="0902278000464"></a><div class="hs_Para">Crucially,
however, as I mentioned earlier, the new clause is unnecessary as
article 3bis of the Chicago convention already allows a state to
require civil aircraft to land if there are reasonable grounds to
conclude that it is being used for any purpose inconsistent with the
aims of the convention. An act of unlawful rendition may well fall
within such a definition. We would nevertheless need to be very sure of
our intelligence before taking such a step. Furthermore, the police
have the power to search premises, including an aircraft, under
warrant. Applications for a warrant are made under section 8 of the
Police and Criminal Evidence Act. A search warrant will be granted
where a justice of the peace is satisfied that there are reasonable
grounds for believing that an indictable offence has been committed,
that there is relevant, admissible evidence on the premises and that
one of the conditions in section 8(3) is satisfied. We believe that
these powers could be used in a case in which an aircraft had been
required to land under the Chicago convention, but there would have to
be sufficient information to satisfy the court that there were
reasonable grounds for suspecting an indictable offence had been
committed.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column646" />Column number: 646</div><a name="0902278000465"></a><div class="hs_Para">As can be seen,
sufficient powers are already in place under existing legislation to
take action of the sort envisaged by this new clause, based on
reasonable suspicion. This view is supported by the Intelligence and
Security Committee&#146;s report into rendition, which
stated:</div><a name="0902278000512"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
are satisfied that, where there is sufficient evidence of unlawful
activity on board an aircraft in UK airspace, be it a rendition
operation or otherwise, this would be investigated by the UK
authorities.&#148;</div>
<a name="0902278000466"></a><div class="hs_Para">While we will
continue to keep these powers under review, the proposed new clause is
simply unnecessary. I therefore call on the hon. Member for
Chesterfield not to press his new
clause.</div><a name="0902278000467"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902278000704"></a>Paul
Holmes:</b> A number of issues arise following what the
Minister has said. The suggestion is that the legislation adequately
covers civil aircraft, but there are doubts about parts of it. The
Terrorism Act 2002, for example, gives</div>
<a name="0902278000513"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;police,
immigration and HM Customs and Excise the power to serve on the owner
or &#145;agents&#146; of an aircraft arriving in the UK a notice
requiring details of the crew and passengers, but this is limited to
cases involving
terrorism.&#148;</div><a name="0902278000468"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is limited to terrorism. There are other possible ramifications which
might not be covered by that provision, so the legislation is not
all-embracing. It applies only to civil aircraft. Unless I missed it,
the Minister did not go on to talk about military aspects. What is new
since the attempts to amend previous legislation in 2006 is that we
have had quite a humiliating climbdown by the Foreign Secretary, who
has twice had to admit that he unwittingly misled the House because he
had taken on good faith what the US Government had told
him.</div>
<a name="0902278000469"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902278000705"></a>Jim
Fitzpatrick:</b> I did say state aircraft, and obviously that
covers military as opposed to civilian aircraft, which formed the main
content of my
remarks.</div><a name="0902278000470"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902278000706"></a>Paul
Holmes:</b> I thank the
Minister.</div><a name="0902278000471"></a>

Holmes:</b> If it is state aircraft it would embrace
everything&#151;civil, military, specialist CIA flights. We all know
the old example of the famous Air America flights that operated in

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902278000709"></a>Mr.
Coaker:</b> On a point of order, Mr. Bayley, I know
that everybody wishes to get away, but may I take a minute or two to
thank people? This has been an extremely good Committee and the quality
of debate has generally been very good. Sometimes, when debate is
good-natured, even when there is disagreement, it helps the world go
round, and this has been a good Committee from that point of
view.</div><a name="0902278000480"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
thank the doorkeepers, the police, the staff of the House, the Clerks
and the <i class="I">Hansard </i>reporters for their efforts with the
Bill&#146;s delivery. I also thank my officials and my office for
putting various briefings together for me and for helping me
understand, as I have told members of the Committee, the issue of
extradition, which I find difficult. I know that the hon. Member for
Oxford, West and Abingdon loves it, but it is a bit of a trial for the
rest of
us.</div><a name="0902278000481"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thank
you, Mr. Bayley, for your chairmanship, and pass on my
thanks to your co-Chairman, Sir Nicholas. I thank my fellow Ministers,
my hon. Friends the Members for Tynemouth and for Poplar and Canning
Town, for their support and assistance with the Bill. The contribution
of my hon. Friend the Member for Poplar and Canning Town was a long
time coming, but it was worth waiting for, and I appreciate it. I also
thank my hon. Friend the Member for Dudley, North for his role as the
Government Whip on the Committee and the way in which he conducted his
work. I also thank my hon. Friend the Member for Sedgefield, who is
sitting behind me. My hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, North
made the point&#151;<i class="I">[Interruption.]</i> I am going to refer to
her, because I do not want to miss anyone
out&#151;<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> Do not worry, I will
mention others too. I wish to thank my hon. Friend, because she pointed
out&#151;I am familiar with this from my time on the Back
Benches&#151;that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column649" />Column number: 649</div>Ministers tend to thank everyone apart from their Back Benchers. I used
to sit there fuming about that, and actually took the matter up with
one or two Ministers. That made me determined not to do it if I found
myself in their position. May I therefore thank my hon. Friends the
Members for City of Durham, for Brigg and Goole, for Northampton, North
and for Stourbridge? They are not here, but I thank them for their
help.</div><a name="0902278000493"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent">I
thank the hon. Members for Hornchurch and for Bury St.
Edmunds&#151;<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> I have thanked my
hon. Friend the Member for City of Durham, but I am grateful for the
reminder. I thank the Opposition spokesmen for the way in which they
conducted the debate. The hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds once said to
me, when talking about the Committee, that they would not mess about.
That is an extremely reasonable statement and I hope he does not mind
me saying that in front of people&#151;it is an extremely appropriate
attitude. The hon. Member for Hornchurch and I have spent many an
hour&#151;many a week and many a month, it seems&#151;on Bills of
various sorts, and I appreciate the way in which he and his colleague
conducted themselves, with the support of their Back Benchers. It has
been a pleasure to have them here as well.</div>
<a name="0902278000482"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before I move
on from the Opposition, I thank the hon. Member for West Chelmsford. I
would like to say formally, on the record that, although it is
inappropriate to mention a couple of things&#151;and I mean this in
all seriousness&#151;some difficult arrangements have had to be made
between him and my hon. Friend the Member for Dudley, North. If it had
not been for his co-operation and help we would have had, through
nobody&#146;s fault, some very real difficulty. It is a great tribute
to him that he has not tried to mess about. He has recognised the
serious situation a couple of my hon. Friends were in and I thank him
very much for his co-operation and help, without which it would have
been extremely difficult&#151;I just put that on the
record.</div><a name="0902278000483"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
thank, too, the hon. Members for Chesterfield and for Oxford, West and
Abingdon for their contributions. The hon. Member for Oxford, West and
Abingdon and I often debate human rights issues of one sort or another,
and I try to take them into account. I thank the hon. Member for
Chesterfield, too, for his contributions to the debate. I think that I
have thanked everyone. Auntie Sylvia or Uncle Frank will appear
somewhere, Mr. Bayley. <i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i>
We will bring that forward in an order-making power by affirmative
resolution! To be serious, I have enjoyed the Committee: it has been an
excellent Committee. and I thank everyone who has contributed to our
deliberations.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902278000710"></a>The
Chairman:</b> That was not really a point of
order.</div><a name="0902278000485"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0902278000711"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Ruffley</b> (Bury St. Edmunds) (Con): Further to that
point of order, I thought that when the Minister stood up, he was going
to have a Kate Winslet moment. If I may be permitted to extend the
analogy, his was a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column650" />Column number: 650</div>very great performance. There should be an Oscar for the scriptwriters
on both sides. The Minister made a very good point: he relied on, or
got support and advice from, his officials who, from what I have seen
in the Committee, are extremely dedicated, professional and thorough,
and they should be
congratulated.</div><a name="0902278000486"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
advisers and supporters on this side should also be
congratulated&#151;those who assist me, my excellent and eloquent
hon. Friend the Member for Hornchurch and, of course, the Back Bench
support from my irreplaceable hon. Friends the Members for
Mid-Bedfordshire and for Bromsgrove. To pursue the analogy, we do not
need scriptwriters all the time, because what was evident from the
debate&#151;so far as the contributions from the Liberal Democrat
spokesman, the Minister, and from Conservative Members were
concerned&#151;was that there was a bit of thinking on one&#146;s
feet, a bit of debate and a bit of exploring what the issues were all
about without relying on the textbook answers. That is why my
scriptwriting Oscar analogy is, on reflection, probably inappropriate.
This has been a very good-natured, but also serious-minded, debate on a
raft of issues. The Minister referred to a conversation that we had
before this debate, so I shall repay him in kind by referring to one
that we had in the first week or so of our proceedings. He passed on
intelligence to me that those who have been following our
proceedings&#151;not only those in the police service, but the wider
policing family and those supporting it&#151;have remarked on the
fact that this has been a grown-up debate.</div>
<a name="0902278000487"></a><div class="hs_Para">Where
necessary, we have disagreed on ideological, party-political lines.
However, we have also found common centre ground where non-ideological
issues have been at stake and where the Minister and Conservative and
Liberal Democrat Members just wanted to find the best
answer&#151;that is to say, the best form of words and law that the
Committee could produce to assist the police service of this country. I
want to end on that note. At the end of the day, the Committee has been
trying to achieve a safer country, a better criminal justice system and
more effective law and order. Without those things, nothing else can
really happen in this
country.</div><a name="0902278000488"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902278000712"></a>The
Chairman:</b> On behalf of Sir Nicholas and myself, I thank
hon. Members for their kind remarks. In particular, I thank
Mr. Kennon and Mr. Shaw, the Clerks of the
Committee, without whom I would have been completely at sea and the
Committee would have been an utter mess. I thank them for their
support. I also thank the <i class="I">Hansard </i>writers for producing a record
of our proceedings, which is important. I agree that our proceedings
have been serious with some extremely good debates and some serious
questions to be resolved; they were resolved with good humour and a
very high quality of debate. It has been a real pleasure for me to sit
in the Chair. I have learned much from Members on both sides of the
House, and I thank them.</div>
