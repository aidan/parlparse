<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610118000353"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> No doubt it would have been a greater pleasure to
call my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge, Sir
Nicholas, to speak to the amendment, but I am delighted to serve under
your chairmanship once again. I am grateful for your reminder us that
this is the 17th sitting, although that shows how time slips by when
one is having fun. I had not realised that our considerations have been
so lengthy. I am also delighted to hear about Macclesfield&#146;s
success at Chester, where I spent a happy year at law school. Having
spent a little more time there in recent weeks, I know it to be a fine
county. <i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> It is the finest county,
although Oxfordshire is also pleasant. I confess that I am struggling
slightly with a cold, Sir Nicholas, so if the volume of my speech drops
below a certain level, I am sure that you will not be remiss in
requesting that I speak
up.</div><a name="080610118000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">Last
week, we debated paragraphs 1 and 2 of schedule 36, and I
said that although the powers were rather broad with regard to taxpayer
notices and third party notices, our main concern was that the
safeguards under paragraph 3, to which many of the amendments relate,
are key in determining whether the opening paragraphs of schedule 36
strike the right balance between the ability of Her Majesty&#146;s
Revenue and Customs to issue notices requesting information and
documents and the rights of taxpayers and third parties to protect
their
position.</div><a name="080610118000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph
3 sets out the circumstances in which taxpayer notices and third party
notices may be issued and provides a framework for that. It is worth
focusing on two points in the amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the
Member for Runnymede and Weybridge and myself. With regard to
amendments Nos. 244 and 245, it is worth explaining how paragraph 3(3)
will work. Paragraph 3(3)(c) states that a first-tier tribunal may not
approve the giving of a taxpayer notice or third party notice
unless</div><a name="080610118000270"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
person to whom the notice is addressed has been told that the
information or documents referred to in the notice are required and
given a reasonable opportunity to make representations to an officer of
Revenue and
Customs&#148;.</div><a name="080610118000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
circumstances in which a taxpayer notice is served, that paragraph
appears to be reasonable, because the taxpayer will be given that
notice and will have a reasonable opportunity to make representations.
However, professional bodies have highlighted their concerns about
circumstances in which that relates to a third party notice. In other
words, the third party must be notified that information or documents
are required, and be given a reasonable opportunity to make
representations to a Revenue and Customs officer. As the provision
stands, in such circumstances, the taxpayer will not be informed of the
notice or have the opportunity to take any action in response to it.
Consequently, the amendment suggests that not only the third party, but
the taxpayer, should be informed of the issue, have a reasonable
opportunity to make representations and the opportunity to produce the
information or
documents.</div><a name="080610118000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
discussion leads me to one of the broader themes with regard to
paragraph 3. I said last Thursday that this is an important part of the
Bill. It deals with everything to do with powers, particularly schedule
36. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column577" />Column number: 577</div>This is a good opportunity for the Minister to make it clear how these
powers will be used in practice. We expressed our view that it would be
better if some of the protections and the difficulties with guidance
were contained in statute. None the less, comments from Ministers with
regard to those powers provide useful
guidance.</div><a name="080610118000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
expect Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs, where possible, to
work co-operatively with taxpayers and third parties when using the
powers conferred under paragraphs 1 and 2 and the framework of
paragraph 3. When notices are issued, we expect that HMRC will be keen
that the taxpayer should co-operate and provide documents or
information on a voluntary basis. We hope that HMRC will not use all
its powers in the most aggressive manner as a matter of course, and
that they will be used as a last resort when the taxpayer does not
co-operate. We recognise that there are be circumstances in which
taxpayers do not co-operate, and that is the purpose of the
powers.</div><a name="080610118000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I mentioned on Thursday, having talked to a former senior official at
HMRC, often the tendency is for an investigating officer to use the
powers available to the limits, which is why we are concerned about
these powers. In responding to my comments on amendments Nos. 244 and
245, it may be appropriate for the Financial Secretary to address the
general issue of how HMRC will use the powers, and whether it will
expect taxpayers and third parties to co-operate before using the
powers to their
utmost.</div><a name="080610118000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 246 leads us to the important issue of rights of appeal. It is
worth noting that paragraph 3(1)
states:</div><a name="080610118000271"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;An
officer of Revenue and Customs may not give a third party notice
without</div><a name="080610118000272"></a><div class="hs_brev">(a)
the agreement of the taxpayer,
or</div><a name="080610118000273"></a><div class="hs_brev">(b)
the approval of the First-tier
tribunal.&#148;</div><a name="080610118000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
first option deals with my point about co-operation. However, when the
approval is granted by the first-tier tribunal, there is no particular
right of appeal. In such circumstances, it is important that we have
the necessary protections in paragraph
3.</div><a name="080610118000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have two points to make on amendment No. 246. First, the first-tier
tribunal should obtain all the facts when determining whether
permission should be granted to HMRC. It is not acceptable, therefore,
that under the current provisions, the first-tier tribunal receives
only a summary, prepared by HMRC, of representations from the relevant
person. Why should the first-tier tribunal not have the representations
as a whole? What is the purpose behind the word
&#147;summary&#148;? It does not appear to save HMRC any time. Why
should such a full representation not be given to the first-tier
tribunal?</div><a name="080610118000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
broader issue is addressed in amendment No. 247, which
states:</div><a name="080610118000274"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;No
notice shall be given by the First-tier Tribunal unless the person to
whom the notice is addressed and the taxpayer have been given notice of
a hearing at which the Tribunal is to consider the issue of the notice
and have been given an opportunity to attend the hearing and make
representations.&#148;</div><a name="080610118000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given
that there is no real right of appeal, the initial decision at least by
the first-tier tribunal should be made in such a way that there is due
process. There should be an opportunity for the relevant parties to
make representations to attend a hearing and then the first-tier
tribunal can make the decision. If the decision 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column578" />Column number: 578</div>is that the notice is correct and appropriate, so be it. At the moment
we have a system where, essentially, we go straight to the first-tier
tribunal. The only representations it will receive from somebody who
disputes the process will be through a summary prepared by HMRC of the
representations made by one of the
parties.</div>
<a name="080610118000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">I referred
earlier to amendments Nos. 244 and 245.</div>
<a name="080610118000035"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="080610118000354"></a><b class="B">Dr.
Nick Palmer</b> (Broxtowe) (Lab): Before the hon. Gentleman
moves on to the next group of amendments, does he not agree that they
are addressed by paragraph 4? Amendment No. 244 requires
that, if a third party is approached, the taxpayer should be informed,
but that requirement is specifically covered under paragraph 4 on page
353.</div><a name="080610118000036"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610118000355"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> There is a requirement, which can be disapplied, to
provide a copy of the notice, but it does not go on to give the
taxpayer the opportunity to produce the information or documents or to
make representations. Amendment No. 244 must be read in conjunction
with amendment No. 245. In a way, the hon. Gentleman makes a valuable
point in favour of amendment No. 245. If the taxpayer is to be given
that notice, he should have the opportunity to make representations, or
to produce the information or document. For the sake of completeness,
amendment No. 244 is still valid. The hon. Gentleman&#146;s comment
strengthens the case for amendment No. 245, so I am grateful for his
intervention.</div><a name="080610118000300"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.45
am</div><a name="080610118000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
potential objection to amendments Nos. 244 and 245 is that providing
the information to the taxpayer may prejudice the assessment or
collection of tax. If there is a concern that the taxpayer is involved
in fraudulent activity, the view could be taken that he should not be
told about that concern, and one would go to the third party, whether a
bank or the taxpayer&#146;s adviser, and seek to obtain information
or documents that way. It is worth drawing the Committee&#146;s
attention to paragraph 3(4) which
states:</div><a name="080610118000275"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Paragraphs
(c) to (e) of sub-paragraph (3) do not apply to the extent that the
First-tier Tribunal is satisfied that taking the action specified in
those paragraphs might prejudice the assessment or collection of
tax.&#148;</div><a name="080610118000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is therefore a protection in the Bill that addresses a legitimate
concern on the Government&#146;s
part.</div><a name="080610118000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 248 deals with what should be in an information notice, which
covers taxpayers and third parties. Paragraph 6 says that
the</div><a name="080610118000276"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;information
notice may specify or describe the information or documents to be
provided or
produced.&#148;</div><a name="080610118000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given
that the purpose of such notices is to specify that information or
those documents&#151;it would be difficult to comply with them if
they did not&#151;the word &#147;may&#148; is inappropriate, and
we suggest that it be replaced with &#147;must&#148;. If the
Financial Secretary can describe circumstances in which a notice would
not include that information, we will happily withdraw the amendment.
However, that wording appears to be
controversial.</div><a name="080610118000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 249 addresses the question of how long a period someone has to
provide information or produce a requested document. At the moment they
have as

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610118000358"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> What the hon. Member for Ealing, North pays
himself as rent might be of interest to others, but I am sure that it
is of no concern to the Committee. Does my hon. Friend the Member for
South-West Hertfordshire agree that that might be the appropriate way
to define a dwelling for those purposes? That would ensure that the man
in the street&#146;s understanding of a residential property is
protected, which we hope is what is
intended.</div><a name="080610118000049"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610118000359"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that useful
suggestion, and I ask the Financial Secretary to provide greater
clarification about what is meant by the phrase,</div>
<a name="080610118000279"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;used solely as
a dwelling&#148;.</div>
<a name="080610118000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 250
suggests that the wording should be expanded to cover a place that is
used &#147;solely or substantially&#148; as a dwelling. The pattern
of work is changing. Technological advances make it easier for more
people to work from home. The Government recognise that a dwelling
should be treated differently, and there is sensitivity about a
dwelling being a place from which documents or information should be
handed over. Perhaps the Financial Secretary can explain why there is
such sensitivity; we certainly recognise that it exists.</div>
<a name="080610118000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">I wonder
whether the definition,</div>
<a name="080610118000280"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;used solely as
a dwelling&#148;,</div>
<a name="080610118000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">is too tight, and
whether the family home would be used in these circumstances, when that
is probably not the Government&#146;s intention. Greater
clarification would therefore be helpful, although I am sure that we
will 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column580" />Column number: 580</div>return to this issue in our discussions of paragraph 10. Amendment No.
251 makes a similar point to amendment No. 249 about the period of time
in which documents must be produced. Again, we have suggested at least
30 days. There might be a case for saying that the period for producing
copies should be shorter than the period it takes to produce the
original documents, but we will listen to the Government&#146;s
arguments.</div>
<a name="080610118000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">Turning to
amendment No.270, which jumps us forward to paragraph 62, which has
given rise to a certain amount of comment. It deals with the important
definition of &#147;tax position&#148;, which runs through this
schedule, and refers to someone&#146;s position</div>
<a name="080610118000281"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;as
regards past, present and future liability to pay any
tax&#148;.</div>
<a name="080610118000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have no difficulty
with past or present liability to pay tax, but future liability is a
rather curious concept&#151;I am not sure about this and the Minister
will correct me if I am wrong&#151;that is recognised as giving HMRC
particular powers. Is it right that HMRC that can make use of the
various powers set out in schedule 36 with regard to future liability,
which is a tax liability which does not exist at the time at which
those powers are used? I do not know whether this signals a more
fundamental change to our tax system, but we have proposed an amendment
which is reasonable and not absolutist. We refer to any past or present
liability</div>
<a name="080610118000282"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;or any future
liability to the extent that it depends in whole or in part to any past
or present transactions&#148;,</div>
<a name="08061118000001"></a><div class="hs_Para">which addresses the Minister&#146;s
legitimate concerns. We would be grateful if she enlightened the
Committee about the thinking behind the proposed working definition of
&#147;tax position&#148;. We look forward to what the Minister has
to say regarding this first group of
amendments.</div><a name="080610118000055"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610118000360"></a>Dr.
Palmer:</b> May I speak briefly to amendments Nos.
244 to 247, which seem to be a bit of a drafting mess, with due
respect.</div>
<a name="080610118000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">The position
in the Bill seems balanced and clear. Paragraph 3 of schedule 36
discusses the issuance of third-party notices, with the due safeguards
to which the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire referred.
Sub-paragraph (4) requires that the taxpayer should be informed unless
there is a good reason why not. Amendment No. 244 somewhat duplicates
sub-paragraph (4) but amendment No. 247 goes further and requires
that</div>
<a name="080610118000283"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;No
notice shall be given...unless the person to whom the notice is
addressed and the taxpayer have been given notice of a
hearing...to consider the issue of the notice&#148;.</div>
<a name="080610118000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">Contrary to
what the hon. Gentleman told us earlier, amendment No. 247 is not
qualified by sub-paragraph (4). In other words, even if the first-tier
tribunal believes that the actions would prejudice the assessment or
collection of tax, that would not apply to his new
sub-paragraph.</div>
<a name="080610118000058"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610118000361"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I concede that the hon. Gentleman raises a fair
point. As I was reading through the amendments again, I could see the
difficulty that he mentioned. I do not quibble with what he is saying.
Making amendment No. 247 subject to the provisions of paragraph 3(4)
could improve the
measure.</div><a name="080610118000059"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610118000362"></a>Dr.
Palmer:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his
open-mindedness. I think that we agree on what we are trying to
achieve: the taxpayer should be informed, unless there is good reason
why he should not be. As it  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column581" />Column number: 581</div>stands, the wording of paragraph 3(3) together with paragraph 3(4)
covers that. I encourage him to consider withdrawing the amendments
relating to those. I will not address the
others.</div>
<a name="080610118000060"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610118000363"></a>The
Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Jane Kennedy):</b> It is
a pleasure, Sir Nicholas, to be here this morning serving under your
chairmanship. Many of us would claim that our boroughs were
&#147;our&#148; boroughs, but few with the authority that you can
with Macclesfield. I congratulate Macclesfield on its success at the
weekend.</div>
<a name="080610118000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">I cannot
disagree with a word that my hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe has
said and will come to the detail of that amendment shortly. The hon.
Member for South-West Hertfordshire moved several amendments out of a
concern that I have heard expressed by a number of people as the powers
have been developed and the consultation has gone through the usual
process. His questions deserve a proper and reasonable
answer.</div>
<a name="080610118000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">Once again,
the amendments all seek to add extra safeguards to the provisions about
information powers. In a broader debate last Thursday, we talked about
the overall aim of the changes that schedule 36 introduces. The
amendments would reduce flexibility and affect HMRC&#146;s
effectiveness, particularly in dealing with the minority of taxpayers
who do not wish to comply. To safeguard the majority, it is important
that I set out what HMRC&#146;s intent is.</div>
<a name="080610118000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">Tribunal
approval is required before an information notice can be issued to a
third party. Amendments Nos. 244 and 245 seek further safeguards to
require the taxpayer to be informed and, in addition, to enable them to
make representations to the third party. In practice, there are two
situations in which HMRC needs to approach third parties. The first
involves a taxpayer who may have a gap in their records, but is
otherwise generally compliant, and information is being sought to fill
that gap. In those situations, HMRC would normally ask the taxpayer to
obtain the information from the third party. There may be occasions in
which the third party would refuse to provide that information to the
taxpayer, so the notice is needed. In those circumstances, the taxpayer
would be aware that a notice had been issued and of what it was
requesting.</div><a name="080610118000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second situation is where a taxpayer is suspected of concealing the
truth from HMRC. HMRC then has to verify the true position with
evidence from third parties. In such a situation, tax could be
prejudiced if the taxpayer were made aware of HMRC&#146;s intentions.
Therefore, the amendment does not add a great deal to the Bill for
compliant taxpayers, as they have already had the chance to discuss
matters with HMRC and to influence the notice. Where a deliberate
mis-declaration of tax was suspected, the amendment would be overridden
by paragraph (3)(4) in the way that my hon. Friend the Member for
Broxtowe described.</div>
<a name="080610118000301"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11
am</div><a name="080610118000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">HMRC
will be able to ask for information from a third party only with the
consent of either the taxpayer or the independent tribunal. Amendment
No. 246 seeks to replace the requirement to give the tribunal a summary
of representations, replacing that with a requirement to provide full
representations. Summaries are often better as they highlight the
salient facts and can explain complex matters in plain English. HMRC
does use plain English. Some representations are made
verbally&#151;&#151;<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column582" />Column number: 582</div>Or, indeed, in a foreign language. It would be an extra burden to make
taxpayers put them in writing, especially low-income tax
payers.</div>
<a name="080610118000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">A summary
must include all the facts and must not omit any issues. Existing case
law shows that a notice is vulnerable under judicial review if HMRC has
not made the tribunal properly aware of all representations it has
received. Where the tribunal wished to see full representations,
therefore, it would be able to do so. Where the taxpayer&#146;s
representations are in writing and set out their case, the officers
would just provide a copy of the representations to the tribunal. The
amendment does not therefore give any better protection and it could be
worse for some more vulnerable taxpayers. I understand, however, the
reason behind the questions that have arisen from the
legislation.</div>
<a name="080610118000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 247 seeks to give taxpayers and recipients of notices a right to
make representations in person to the first-tier tribunal. This is
really a matter for the Ministry of Justice to decide upon, not
something for a Finance Bill. However, HMRC is exploring this with the
new tribunals. The consideration will be taken forward once the
tribunals are established. There are difficulties over taxpayer
confidentiality and prejudicing the case where the third party and
taxpayer are present for the whole hearing. Members of the Committee
can imagine what those would be. We do think that it would be helpful
for parties to make their representations in person to the tribunal as
that would allow the tribunal to clarify particular points and ask
questions. In principle, therefore, we think this is fine.</div>
<a name="080610118000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 248 seeks to restrict the scope of information notices by replacing
&#147;may&#148; with &#147;must&#148;, as described by the hon.
Member for South-West Hertfordshire. Where HMRC knows the nature of the
information and the documents, they will be specified but there are
times when the exact nature is not known so the notice will need to be
worded a little more vaguely. For example, a notice might say,
&#147;all documentation relating to the sale of the White house in
New Town&#148;. Or it might say, &#147;details of all company cars
purchased in 2009&#148;.</div>
<a name="080610118000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">As far as
possible, HMRC will limit the scope. For example, I know there has been
concern where a company was required to send in all e-mails from a
particular year. That clearly goes far wider than is necessary or of
benefit to anybody. There is no intention on the part of HMRC to seek
that width of information. There is certainly no intention on the part
of HMRC to do the job of accountants. The only purpose of seeking
information and being vague would be because they did not know the
exact definition. I hope my examples give an indication of the sort of
information that will be sought.</div>
<a name="080610118000070"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="080610118000364"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Peter Bone</b> (Wellingborough) (Con): It is a pleasure, Sir
Nicholas, to serve under your chairmanship. When I was in practice
dealing with these matters, especially on investigations, the Revenue
would employ very wide definitions when in fact they could have been
much tighter. I have seen no evidence in practice, therefore, that the
Revenue is doing
that.</div><a name="080610118000071"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610118000365"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> I am aware of one example in particular where a
bank was asked for all e-mails. I do not quarrel with the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s experience but this has been the practice in the
past. I said earlier that the changes 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column583" />Column number: 583</div>that are being made&#151;the reforms we are making to the
powers&#151;mean that, in some areas, HMRC accepts that it must rein
back those powers. It is not in its interests to have that huge range
of information, which must require huge resources to work through. Its
whole purpose is to make sure that the appropriate taxes are paid, not
to impose unnecessary burdens on
business.</div><a name="080610118000072"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610118000366"></a>Dr.
Palmer:</b> I share the concern that we do not open a loophole
to allow, as the Minister says, a requirement for all e-mails over the
last year, or something like that. This section is qualified, though,
by the original paragraph 1, which says:</div>
<a name="080610118000073"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
information is reasonably required by the officer for the purpose of
checking the taxpayer&#146;s tax
position&#148;.</div><a name="080610118000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
assume the tribunal would refuse to allow a notice where some
ridiculous request was
made.</div><a name="080610118000075"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610118000367"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> Indeed, that would be my expectation and as we
discussed before, HMRC is required to act &#147;reasonably&#148;
and there is a very well understood meaning of that
word.</div><a name="080610118000076"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="080610118000368"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mark Field</b> (Cities of London and Westminster) (Con):
Notwithstanding our discussion, which has been useful in focusing on
where HMRC is trying to operate, given the concerns expressed in our
initial debate last week about fishing expeditions, where is the
incentive for HMRC to have as narrow a focus as possible? Is it
possible to construct a financial disincentive? Since some
administrative costs would clearly be incurred in a larger inquiry than
was strictly necessary and genuinely reasonable, could we ensure that
any party that lost out or incurred significant administrative costs as
a result of such an inquiry could be compensated? My concern is the
lack of any incentive for HMRC to behave in a narrow, focused
way.</div><a name="080610118000077"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610118000369"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> That is a very fair point. The incentive is the
pressure&#151;&#151;the requirement&#151;&#151;on HMRC, to act
in every way as efficiently as possible. Even if it was charging for
the administrative costs, it has finite human resources and if its
human resources were deployed in that way, it would seem to me, as the
Minister to whom it is accountable, that that is not the best use of
the resources available and that it could deploy them to areas of
greater risk. The requirement on HMRC to act reasonably, in my view,
includes a reasonable use of the resources HMRC has at its disposal. I
hope that in our brief discussion this morning I have explained the
purpose behind the reforms and why I think the amendment is
unnecessary, although I appreciate the spirit in which it was
moved.</div><a name="080610118000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 249 and 251 are too inflexible in insisting that 30 days should
always be given for the production of documents and information. In
many cases, the information will be readily to hand and officers can
use discretion in setting a time limit. They must act reasonably and be
able to show that they have acted reasonably. The time allowed would
usually be agreed with the taxpayer in
advance.</div><a name="080610118000079"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610118000370"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> Again, going back to my experience, it used to annoy
me enormously when we were served with a notice to supply a lot of
documents within, say, 30 days. We would provide these documents, it
would be a very long time before the Revenue ever bothered to get 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column584" />Column number: 584</div>back to us and then they would serve us with another short period
notice. Putting in a minimum of 30 days would be a safeguard that would
not damage the Revenue but would be very helpful to people in
business.</div><a name="080610118000080"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610118000371"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> I hear what the hon. Gentleman says. I am advised
that HMRC, where it is appropriate and because there may be a lot of
documents in deep storage that it needs to see, would often allow more
than 30 days where it was necessary. His point would be covered if HMRC
would deal in more co-operatively with the taxpayer, in the way we have
just been discussing. I want to give some thought to his point and do
some further probing of my
own.</div><a name="080610118000081"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610118000372"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I am grateful to the Financial Secretary. She has
given a reasonable response to my hon. Friend the Member for
Wellingborough. She mentioned circumstances where documents will be
readily available and where 30 days will therefore be too long. I
acknowledge that point, but we are talking about a minimum. What does
she think would be reasonable? Would it be reasonable for the documents
to be handed over in 24 hours, 48 hours or is she talking about seven
days? With documents that are not vast and which are readily available,
what should be the minimum? After how long would it be reasonable for
an HMRC officer to say, &#147;Please hand it
over.&#148;?</div><a name="080610118000082"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610118000373"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> As I recall, there will be a greater requirement
on taxpayers to have good documentation available. That ought to mean
that it will be reasonable to demand it. This will be done on a
case-by-case basis as the work develops. A change of culture is
required in HMRC to make this work in the way that I am describing.
There may be occasions when HMRC needs to ask for further documents. It
would be unreasonable to impose a 30-day period on every occasion,
particularly when the taxpayer is compliant and only wants to get their
records in
order.</div><a name="080610118000083"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610118000374"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> The Financial Secretary is describing exactly the
problem that taxpayers face. They are asked for a huge amount of
information, usually within 30 days. After they provide that
information, six months goes by with nothing happening and with no
information available to the taxpayer. They are then served with
another 30-day notice for further information. This uneven-handed
approach by the Revenue is wrong. I have seen no evidence that it is
changing its
practices.</div><a name="080610118000084"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610118000375"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> I want to give a lot of thought to what has been
said on this issue, particularly by the hon. Gentleman who is bringing
his own valuable experience to the Committee. As things stand, my
strong view is that to require 30 days on every occasion is unnecessary
and too restrictive. I will see what can be done to allay his concerns
and to improve the experience of taxpayers that he
describes.</div><a name="080610118000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
amendment No. 250, allowing no production of documents at a building
substantially used as a dwelling would be impractical, particularly for
VAT purposes. Where businesses are run from dual-purpose buildings, the
term &#147;substantially&#148; adds no real protection as it needs
interpretation. It will not be possible for HMRC to visit private
residences that are not used for business purposes without the
taxpayer&#146;s consent. That has been 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column585" />Column number: 585</div>a huge area of concern in business. The exceptions are in criminal
investigation cases or for taxes not covered by the
schedule.</div><a name="080610118000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
most cases, it is clear whether premises are for business or private
use. We cannot set out every situation in legislation, but the
legislation sets out the principal aim that HMRC should be able to
inspect a business, but not a private home. The correct place to
explore borderline cases and give examples is in guidance, which will
be produced in partnership with taxpayer representatives. That is an
approach taken by other public bodies that need to distinguish between
businesses and private premises. One example is the council tax banding
authority. It has been suggested that we use the same definitions as
local authorities and I am open to that. HMRC will consult in full on
the production of the
guidance.</div><a name="080610118000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is general concern from external commentators about the relevance of
checking records for income tax and corporation tax before the tax
return for the year in question has been completed, which amendment No.
270 seeks to address. The new powers under the schedule and the
proposals we will be making in respect of time limits are designed to
allow HMRC to make compliance checks on a cross tax risk-assessed
basis.</div>
<a name="080610118000302"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.15
am</div><a name="080610118000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
powers can be used without a tax return being issued and completed
first. This is new for income tax, capital gains tax and corporation
tax and it is true to say that it has not been universally supported in
consultations. None the less, I am persuaded and HMRC certainly
believes that it is essential to enable it to be flexible in the
different circumstances that it encounters. HMRC should be able to ask
simple questions of taxpayers who do not normally file tax returns,
without putting them to the trouble of completing a tax return that
might ultimately prove unnecessary. It should also be able to check
those persons who do not submit returns because they trade in the
hidden
economy.</div>
<a name="080610118000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">Where that
is identified, it makes sense to approach the person, ask the questions
and establish the tax that needs to be paid for all of the years
concerned, rather than sending them a large number of years&#146;
worth of income tax, VAT and pay-as-you-earn returns to complete. As I
said earlier, good records are fundamental to accurate returns. HMRC
should be able to check that the records that are kept will allow a
correct return to be made. It is sensible that HMRC should be able to
correct poor record keeping before incorrect returns are filed and
penalties are
incurred.</div><a name="080610118000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">Furthermore,
where there is a risk of evasion or serious abuse of the tax system and
the taxpayer is likely to move on&#151;as I have said, that does
happen&#151;HMRC cannot afford to wait for a return to be issued and
completed, as it needs to act as soon as the risk is identified. In
order to address all those circumstances, these powers have been
designed to check a tax position, which has necessarily been defined in
a wide sense. HMRC will only check things on a visit that it is
legitimate to check. An officer will check whether records have been
kept, which is an ongoing requirement, but they cannot assess tax that
is not yet due. There is no need to enshrine that protection
specifically, as it is already inherent in the
legislation.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column586" />Column number: 586</div><a name="080610118000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">Overall, the
amendments go too far in restricting HMRC&#146;s ability to see
information and documents, but I understand the motive behind their
tabling. I appreciate that there are genuine concerns, which I hope I
have been able to allay this morning. I hope that the amendment will be
withdrawn.</div><a name="080610118000092"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610118000376"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> We have had a useful debate. There is much that the
Financial Secretary has said this morning that will be viewed with
interest and probably welcomed in many quarters. Amendments Nos. 244
and 245, which should be taken together, make a reasonable point,
particularly amendment No. 245. I shall not press either amendment to a
vote, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw them, because the Financial
Secretary has provided some reassurance as to how the powers contained
in paragraph (3) will operate. I shall also seek leave to withdraw
amendment No. 246, although I am not 100 per cent.
persuaded&#151;</div><a name="080610118000093"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610118000377"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. The hon. Gentleman does not have to
announce that he will seek leave to withdraw anything but the lead
amendment. If he wants to seek a Division on any of the amendments and
makes a request to me in the Chair, I would certainly consider it. The
only amendment that he need seek leave to withdraw is the lead
amendment.</div><a name="080610118000094"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610118000378"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I am grateful, Sir Nicholas, for your guidance. I
will indeed press for a Division on one of the amendments, but I will
stop begging to withdraw the other amendments. On the requirement to
give a summary, which we have queried, the Minister&#146;s remarks
are helpful. She said that where there are written representations,
those will be provided to the relevant person. The summary will also be
provided to the third party. That is helpful, and essentially addresses
our concern. She points out that that will enable HMRC to provide the
information in plain English. We are talking about the first-tier
tribunal, which should be capable of understanding something a little
more complex. I am therefore not persuaded by that argument, but the
reassurances that she otherwise provided were
helpful.</div><a name="080610118000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
appeal process is being worked out with the Ministry of Justice, which
underlines my earlier point that many of these measures do not fit well
with the Finance Bill. The appeal process is a broader issue. We will
wait to see the outcome of those discussions, but I hope that the House
of Commons will have the opportunity to look at the measures again, so
that we can get the balance right. I am not convinced by the Financial
Secretary&#146;s response on amendment No. 248. She gave an example
in which it would be too prescriptive to use &#147;must&#148;
instead of &#147;may&#148;. In the circumstances to which she
referred&#151;she used the example of &#147;the White house in New
Town&#148;&#151;there is a description in the Bill of the
information or documents to be provided, rather than a specification,
and the arguments apply, whether we use &#147;may&#148; or &#147;
must&#148;. Having said that, what she said overall on the amendment
was helpful. It is of some comfort that HMRC will not misuse the
measure and engage in &#147;fishing expeditions&#148;, to use an
expression deployed by my hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London
and
Westminster.</div><a name="080610118000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
amendments Nos. 249 and 251, I touched on the argument for greater
flexibility regarding the time limit. We are talking about a minimum
period, and the compliant 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column587" />Column number: 587</div>taxpayer to whom the Financial Secretary referred may be able to respond
more quickly. I know that HMRC will use its discretion, but greater
guidance would be helpful. However, I will not press the amendment, nor
will I press amendment No. 250, as we will return to the debate about
the phrase, &#147;used solely or substantially&#148; as a dwelling
when we discuss paragraph
10.</div><a name="080610118000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
amendment No. 270 addresses future liability, and the use of the powers
with regard to a tax return that is not yet due. The wording that we
have introduced addresses the circumstances to which the Financial
Secretary referred, where there is a need for HMRC to act early
regarding the long-compliant taxpayer who may be about to disappear. At
that point there will be a future liability in respect of past or
present transactions, and I was therefore not persuaded that the
Government proposals reasonably address the concerns of the
professional bodies to which the Financial Secretary referred, or
accommodate the needs of HMRC, which she outlined. When we reach
paragraph 62 and amendment No. 270, I will press the amendment to a
Division.</div><a name="080610118000098"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610118000379"></a>The

leave to withdraw amendment No. 244, but is giving notice that he
wishes seek a Division on amendment No. 270 when we reach that point.

amendment.</div><a name="080610118000099"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

Jeremy Browne</b> (Taunton) (LD): Good morning, Sir Nicholas.
I will try to keep the tempo high, as the Minister indicated she would.
Amendments Nos. 165 to 169 were tabled by my hon. Friends and myself.
It might be helpful for the Committee if I go through the amendments
systematically and explain the purpose of each of them in
turn.</div>
<a name="080610118000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">To be fair,
the Government have demonstrated a willingness to be open-minded
through some of their amendments. There has been some well-intentioned
movement from the Government in response to representations from
relevant outside bodies, which I am sure the Committee will broadly
support. Amendment no. 165 defines the word &#147;inspect&#148; to
prevent inspectors rifling through the drawers of people they choose to
inspect. The drafting in the Bill is extremely wide and could
conceivably allow HMRC greater access to the private possessions of the
taxpayer who is being inspected than we would wish. The amendment would
add a new sub-paragraph to paragraph 10(1), which would exclude the
searching of premises&#151;the intention is to cover non-business
premises&#151;and personal effects. Some of that was touched on in
the discussions we had earlier this morning.</div>
<a name="080610118000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">My party and
I welcome Government amendments Nos. 220 to 222, especially the
explicit exclusion of areas used solely as a dwelling, but our belief,
nevertheless, is that the word &#147;inspect&#148; is not defined
adequately. There is concern in some quarters that it may be
interpreted in the broadest possible sense by those carrying out the
inspections.</div>
<a name="080610118000303"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 166 has been overtaken by the Government acting to an even greater
extent than we envisaged, but it would increase the notice period for
an inspection from 24 to 72 hours, or from one day to three days. The
Government have tabled amendment No. 222 which goes further and extends
the notice period to seven days. That is beyond our greatest
expectations, and we are extremely supportive of the Government in that
regard, albeit with one caveat. An HMRC officer&#146;s ability to
bypass the notice period stipulated in paragraph 10(3)(b) means that
the period of seven days, as detailed 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column589" />Column number: 589</div>in Government amendment No. 222, would not necessarily apply in all
circumstances. We are concerned that the circumstances in which it
would not apply may be used by HMRC inspectors too freely and
liberally. In other regards, amendment No. 166 has become redundant as
a result of the Government&#146;s own
amendment.</div><a name="080610118000304"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.30
am</div><a name="080610118000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 167, in my name, requires more senior accountability if no notice
period is required. It follows the point I was making with regard to
the previous amendment: because of reservations in our party regarding
sub-paragraph (3)(b), even with the Government amendment I have just
described, amendment No. 167 would replace the
description,</div><a name="080610118000284"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;an
authorised officer of Revenue and Customs&#148;,</div>
<a name="080610118000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">with a requirement
that a first-tier tribunal give authorisation for the seven-day notice
period to be bypassed. The tribunal is a more appropriate mechanism,
because of its impartiality in such investigations, and it would
provide greater protection for the taxpayer.</div>
<a name="080610118000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 168 says that notice must be given appropriately. This would remove
paragraph 10(4)(c) which requires a notice
to</div><a name="080610118000285"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;be
left in a prominent place on the premises&#148;.</div>
<a name="080610118000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">My colleagues and I
regard that as an inadequate safeguard, and would replace it with the
requirement that the notice should be provided directly to the occupier
or the relevant person in person, rather than merely being left in a
prominent place on their premises.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610118000383"></a>Dr.
Palmer:</b> There will be cases in which a business is no
longer operating and, even if it is not formally defunct, there is
nobody about. How would the hon. Gentleman pursue the issue in that
case?</div><a name="080610118000125"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610118000384"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> It is not my job to pursue it, but I can see why
the hon. Gentleman asks the question. The safeguard we are trying to
enshrine in law is that, in the circumstances that he described, the
person against whom the notice has been issued would not be presumed to
have failed to comply if they did not realise they had received the
notice in the first place. He gave an example in which a notice could
be put in a prominent place in premises, although the intended
recipient of that notice may not be there to receive it. In those
circumstances it would be difficult to conclude that someone was
failing to comply with HMRC investigations, if they did not even know
that HMRC required them to comply. The task would then be for HMRC to
identify and track down the individual concerned. The intention of the
amendment is that it ought to do so. In most cases, however, the
Committee will agree that it would be far more straightforward, and
would involve pressing the documentation into the hand of the
recipient, rather than assuming that they had received it. I accept
that in some particular and exceptional cases that may present the HMRC
with a greater challenge to achieve their objective.</div>
<a name="080610118000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 169, which is the final Liberal Democrat amendment in this group,
protects the rights of the individual. Paragraph 10(5) requires the
penalties of obstructing an officer to be explained in the notice, but
it says nothing at all about the rights of the taxpayer against whom
the notice is issued. The amendment 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column590" />Column number: 590</div>would remove that provision, and insert a requirement for the notice to
explain the rights of the occupier whose premises are searched and the
rights of any person falling under the requirements of paragraph 10(1).
In other words, the person whose tax position is the subject of the
search can expect their legal rights in those circumstances to be
formally explained to them.</div>
<a name="080610118000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
underlying concern, as touched on by other Members, is that
occasionally, HMRC&#151;and I shall put this delicately&#151;has a
zealous desire to fulfil its duties as effectively as possible. While
that is admirable in many respects, it can mean that the person who is
on the receiving end of that zeal feels that they are being unfairly
and harshly treated, and that it is not sufficiently clear to them what
their rights are in those circumstances. That is what amendment No. 169
seeks to address.</div>
<a name="080610118000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">Government
amendment No. 220 will restrict access for inspection, so that the tax
position of the person whose business it is can be inspected, rather
than &#147;any person&#148;, which was the original intention. It
is specifically the owner of the business who will be required to
comply. While my party welcomes attempts to add clarity and to specify
the recipient of the notice, the change has raised some questions in my
mind and in the minds of my colleagues, and it would be usefully if the
Financial Secretary addressed them. Will documents relating to
employees be excluded from inspection because they do not own the
business? If we move, as the Government envisage, from &#147;any
person&#148; to the person whose business it is, what is the status
of people who are related to, or employed by, the business? Under a
literal interpretation of Government amendment No. 220, such people
will no longer be required to comply in the way that I think the
Government would
want.</div><a name="080610118000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
seek to be helpful in making a point about Government amendment No.
222. As I have already said, I welcome the extension of the notice
period required for an inspection from 24 hours to seven days. Liberal
Democrat amendment No. 166 was designed to extend that period, and the
Government have more than doubled the period that we sought. We are
grateful for the step that the Government have taken, but the
Government amendment will not remove lines 24 to 26 of paragraph 10,
which allow the notice period to be bypassed by an authorised officer
of HMRC. Although Government amendment No. 222 is an extremely welcome
step in the right direction, it would be helpful if the Financial
Secretary addressed my
reservations.</div><a name="080610118000130"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610118000385"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Before I call the hon. Member for South-West
Hertfordshire, may I draw attention to amendment (a) tabled by Her
Majesty&#146;s Opposition? It is an amendment to a Government
amendment. Should the Opposition wish to press it, although it appears
on the amendment paper after Government amendment No. 222, it would
have to be taken before
it.</div><a name="080610118000131"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610118000386"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> Thank you, Sir Nicholas, for your guidance to the
Committee.</div><a name="080610118000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">Like
the hon. Member for Taunton, we welcome the Government&#146;s
flexibility on paragraph 10. It is an important provision that will
give HMRC the power to inspect business premises. It has produced a
fair amount of comment. We welcome the increase in the notice period
before an inspection of premises from 24 hours to seven 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column591" />Column number: 591</div>days. As you mentioned, Sir Nicholas, we have tabled amendment (a),
which would extend that to 14 days. I hope that the Financial Secretary
will not consider that this is an example where, if the Government give
an inch, we seek a mile. I hope that we are not being unduly
unreasonable.</div><a name="080610118000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is always a question of judgment when assessing what is a reasonable
period for any purpose. We started with 24 hours, the Liberal Democrats
proposed 72 hours, the Government have said seven days and
the Law Society and the Institute of Chartered Accountants have
suggested 14 days. That is reflected in amendment (a). Where do we draw
the line? Should it be 28 days, or even 42 days? I thought about
tabling an amendment for 42 days and saying that we were adamant that
that should not be reduced because it was a matter of confidence, but
we decided not to pursue that route. However, there is an issue when
people are sent a notice while on holiday, because the period may
elapse while they are still away. That is the argument for extending it
beyond seven days, but I do not want to be in any way churlish about
the fact that the Government have moved from 24 hours, which would have
been wrong.</div>
<a name="080610118000134"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610118000387"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> I wonder whether the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
concern about people on holiday might be addressed were the Government
to concede the point that I was trying to make earlier about the notice
being issued to the recipient in person, rather than just put in their
premises so that they might happen to chance upon
it.</div><a name="080610118000135"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610118000388"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> Possibly. The hon. Gentleman makes a reasonable
point in mentioning that as a way of addressing the issue. In these
circumstances, the Government are worried that the person in question
would receive the notice and then start destroying documents and
concealing evidence. In that case, 24 hours leaves the Government
vulnerable to that, as would seven days, 72 hours or 14 days. That is
not what the Government have in mind. The concern here is an
administrative one about how quickly they can come along, inspect the
premises and look at documents contained there. There is no matter of
principle on how long the period is, as it is just a matter of
administrative convenience. In those circumstances, and in light of the
representations that have been made by the Institute of Chartered
Accountants and the Law Society, we urge the Government to show even
greater flexibility and consider whether 14 days would be more
appropriate. We look forward to what the Minister has to say on
that.</div>
<a name="080610118000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">With regard
to paragraph 10 and the relevant amendments in this group, I encourage
the Financial Secretary to give as much comfort as possible that the
powers outlined will not be used over-aggressively. By that I mean
that, where the taxpayer is looking to co-operate, HMRC will agree a
date on which business premises will be inspected as a matter of course
and that HMRC officers will be expected to reach agreement and not
behave in a heavy-footed and determined
way.</div><a name="080610118000137"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610118000390"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I did not want to use the expression jack-booted,
but perhaps it was what I was looking for.</div>
<a name="080610118000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are

in laying down the law or say, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column592" />Column number: 592</div>&#147;We are going to come in on a particular day, whether you like it
or not&#148;, but will seek to accommodate the reasonable requests of
the taxpayer. A key point for the Financial Secretary to address in her
response is reassurance that those powers will be used in exceptional
circumstances, rather than as a matter of
course.</div><a name="080610118000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some
of the amendments that we tabled, as was the case with those of the
Liberal Democrats, have been rather swept up in subsequent Government
amendments. However, I would like to highlight Government amendment No.
221, which includes the reference that we mentioned earlier about
premises being</div>
<a name="080610118000141"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;used solely as
a dwelling&#148;.</div>
<a name="080610118000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">I reiterate that I am
not sure that that provides as much comfort as the Government perhaps
wanted, as working patterns are changing and more people do some work
from home. The definition of premises that are</div>

a dwelling&#148;</div>
<a name="080610118000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">is not as effective as
it might be, given that the Government acknowledge the sensitivity
about going to people&#146;s homes. It is particularly acute in
paragraph 10&#151;more so than when we were referring to it in
relation to the earlier group of amendments&#151;when HMRC officers
are going to be storming around someone&#146;s home. There is a
sensitivity there, which the Government recognise, given the first
words of amendment No. 221, but is that sensitivity fully addressed
when we have a tight definition of premises</div>

amendment No. 225 reiterates wording that was in the original paragraph
10, which includes within the definition of premises &#147;any means
of transport&#148;. I would be grateful if the Minister enlightened
the Committee about what that means. Does it give HMRC the power to
inspect people&#146;s cars? What happens if a car is in a garage, for
example? How would the amendment work and is it an exceptional
provision? When will HMRC consider it necessary to inspect
people&#146;s
cars?</div><a name="080610118000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 269 relates to regulations made under paragraph 58(3) for the
Government to provide a definition of when someone is carrying on a
business. I would like to know when the Government envisage that that
will be necessary. To what circumstances does the provision
relate?</div><a name="080610118000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
amendment No. 169, tabled by the Liberal Democrats, the hon. Member for
Taunton raised the valuable point that the existing wording refers to
the consequences of obstructing an HMRC officer, but does not say
anything about the rights available to a taxpayer. I have no particular
objection to the notice informing a taxpayer of the consequences of
obstructing an HMRC officer, so I do not support deleting that
reference, but it would be valuable for the rights available to the
taxpayer to be known and for the taxpayer to be informed of them.
Perhaps the Minister could provide some comfort in Committee by saying
that people will be informed of their rights in the circumstances that
we are considering. I reiterate that we are grateful for the
Government&#146;s showing some flexibility, but we seek reassurance
that HMRC will use those powers only in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column593" />Column number: 593</div>exceptional circumstances and that it will seek to reach agreement with
taxpayers about when business premises should be
inspected.</div><a name="080610118000150"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="080610118000391"></a><b class="B">Stewart
Hosie</b> (Dundee, East) (SNP): The Minister&#146;s approach
to Government amendment No. 221 is sensible: she has tabled it and is
now listening to the comments on it. It, too, relates to powers to
inspect or enter any part of the premises that is,</div>
<a name="080610118000286"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;used solely as
a dwelling&#148;.</div>
<a name="080610118000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
concerned about the word &#147;solely&#148;. I can think of several
trades or professions about which tax inspectors often have
concerns&#151;at a very low level, but none the less concerns. They
include taxi drivers and semi-professional musicians who may be paid in
cash. We all know about such things. I am concerned that someone might
take a booking for a band for a wedding on a house phone, or phone up
to organise insurance for the taxi on a house phone, and that that
would negate the family home&#146;s being</div>
<a name="080610118000287"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;used solely as
a dwelling&#148;.</div>
<a name="080610118000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would like
the Minister to confirm that the very low level use of a private house

description of the dwelling as being,</div>

<a name="080610118000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">and would not make it
a business premises, which could then be entered. Other hon. Members
have expressed anxieties about that. I would like confirmation that the
guidelines will be robust, and that making a modest business

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610118000392"></a>Dr.
Palmer:</b> Government amendment No. 222 leaves out from
&#147;this&#148; to the end of line 22. Do they not mean to the end
of line 23? Amendments Nos. 168 and 253 seem to leave a gap for someone
who has slightly dubious records, which they would not like to be
subject to inspection. If I am conducting a business and I have such
records, which I keep in my garage, so long as I am not present in my
garage, the authorities would not be allowed to inspect them under
amendment No. 168. Under amendment No. 253, the Government would not be
allowed to inspect them at all because the garage is primarily used to
park my car or store other materials. Those seem to me to be
difficulties.</div><a name="080610118000155"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="080610118000393"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Brooks Newmark</b> (Braintree) (Con): Earlier in our
deliberations on this part of the Bill, my hon. Friends the Members for
Cities of London and Westminster and for South-West Hertfordshire
lamented the fact that the new powers proposed in clause 108 and
schedule 36 have appeared in a money Bill rather than in one sponsored
by the Home Office. I share their concern that this territory should
perhaps have been covered by the Solicitor-General or another Law
Officer and been subject to debate in another
place.</div><a name="080610118000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
my hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster also
mentioned that he had served

that?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column594" />Column number: 594</div><a name="080610118000158"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610118000395"></a>Mr.
Newmark:</b> I was hoping to finish the sentence. I paused to
catch my breath. My hon. Friend served time on the Bill that created
the Serious Organised Crime Agency and that experience proved useful.
As luck would have it, last year I had the pleasure of serving on the
Committee that considered the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act
2007 and looked at several of the wider human rights issues that are in
play here. I remember, for instance, our attempts to get assurances
from the Government that bailiffs would be prevented from undertaking
enforcement actions against premises where the occupants were women on
their own, young children or other particularly vulnerable
people.</div><a name="080610118000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">Bailiffs
and tax inspectors are two of the three classes of people least
appreciated when they knock on doors, and their activities and powers
should receive proper scrutiny. It is tempting to say that politicians
out canvassing for votes are the third class of unwanted doorstep
visitor, but I can only say that that was not my experience in Crewe
and Nantwich or yesterday in Henley.</div>
<a name="080610118000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">I admire the
measured way in which the Financial Secretary has so far addressed this
part of the Bill and I am sensitive to the fact that the new powers
that it confers will be used by an agency for which she is the Minister
directly responsible. Nevertheless, I am struck by the parallels
between many of our concerns during consideration of the Tribunals,
Courts and Enforcement Bill and the issues that are before us
today.</div><a name="080610118000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Financial Secretary said at our last sitting that HMRC&#146;s
consultative committee had evaluated the compliance of the new powers
with the Human Rights Act and subsequently made changes. However, I
want to place those provisions in the context of last year&#146;s
scrutiny of similarly invasive powers. For that purpose, the commentary
of the Joint Committee on Human Rights on the Tribunals, Courts and
Enforcement Bill, as it then was, is particularly helpful, not least
because it expresses an opinion shared by the upper House, which is
denied to us on the Finance
Bill.</div><a name="080610118000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to quote briefly from the Joint Committee&#146;s comments on the
Government&#146;s use of the sort of powers with which we are
dealing. It
said:</div><a name="080610118000289"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
cases where the State is using, or authorising the use of, intrusive
powers such as entry, search and seizure, we consider that the case for
including minimum safeguards (such as the requirement that an
enforcement agent should identify himself and the authority for his
entry&#148;</div><a name="080610118000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">to</div><a name="080610118000290"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
premises to an occupier without need for a request; the minimum period
of notice required; the requirement that entry take place at a
&#145;reasonable&#146; time, and protection for material subject to
legal professional privilege) on the face of primary legislation is
particularly
strong.&#148;</div><a name="080610118000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to pick a couple of themes out of that warning. First, there is a
need for sharp focus in primary legislation and, specifically in
schedule 36, a sharp focus on precisely what will be regarded as
carrying on a business, what qualifies as business premises and what
will be regarded as business records. The Government&#146;s position,
as I understand it, is that only the use of premises solely as a
dwelling lies outside the scope of the powers. As we have heard, that
is a very uncompromising position and likely to drag
huge&#151;</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610118000396"></a>The

Gentleman is raising is entirely relevant, but I will allow him to
continue, otherwise he may seek a schedule stand part debate. If he
raises the issues now, I am confident that he will not ask for that
debate.</div>
<a name="080610118000166"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610118000397"></a>Mr.
Newmark:</b> Thank you, Sir Nicholas. You are right&#151;I
was trying to put in context the various amendments, which I will now
get on to. The Government&#146;s uncompromising position is likely to
drag huge numbers of taxpayers, who live and work in the same place,
into a net of potentially draconian new inspection powers.</div>
<a name="080610118000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">In that
context, amendment No. 269, which strikes out the commissioners&#146;
ability to decide in future by regulations what constitutes a business,
is perhaps the most important. There have, for example, been periodic
warnings to taxpayers who make substantial incomes from buying and
selling items on internet auction sites such as eBay but do not pay the
correct tax on that income. The figures that I have seen suggest that
68,000 people make all or a substantial part of their living from
selling things on eBay. Presumably, those people fall within the
category that the Financial Secretary last week described as
&#147;ghosts and moonlighters&#148;. Indeed, HMRC ran an
advertising campaign on that issue last year, which a spokesman
justified by
saying:</div><a name="080610118000291"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
overwhelming majority (of online sellers) are selling off unwanted
goods. We are concerned with the minority conducting a
business.&#148;</div><a name="080610118000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
the minority who may be conducting a business are presumably doing so
from their own
homes.</div><a name="080610118000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
question becomes whether someone can be said to be conducting a
business merely by dint of regular use of an online auction site, and,
by extension, whether that might justify the invasion of their homes by
Revenue and Customs officers. I do not know if my hypothesis is valid,
but I would not want the commissioners of the Treasury to be able to
decide at a later date what constitutes a business. It would seem
extraordinary if the home addresses of some 70,000 people suddenly
became subject to inspection by Revenue officers because those people
were suddenly deemed by regulation to be carrying on a business there
for the purposes of the powers in the
schedule.</div><a name="080610118000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">Like
my right hon. Friend&#151;he is not quite right honourable yet, but I
have huge aspirations for him&#151;my hon. Friend the Member for
South-West Hertfordshire, I am not reassured by Government amendment
No. 221, which does nothing to narrow the potential scope of the
powers. Buy-to-let landlords were also mentioned by HMRC last year, in
the same breath as the clampdown on internet auctioneers. The Chartered
Institute of Taxation goes a step further and expresses concern about
whether the inspection powers will apply to lodgers or employees who
take work home. If the Treasury has those kinds of situation in mind,
it ought to be made explicit in primary legislation so that the
reservations can be made equally explicit.</div>
<a name="080610118000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">I welcome
amendments Nos. 252 to 254, which would clarify the position for those
who share their workplace and home, and introduce a little flexibility
to the situations to which the new powers
apply.</div><a name="080610118000306"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12
noon</div><a name="080610118000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
second theme from the comments of the Joint Committee on Human Rights
on invasive powers is the need for notice. I am not at all reassured by
Government 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column596" />Column number: 596</div>amendment No. 222, which seemingly gives with one hand while snatching
away with the other. On the face of it, the occupier of the premises is
promised a visit at a reasonable time by prior agreement with at least
seven days notice. However, the notes to the amendment give cold
comfort:</div><a name="080610118000292"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
normal rule will be that the occupier of the premises must be given 7
days notice of the visit, instead of only 24 hours as required in the
Bill. A shorter notice period (or no notice at all) may apply where
this is agreed with the occupier or approved by an authorised officer
of
HMRC.&#148;</div><a name="080610118000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government are not displaying an unambiguous commitment to a minimum
period of notice and to reasonable conditions, which I believe
taxpayers are entitled to expect. Perhaps the Financial Secretary will
flesh out the situations in which she expects the normal courtesies to
be
suspended.</div><a name="080610118000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
final observation concerns the presence of adequate safeguards, which
the Financial Secretary began to address in last week&#146;s debate.
In my view, safeguards should not be limited to the training and
oversight of HMRC officers before the fact, but must include monitoring
of the process going forwards. I want to close my remarks by quoting
again from the report of the Joint Committee on Human Rights on the use
of invasive
powers:</div><a name="080610118000293"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
consider that, without an effective means of monitoring and regulating
the execution of the invasive powers provided by the Bill, there will
be a greater risk that these powers may be used in a way which leads to
a breach of Article 8
ECHR&#148;.</div><a name="080610118000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is a warning that resonates with the matters that we are discussing and
I hope that the Financial Secretary will set out the way in which the
operation of the new powers will be monitored and, if necessary,
adapted and
improved.</div><a name="080610118000176"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="080610118000398"></a><b class="B">Peter
Viggers</b> (Gosport) (Con): I thank the Financial Secretary
for the helpful and thoughtful way in which she has introduced the
amendments. It is very useful for us to hear her responses to our
concerns. My central point is on amendment No. 269. My party is
concerned that it is left to regulations and guidance made by the
Government by secondary legislation to set out definitions. We would
prefer to see definitions in primary legislation rather than delegated
to regulations and guidance in secondary
legislation.</div><a name="080610118000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
number of concerns have been expressed. The Chartered Institute of
Taxation makes the very general point that HMRC should explain why it
needs such wide powers to inspect business records anywhere and at any
reasonable time. It makes the point in detail that it seems that HMRC
is giving itself powers to enter a bank to check the bank records of an
individual taxpayer in order to ascertain that taxpayer&#146;s
position. Does HMRC anticipate that it will take the power to enter a
business premises, namely a bank, to check the tax and financial
records of an individual
taxpayer?</div><a name="080610118000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under
paragraph 10(4), a visiting officer is required to give a notice to the
taxpayer. It would be helpful if HMRC could confirm that that notice to
the taxpayer will contain a statement of the taxpayer&#146;s rights
and  will not be just an implied threat, as suggested in
paragraph
10(5).</div><a name="080610118000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">An
important point was made by my hon. Friend the Member for Braintree
when he pointed out that while the legislation seems to restrict the
rights of HMRC to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column597" />Column number: 597</div>business premises, the definition of business premises is nevertheless
very widely drawn in amendment No.
221:</div><a name="080610118000294"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;&#145;business
premises&#146;, in relation to a person, means premises (or any part
of premises) that an officer of Revenue and Customs has reason to
believe are (or is) used in connection with the carrying on of a
business by or on behalf of the
person.&#148;</div><a name="080610118000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
definition is extremely broad, bearing in mind not only the older habit
of taking work home, but the increasing use of computers at home. There
cannot be many people engaged in business practice who do not have in
their house a computer capable of being used for pulling out records,
or for other business purposes. Any home with such a computer would
seem to be included in that definition of business premises.
Specifically, I would like to ask the Financial Secretary whether that
definition would include domestic premises where a lodger pays for
residence.</div><a name="080610118000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have two further detailed points. Where HMRC makes unannounced visits,
will it assume responsibility for the health and safety of the visiting
officers, and have that responsibility enshrined in legislation? On
building sites in particular, and on various other premises, it will
not necessarily be safe for untrained personnel to visit unannounced,
to inspect any part of that premises and its contents. It would seem
unfair for such risks as may be entailed to be imposed upon businesses,
namely on the owner-occupier of the
premises.</div><a name="080610118000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">Where
an HMRC officer wishes to take a copy of a document that has been
produced to or inspected by him, will HMRC bear the cost, which could
be considerable if the document is extensive? I am grateful for the
opportunity to ask those questions, and I look forward to the Financial
Secretary&#146;s
response.</div><a name="080610118000183"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610118000399"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> This discussion has been useful. In response to
what the hon. Member for Gosport said regarding secondary legislation,
we regularly debate whether certain details of legislation should be
primary or secondary, but the aligned powers that we have discussed
leave relatively little to secondary legislation. Following the
changes, more provisions governing the conduct of HMRC will be dealt
with in primary legislation than before. For example, the
review&#146;s work on penalties has seen the framework for the
mitigation of a penalty for an incorrect return brought out of guidance
and put into primary legislation. There are times, however, when
secondary legislation is more appropriate. In this package, the only
provisions left to secondary legislation are those that provide the
detail&#151;for example, those clarifying what is and is not a
business or a statutory record&#151;and those that need to respond
quickly to external changes, such as those on credit card
fees.</div><a name="080610118000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before
turning to the detail I will make a general point. The Committee will
hopefully be reassured by the fact that training will be really
important to HMRC in exercising the new powers. I anticipate that HMRC
will make what I describe as a culture change. At the moment, over
25,000 compliance staff in HMRC are undergoing training on the
penalties changes that were made in the Finance Act 2007. The same
e-learning package is available online to tax practitioners and the
public, and it has been well
received.</div><a name="080610118000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
turn now to the detail of the amendments. Paragraph 10 of schedule 36
introduces the power to enter and inspect business premises of
taxpayers and third parties for income tax, corporation tax and capital
gains tax 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column598" />Column number: 598</div>purposes. Previously that power has been available for VAT and PAYE
inspections in the UK, and it exists in other OECD countries. It is not
an unusual power, but its operation quite rightly concerns the
Committee.</div><a name="080610118000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">At
the same time as extending the power to other taxes, the opportunity
has been taken to build in a number of taxpayer safeguards not present
in the existing VAT and PAYE provisions. Our amendments seek to
strengthen further those new safeguards in the light of the
representations that have been made by the Chartered Institute of
Taxation among others. They did say when they saw the January
consultation documents that they felt the suggestions on visits to
business premises seemed reasonable.</div>
<a name="080610118000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">The first
change that we are making is to restrict the circumstances in which
third-party premises can be inspected. As drafted, paragraph 10(1)
allows HMRC to inspect any business premises in order to check the tax
position of any person. It is modelled on the existing VAT power to
enter and inspect premises and it is applied to all tax checks. The
circumstances in which HMRC will need to visit the business premises of
a third party are essentially those where officers wish to check on the
movement of goods.</div>
<a name="080610118000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope to
reassure the hon. Member for Taunton who asked about the position of
employees. A number of other Members mentioned this. I reassure him
that employees of the business are excluded from inspection. They are
not business taxpayers. Their homes are not business premises for the
purposes of this part of the schedule. Our amendments Nos. 219, 220 and
221 therefore change or omit references to &#147;any person&#148;
as appropriate to refer instead to the person whose tax position is
being checked. The effect is that revised paragraph 10 will provide the
main rule that the business premises that HMRC may inspect must be
premises used by the person whose liability is being checked. This is
subject to new paragraph 10A, which is introduced by the main part of
amendment No. 221.</div>
<a name="080610118000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">That part
does a number of things. First, it provides that the power of entry and
inspection does not extend to any part of premises used solely as a
dwelling. That is an important new taxpayer safeguard. The hon. Member
for Dundee, East gave a good example of an individual musician. I hope
to reassure him that it would be very unlikely that these powers of
inspection would apply in that sort of example.</div>
<a name="080610118000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">A fair
question would need to be asked: what business activity would take
place that it would be reasonable for HMRC to inspect in that
individual&#146;s home? It is unlikely that part of the home would be
used just for business. We will make it clear in guidance so that
people in those circumstances ought not to feel that this would apply
to them.</div>
<a name="080610118000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 221 also deals with the definitions of business assets, business
documents and business premises and it redefines business premises in
relation to a person.</div>
<a name="080610118000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I have
just mentioned, the amendment inserts new paragraph 10A in schedule 36.
That maintains the current rule that third-party premises may be
inspected where broadly speaking they are being used in connection with
the supply of goods. There is an added restriction that premises used
solely as dwellings are excluded. It is important that HMRC retains the
power to inspect 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column599" />Column number: 599</div>third-party business premises, goods on those premises and documents
relating to those goods in order to combat large-scale VAT fraud. The
hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire asked a number of questions,
including about vehicles, which I will come to in a moment.</div>
<a name="080610118000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to
deal with the questions raised by the hon. Member for Taunton who asked
whether we could get an idea of the scale of the number of visits and
where disputes might arise. In 2007-08, the last year for which we have
figures, HMRC carried out approximately 12,000 unannounced VAT visits,
5 to 10 per cent of total visits carried out. I expect there will be
fewer visits in the future but taxpayers refused a visit or complained
about a visit in only 44 of those cases, so I hope that sets the
context within which we are discussing these
matters.</div><a name="080610118000307"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.15
pm</div><a name="080610118000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire asked about a taxpayer who was
on holiday. I will come in a moment to an example of the type of
premises where there would be nobody present, but he asked what would
happen if the taxpayer was temporarily not present. The visit will
normally have been arranged by phone and confirmed in writing, so the
taxpayer should be aware of the visit. Guidance will cover matters such
as providing a copy of the appointment letter and when it is
appropriate to rearrange a visit. The seven days that we are suggesting
is the minimum notice we would anticipate being
given.</div><a name="080610118000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Braintree made an entertaining speech. Being an eBay
shopper myself, I encourage him to continue to defend the interests of
eBay sellers, but on the detail of what he was asking for, it is
appropriate that we deal with that in the guidance. I know that that is
not a popular answer in Committee, but that sort of very close detail
is better worked out through guidance and in discussion with the
representative bodies, which will, no doubt, make their views clear
when the guidance is
published.</div><a name="080610118000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 222 modifies the rule on the amount of prior notice to be given to
an occupier that an inspection of the business premises is to be made.
Much has been made of this. We now know that our amendment has found a
third way between the ways proposed by the Liberal Democrats and by the
Conservatives. It is worth mentioning again that is no minimum notice
period is set out in the existing VAT and PAYE legislation. It is
considered that most businesses should have no difficulty in
accommodating a visit within a week&#146;s notice. If there are good
business reasons for delaying it by another week, HMRC will of course
listen to those representations.</div>
<a name="080610118000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">As a public
body, HMRC is required to act reasonably. It will not make a visit at a
time when it is known to be particularly inconvenient. Normally, HMRC
would telephone the taxpayer&#151;we are back to the co-operative way
of working that I am pleased to see HMRC developing. A phone call would
be made in advance of a notice being issued, and that phone call would
agree a convenient time and date for a visit. It is very unlikely that
a notice would ever be issued out of the blue. Seven days is a minimum,
partly chosen as it is the longest period which could be given without
interfering with HMRC&#146;s aim&#151;the hon. Gentleman is right
to say it was an 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column600" />Column number: 600</div>administrative reason&#151;to deal with repayments in 10 days. Since
many visits are undertaken to verify a repayment claim, we did not feel
it was right that the legislation should inhibit HMRC&#146;s ability
to meet its
target.</div><a name="080610118000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope the Committee will welcome the fact that we have listened to
representations made since the Bill was published. We have tabled a
number of
amendments.</div><a name="080610118000199"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610118000400"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> Before the Minister moves on to fresh territory,
will she respond to the point I made earlier about the number of cases
in which the seven days would not apply&#151;in other words, special
exemptions&#151;because the reassurance that the Committee could draw
from the seven-day limit would be lessened were there to be routine use
of
exemptions.</div><a name="080610118000200"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610118000401"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> I will come to that point in a moment, but first
let me say that the Government amendments other than those I have
already mentioned mainly correct miscellaneous
errors&#151;surprising, but they do occasionally happen. Amendment
No. 225, discussed by the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire was,
I thought, consequential on amendments just discussed. He asked what
means of transport might be subject to inspection. I am advised that
that might refer to businesses such as mobile chip vans and market
stalls run from vans. It does not mean that a car is a business
premises. However, a car could be a business asset and would be
inspected differently. I hope that that answers his
question.</div><a name="080610118000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
should like to deal as quickly as I can, while giving a reasonable
answer, with the amendments tabled by the two Opposition parties.
Amendment No. 165 is unnecessary, as it is well understood that the
term &#147;inspection&#148; does not extend to a right to search,
and the term has worked in the past for VAT and PAYE inspections. There
is also the new safeguard that only the statutory records of the
business can be inspected on the premises&#151;again, that is a
reining in of some of the powers that inspectors have had in the past.
The hon. Member for Taunton said last week that he had never had the
opportunity to vote for removing and reducing inspectors&#146;
powers; well, here we are inviting him to do exactly that. Secondly,
the reference to any person to whom paragraph 10(1) may apply would not
work properly if the premises being inspected are not those of the
person whose tax position is being
checked.</div><a name="080610118000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
amendment No. 167, another new safeguard would require unannounced
visits to be pre-authorised by a senior, experienced officer in HMRC.
The hon. Member for Braintree was over-dismissive of that provision,
which will ensure that the need for such a visit has been critically
examined at an appropriate level within HMRC. It would be heavy-handed
for the first-tier tribunal to be involved in every case where an
unannounced visit is considered necessary. However, the tribunal will
have to pre-authorise any visit in respect of which HMRC intends to
levy penalties against any person for obstructing a
visit.</div><a name="080610118000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 168 would bring in yet another new safeguard that is not present in
existing legislation&#151;a requirement for the officer making an
unannounced visit to provide a written notice to the occupier or the
person who appears to be in charge. In cases where no one appears to be
in charge, the notice must be left in a prominent place on the
premises. That might ensure 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column601" />Column number: 601</div>that there is evidence of a visit to an unmanned commercial car park,
for example. It is right and proper that HMRC should be able to be able
to visit unoccupied business premises and it should be right and proper
that a notice of their visit is left on those premises. There is no
right to force entry to premises, so I anticipate that the number of
times that such a notice would be left and such an inspection would be
made would be
limited.</div><a name="080610118000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 169 proposes changes to what the Bill specifies that the notice of
a visit should contain. It is important that the occupier should be
made aware of the consequences of obstructing the officer in the
exercise of their duties. I think that paragraph 10(5) should remain,
and I hope that I can reassure the Committee. It would be impractical
for a notice to specify all the rights of the occupier in such
circumstances, but I envisage that the occupier will always be given a
copy of a written code of practice governing unannounced visits that
sets out their rights. A draft of that code of practice was published
in January with the consultation document, and the final version will
be drawn up with considerable input from representative
bodies.</div><a name="080610118000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have read amendment No. 252 again while listening to this debate. I am
not sure that it makes
sense.</div><a name="080610118000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 253 and 254 together would change the definition of
&#147;business premises&#148; in paragraph 10(7). The right
criterion for defining business premises is that they are used in
connection with carrying on a business. Premises should be treated as
business premises that are liable for inspection even if they are not
so used &#147;wholly or mainly&#148;. Adding the
words</div><a name="080610118000295"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;or
from which a business is substantially carried
on&#148;</div><a name="080610118000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">would
introduce new uncertainty into the Bill. Cases where business use is
insignificant&#151;for example, someone taking work home&#151;will
be covered in guidance which will be drawn up with input from
representative bodies.</div>
<a name="080610118000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 269 would delete paragraph 58(3). The power to make regulations has
been included in a taxpayer-friendly measure to remove possible
uncertainty about what constitutes a business. I hope that is of some
comfort to the hon. Member for Gosport. It will remove uncertainty as
to what constitutes a business and, therefore, as to whether premises
being used are business premises. It will also be possible to specify
that a particular group of persons should be given comfort that they
will not be visited&#151;for example, certain clubs, societies or
charities.</div>
<a name="080610118000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
I have answered all the points raised in debate. I therefore commend
the amendment standing in my name, and hope that the hon. Members who
have spoken to their own amendments have been sufficiently reassured
not to press
them.</div><a name="080610118000210"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610118000402"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> I say in a spirit of good will that, although a
number of concerns have been raised, and it was right and proper that
we should have dwelt on this part of the legislation at some length
because it is about defending the liberties and rights of the
individual citizen, it is welcome that the Government have shown some
movement and willingness to listen. I take on board the points the
Minister has made. In many cases I would have wished to see them go
further; nevertheless, it is right to acknowledge that there has been
progress, particularly in relation to amendment No. 169.</div>
<a name="080610118000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">I welcome
the fact that the Minister envisages that a code of conduct will be
made available to the people who are being inspected. I do not fully
understand how 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column602" />Column number: 602</div>the transition is made between her envisaging that being the case to
people actually receiving a copy of the code. She said there will be
consultation and what the time scale is, and I am sure that can be
resolved within her Department. It would balance the powers of the HMRC
inspector if the person being inspected was empowered to some degree to
know where they stood with regard to their rights in those
circumstances. That would be a welcome
development.</div>
<a name="080610118000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are also
happy to withdraw our modest proposal for a 72-hour notice period and
to accept that triangulation is not yet a dead concept in new Labour,
although it may be close to the end of its lifespan. We support the
proposal of a week as a reasonable period.</div>
<a name="080610118000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">On that
note, with the caveat that we would still like to have seen greater
safeguards provided for the people being inspected, we acknowledge that
this has been a useful debate. The Minister has provided on the record
much welcome clarity and made some worthwhile concessions and on that
basis I seek your leave&#151;do I beg it or seek it, Sir Nicholas, or
just request
it?</div><a name="080610118000214"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610118000403"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I have to say to the hon. Gentleman that he does
not have to do either.</div>
<a name="080610118000215"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610118000404"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> Because the Government amendment is the lead
amendment.</div>
<a name="080610118000216"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610118000405"></a>The
Chairman:</b>
Indeed.</div><a name="080610118000217"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610118000406"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> I am getting better and better. In that case, I
merely express my gratitude for your willingness to listen to my
contribution.</div>
<a name="080610118000218"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610118000407"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I think this has been a useful debate and I do not
think there are enormous divides among us on the issues. I am grateful
to the Financial Secretary to the Treasury for saying that, where
possible, HMRC will seek to work in a co-operative manner with the
taxpayer and that the use of the powers in paragraph 10 will not be
abused or used as a matter of course.</div>
<a name="080610118000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would like
to come back to the right hon. Lady on the question of seven
days&#146; notice. She argued that the target for HMRC is that
repayment cases are dealt with in 10 days, so a 14-day period would
create some administrative difficulties for HMRC. This is a reasonable
point to some extent, although it is worth noting that, under amendment
No. 222, it is possible to agree any time. It does not have to be after
the seven days; it could be tomorrow, for example. One would expect
that in the circumstances of a repayment, the taxpayer might be quite
enthusiastic about having a meeting sooner rather than later. I simply
draw that point to the Committee&#146;s attention. I do not think
that it is a killer argument as such&#151;the period of 14 or seven
days would come into effect when no agreement can be reached between
the occupier of the premises and HMRC. None the less, the Government
have moved ground. We will not press the amendment to a
Division.</div><a name="080610118000308"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.30
pm</div><a name="080610118000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">Had
the final consultation period not been quite so rushed&#151;I do not
want to go over old ground, nor do I wish to be churlish&#151;the
Government&#146;s position on notice periods might have emerged
slightly earlier than during the Committee stage. That is not to say
that the fact that it has emerged at this stage is
unwelcome.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column603" />Column number: 603</div><a name="080610118000221"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610118000408"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> We normally say that we keep all legislation
under review. I have made clear the intent of the period of notice and
that it may be a minimum, but that it may also be reduced if there was
an agreement with the taxpayer. I undertake to review the operation of
the measure to ensure that a period of seven days, where an agreement
cannot be found, is reasonable and works as I anticipate it
will.</div><a name="080610118000222"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610118000409"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> That is an extremely helpful intervention. I am
grateful to the Minister. I am sure that those reading the record of
these proceedings will be pleased to know that that the Minister will
review the matter to see how it works and whether it creates
difficulties. I can envisage circumstances where someone is away or
does not receive the notice until late in the seven-day period,
particularly if he seeks to obtain legal advice, which can take a bit
of time,
too.</div><a name="080610118000223"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610118000412"></a>Mr.
Breed:</b> Amendment No. 173 is very simple. We believe that
the cut-off period of six years should be absolute, with no caveat or
indication that it could be extended in any way. Part 4 of schedule 36
concerns restrictions on powers and amendment No. 137 would delete
words from the paragraph that deals with old documents. Paragraph 18
deals with old documents states that HMRC cannot issue an information
notice requiring a person to produce a document if that document is
more than six years old on the date that the notice is issued. However,
that wording provides a caveat. We believe that the inclusion of those
words will unfairly allow HMRC to require a person to produce a
document that is more than six years old. The Chartered Institute of
Taxation has argued that older documents may legitimately have been
destroyed and replacements not possible to get. Six years is a lengthy
period and it is well known by many people, who believe that once they
have got to that stage, they can get rid of documents.</div>
<a name="080610118000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is not
reasonable for taxpayers to have to keep documents for potentially a
very long time just in case they may be required at the whim of an
authorised officer. The six-year period, which has persisted for some
time, is appropriate and should not be qualified or subject to caveats
in any way. Six years should be the absolute cut-off and amendment No.
173 seeks to make it so.</div>

Government&#146;s response to amendment No. 173 and their explanation
of Government amendment No. 224, although I think that we are
sympathetic to that one&#151;I will leave it at that at this
point.</div><a name="080610118000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 291 relates to an issue raised by the Law Society. It would amend
paragraph 19, which sets out part of the protections for the taxpayer
against the powers in schedule 36. The premise of the paragraph is that
a notice cannot be issued in relation to a taxpayer if that taxpayer
has already filed a tax return, but that is subject to exceptions.
Concerns have been raised that one of the four exceptions, condition B,
is so broad that essentially it waters down the protections contained
within paragraph 19. Condition B provides that the information powers
can be used if an
officer</div><a name="080610118000296"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;has
reason to suspect that...an amount that ought to have been
assessed...may not have
been&#148;</div><a name="080610118000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">or
that</div><a name="080610118000297"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;an
assessment...may be or has become
insufficient.</div><a name="080610118000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
appears to mean&#151;at least in the Law Society&#146;s
view&#151;that if HMRC has not assessed an amount of tax that it
should have, it can simply start to issue information notices under
schedule 36. I would be grateful for the Minister&#146;s view on
whether that concern is
reasonable.</div><a name="080610118000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
solution produced by the Law Society is that condition B should be
subject to the qualification that if the relevant facts have been known
to HMRC for one year, it cannot use the powers in the schedule 36. In
other words, HMRC should not be able to use the powers in the schedule
if the information is already available to it but it has simply failed
to act upon it. That is the reason behind amendment No.
291.</div><a name="080610118000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 255 relates to the period of time available for assessing a
deceased person&#146;s tax position and has to be looked at in
conjunction with paragraph 11 of schedule 39, which will alter the
existing period from six years to four years after the end of the
assessment year in which death occurred. Both the Law Society and the
low incomes tax reform group have made the point that it seems
illogical that paragraph 20, as currently drafted, will give HMRC
powers to seek information for up to six years after a person&#146;s
death, whereas the period of assessment in schedule 39 is only four
years, or four years plus the relevant year. There appears to be an
inconsistency; will the Minister explain whether that is the case and
the purpose of allowing information notices to extend six years after a
person&#146;s
death?</div><a name="080610118000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 256 seeks to impose a parallel provision to the present
arrangements through paragraph 20 for companies, although we see no
reason for not having the six-year norm in these circumstances. It
would amend schedule 36 so that an information notice could not be
given</div>
<a name="080610118000298"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;more than 6
years after the company ceased to
exist.&#148;</div><a name="080610118000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is obviously a practical issue about record keeping for companies that
have not been in existence for a long time.</div>
<a name="080610118000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 258 relates to the rather thorny issue of legal professional
privilege. I should declare an interest, or perhaps the reverse of an
interest, because I am a non-practising solicitor and remain on the Law

<div class="Column"><a name="Column606" />Column number: 606</div>Society&#146;s roll of names. More specifically, I should declare that
my wife is a tax lawyer. The fact that the provisions appear to favour
tax lawyers over tax accountants has excited considerable interest in
the representations that we, and no doubt the Minister, have received
from the Institute of Chartered Accountants and other accountancy
bodies. However, no other representations on that point have been
received from the Law Society, because it represents a continuation of
the existing position, whereby the protection provided for documents
produced for the purposes of providing legal advice is somewhat wider
than that given for documents provided by tax advisors and
auditors.</div>
<a name="080610118000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph 21
relates to legal professional privilege, and paragraph 22 relates to
tax advisors. What causing considerable concern within the accountancy
profession is not so much advice documents, for example, being produced
by a tax advisor, because when that advice is held by the tax advisor,
he will benefit from the provisions in paragraph 23. The difficulty
arises when that advice is provided to the taxpayer, as it would appear
that paragraph 23 will no longer provide any protection. Therefore,
HMRC can seek to obtain that advice from the taxpayer and no privilege
is provided. However, as far as paragraph 21 is concerned, when dealing
with a lawyer, the privilege protection applies when the advice is in
the hands of both the lawyer and the client. There appears to be an
inconsistency, and I would be grateful if the Financial Secretary
explained the reason for
it.</div>
<a name="080610118000309"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.45
pm</div><a name="080610118000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
issue goes back to the historical development of legal professional
privilege under our common law system. It goes back to a time when a
defendant was not able to make representations to a court and had to
rely on his lawyer to make them for him. I do not want to bring into
question the whole basis of legal professional privilege; my former
colleagues would never forgive me. However, there is a purpose behind
that
privilege.</div><a name="080610118000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is presumably right that people should be encouraged to seek
professional advice to guide them in difficult circumstances. Tax
matters can be difficult. The taxpayer does not want to find himself in
a worse position as a consequence of seeking advice to ensure that he
does what is in his interests and in compliance with the law. As I have
said, I think that the proposals are a continuation of what we have had
until now. The Financial Secretary may differ from that view. If we
continue with the existing position, this is a missed opportunity
because this is a fundamental review of
powers.</div><a name="080610118000248"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610118000414"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> As my hon. Friend said, this is not a new situation.
It has consistently rankled with members of the accountancy profession
that in effect they cannot talk freely to a taxpayer and a taxpayer
cannot talk freely to them for fear that what they say might be exposed
to the
Revenue.</div><a name="080610118000249"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610118000415"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I am grateful to my hon. Friend who comes from a
different profession to me. That is a long-standing complaint and this
is an opportunity to do something about it. There does not appear to be
anything within the provisions that addresses that complaint, which
creates difficulties in the relationship between an accountant and his
or her client. It also creates a market 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column607" />Column number: 607</div>distortion because there are circumstances in which the legal profession
has an advantage over the accountancy
profession.</div><a name="080610118000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">Particularly
in the context of tax advice, the line between the two professions is
relatively narrow. What is legal advice, what is accountancy advice and
what is simple tax advice is not always clear. There is some crossover
between what the two professions do and there appears to be an
advantage to the legal profession. That raises a concern because, by
and large, it is big businesses and wealthier private clients who go to
the legal profession for tax advice; they may also go to the
accountancy profession, but the clients of tax lawyers tend to be
bigger businesses and wealthier families. Some of the protections
contained in paragraph 21 will therefore essentially be available only
to those bigger businesses and wealthier families and not to smaller
businesses and less wealthy private individuals or families because
they will not be extended to auditors and tax advisers. There is
therefore a distortion that could be seen to be
unfair.</div><a name="080610118000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
seems to be an opportunity to address those concerns. If there are
reasons why the Government are not able to address them in this Bill or
schedule, I should be grateful if the Financial Secretary would explain
why that is and whether there is any prospect of this long-standing
complaint of the accountancy profession being addressed at any point.
Were we to start afresh in this field it would be very
difficult&#151;and I speak as a lawyer&#151;to justify the way that
privilege works at the moment. Therefore, some indication as to whether
the Government will look at this more widely would be welcome on these
benches.</div><a name="080610118000252"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="080610118000416"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> The information powers may require documents to
be produced if they are reasonably required to check a tax position. Of
course, HMRC will not seek documents if, because of the operation of
time limits, it would be unable to assess liability disclosed by the
documents.</div>
<a name="080610118000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">Where there
is deliberate error by a taxpayer, the general rule is that HMRC may go
back and recover tax for the previous 20 years. Any evidence about tax
liability for those earlier years may be contained in documents that
are themselves several years old. The effect of amendment No. 173 would
be that HMRC could never require production of a document that
originated more than six years before the date of the information
notice. It would mean that no old document could ever be sought in an
information notice despite its being essential for the accurate
determination of liability. Documents more than six years old can only
be accessed with approval from an authorised officer who will be a
suitably experienced senior official. Together with the protection
provided by the assessing time limits, these are an effective group of
safeguards. I will explain a slight doubt in my voice in a moment when
I come to some of the detail.</div>
<a name="080610118000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">HMRC needs
to be able to look at old information in a range of routine checks.
Where, for example, capital gains, capital allowances or stock are
being sold, the original purchase may well have taken place more than
six years ago. It is right, therefore, that HMRC can 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column608" />Column number: 608</div>access old documents in appropriate circumstances and acceptance of this
amendment would prevent that from
happening.</div><a name="080610118000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">Government
amendment No. 224 reinstates some words that were omitted when the Bill
was printed. The words were inadvertently omitted and reinstating them
would give clarity to the legislation. It does not work properly
without them. I am grateful to the hon. Member for South-West
Hertfordshire for saying that he agrees with it. The Institute of
Chartered Accountants in England and Wales notified us of the omission,
although, of course, we had already spotted it.</div>
<a name="080610118000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the
enquiry window has passed, sub-paragraph (6) provides that the officer
must have reason to suspect some further tax is due. That is
essentially the same as the existing direct tax rule but providing
further taxpayer safeguard in that the &#147;reason to
suspect&#148; test is a higher one than the existing &#147;may
contain information relevant to a tax liability&#148; test. The
amendment seeks to import an additional test; that is &#147;the
evidence of facts rule&#148; from the VAT legislation.</div>
<a name="080610118000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">Direct tax
checks are in their nature different from VAT checks and there is good
reason for the present different tests that these proposals retain.
Having an evidence of facts rule in direct tax could lead to numerous
assessments for the same year as more information came to light, which
would not be a taxpayer-friendly outcome. In workshops held by HMRC in
2007 there was no enthusiasm either within HMRC or the representative
bodies to change the respective direct tax and indirect tax tests with
which everyone is
familiar.</div><a name="080610118000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">Turning
to the treatment of deceased taxpayers&#146; affairs, amendment No.
255, tabled by the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire, seeks to
align the period for which information can be sought with the assessing
time limit. Six years was retained to ensure that HMRC can obtain
information about the affairs of the deceased where there has been
failure to take care or deliberate error during the person&#146;s
lifetime. Where the deceased was also involved with a company, it may
be that tax can be assessed on the company even though HMRC is out of
time for assessing the deceased. That may require information in the
extra two years. The four-year time limit only applies to assessments
to charge tax not attributable to careless or deliberate
error.</div>
<a name="080610118000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the
information is needed within six years of death in connection with an
assessment for failure to take reasonable care, it is right that HMRC
has the power to obtain it. In considering this, I have been thinking
hard about the amendment proposed by the hon. Member for South-West
Hertfordshire and I may wish to revisit the issue later in our
consideration on the Floor of the House. On the six-year restriction, I
hear the point that people should not have to keep records for a long
time. People have to keep records only for as long as the
record-keeping requirements tell them to. <i class="I">[Laughter.]
</i>Information can be requested only if it is in the person&#146;s
possession or power. I must admit that I smiled when I read the advice.
There is some attraction to the idea that the assessment time and the
powers to require documents to be produced should be aligned. I would
like to consider that further, particularly as when I asked for advice
on how often we use the powers, I was told that we do so very rarely.
It is mostly in cases of fraud or when old capital gains tax cases are
being pursued. I hope to return to that issue.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column609" />Column number: 609</div><a name="080610118000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">I come now to
amendment No. 256. In practice, HMRC is very unlikely to pursue the
affairs of a ceased company&#151;we move from a deceased person to a
ceased company&#151;as it will be unable to assess any discrepancies
found in relation to the company unless there has been fraud by the
directors, in which case the assessment can be made on those directors.
The protection provided by the assessing time limits provides a
sufficient safeguard without the
amendment.</div><a name="080610118000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall now deal with amendment No. 258. Paragraph 21 of the
schedule enshrines the common law principle of protection given to
communications between lawyers and their clients. That protection
existed in section 20 of the Taxes Management Act 1970, and the new
legislation clarifies that that applies across all relevant taxes. I
recognise that there is a problem in this regard. I can see that a
large firm that might be providing financial and tax advice using
accountants in the firm can use the cover of the fact that there are
solicitors in the firm and that gives it a professional advantage over
smaller firms. I have discussed that with the organisations concerned
about it and I want to give it further thought. I cannot give an
undertaking at this point. I am more attracted to amendment No. 255,
but this is in the legislation on the insistence of the Ministry of
Justice and, being part of a joined-up Government, I of course support
that entirely. It could be argued that the common law principle was
protection enough, but representative bodies were keen to preserve the
protection in tax law. Therefore, paragraph 21 achieves
that.</div><a name="080610118000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
amendment No. 258 is designed&#151;it is now clear that it
is&#151;to clarify that privileged information in the hands of third
parties is protected on the basis that the common law principle will
prevail, it seems unnecessary. Information giving tax advice is
protected in law for auditors, tax advisers or lawyers while it is in
the hands of those professionals. Information in the hands of the
taxpayer is protected in law only if it is advice given by a lawyer.
The Committee may find that distinction helpful.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column610" />Column number: 610</div><a name="080610118000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for South-West Hertfordshire will know from the tone that I have
taken in replying to him on the question of legal privilege that my
heart is not entirely in the position, but the protection for legal
privilege is very important. If we extended it as widely as suggested
in the conversations that I have had with those making representations,
I would be concerned that we would extend it too widely, but perhaps
the hon. Gentleman will allow me to give the issue further thought. If
the Committee will agree Government amendment No. 224 and the hon.
Member for South-East Cornwall will withdraw amendment No. 173, I hope
that we can make
progress.</div><a name="080610118000264"></a>
