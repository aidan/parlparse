amendment No. 173, in
page 22, line 44, leave out from
&#145;terrorism&#146; to end of line
46.</div>
					<a name="0805141000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">Good
morning, Mr. O&#146;Hara, and may I welcome you back to
the Chair for our consideration this week? Under the part of the Bill
dealing with the forfeiture of terrorist property&#151;provided for
originally in clause 32 &#151;the intention is to confiscate
property after conviction if it has</div>
					<a name="0805141000378"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;been used for the purposes of
terrorism&#148;</div>
					<a name="0805141000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">or</div>

had reasonable cause to suspect might be used, for those
purposes.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0805141000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
clause 33, which we are now considering, there are amendments to the
section of the Terrorism Act 2000 entitled &#147;Forfeiture:
terrorist property offences&#148;. Again, amendments are included,
the first ones of which one might think are entirely understandable.
Forfeiture may be ordered by the court if the property has
been</div>
					<a name="0805141000380"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;used for the
purposes of
terrorism&#148;</div>

					<a name="0805141000381"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;it was intended by that person
that it should be used for the purposes of terrorism.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0805141000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">But then subparagraph (iii) goes on to
say, if</div>
					<a name="0805141000382"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the court
believes that it will be used for the purposes of terrorism unless
forfeited.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0805141000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
deletes that third section.</div>
					<a name="0805141000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is a probing amendment, but
I should be grateful if the Minister would explain what in fact is the
architecture that we are putting in place here. My
recollection&#151;though I may be wrong about this&#151;is that the
Terrorism Act 2000 provides that there should be forfeiture in the
cases of terrorist property&#151;that is, forfeiture of property
connected to terrorism. But to include a provision that the court
believes that it will be used for the purposes of terrorism unless
forfeited seems to be an extension of that principle. It may be
justified, but it would be useful for the Committee to understand the
Government&#146;s reasoning on this point.</div>
					<a name="0805141000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would like
to illustrate my possible concerns. On the basis that the individual
concerned would almost certainly have been imprisoned for the terrorism
offence with which he has been convicted, if the property has not been
connected to terrorism in the first place, that raises the question in
my mind: what sort of property will the court then be asked to look at
to form a belief that it 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column394" />Column number: 394</div>will be used for the purposes of terrorism unless forfeited? It seems to
me to be an exceptionally wide power. Will the Minister therefore tell
the Committee what the Government&#146;s intention is here, and what
the criteria are that the court would be asked to apply in coming to
that
determination.</div>
					<a name="0805141000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="0805141000434"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Douglas Hogg</b> (Sleaford and North Hykeham) (Con): I rise to
support my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Beaconsfield on this
point. We go back in part to the debate we had last week about the
imaginary McNulty&#151;because what we have got, or could have again,
is the repairer in a garage in whose possession is a vehicle deposited
by an innocent third party, and here we have a very wide power to
forfeit that could bite on the properties of innocent third parties, so
it is rather important that the Government explain the precise reasons
for and limits of this
power.</div>
					<a name="0805141000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805141000435"></a>The
Minister for Security, Counter-Terrorism, Crime and Policing
(Mr. Tony McNulty):
						</b> I do not
want&#151;however pleasant that may be&#151;to go back to the
imaginary Mr. McNulty. I thought we dispatched that last
week. Equally, let me say what a pleasure it is to be under your
chairmanship again, Mr. O&#146;Hara. You will see that we
have made, in your absence, some progress, but a little more today
would be extremely useful for all concerned.</div>
					<a name="0805141000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the first point made by the
hon. and learned Member for Beaconsfield, the architecture of this set
of clauses on forfeiture of assets can be found in the Powers of
Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000. This is largely replicated here.
He is entirely right: there was a forfeiture element in section 111 of
the Terrorism Act 2000, but that was just for Northern Ireland, and has
since been repealed. Interestingly, that referred to a similar set of
rules, but said that the court may forfeit if it believed that they
were used for the purposes of terrorism, and we think that &#147;will
be used&#148; is stronger than &#147;may be used&#148; in that
regards. So the architecture is not new; it comes from there.</div>
					<a name="0805141000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">The entire
regime that clauses 32 to 37 aim to build on, extends, as I said, that
already in place in the Terrorism Act 2000. Such a regime is an
important means of ensuring that assets held by convicted terrorists
that either have been used, or will be used, for the purposes of
terrorism, are removed from circulation. The regime also serves as an
additional part of the sentence of the convicted, thereby adding to the
deterrent power of the
offence.</div>
					<a name="0805141000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">To ensure that
the regime is as effective as possible, it is clearly important that
the maximum amount of assets that might be used for the purposes of
terrorism are available for the courts to consider for possible
forfeiture. In this context, it is sometimes very difficult to prove an
intention in the mind of the convicted person beyond reasonable doubt.
In these cases, it is right that the court is able to come to its own
belief about whether the assets in question will be used for the
purposes of terrorism unless forfeited. We think that is an important
element of the architecture, as the right hon. and learned Gentleman
fairly said. Amendment No. 173 will deny the court that
ability.</div>
					<a name="0805141000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is worth
pointing out at this stage that this type of wording is not new in
legislation. Section 111 of the now repealed element of the Terrorism
Act 2000, which applied to Northern Ireland, allowed for forfeiture to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column395" />Column number: 395</div>be ordered where the court believed that property may be used in
connection with the activities of specified organisations unless
forfeited. Actually, as I have implied, this is a lower test than the
wording in the present clause, which requires the court to believe that
the property will be used for terrorist
purposes.</div>
					<a name="0805141000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805141000436"></a>Mr.
Grieve:
						</b> If I understand the Minister correctly, that was
with reference to specified organisations and not a general
power?</div>
					<a name="0805141000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805141000437"></a>Mr.
McNulty:
						</b> Absolutely so, and specific to Northern Ireland.
As I have said to the Committee, in quite rightly looking at the
dismantling of the assorted security and terrorist legislation in
Northern Ireland, and given the peace process, the Government have
sought to learn from those experiences and see how we can improve our
legislation, if we think the legislation should be translated into a UK
dimension.</div>
					<a name="0805141000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">It should also
be pointed out that the civil standard of proof is required in testing
whether there has been unlawful conduct such as to bring into play the
proceedings for recovery and confiscation of assets under the Proceeds
of Crime Act 2002. Clearly, however, giving the courts this power needs
to be balanced by appropriate safeguards to prevent assets being
unfairly removed either from the convicted person or from innocent
owners, such as the imaginary Mr. McNulty. Such safeguards
do exist, and with your indulgence, Mr. O&#146;Hara, I
will run through them now, as they are germane to the amendment as well
as to the overall
clause.</div>
					<a name="0805141000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, the
court must still have before it all the necessary evidence in order to
make a full and proper investigation into the prosecution's
application. This is established in case law with R <i class="I">v</i>
						<i class="I">.</i>
Pemberton 1982, and applies to all court orders for deprivation and
forfeiture of assets. The court must also act in a way that is
compatible with the European convention on human rights, in particular
article 8, the right to respect of private and family life, home and
correspondence, and article 1 of the first protocol, the right to
peaceful enjoyment of
possessions.</div>
					<a name="0805141000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill
provides greater safeguards than the forfeiture provisions in the 2000
Act and new section 23B(2) provides that the court must also have
regard to the value of the property and to the</div>
					<a name="0805141000383"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;financial and other effects on the
convicted person of the making of the order&#148;.</div>
					<a name="0805141000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given those safeguards,
the existence in other legislation of a similar standard of proof when
considering deprivation of assets, and the need for a fully effective
forfeiture regime, amendment No. 173 is not necessary and I would ask
that it be
withdrawn.</div>
					<a name="0805141000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805141000438"></a>Mr.

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805141000441"></a>Mr.
McNulty:
						</b> Clause 33 extends the power of the court in
clause 32 to order, as we have just discussed, forfeiture of money or
other property under the possession or control of the person convicted
by it, from the terrorists finance offences with which clause 32 is
concerned, to certain other terrorism offences and offences with a
terrorist connection.</div>
					<a name="0805141000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">A number of offences contained
in the 2000 Act and the Terrorism Act 2006 do not have bespoke
comprehensive forfeiture provisions attached to them. This clause will
allow a court that convicts a person of certain terrorist offences or
offences with a terrorist connection to order the forfeiture of money
or other property in the possession or control of the person convicted
at the time of the offence, which had either been used for the purposes
of terrorism, or which it was intended by the person convicted should
be used for the purpose of terrorism, or which the court believed would
be used for the purpose of terrorism unless forfeited.</div>
					<a name="0805141000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">The extension of the
court&#146;s powers is necessary as the more general forfeiture
provisions that exist, in particular section 143 of the Powers of
Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000 do not cover complex assets such
as land. It is clearly right that land held by terrorists for terrorist
purposes, such as a flat bought to use as a bomb-making factory, is
removed from circulation. Specifically, clause 33 inserts new section
23A in the Terrorism Act 2000, setting out the power of the court to
order the forfeiture of assets of a person convicted of certain
terrorism offences and offences with a terrorist connection.</div>
					<a name="0805141000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection
(2)(b) contains a list of offences in the Terrorism Act 2006 to which
these powers will apply. This includes offences under sections 2, 5 and
9 to 11. Amendment no. 138 would add offences under section 6 to this
list. Section 6 of the Terrorism Act concerns the provision and receipt
of terrorist training, and section 7 sets out specific powers of
forfeiture in relation to an offence committed under section 6, but
these are restricted to assets connected to the offence itself. These
wider powers of forfeiture ought to be made available to the courts in
respect of people convicted for an offence under section 6, as I have
said&#151;the provision and receipt of terrorist training&#151;as
it may be that such a person has other assets intended to be used for
the purposes of terrorism that would not be available for forfeiture
under the current regime. This is in line with the extension of the
forfeiture regime in general under the Bill. Amendment No. 139 would
simply add a line to section 7 of the Terrorism Act 2006 stating that
the forfeiture powers set out there in respect of assets connected to
an offence are in addition to those in new section 23A.</div>
					<a name="0805141000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is simply tidying up
matters on how the three Bills relate to each other. I commend the
amendments to the
Committee.</div>
					<a name="0805141000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805141000442"></a>Mr.
Grieve:
						</b> I realise that in a sense the
Minister is tidying up, but he is creating a very wide-ranging series
of powers in relation to forfeiture covering, I assume, the entire
spectrum of any offence that might fall within the terrorism
definition. It simply means that then it is up to judicial discretion
to ensure that all this is applied in a way that is fair. Otherwise one
can see it would have the potential of becoming a draconian side
sanction 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column397" />Column number: 397</div>that may be out of all proportion to the actual offences being
committed. I say no more about that, Mr. O&#146;Hara. I
simply flag up the fact that these are very extensive powers that the
state is taking to itself but I trust that, moderated by the judiciary,
they will be applied
correctly.</div>

						</b> I always like to agree with my hon. and learned
Friend the Member for Beaconsfield, but this is one of the occasions
when I am jolly uneasy about the amendment. My general rule, as the
Committee will know, is to take the libertarian view and I ask myself:
what is the impact of the criteria set out in my hon. and learned

circumstances, against the interests of the convicted

					<a name="0805141000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
can well comprehend a range of circumstances when &#147;other
effects&#148; will go outside the financial effects. If somebody, for
example, owns a car&#151;I am sorry to come back to the car, but it
is a rather good example&#151;forfeiting a car might not only have a
financial effect, but it might preclude a person from being able to
live where that person has chosen to live, or go to work, or other such
consequences. As the power to forfeit extends to anything&#151;I use
the word advisedly, because it is in the language of the
statute&#151;I want the court to be able to consider as wide a set of
consequences as is possible. <i class="I">[Interruption.] </i>If my hon. and

Hogg:
						</b> I am sorry to come back to the imaginary
Mr. McNulty, because I know that the real Minister is a
little exasperated by this. However, I remain very concerned about the
position of innocent third parties. I took the liberty of tabling an
amendment. I know that it is starred, because it was put down late, but
it is an attempt to set out the protection that I think should be given
to innocent third parties.</div>
					<a name="0805141000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have read the Proceeds of
Crime Act 2002 and the relevant provisions in the Misuse of Drugs Act
1971, and I am perfectly willing to accept that the provisions set out
in the Bill are broadly in line with those provisions. However, I ask
myself a basic question: are the interests of the innocent third party
properly safeguarded by the provision in new section 23B(1), which, in
my view, is the key part of clause 34? I think that the honest answer
is no. Nothing is said about the burden of proof or the standard of
proof, and nothing actually sets out the criteria that a court has to
adopt.</div>
					<a name="0805141000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister may well say that there is a body of case law arising from,
for example, POCA or the Misuse of Drugs Act, and that the courts need
no further guidance, but I find that a profoundly unsatisfactory
explanation for two reasons. First, it seems to me that the
citizen&#151;the ordinary chap; the imaginary Mr.
McNulty&#151;is entitled to know what the law is by looking at the
relevant statute without having to go to a body of case law to which,
in reality, he will not have access. Secondly, although, at common law,
we have long accepted judge-made law, and although it is inevitable
that a majority of law is judge-made law, in the sense that statutory
interpretation has to be in the hands of the judges, we
parliamentarians should set out the tests and the criteria if we have
the opportunity to do so. Here, we have not set out the criteria that
address the question and we are relying instead on judge-made law from
the past. Frankly, I do not think that is satisfactory. Given the
opportunity, Parliament should set out the criteria and tests. If there
is then ambiguity or uncertainty, the judges will have to interpret
that. Simply shrugging off the responsibility seems to me to be
profoundly unsatisfactory. We are not doing our job of safeguarding the
innocents&#151;in this case, the imaginary Mr.
McNulty.</div>

							<a name="0805141000458"></a>Mr.
McNulty:
						</b> I do. We touched on this matter last week. I
understand why the right hon. and learned Member for Sleaford and North
Hykeham wished to table his amendment, but it is unnecessary. If we
followed his exhortation, we would have some quite large Bills. I do
not believe that there is any ambiguity in the surrounding architecture
of this or any other clauses in the Bill that relate to existing
statutes, common law provisions or case law. It goes without saying
that it is for Parliament to pass laws&#151;good laws. Given that we
already have the provision elsewhere and, as far as I can see, it has
worked satisfactorily, and given the provision in the ECHR and the
other oversight and safeguards that I described, new section 23B(1)
makes it very clear that there is role for at least looking at claims
of ownership from third parties regarding forfeited assets.</div>
					<a name="0805141000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the right
hon. and learned Gentleman implies, the provision mirrors similar
protections in the Proceeds of Crime Act, and Parliament did not
consider, when 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column400" />Column number: 400</div>passing that Act, that an amendment such as that which he is suggesting
was necessary. It was not necessary then and I do not believe that it
is necessary now. The safeguards already exist. It is not necessary to
legislate in such explicit terms to prevent the courts from unjustly
punishing innocent people. If we were considering the
amendment&#151;if it were not starred&#151;I would argue that it
was otiose, unnecessary and irrelevant. As was the case last week, I
take the thrust of the right hon. and learned Gentleman&#146;s
argument, but I do not believe it is necessary to reflect that in the
Bill.</div>

Amendment No. 95 has been slightly overtaken by events, as we also have

terms of clause 42, which was why the probing amendment was tabled. I
would like the Minister to address his remarks to that. It may even be
that he can properly do so by merging it with his speech in respect of
transferring the clause, because I think the consequence of that will

and pray the Committee is with me on my motion&#151;I think the fears

that. Clause 29 sets out the schedule 2 offences that are potentially
in the frame for terrorist offences and, therefore, notification.

tidy that up with no significant change to the policy, which I do not
think is what the hon. and learned Gentleman is seeking, I am happy to
take away that principle. Having rather rapidly refreshed my memory of
clauses 29 and 42, the determination of terrorist offences and the
12-month caveat for of sentence notification determination and,
therefore, notification, I think that this approach is quite logical,
albeit a bit clumsy. I will, as the Committee asks, look at it further,

and can conceive of circumstances in which someone could be before a
service court for an offence with a terrorist connection, particularly
with the training of individuals or supply of armaments&#151;the army
rifle off the back of a lorry syndrome. I would be interested to know
why it was felt necessary to have this specific

							<a name="0805141000476"></a>Mr.
McNulty:
						</b> Notification requirements would apply only to
those convicted of terrorism or terrorism-related offences, as the rest
of the clauses make clear. It is not anticipated that a terrorism or
terrorism-related offence would ever be dealt with exclusively by a
service court because a terrorism-related case would be transferred to
a civilian court, given its seriousness. Almost without reservation, I
do not think there is any ambiguity there. As such, it is not necessary
for these notification requirements to be made to work for offences
dealt with by service courts, and so these are excluded from this part
of the Bill. The clause defines service courts, in subsections (2) and
(3), both in their present guise, and when the relevant provisions of
the Armed Forces Act 2006&#151;already passed&#151;come into force.
I think it is relatively straightforward. It was a perfectly reasonable
question, but I beg to move that clause 40 stand part of the
Bill.</div>

						</b> I have limited experience of service courts in
Germany, and I think it is a question of jurisdiction here. I am not
sure that a serviceman under a status of forces agreement in Germany
who is then charged with an offence under this would either have a
choice of being dealt with by a service court or being dealt with by a
German court, and that is where the jurisdictional debate would lie. I
am not entirely sure that there is the option then of bringing someone
back to a civil court in the United Kingdom in those
circumstances.</div>

others already on the books do make, as I understand it, for the
jurisdiction issue of UK citizens to run nationally and
internationally. I do not think that case would prevail. The broader
point, about whether to be tried in a German or UK court for serious
terrorism offences, does not tie in to the point the hon. Member for

might be issues there but I do not think that is germane to the point

understand that, in almost all circumstances, a case of this kind would
be transferred to a normal criminal jurisdiction. I just cannot
entirely see why it is necessary to exclude a service court for the odd
circumstance of perhaps late evidence in the progress of a trial in a
service court, which has led to a suggestion of an aggravated offence
by reason of connection with terrorism&#151;why should the case then
have to be abandoned in order to put it before an ordinary criminal
court? I do not understand why the service court needs to be excluded,
if the circumstances are such that it simply would not

							<a name="0805141000485"></a>Mr.
Heath:
						</b> This is a series of probing
amendments to secure the response of the Minister on two principal
points. We have not sought to argue against the notification procedure
as a whole on the grounds of the utility of the procedure. We
understand that this is a matter to ensure public safety, rather than
an extra punitive measure on the part of the state against the accused.
This is not part of the sentence; this is to ensure public safety
following the expiry of the sentence. It is a principle that has been
used before in the case of sex offenders and violent offenders. I have
a concern that we have a proliferation of registers and notification
procedures and an increasingly complex system, but I am not proposing
to investigate or further dissect that matter
now.</div>
					<a name="0805141000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">This series of
amendments deals with two specific issues&#151;first, how we deal
with juveniles and secondly, how we deal with the insane and whether it
is appropriate to use this notification procedure for those two classes

<div class="Column"><a name="Column406" />Column number: 406</div>of offenders, or whether there are more appropriate ways of dealing with
them. I fully accept that simply because someone is young does not make
them any less dangerous if they have a propensity to terrorist
offences. I accept also that if someone is insane and has a propensity
to terrorist offences, one must be aware of that, but I do think that
there are regimes that may be more appropriate than the notification
process before us today for dealing with those two classes of
offender.</div>
					<a name="0805141000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the case
of juveniles, one must hope that a young person who gets involved with
terrorist connections and finds himself accused and convicted of
terrorist offences is capable of rehabilitation and education and that
that person has the opportunity not to pursue that course in their
future life following any sentence that he may serve. It may be more
difficult in the case of an adult, but we have always based our legal
system upon a clear principle of rehabilitation of young offenders.
That is particularly the case where there is a degree of idealism in
the young that might be misplaced and inappropriately expressed in the
form of support for terrorist activities, or indeed where there may be
a coercive element, in the case of a young person who was in contact
with people who are conspiring to commit terrorist offences. My only
question is the appropriateness of this procedure to those two classes
of offenders where I suspect that there is a better and more
supportive, more appropriate way of dealing with them to ensure they do
not re-offend and that the public safety is ensured. This is a rather
bureaucratic and onerous process&#151;the fact that it is onerous is
not necessarily an argument against&#151;but this process may not be
the most effective way of dealing with
them.</div>
					<a name="0805141000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805141000486"></a>Mr.
Grieve:
						</b> I sympathise with the points
made by the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome, and the amendment that
I have tabled that comes next in sequence is very similar in intention.
It is a probing amendment looking at the question of whether the court
should have any discretion as to whether notification should be
required.</div>
					<a name="0805141000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
will consider this, I suppose, when we come to the related section on
duration in clause 51, which states that anybody sentenced to a period
of more than five years is required to submit to notification for the
rest of their lives. On any showing, that is a fairly onerous
requirement. While it is certainly not intended to be punitive, it is
nevertheless a considerable intrusion on a person&#146;s private and
family life, particularly because, in addition to the explicit
requirements laid down in clause 51, it is clear that it will be
possible for the Secretary of State to make by affirmative order
further requirements&#151;the nature of which we currently do not
know&#151;in respect of notification. That is something we will come
back to and can perhaps debate further later this
morning.</div>
					<a name="0805141000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
should not lose sight of the fact that, while notification is a very
important requirement and one which may well be for public protection,
we are widening the scope of intrusive state powers and removing the
old principle that when a person had finished serving their sentence
they were, effectively, on the way to rehabilitation and, apart from
the requirements of the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 for
notification in getting a job, were free to do what they
like.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column407" />Column number: 407</div>
					<a name="0805141000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
justification always advanced for including sex offenders in a
notification system was that they appeared to have a propensity to
commit such offences and were not amenable to rehabilitation, and that
under no circumstances was rehabilitation justified because in truth we
could have little confidence that it was ever going to be possible.
That is rather different from terrorist offences. In this country, at
the moment, there are previously convicted terrorists serving in
Government in Northern Ireland, and we appear to have accepted that it
is possible for them to change their ways.</div>
					<a name="0805141000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">Indeed, if we
are to beat the current menace of terrorism in this country, I have
absolutely no doubt that it will come about only by virtue of the fact
that some people who are attracted to terrorism at present will decide
to abandon it, and may well turn out to be rather important citizens.
There are already one or two examples of people who have been lured
into this area already and are now writing books about their
experiences.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805141000487"></a>Mr.
Hogg:
						</b> My hon. Friend makes a very valuable point here, and
I wonder whether his anxieties would be reduced if there were a
provision in the Bill that would enable a person to apply to the court
to vary or to revoke a restriction order. So far as I can see, there is
no such provision in the Bill as it stands. I may be wrong about
that.</div>
				
					<a name="0805141000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805141000488"></a>Mr.
Grieve:
						</b> I agree with my right hon. and
learned Friend. This is a subject which, I confess, has troubled me in
other contexts. I have made speeches in the past about my view that it
is generally very difficult in this country to be fully rehabilitated
for criminal offences, even extraordinarily minor offences. In one case
in my constituency, a lady employed as a matron or senior carer in a
care home who had a conviction for shoplifting some 20 years before in
circumstances clearly linked to her psychological state at the time and
the breakdown of her marriage, and who had no other previous
convictions, found that she was never able to obtain senior employment
again because of the provisions of the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act
1974 and the fact that she had to make a disclosure. More relevantly,
the fact that no allowance seemed to be made by anyone for the
circumstances surrounding the offence meant that a taint remained with
her, which was as damaging to her as I suspect it was unproductive, in
the long run, for the community. This subject has long been of concern
to me.</div>
					<a name="0805141000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">Through these
notification requirements, we are adding, albeit in a slightly
different way, to the control architecture. I can see that that has
compelling justifications, and I do not disagree with it in principle,
in view of the seriousness of terrorism offences. However, I agree with
my right hon. and learned Friend that a system could be created in
which, in 25 or 30 years&#146; time, individuals sentenced to more
than five years for a connection with terrorism could be completely
rehabilitated&#151;and even turn out in the long term to be
campaigners against terrorism&#151;but would still find themselves
subject to such requirements at a certain amount of public expense and
to no great public benefit. Perhaps we ought to consider whether a
mechanism exists to allow people to make an application along the lines
that my right hon. and learned Friend
suggested.</div>
					<a name="0805141000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805141000489"></a>Mr.
McNulty:
						</b> This short debate has been quite interesting and
of some value. The regime is not particularly onerous, but I do take
the point made by the hon. Member for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column408" />Column number: 408</div>Somerton and Frome that it might be worth exploring elsewhere the
proliferation of registers, all of which are important on their own
terms. There may be some discussion to be had about getting them all in
one place as a kind of public safety register. I do not agree that
being on the register and having to notify is excessive or
onerous.</div>
					<a name="0805141000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not
think that the hon. Gentleman intended it, but there was a touch of a
counsel of despair in his view that those on the list who are under 18
will never be rehabilitated. Being on the register is not, in this
context or in others, an anti-rehabilitation measure, although I take
his point in that regard. In terms of the specifics of his
amendments&#151;regarding the insane, temporarily or otherwise, and
under-18s&#151;we have simply sought to reflect the sex offenders
register. That relates to his other point: if there is to be a
proliferation of such registers, let us at least have them within the
same architecture and framework. That is a fair point. In that context,
I would resist his
amendments.</div>
					<a name="0805141000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
in the case of the Sex Offenders Act 1997, I am fairly confident about
the universality of the notification criteria&#151;that, over 12
months, it will capture everybody. I share some of the discomfort and,
perhaps, disappointment about there being further flexibility down the
line. That might be worthy of further exploration, though not
necessarily here.</div>
					<a name="0805141000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">I take the
point about those sentenced to five years. I accept the broad sweep of
the point that we need to take risks in this area: in relation to whom
we engage with, on what level and with what degree of sincerity, given
their past. There are some excellent ex-Hizb ut-Tahrir people around
whom I take entirely at face value and who do some very good work in
the broad areas of prevention, rehabilitation and other work to which
the amendment refers. I cannot go into too much detail, but I have also
met another chap who has supposedly seen the light and no longer
indulges in such activities&#151;that might or might not be the case;
he might still be &#147;at it&#148;, for want of a better phrase.
The matter is not quite sub judice, but it is certainly sensitive at
the moment, so it is not for me to go into any detail. None the less,
it is perfectly right and fair to meet him, because if we can learn
from such individuals about rehabilitating others&#151;whether on the
fringe or in the middle of Hizb ut-Tahrir or of violent extremism and
jihadism&#151;it would be irresponsible not to do so.</div>
					<a name="0805141000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">I take the broad point about
rehabilitation and someone not necessarily always being that which they
were convicted for being in the first place. We need to have regard to
that, but it is not achieved in any way, shape or form by the
amendments. I am comfortable with the universal nature of the
register&#151;for it to be effective, anyone who is convicted for 12
months or more must be on it. Some interesting points were made about
what should happen further down the line that I am happy to take away
and explore, but not in the broad thrust of the current context because
that is not
appropriate.</div>
					<a name="0805141000400"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.30
am</div>
					<a name="0805141000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">Going
on the register is not the be-all and end-all for sex offenders, as the
hon. Member for Somerton and Frome will know. For the more serious,
there are multi-agency public protection
arrangements&#151;MAPPA&#151;and other elements in place, not in
this Bill but in the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column409" />Column number: 409</div>broader prevention work with local government and the police. Some chief
constables have been quite forthcoming on this and do see the potential
radicalisation of the very young as a child protection matter, in the
same way as guns, gangs and other issues. The more enlightened police
forces are exploring that as well.</div>
					<a name="0805141000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">I know that the hon. Gentleman
was not putting forward a counsel of despair&#151;that if the
under-18s are included then, Lord Almighty, that is rehabilitation out
the window for them&#151;and I accept the sincerity with which he
makes his argument, but this clause, Bill and amendment are not the
place to make his perfectly proper points. I am happy to have a broader
discussion on MAPPA arrangements, child protection and other matters,
but I will not give in on the universal nature of notification and
people on the
register.</div>
					<a name="0805141000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805141000490"></a>Mr.
Heath:
						</b> That was a very useful exchange all round. I was
not advocating a counsel of despair&#151;I had this argument with the
Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, the hon. Member for
Gedling in the context of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill,
and considerable progress was made during the course of that Bill, now
an Act. I am grateful to him for the way in which he responded to some
of the concerns that I raised in that context.</div>
					<a name="0805141000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">The issue of light at the end of
the tunnel, particularly for young people, is important. I know that
the notification procedure is not the most onerous, but it is a
genuinely onerous responsibility and it does tend to discourage,
particularly a young person who is carried away with an enthusiasm
which he or she might completely foreswear later. We know that young
people have immensely strong enthusiasms for causes, for religions, and
for all manner of convictions which they later find to be completely
wrongly based. We therefore need to be very careful to make it clear
that there is light at the end of the tunnel. That is partly for
exactly the reasons that the Minister gave: it is not only for the
rehabilitation of the individual, but because those who have seen the

					<a name="0805141000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">For that reason
alone, as the right hon. and learned Member for Sleaford and North

						</b> I may have misunderstood what the Minister said, but
my understanding was that while he was sympathetic to the proposition
that there should be a process whereby people could apply to the courts
to vary or discharge a restriction order, he was not minded to include
such a provision in the Bill. If that was the correct understanding of
what the Minister said, does the hon. Gentleman share my dismay that we
are not taking the opportunity to do that which in principle is
desirable? It could be done on Report or in the other place, but it
should be done in this
Bill.</div>

He made it quite clear that he 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column410" />Column number: 410</div>was not prepared to accept the amendments or the principle that there
would be a different notification regime from those already in place
elsewhere. He wanted simplicity in the notification regime. He can
correct me if I have misinterpreted him, but I am not sure that he
entirely shut the door to further consideration of whether there should
be some process of variation or

I am happy to go away and reflect on what degree of flexibility might
be afforded in this Bill or elsewhere further down the line. However,
not least because of the read-over into the sex offenders register and
all the legal architecture behind that, the mandatory element at the

						</b> This is a simple
matter&#151;just to have it on the record. As I understand the
purpose of clause 43, it is to ensure that there will be no
retrospectivity applying to any decision to reduce a specified term or
period requiring notification but, at the same time, will give
individuals the benefit of any retrospectivity in cases of extending
the period and thereby taking people out of the regime altogether. In
those circumstances somebody who has been made subject to a
notification process but finds subsequently that the Government change
the rules so that they would not have been subject to that process at
the outset of notification would thereby no longer have to
register.</div>

					<a name="0805141000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 42 specifies that
sentences or orders of 12 months or more for relevant
offences would lead to the notification requirements applying, as we
have discussed. We believe that this threshold will lead to
notification requirements for convicted terrorists who pose a
significant risk to the community on their release from
custody.</div>
					<a name="0805141000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">It may be
found in future that the threshold captures serious offences not deemed
to present sufficient risk to justify the application of the
requirements because the threshold is too low. Alternatively, the
threshold may be found to be too high. The clause provides the
Secretary of State with an order-making power to vary the sentence or
order thresholds to ensure that they remain effective, proportionate
and justified. This will be subject to parliamentary scrutiny as the
order is subject to the affirmative resolution procedure. If the order
reduces the thresholds for notification requirements, they will only
apply to those dealt with after the order comes into force. However, if
the order increases the thresholds, for example, from 12 months to two
years, individuals who were subject to notification requirements
because of a sentence of up to two years, would no longer be required
to notify as from the date the order comes into force.</div>

							<a name="0805141000501"></a>Mr.
Heath:
						</b> My brief question also relates to
clause 52, which sets out offences relating to notification.
The offence, of course, is failure without reasonable excuse to comply
with initial notification as outlined in clause 44. Presumably, that
offence is triggered by any failure to comply with any part of clause
44, and what worries me&#151;it is a perfectly simple
concern&#151;is subsection (2)(b), the national insurance number. I
can see that it is entirely possible for a person to comply in every
respect with clause 44&#151;to appear at the police station within
the three-day period, give their date of birth and home address, which
they know, and all the other details which they know, but they may not
know their national insurance number. They may thus not be able to
comply with clause 44.</div>
					<a name="0805141000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is no requirement to know
one&#146;s national insurance number; it is helpful if one does, but
there are circumstances in which people do not know or perhaps have
never been allocated one, or have been allocated two, which is
sometimes the case. As the offence is non-compliance, it worries me
that the compliance is absolute in terms of the whole provision, yet
one element is not necessarily in the control of the individual to whom
the notification order
applies.</div>
					<a name="0805141000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805141000502"></a>Mr.
Blunt:
						</b> I have a brief point on which I
seek clarification. In what circumstances is it anticipated that
someone who is unlawfully at large would notify their address and all
the other required information to the police? I just draw attention to
subsection (1)(b)(ii), which puts a duty on someone who is unlawfully
at large to provide their details. I would be grateful if the
Minister&#151;[<i class="I">I</i>
						<i class="I">nterruption</i>
						<i class="I">.</i>
						<i class="I">]</i> I
understand that, but the punishment under the provision is five years
on conviction. I would have thought that someone unlawfully at large on
a conviction for being unlawfully at large would already be subject to
a punishment of that order. I would be grateful for the
Minister&#146;s clarification.</div>
					<a name="0805141000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805141000503"></a>Mr.
McNulty:
						</b> On the point made by the hon.
Member for Somerton and Frome, if he had committed the Bill to
memory&#151;as no doubt he has, but has forgotten it, rather as I
have&#151;he would have rushed to clause 52, where it says very
clearly under &#147;Offences relating to notification&#148; that a
person commits an offence
who</div>
					<a name="0805141000386"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;fails without
reasonable excuse to comply with...section 44&#148;.</div>
					<a name="0805141000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would be a reasonable excuse that a
person had tried and been unable to get his national insurance number
from the Department for Work and Pensions or whomever, but told the
police that he would try to get it as quickly as possible. That would
be a reasonable excuse, so I think the interplay between the two is
perfectly fair. As the hon. Gentleman says, giving a false name would
be a different matter.</div>
					<a name="0805141000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">An individual&#146;s being at
large does not obviate the need for them to comply with the
notification order. If they are unlawfully at large and have a duty to
notify and fail to do so, that is an offence with a penalty of up to
five years in prison, so it is proper that the words &#147;unlawfully
at large&#148; are included. I suspect that the meaning of those
words is not covered by &#147;reasonable excuse&#148; in terms of
clause 52.</div>
					<a name="0805141000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">The wording
of the clause makes sense, but I take the point made by the hon. Member
for Reigate. The legalese
says:</div>
					<a name="0805141000387"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A person
to whom the notification requirements apply must notify the required
information to the police within three 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column413" />Column number: 413</div>days...If the person was dealt with...before the commencement
of this Part and... has been released on licence or...is
unlawfully at
large&#148;</div>
					<a name="0805141000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">on
commencement, and so on. As the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome
implied, the notification elements do not disappear simply because a
person is unlawfully at large; they are still germane and relevant,
which is why they are mentioned in the clause. However, clause 52
answers the hon. Gentleman&#146;s broader
point.</div>

Amendment No. 150 clarifies that the one-year period for

					<a name="0805141000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 151 makes it clear that a person is not required to re-notify under
clause 47 if the annual re-notification date falls when he is remanded
in custody, imprisoned or detained in a hospital. Further to that,
amendment No. 152 provides that if the person is remanded in custody,
imprisoned or detained in a hospital when the period of one year since
his last notification ends, he is required to notify the police on his

							<a name="0805141000508"></a>Mr.
Heath:
						</b> I have one small anxiety. I hope that the people to
whom the notification orders apply are made aware, while in custody, of
all the details about what they are required to do. I am thinking
particularly about the fact that they are required to provide
notification that they have been released from custody. Many people
might assume that the criminal justice system would be aware that a
person had been released from custody, although that is an unsafe
assumption in the current circumstances. Nevertheless, a reasonable
person might assume that the criminal justice system was aware that a
court had released somebody from custody or from detention in a
hospital. Unless that is spelled out to the person, I fear that they
might inadvertently be in breach of the notification procedures even
while they were attempting to do everything required of them, having
made the sensible assumption that once a court says &#147;you are now
free to go&#148;, the fact is logged somewhere in the
system.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805141000509"></a>Mr.
McNulty:
						</b> That part of the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s comments is perfectly fair, but it is incumbent on
the individual&#151;having previously been under a notification
requirement&#151;to understand fully where that requirement picks up
again once he is released from custody. It is a bit two-way but I take
the point none the less.</div>
					<a name="0805141000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">In terms of the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s first point, I say simply that we are getting there.
The one thing I have discovered, having been tangential to&#151;but
never responsible for&#151;prisons and the interface between prisons
and criminal justice, is the enormous churn of numbers on a daily
basis. It is quite phenomenal when explored in any detail&#151;those
on short term and those being moved from security to open prisons as a
prelude to release. The hon. Gentleman is right; any normal person
would expect that everyone in the entire system knows when someone is
released, but sometimes there is more than one link-up to make in that
regard.</div>
					<a name="0805141000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are also
responsibilities on the individual, however, bearing in mind that they
are already under a notification requirement and, for whatever reason,
are now detained in prison or custody. They should know precisely when
they should pick up and notify again in terms of the register regime.
Between the individual and the criminal justice system, it is to be
hoped that sanity will
prevail.</div>

						</b> Amendment No. 153 removes part
of subsection (2)(d). It provides the Secretary of State with a
slightly wider power to prescribe other information to be notified.
Further information about the person&#146;s departure from or return
to the UK and the person&#146;s movements while outside the UK, as
currently mentioned in the clause, will be covered, but further
information need not be limited to those matters. That will allow the
Secretary of State to consider specifying information such as the
persons with whom the person stayed while
abroad.</div>
					<a name="0805141000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
think that the slightly wider vires are appropriate. The provision is
in line with the foreign travel notification requirements for
registered sex offenders, which require information such as the date of
departure from the UK, the destination, additional places they intend
to visit, the carrier they intend to use, details of first-night
accommodation, and the date and location of re-entry to the United
Kingdom. Furthermore, the regulations are of course subject to the
affirmative procedure, so Parliament will have an opportunity to debate
fully the matters included in them.</div>
					<a name="0805141000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 154 removes
subsection (5) because it is not necessary. Clause 86(2)(a) already
enables regulations made under the Act to make different provision for
different cases or circumstances, and that must include the power to
make different provision for different descriptions or categories of
person. The provisions tidy things up rather than anything else and
make things all the more explicit. I commend the two amendments to the

Heath:
						</b> These proposals return us to a debate on clause 42
that we held in a pre-emptive fashion. I set aside amendment No. 43,
which deals with the point of insanity that we have already covered,
and deal instead with the period for which notification requirements
apply, which is the purport of amendments Nos. 39 to 42. As the Bill is
constructed, there is an indefinite period for serious cases and a
ten-year period for less serious cases&#151;any terrorism offences
are serious. My amendments would effectively put break clauses in those
periods every five years. The initial notification period would be for
five years; in the case of a serious offence, it could be renewed on a
five-yearly basis to the point of being an indefinite notification. In
the case of less serious offences, it would be for five years in the
first instance, which could be renewed to apply for a further five
years, thereby making the ten years that the Government are requesting
through the Bill.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column417" />Column number: 417</div>
					<a name="0805141000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
most important thing is to allow the courts to consider the
individual&#146;s circumstances, the environment in which the order
is made and to ensure that the notification orders are still
appropriate. They may be inappropriate because the person has changed
their views and conduct entirely and can demonstrate that that is the
case to the satisfaction of the courts. It may be, as the hon. and
learned Member for Beaconsfield said earlier, that people who have
engaged in terrorist activities can sometimes make quite substantial
changes to their lifestyles to the point where they become part of
Administrations in the UK or abroad. Those would be cases in which, I
assume, it would be inappropriate to retain a notification procedure.
The circumstances of the individual and their propensity to be a danger
to the public may
change.</div>

					<a name="0805141000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">It may well be
that the political circumstances change entirely and we happily move
out of this period. I do not see it happening in the very near future,
but I would like to think that at some stage in the future we shall no
longer have the present terrorist threat. There may be other terrorist
threats, but I certainly hope that the present threat&#151;the reason
that the Government and we in Parliament are so engaged in taking
forward these changes to legislation&#151;will have a period. It is
to be hoped that, at some stage in the future, what are effectively
emergency powers will no longer be required.</div>
					<a name="0805141000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that that will happen in
the short term; my fear is that it will not, and that we will be
saddled with measures of this kind for some time to come. I do,
however, think it is appropriate for a court to consider all the
matters before it, and decide at a quinquennial review whether the
notification procedure is still required. If necessary, it will renew
it. If not, what I maintain are onerous requirements on the individual
will be lifted at the point at which they cease to have an effect in
terms of protecting the public and simply become a burden on the
individual that is punitive, rather than for a wider
good.</div>

							<a name="0805141000518"></a>Mr.
Grieve:
						</b> As the hon. Gentleman will be
aware from the debate we had on the earlier clause, I am sympathetic to
the points he makes. In addition, we have our own new clause 7 in this
group. Bearing in mind the comments that I made earlier, there is a
possible solution for the Minister in terms of a clause allowing a
person to make an application after five years to be discharged from
the notification requirements, if the court is satisfied that there are
exceptional circumstances indicating that the person no longer presents
a danger to national security or to public safety. If the Minister has
had a chance to look at that, I would commend it as a possible
formula.</div>
					<a name="0805141000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
different ways of approaching this, but new clause 7 seems to me to put
the burden on the individual concerned to make a case to the court.
That would meet some of the concerns raise by the hon. Gentlemen, but
in a slightly different way. I have a slight preference for new clause
7. As the Minister indicated an interest in looking at this again, it
might be something to which he can return on Report. If he does not, we
may well do so in terms of new clause 7 as a possible formula, which I 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column418" />Column number: 418</div>do not think will do anything to defeat the perfectly proper objectives
of the notification
procedure.</div>

debates, I am not unsympathetic to doing something at that end, but I
do not think we should do anything at all to the mandatory end. I do
not think these amendments suffice. New clause 7 is flawed. It talks
about the original court of determination, but under the current
regime, the court will not determine anything. The notification
requirement is automatic with the sentence, so it cannot be referred to
the original court of determination.</div>
					<a name="0805141000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, I
have said&#151;with, I thought, extraordinary generosity&#151;that
I will take these matters away and consider them. I shall do so with a
view to coming back on Report to say that, having looked at the matter
further, on reflection, I do not agree with its broad thrust or,
indeed, that there are ways in which we can at least give people the
option before the end of 10 years of looking at coming off the register
given their circumstances. In that context, I would far rather have the
leisure to consider whether there are ways that we can proceed, rather
than accepting clauses, however well intentioned, that might not have
quite the import or legal outcome that their proponents
desire.</div>

					<a name="0805141000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
purpose of this amendment is to enable the Minister to give assurances
that I hope he will be happy to do in respect of the schedule and
conditions for making a notification order concerning an offence that

I believe that the spirit of our treaty obligations requires us not to
make such an order in respect of an offence that is tried using
evidence that would be inadmissible in this country by reason of it
being obtained under duress or by torture. I certainly think that that
is an obligation in any country with which we have dealings and under
this provision within the Council of Europe or the European Union, but
I would like an assurance that that will be the case in any
jurisdiction. I do not want people who have been tortured, for example,
in Uzbekistan, and found guilty of an offence using the evidence
obtained by torture to find themselves subject to further penalties,
even of this kind, in this country as a
consequence.</div>

						</b> Perhaps we should keep in mind that some of the

particularly the long periods of detention in Guantanamo Bay and the
practice of water-boarding, which the President of the United States
appears to have sanctioned. We should keep in mind that the Government
of the United States are using methods that have the result of
providing information in circumstances that we would regard as wholly
unacceptable.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805141000526"></a>Mr.

						</b> I have that at the forefront of
my thoughts. It is not merely those countries that are openly despotic,
but those countries that would say that they accept the same principles
of law that we understand in this country, who nevertheless feel that
there are exceptional circumstances that allow them to use processes
that in anybody&#146;s book come under the categories of duress or
torture in order to gain evidence. The United States has a very serious
charge against it; indeed I was one of many colleagues&#151;I think
the right hon. and learned Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham may
have been another&#151;who was amicus curiae in the case on
Guantanamo Bay in the United States on precisely this 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column420" />Column number: 420</div>issue. It does concern me, so I shall listen very carefully to what the
Minister has to say. There are countries to which it is obviously
applicable and there are others to which it is less obviously
applicable, but under either circumstance, courts in this country
should not be making legal orders on the basis of evidence that is
inadmissible in this country because it is obtained from unsavoury
practices that would be illegal within this country. That is the
assurance, in very clear terms, that I want the Minister to give me
this
morning.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805141000527"></a>Mr.
Grieve:
						</b> I am sympathetic to the point raised by the hon.
Member for Somerton and Frome, and indeed my concerns about this go
further. We are setting up a system that requires notification of
conviction for foreign offences and whilst in many cases this may
present no problems in the general acceptance that the individual has
been justly convicted in a foreign country of a terrorist offence that
requires notification, I can readily envisage that perhaps, unlike
sexual offences, there may be instances where individuals challenge the
basis on which they were convicted and whether in fact their actions
constituted a terrorism offence. This may well turn out to be a fertile
field for judicial review
applications.</div>
					<a name="0805141000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">Can
one be required to notify, or to go through a notification procedure
which, as the Government have acknowledged&#151;because they
cannot make it retrospective&#151;has an element of a penal sanction,
and can that be done in circumstances where a court in this country
cannot be satisfied that the offence was in fact committed? Clearly,
taking the hon. Gentleman&#146;s example, if there is evidence that
the conviction was obtained on the basis of evidence obtained under
torture, for reasons that we have already rehearsed very well in this
country, we know that the courts will not be very sympathetic to that.
I think it could even go wider and I wonder what view the Government
have as to the chances of this being a contentious area, because I
think it may well turn out to be
so.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805141000528"></a>Mr.
Hogg:
						</b> My hon. and learned Friend is obviously right when
he talks about the risk of judicial review. For example, does he not
accept that where a person has been brought, say to the United States,
through the process of extraordinary rendition, that person might well
challenge notification in this country on the grounds that
extraordinary rendition is so gross an infringement of human rights as
to constitute an abuse and that no trial should be allowed to proceed
on the basis of such extraordinary
rendition.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805141000529"></a>Mr.
Grieve:
						</b> My right hon. and learned Friend
makes a good point. If in future individuals are released from
Guantanamo Bay and end up back in this country with a conviction before
a military commission at Guantanamo Bay and somebody says that they
have to register a notification in this country, I should have thought
that would be challenged pretty readily and that a challenge may well
succeed, not necessarily on the basis that the evidence may have been
obtained under torture but on the basis of the lack of proper due
process in the trial.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column421" />Column number: 421</div>
					<a name="0805141000403"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">I can also envisage circumstances where
individuals who have come from foreign countries with very poor human
rights records could be required to provide notification, where the
individuals concerned wished to argue both that they were never
terrorists in the first place and that their conviction is bogus, and
that the trial process was so flawed that it cannot be said that they
have been put through a proper trial process.</div>
					<a name="0805141000404"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is a matter of hypothetical
speculation at the moment but it is not difficult to see this
happening, particularly, as the Minister knows, when we debated the
last Terrorism Act there was considerable anxiety as to what
constituted the definition of terrorism. For those reasons, I do not
think this will be an area without controversy.</div>
					<a name="0805141000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">For the present, I would be
interested to hear the Minister&#146;s views and comments. If it were
to be established that the person&#146;s conviction had been obtained
in the circumstances in amendment No. 48, I should have thought that a
challenge to the notification order is likely to be successful. For the
reasons that I have given, I can also think of other circumstances in
which challenge to the notification process might be successful. I
wondered what the Government thought about
it.</div>

						</b> I support what has been said by my hon. and learned
Friend the Member for Beaconsfield and by the hon. Member for Somerton
and Frome. It is clear that the notification procedure brings with it
some penal sanctions. It may not strictly be a penalty but it imposes
restrictions and obligations that are analogous to a penal sanction.
However, one has to ask whether, as a matter of policy, one wants to
use it when the underlying criminal conviction was obtained in
circumstances that would not justify conviction within the courts of
England, Wales or Scotland.</div>
					<a name="0805141000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have the
gravest anxieties about some of the processes currently sanctioned by
the American Administration. Extraordinary rendition is wholly and
utterly wrong. Guantanamo Bay is a stain on the reputation of a common
law country. Water-boarding is so disgraceful that I find it difficult
to understand how the United States President can think it is in any
way proper to give it presidential validation. This is a good
opportunity for the British Government to say, &#147;Up with this we
will not put.&#148; I would not mind some specific statement to the
effect that so long as a United States Government use these practices
in respect of any conviction that is procured in any of those
circumstances we will not seek for one moment to obtain a notification
order.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805141000531"></a>Mr.
McNulty:
						</b> I fully understand the thrust of this amendment
and support the principle of it.</div>
					<a name="0805141000281"></a><div class="hs_Para">With respect, I do not need
lectures from the right hon. and learned Member for Sleaford and North
Hykeham about our objection to Guantanamo, torture or any such matters.
The Government have been there right from the off and we do not need to
say now or at any other stage, &#147;Up with this we will not
put,&#148; as he so quaintly puts it, because we never have put up
with it and have made our position abundantly clear. I regard his
comments about what the President says as ranking with one of the
latter Presidents who described tomato 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column422" />Column number: 422</div>ketchup as a vegetable, and will treat it with the same disdain. But I
do not need lectures, with the greatest respect, not given some of the
activities of the last Conservative Government in this regard, which we
will go into at another time, as I do not want to provoke anyone in
that matter.</div>
					<a name="0805141000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
practical and serious difficulties with the broad sweep of what the
right hon. and learned Gentleman is saying. The amendment could be
interpreted as saying that anything offered in the context of a
conviction abroad that did not comply with the admissibility criteria
for evidence in this country could not be accepted. I understand that
that is not the way that the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome sought
to draw it, but that could be
inferred.</div>
					<a name="0805141000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the hon.
and learned Member for Beaconsfield suggested, we could effectively
have mini reruns of foreign trials in our common law framework to see
whether we should uphold the conviction. I know that that is not the
intention of the amendment, but it could be a consequence in practice.
However, I accept the broad thrust behind the amendment of not
condoning torture or information coming from
torture.</div>
					<a name="0805141000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805141000532"></a>Mr.
Hogg:
						</b> Does the Minister understand that the judicial
review process, to which my hon. and learned Friend the Member for
Beaconsfield referred, would inevitably bring the court to which the
application is made to consider the underlying soundness of the
conviction? The kind of points that have been made by the hon. Member
for Somerton and Frome, my hon. and learned Friend the Member for
Beaconsfield and myself will come into play at that point. The court to
which an application for judicial review is made is bound to consider
the underlying fairness of the conviction on which reliance is
placed.</div>
					<a name="0805141000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805141000533"></a>Mr.
McNulty:
						</b> I thank the right hon. and learned Gentleman for
the echo. That is entirely the point that I just made. I am sympathetic
to what the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome is seeking to achieve,
but I do not think that it is in line with the practicalities of his
amendment. The practicalities go beyond the thrust and import of his
arguments to the possibility of our courts under judicial review
assessing the viability of the evidence per se and whether it is
admissible.</div>
					<a name="0805141000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
absolutely behind the broad principle, notwithstanding the difficulties
that it would cause. The internationalisation dimension of the
notification regime does do that, but I am not convinced that the form
in which he offers it is quite the way to go forward. I ask him to
withdraw the amendment and I will give the matter serious consideration
to see if we can include it in the Bill because I have not one dispute
with the overall thrust of the
amendment.</div>
					<a name="0805141000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">My last
point is that twice people have suggested that notification is a penal
sanction. It most profoundly is not. I offered up the amendments that
made this a fairer regime because any requirement or obligation under
law should be fair and proportionate. It was not a recognition that
notification is somehow a penal sanction. I say sincerely that it
profoundly is not. I have let two or three people get away with saying
that the Government were seeking a penal sanction with notification.
That is most profoundly not the case.</div>

the Minister for that last point, but I thank him for his helpful

under

am grateful to the Minister for his assurance that he will look at this
matter again.</div>
					<a name="0805141000292"></a><div class="hs_Para">I confess
my ignorance on the matter raised by the hon. and learned Member for
Beaconsfield, the right hon. and learned Member for Sleaford and North
Hykeham and the Minister about whether the notification order would be
subject to judicial review or whether it is an action by the court as
framed in the context of the Bill. I am not clear on that, but perhaps
it could be
elucidated.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805141000537"></a>Mr.
Grieve:
						</b> It would be subject to review for two reasons.
First, it goes with the conviction of the individual in this country
and, secondly, in respect of a foreign offence, as I understand
it,</div>
					<a name="0805141000389"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the defendant serves
on the applicant, not later than rules of court may provide, a
notice...stating that, on the facts as alleged with respect to the
act concerned, the condition is not in the defendant&#146;s opinion
met&#148;.</div>
					<a name="0805141000294"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although he is able
to challenge it, he is simply served with an order that he must provide
notification. That is a ministerial action and, in those circumstances,
it must be possible to review
it.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805141000538"></a>Mr.

but I am less convinced about an ab initio notification as a result of
the offence being tried under a British
jurisdiction.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805141000539"></a>Mr.

						</b> In the case of a sanction being imposed following
a conviction in this country, it is more difficult to see what there is
to review. There might be reviews further down the road, on the basis
that it is no longer proportionate to rights contained in the European
convention on human rights, but that is the only thing that I can think
of. I can think of 101 reasons why somebody convicted in a foreign
court might seek to have that position
reviewed.</div>

interpretation made by the hon. and learned Member for Beaconsfield is
correct&#151;I have no reason to suppose that it is not&#151;it is
almost inevitable that these matters will be challenged if there is the
slightest doubt about the appropriateness of the original 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column424" />Column number: 424</div>sentence or about the proceedings in which the original sentence was
given under a foreign jurisdiction. That being the case, any
declaratory statement that could be made in the Bill&#151;the
Minister suggested he would consider that&#151;would be helpful, as
we always say, for the avoidance of doubt. I am clear about the

accept the amendment. There is no such express provision in the foreign
travel order measures in the Sexual Offences Act, or in relation to the
successful football banning orders or other civil orders, such
as&#151;notwithstanding the recent interest from their
lordships&#151;violent offender orders in the Criminal Justice and

							<a name="0805141000547"></a>Mr.
McNulty:
						</b> Whenever it is moved, however eloquently it is
done, I shall ask for it to be resisted or withdrawn. Amendment No.
212, which we will come on to, would ensure that foreign travel
restrictions do not breach any right of free movement within the EU as
provided for in the directive. Article 27(1) of the directive provides
that member states may restrict the freedom of movement of Union
citizens and their family members on the grounds of public policy or
public security. Article 27(2) provides that such a measure must be
proportionately based exclusively on the personal conduct of the
individual concerned, which clearly, these matters are. As and when
that is moved, I shall ask again for withdrawal or resistance. Wrapped
around those amendments and at the core of this are the Government
amendments, which, as I have suggested, are merely tidying up or
technical amendments. I commend them, but not amendment Nos. 211 or
212&#151;however eloquently they are about to be moved&#151;to the
House.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805141000548"></a>Mr.
Grieve:
						</b> I shall not comment further on the Government
amendments. I accept that they are of a fairly minor nature. Amendment
Nos. 211 and 212, which the Minister has dismissed before I have had
chance to speak to them, were intended to be probing amendments. It is
quite important to go back to basics. We have now become quite ready to
prohibit people from travelling abroad. We have been doing so for some
time and the Minister has rightly highlighted football banning orders
and sexual offender orders. Such a measure is, of course, a very
serious restriction on the liberty of the subject because historically
it was essentially prohibited in the clauses of Magna Carta.</div>
					<a name="0805141000318"></a><div class="hs_Para">There should be no right to
prevent an individual who is in this country and who is not otherwise
subject to detention to be brought to trial going to a foreign 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column426" />Column number: 426</div>country. That said, I will not quibble about there being circumstances
in which one should be entitled to do so. We started doing so in the
case of football banning orders where there was a clear correlation
between the intention of the visit and causing mayhem at a foreign
football match. We then moved it on towards sex offenders, again,
because of the point about propensity and the clear existence of sexual
tourism. In this case, it is clear that the Government will have to be
careful about how they exercise this particular power. Will it prevent
people from travelling outside the United Kingdom generally or will it
prohibit people from travelling outside the United Kingdom to a
specified destination because of reasonable grounds that they will
engage in terrorism when they get
there?</div>
					<a name="0805141000319"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would not want
the clause to go through on the nod because in terms of restrictions on
the liberty of the subject it is&#151;I think we sometimes abuse this
word&#151;a draconian sanction. Generally speaking, we have no
business prohibiting people from travelling to a foreign country just
because the state takes the view that they are dodgy. That is really
what we are dealing with here. I simply say to the Minister that the
two amendments were designed to probe this issue and to make sure that
we do not create a power that could be abused.</div>
					<a name="0805141000320"></a><div class="hs_Para">The issue that particularly
interests me is that it is clear in paragraph 1 that specified
countries can be named as being places on which a prohibition may be
attached. The Minister will be perfectly aware that the difficulty with
that is if one prohibits someone from travelling to Pakistan, there is
nothing to stop them travelling to France and hopping on the first
plane to Pakistan, if that is what they are minded to do. We will not
be able to do much if they do not come back to this country, unless we
are able to prove on their return, which may be extremely difficult,
that that is where they went. Blanket prohibitions on leaving the
country could, I envisage, turn out to be a fertile field for judicial
activism and there could be a lot of litigation. I simply wanted to
flag up to the Minister that I am not against the principle behind the
measure, but I hope that it is applied sparingly. If it is not, we
could end up with
problems.</div>

wanted to ask, using the context of the amendment, but perhaps
pre-empting the need for a stand part debate, how and on what basis the

passport? On what basis would a person who is no longer subject to
detention or custody in this country be restricted from travelling to
their country of origin using the passport of their country of origin?
On what basis are the British Government to be able, as they apparently
will be under the schedule, to confiscate all passports, which implies
passports issued by a foreign Government, which are not the property
either of the individual or the British
Government?</div>

					<a name="0805141000328"></a><div class="hs_Para">I agree with the
broad sweep of the comments made by the hon. and learned Member for
Beaconsfield: the power is a strong one and should be used sparingly.
For that reason, there are strong appeal and variation provisions in
the schedule, unlike some of the other measures that we have discussed,
such as those on notification and other matters. The measure, however
sparingly it is used, will be a useful device.</div>
					<a name="0805141000329"></a><div class="hs_Para">The point about not going to a
designated country as outlined in schedule 1 is picked up in paragraph
6(1)(b) of schedule 5, which talks about going to another country via a
third country.</div>
					<a name="0805141000330"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
broad point made by the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome, the
Government can confiscate a foreign passport, but there is nothing to
stop a person going to the embassy to get another. However, one would
hope, notwithstanding the collective wit of the authorities, that that
person would go on to a watch list and, the next time they present
their passport when they come back into the country, they will not be
permitted to do so.</div>
					<a name="0805141000331"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would not say that the power is draconian, but it is strong, and
notwithstanding recent experience, it should be relatively sparingly
used. None the less, we believe that it will add to the greater
arsenal, for want of a better phrase, of provisions available to us in
the fight against terrorism. As I have said on a range of matters, I do
not afford panacea status to any of the provisions of themselves but,
taken as a whole, they will be useful. I do not deny, as both the hon.
and learned Gentleman and the hon. Gentleman said, that it is worth
exploring the substantial provisions in the schedule because they are
important and serious. However, as the hon. Gentleman generously said,
the measure could be of some help in our struggle, if it is used only
sparingly. However, if one reads the whole schedule, including the
technical amendments that I hope to make, one will find the appropriate
checks and balances for what is, after all, a serious power that will
be, if used sparingly, used seriously. It will have a serious impact,
which is the whole purpose of the measure.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805141000557"></a>Mr.
Hogg:
						</b> This is rather an important clause and rather an
important set of amendments. We are dealing here with the powers given
in the Bill for the making of rules relating to the asset-freezing
procedures. Those procedures, which are set out in clause 56, are
fairly far reaching.</div>
					<a name="0805141000349"></a><div class="hs_Para">My reading of clause 57 makes me
extremely depressed. All the provisions are designed to benefit the
Treasury, and none is designed to benefit the person whose assets may
well be frozen. In the various amendments that I have tabled, I have
tried to ensure that the maker of the rules is obliged to consider a
number of criteria that are designed to benefit the individual, not the
state.</div>
					<a name="0805141000350"></a><div class="hs_Para">For example, the
lead amendment, No. 213, requires the maker of the rules to have regard
to the need</div>
					<a name="0805141000390"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to ensure
that that manner in which the proceedings are conducted is fair to
every party to the
proceedings.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0805141000351"></a><div class="hs_Para">One would
have thought that one would not have to say that, but the way in which
the law is being construed and implemented means that one
does.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column429" />Column number: 429</div>
					<a name="0805141000352"></a><div class="hs_Para">Nothing in the Bill requires the
maker of the rules to have any regard to the person whose property is
about to be taken. The Minister might say that that is all inherent in
the convention on human rights, and some parts may be, but I want us as
parliamentarians to enact legislation in such a way that people cannot
criticise us for not addressing such matters. It is quite plain that we
should require the maker of the rules to have regard to
fairness.</div>
					<a name="0805141000353"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am also
concerned by subsection (4), with which amendment No. 214 deals. As the
Committee will appreciate, subsection (4) enables the maker of the
rules to make provision for proceedings to be heard in the absence of
the person concerned or their legal representative. It also enables the
rules to provide for the proceedings to take place without full
particulars of the relevant reasons being given to the parties, and it
enables the court to proceed on the basis of a summary of evidence
rather than full evidence. That is extraordinarily one-sided, and I
have tabled the amendments to try to ensure that the maker of the rules
is obliged to consider issues of fairness.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
Elfyn Llwyd</b> (Meirionnydd Nant Conwy) (PC):
The right hon. and learned Gentleman will recall that
during our last sitting, we discussed a possible challenge by an
innocent third party whose property had been confiscated. Subsection
(4)(b), to which he referred, states that proceedings can be
conducted</div>
					<a name="0805141000391"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in the absence
of any person, including a party to the
proceedings&#148;.</div>

that leave the innocent third party if that property belongs to
him?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805141000559"></a>Mr.
Hogg:
						</b> That is a fair point which I have not yet addressed.
Although the debate last week related to forfeiture, whereas this
debate relates to freezing, it is perfectly true that the same issue
could arise. I take the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point entirely. I can
conceive of circumstances in which the imaginary Mr. McNulty
will not know that his property, which is in the hands of the person
who is the subject of the freezing order, is likely to be frozen. I do
not have an answer. The hon. Gentleman is right to identify and flag up
the issue&#151;it must be addressed.</div>
					<a name="0805141000357"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805141000560"></a>Mr.
Llwyd:
						</b> I was not quizzing the right hon. and learned
Gentleman, I was bouncing a question in the hope that we will have a
response later in the debate.</div>
					<a name="0805141000358"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805141000561"></a>Mr.
Hogg:
						</b> I am glad about that, but it is a serious point and
I am glad that the hon. Gentleman has raised it. It needs to be
addressed, at least, that is my immediate feeling about it.</div>
					<a name="0805141000359"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 216, 225 and 226 are about disclosure rather than the general
provisions. I can understand the grouping because clause 58 deals with
rules about disclosure. My concern is that there is no provision in the
Bill that causes the maker of the rules to consider the impact on the
person whose property might be frozen of withholding classes or pieces
of information. The maker of the rules should have to consider those
matters, so that a court is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column430" />Column number: 430</div>not in a position to make orders that prohibit the disclosure of
information where the prohibition on the disclosure would be
unfair.</div>
					<a name="0805141000360"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is the
same category of argument that I have been raising. Parliament has a
duty to take account of the interests of those people&#151;however
unworthy they may be&#151;and ensure that no unfairness is done on
the face of the Bill. I hope that the Minister will give serious
consideration to what further language should be used to ensure, as
best one can, that the interests of the individual whose property may
be the subject of the freezing order are properly safeguarded, both as
to the hearing and the disclosure of the
material.</div>
					<a name="0805141000361"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805141000562"></a>Mr.
Grieve:
						</b> I join my right hon. and learned
Friend in having the gravest reservations about the wording of clause
57, in terms of setting down general provisions about rules of court. I
also share his anxiety about disclosure, although on my reading, the
rules on disclosure closely follow those on the existing system for
control orders in providing protection for the use of intercept and
other intelligence evidence. That raises anxieties, but they do not
seem to justify the extraordinary nature of the rules in clause
57.</div>
					<a name="0805141000362"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Committee will
see that I have tabled two amendments to clause 57. The first would
remove subsection (3)(b), which says that rules of court may make
provision&#151;</div>
					<a name="0805141000392"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;enabling or requiring the
proceedings to be determined without a hearing&#148;.</div>
					<a name="0805141000363"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second one would leave out subsection
(4)(a), which allows the rules of court to make
provision&#151;</div>
					<a name="0805141000393"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;enabling
the proceedings to take place without full particulars of the reasons
for the decisions to which the proceedings relate being given to a
party to the proceedings (or to any legal representative of that
party);&#148;</div>
					<a name="0805141000364"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
provisions cause me considerable concern about how the proceedings can
be fair. If the matter of amendment No. 208 can be construed as being
in the context of intelligence evidence, enabling or requiring
proceedings to be determined without a hearing is something that I find
totally inexplicable. On the face of it, I cannot see how any rules of
court which make such a provision could pass the first and most basic
test of fairness that one may require. I would be particularly
interested, therefore, in the Government&#146;s justification of
it.</div>
					<a name="0805141000365"></a><div class="hs_Para">What is needed now
is a general debate in which I expect the Minister to set out in
considerable detail how he expects this system to work in practice. I
also going to require him to justify each and every one of the
provisions which depart from the normal standards that one would expect
to find in civil proceedings of this
type.</div>
					<a name="0805141000366"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to make it clear that I am not unsupportive of the need to have a
special procedure. It has been recognised that we want to try to use
intercept evidence, and that in itself is a novelty that is going to
present considerable details to the Minister and to the Government. But
the process has to be fair&#151;all the more so because we are not
dealing with controlling individuals, which might be argued to be an
absolute necessity in the context of terrorism; we are arguing about
property, and I am going to need a lot of persuasion that each and
every one of these provisions is necessary. However, I would say to the
Minister that I am open to persuasion.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805141000563"></a>Mr.
Llwyd:
						</b> I rise briefly to support the arguments made in
support of the amendments, and in particular to speak to amendment No.
213, which stands in the name of the right hon. and learned Member for
Sleaford and North Hykeham. It is obviously a prerequisite that there
should be fairness in the system. Otherwise, the whole system will
break down, whether as the result of legal challenge or in another
way.</div>
					<a name="0805141000368"></a><div class="hs_Para">We must read
clause 57 alongside clause 56. The Treasury is to determine whether an
application will be made or not. Under clause 57(3)(a), rules of court
may make provision</div>
					<a name="0805141000394"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;about
the mode of proof and about evidence in the
proceedings&#148;.</div>
					<a name="0805141000369"></a><div class="hs_Para">That fills
me with great concern. I hope the Minister will tell us more about that
provision, whether it is about the standard of proof or its precise
meaning. I do not quite understand the wording. Looking at subsection
(3)(b), to echo what the hon. and learned Member for Beaconsfield has
said, there is something Kafkaesque about making rules of court to
enable no hearing to take place. In fact, it borders on the ridiculous
that this could be an administrative decision, by the Treasury, to
freeze these assets without notice to anyone, without inviting
anybody&#146;s opinion and without allowing for the possibility of an
innocent third party who might or might not be the owner of the assets
that are being frozen.</div>
					<a name="0805141000370"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection (4)(b) refers
to,</div>
					<a name="0805141000395"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;enabling the court to
conduct proceedings in the absence of any person, including a party to
the proceedings&#148;</div>
					<a name="0805141000371"></a><div class="hs_Para">I stress
that, like other hon. Members, I have no desire to prevent a proper
system from being introduced. Clearly, that is an important tool in the
armoury, as the Minister said earlier. However, we must ensure fair
play; otherwise, this part of the Bill will soon
unravel.</div>
					<a name="0805141000372"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am very
concerned about the idea that proceedings will take place in the
absence of a party and the legal representative of that party. Let us
imagine that the party is a trustee of some fund or that moneys have
been entrusted to him or her in an innocent way. It seems that those
moneys could be taken away without any challenge from a third party. To
be fair to the Government, in another clause, regarding confiscation,
there is provision for a party legitimately claiming to be the owner of
property to be heard. The Bill may contain a similar provision covering
asset-freezing proceedings, but I cannot find it. In the circumstances
that I have described, is there any way in which a person with a
legitimate claim to the moneys could be heard in the process, or will
that voice be shut out completely, just as, unfortunately, under
subsection (4)(b) will be the person who is the subject of the
proceedings? Those are important points and I am sure 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column432" />Column number: 432</div>that the Minister will have answers for every one of them. The position
is not obvious from the Bill and we need
answers.</div>
					<a name="0805141000373"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805141000564"></a>Mr.
Heath:
						</b> I do not want to extend my
observations into this afternoon&#146;s sitting, so I shall be
exceedingly brief. One does not have to be against the principle of
this aspect of the Bill to raise pertinent questions about how it will
withstand any challenge, which we are familiar with in the context of
control orders and which we know lies further down the road. If the
provision is not sufficient to meet the terms of any challenge under
human rights or any other legislation, it will not do the job that the
Government want it to
do.</div>
					<a name="0805141000374"></a><div class="hs_Para">We need to be a
little more circumspect than usual, not only because of the experience
of the past few years and the difficulties thrown up by court
proceedings in respect of control orders, but because we are talking
about what is essentially an executive action on the part of the
Treasury. I understand why the Treasury is involved. Of course it is:
it is the Government Department in this country that deals with
financial matters; it is Her Majesty&#146;s Treasury. However, the
Treasury is not the Ministry of Justice, or even the Home Office, so it
is important that anything done by the Treasury in this respect is
clearly seen as being in accordance with the principles of justice and
fair play to the individual as well as to the state. That is why some
of the concerns expressed have been put before the Committee and why
the Minister must take exceptional care to ensure that the clause is in
good order before the Bill proceeds to later
stages.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805141000565"></a>Mr.
McNulty:
						</b> I have heard what all the speakers have said and
I understand the import of their remarks. As the hon. and learned
Member for Beaconsfield said, the provision is not new. It reflects as
closely as we can the special advocate system that prevails in the
Special Immigration Appeals Commission. For a lot of people, that
system is not entirely satisfactory, and I have met special advocates
to discuss at some length both SIAC and other matters. In the
Proscribed Organisations Appeal Commission, we have the same system. It
is not Kafkaesque. If we are considering how to, at least in part,
afford people a degree of fairness from what starts as a simple Order
in Council and we can go thus far and no further, given some of the
material before the court, it is perfectly appropriate to put rules of
court around those hearings, because they do not exist otherwise. As
with SIAC and POAC, it is more than appropriate for cases to be dealt
with in this
fashion.</div>
