[Continuation from column 188]

<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
On resuming—
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> Before the break, I was explaining the difference between information to which there is a right on individual application under clause 1 and information that is required to be published in a publication scheme under clause 17. The core of the Government's objection to the amendment is that much of the information will not be of sufficient general interest to justify inclusion in a publication scheme for every public authority. I accept that there may, and almost certainly will, be some authorities for which the sorts of information listed in the amendment are appropriate for inclusion, but that does not mean that it is appropriate to require every public authority to include every item in the scheme.
<P>
Ultimately, it is a matter of judgment. The right hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross suggested that the Government were retreating from freedom of information. With respect, he is wrong for two reasons. First, it is not the case that this information is not freely available: it is a question only of under which section it will become available. Its not being in a publication scheme will not remove it from the obligation under clause 1. Secondly, we have resisted the amendment to water down the terms of clause 17(1)(a)—to make the publication scheme broadly in accordance with the requirements of the Information Commissioner—and specifically required that the commissioner ``shall approve'' the publication scheme. The judgment about what is appropriate in an individual publication scheme is a matter not for the Government but for the Information Commissioner.
<P>
Clause 17 includes provisions that will require a public authority to have regard to the public interest in determining what to include in the scheme. The commissioner will take that interest into account in deciding whether to approve the scheme. I am sure that the commissioner will expect to see many of the items that are specified in the amendment referred to in a scheme for many, but not necessarily all, public authorities. As I said, the public authority and the commissioner need flexibility to determine the right balance between including information in the publication scheme in order to promote openness, and making schemes so detailed as to place barriers in the way of their effective use by the public.
<P>
It is a question not of whether information should be available under clause 1, but of getting the right publication scheme for different public authorities under clause 17. On that basis, it would not be right to include in a mandatory publication scheme the vast quantity of information referred to in the amendment. I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will accept that it is ultimately a matter of balance between the Information Commissioner and the public authority.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> The Parliamentary Secretary argues that, irrespective of the rights and wrongs of the argument prior to our short comfort break, clause 17 is about something else. He argues that it is not the right place for us to propose the amendments that we want. We are owed a more substantive response than we have received so far to our counter-point about the presumption that this information will be provided.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> Whether the information is provided will be decided under the general scheme of the Act on individual application. It will be available unless it comes within the categories of exempt information set out in part II. Therefore, on individual application, the various matters referred to in the amendment will be available unless they are specifically exempt. It is not appropriate to burden every public authority with a requirement, under a publication scheme that may or may not be appropriate for that authority, to publish every bit of information referred to in the amendment. That may be appropriate for some public authorities, but it will certainly not be appropriate for all of them. To maintain flexibility, we must leave the matter for agreement between the public authority and the Information Commissioner; he will have the last word because he must approve the publication scheme. On that basis, I invite the right hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> The Parliamentary Secretary's answer is wholly unsatisfactory. He has set up an Aunt Sally to knock down. He has said that it is inappropriate to put these responsibilities upon every authority because he wishes to proceed by way of the publication of schemes and to include the question whether they should include internal guidance. That is not the scheme that I am advocating. This is quite separate from the publication scheme to be approved by the commissioner.
<P>
On a number of occasions, the Minister prayed in aid bureaucratic difficulties and the unnecessary burden of scrutiny that would be involved in looking at every conceivable case. I am trying to relieve the commissioner of that burden by saying that all these publications are already required by the code to be published. What evidence is there that the present system is unacceptable or places an intolerable burden on the public authorities? None at all that the Minister has adduced. Instead, he has set up an elaborate scheme and says that my proposal does not fit in to it.
<P>
I do not advocate that the disclosure of manuals, instructions, precedents and guidelines should be brought within the Minister's arrangements for scrutiny by the commissioner. Those matters should not be judged in that way. As in every freedom of information law throughout the world, they should be covered by a statutory requirement on the face of the primary legislation. If the Minister does not accept that, I repeat my charge that he is simply trying to water down the existing arrangements, which are working well and which his Government and at least some of the Departments are seeking to implement.
<P>
The Home Office is taking a backward step in seeking to contract, rather than open up, the information that we are to have. The way the Bill is developing in Committee is quite insufferable as, clause by clause, we see exactly what the Government's philosophy is: we gave too much in our White Paper; we gave too much in our draft Bill; let us claw it back now, at half-past four on a Thursday afternoon when there are no members of the press to hear us. There is some hope that their action will not see the light of day, because the Home Office has organised counter attractions on the Floor of the House.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> The organisation of the change in the business is the fault not of the Home Office, but of the Leader of the House, who must take responsibility for the business scheduled for after ten o'clock last night.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> The hon. Gentleman may be right, although I dare say that the Leader of the House and the Home Secretary are still on speaking terms. Furthermore, a good deal of effort has been put into what is taking place on the Floor of the House to entertain and divert.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> Does not the right hon. Gentleman share with me some sympathy for that part of the Parliamentary Secretary's argument that says that small entities such as doctors' surgeries and dental practices, which are not always covered by freedom of information legislation in other countries, would find it difficult to prepare guidelines? Does he share my frustration with the Minister's attitude? I have some sympathy with the small bodies that might find the requirements onerous, but is there not a simple remedy that the Minister is more than capable of eliciting—making two parts of schedule 1? The first part could cover the bodies that are in it now, and a part II would list the small bodies that could be exempted from this type of provision.
<P>
That would achieve what the right hon. Gentleman and I wish to achieve, which is the routine publishing of internal guidance. As I have said, it is nonsensical that a body that is required to publish information will not be required to publish the manner in which it prepares that information in its internal guidelines. It would also meet the point about scale, which the Minister fairly made and which concerns and disturbs the right hon. Gentleman and me, because it is not going forward normally.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for trying to mediate. However, in part the problem to which he alluded is not merely in the drafting of the Bill. Only such manuals and other documents as are used by some authorities have to be disclosed. I raised that matter with the Minister in an intervention. Furthermore, if there are such documents being relied on by the smaller authorities, they are probably manuals applicable not only to a medical practice, but to the entire spectrum of practices within a health trust. They would, no doubt, be made available through the agency of the trust or another body.
<P>
I see no practical problem. The Minister has not sought to adduce one; he has rejected the whole concept of continuing with what we have. He has said that, instead, there has to be an elaborate process of considering each one of 500 cases. How many officials will the office of the Information Commissioner need to deal with the scrutiny of all those matters? It is no longer a matter of law that it has to be published, but a matter of judgment, which will have to be exercised with discretion, and with full regard to the possibility of judicial review.
<P>
The Minister has lost contact with reason in the course of his advocacy of the Government position. Therefore, I have no intention of accepting his arguments. However, because the matter is crucial it will obviously have to be debated again. I warn the Minister that, in another place, today's arguments will be seen to be utterly threadbare. The hon. Gentleman may be able to command a majority in the Committee, but I suspect that it will not be so forthcoming elsewhere—clearly, it ought not to be. This is not defiance of sense, but defiance of experience of how freedom of information legislation operates throughout the world. It is a backtracking on what the Government decided after consultation, and it is quite unworthy.
<P>
Amendment negatived.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 86, in page 10, line 8 at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(2A) It shall be the duty of every public authority—
<P>
(a) to maintain an index identifying all information disclosed by it in response to requests under section 1, other than information whose disclosure to a person other than the person to whom it was disclosed would involve the disclosure or information which is exempt under sections 38 or 41;
<P>
(b) to make adequate reference to the existence of that index in its publication scheme; and
<P>
(c) to make copies of information referred to in the index available to any person on request on payment of a reasonable fee which may not exceed the cost of copying the information and posting (or otherwise delivering it) to that person.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment is not as significant as amendment No. 65, but it is useful. It would require authorities to maintain an index of information previously disclosed under clause 1. It would make a guide to disclosures available for public inspection, and would help consumers gain access to information. It would achieve what was once considered to be the Bill's purpose—access to information—by establishing a proper dialogue between authorities and the public.
<P>
The index of described information vetted to remove exempt details could easily be provided to those requesting it. It would help to educate potential users about the kind of disclosure that they could expect. It would not include references to disclosures of personal information to people seeking information about their private affairs. Under clause 38, such information would be exempt if a third party applied for it. Information about a business's affairs for which the business itself applied—such as an inspection report on its premises—would also be excluded. Disclosure of such information to a third party might prejudice the company's commercial interests.
<P>
Making disclosed information available to the public at large, not merely the individual requestor, would ensure that it served the wider public interest. We should never lose sight of the wider public interest underlining the intentions of freedom of information legislation.
<P>
Applicants sometimes fail to make good use of the information they receive, perhaps because they lack means to disseminate it, it arrives too late to be of value, or it is too complex to handle. However, making its existence more widely known would ensure that the work that had gone into processing a certain request was more likely to be of general benefit. It would also educate potential users by revealing what is held and disclosable. Unlike many overseas freedom of information measures, the Bill imposes no duties on authorities to publish guidance about the type of records they hold. The rolling index would help to fill that gap.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> Amendment No. 86 would require authorities to keep an index of all information disclosed them in response to requests under clause 1, with the exception of personal information or information that would prejudice people's commercial interests. Under the amendment, authorities would have to refer to such an index in their publications scheme, and make copies of the information referred to in the index available to anyone on request and payment of a reasonable fee.
<P>
The amendment is based on the understanding that information, once disclosed, is public property. I have no difficulty with that principle, and the Bill does not permit authorities to restrict the circulation of information, although questions of copyright and intellectual property law may limit applicants wishing to disseminate information disclosed to them.
<P>
However, there would be practical difficulties with making the amendment work, which flow from the fact that clause 1 applies to all written requests for information, regardless of whether they are formally stated as applications under the Bill. Therefore, all correspondence requesting information from an authority will, technically and legally, become freedom of information requests once the Bill is enacted. Such requests are routinely made and granted without a freedom of information Bill. However, all written requests will come within the terms of the Bill as a result of how clause 1 is drafted.
<P>
Therefore, there is potentially a huge number of requests and corresponding pieces of information. For example, the 1998 monitoring report on the code of practice revealed that in that year, National Savings received 3.2 million general inquiries. To require National Savings to create and maintain a single index of all those items of correspondence, and to list them and the information required in the amendment would place an enormous burden on that agency and demand that substantial resources be set aside to fulfil the requirement.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> The Minister referred to clause 1. He said that requests are the same as information. As I understand it from the amendment tabled by the right hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross, the hon. Gentleman is asking only for the publication of the index of information that is disclosed. The Minister is talking about applications for information, which is a different and much larger matter. I do not understand how he links the two. I gather that he is taking advice on the matter and I should be grateful if he would explain it. If he is right in saying that the Bill treats an application in the same way as information disclosed, surely we can find a form of words that would meet the Spirit of the right hon. Gentleman's and would reconcile the two. No one wants all requests to be published, but there is good sense in saying that information that has already been asked for and published should be identiflable.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> I will attempt to explain my understanding of the Bill. Clause 1(1) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Any person making a request for information to a public authority is entitled—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>to be informed in writing by the public authority whether it holds information of the description specified in the request, and<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) if that is the case to have that information communicated to him.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Any request to a public authority for information, whether it is in a letter or in another form, which results in information being given by that public authority, counts as a request in the terms of the Bill. Amendment No. 86 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``It shall be the duty of every public authority—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>to maintain an index identifying all information disclosed by it in response to requests under section l''—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman concede that it is not beyond the wit of parliamentary draftsmen to draft a proposal to cover the point he fairly makes about clause 1, whereby the recognition or denial of information is an answer and therefore might be technically publishable under the right hon. Gentleman's amendment? However, what the hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross wants is substantive information. It would be possible to redraft his amendment to distinguish between the acknowledgement of applications to which the Minister, fairly and properly, refers and the substantive information that the right hon. Gentleman rightly seeks.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> I understand the anxieties expressed by the right hon. Gentleman and by my hon. Friend. Unfortunately, there is no clear distinction between someone who applies specifically saying, ``This is a request under the Freedom of Information Act for this type of information,'' and a general letter from a member of the public saying, ``Please can you tell me about X?'' Both are requests under the measure and there will be degrees of formality in between. The Bill has been drafted to ensure that there are a limited number of technical obstacles that need to be laid in the way of members of the public seeking information. Therefore, the Bill is cast, rightly, in wide terms. The consequence is that an index of the sort required must relate to every request that goes to a public authority under the Bill. Therefore, as far as one public authority—National Savings—is concerned, 3.2 million requests could technically fall within the Bill. If there is a response, the information is provided. That is only one body; no doubt other bodies will have an equally large number of requests for information that are routinely provided at present. There is no need for an index providing every piece of information to members of the public which a body holds.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> As a distinguished lawyer, my hon. Friend cannot be happy resting on an ad absurdum argument. No one is suggesting that 3 million requests should be published. That is in neither the spirit nor the intent of the right hon. Gentleman's amendment. Will the Minister therefore return to my question: does he think it is beyond the wit of draftsmen to distinguish between substantive information and the sort of absurd circumstances that he is praying in aid of his argument? He cannot be happy with such an argument.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> With the greatest respect to my hon. Friend, my point does not rest purely on the fact that there are 3.2 million requests for information, which are provided at present without an index. The point is that requests are made at every point on the continuum of formality between those minor requests and the substantial formal requests made under the Freedom of Information Bill. An index would be an administrative burden on every public authority; it would relate to substantial amounts of information because of the nature of the Bill. It is doubtful whether or not the index would be of substantial use to the public and it cannot be sensible for the Bill to impose such an expensive and costly burden on authorities when the primary duty of the measure is to make information available. Authorities will be under a duty to make that information available and it may be sensible for authorities to make available information for which they regularly receive requests. A commitment to do so could form part of the publication scheme. That would prevent individual applications for that information. However, the amendment makes an unreasonable demand on authorities at a cost that is out of proportion to the benefit that it would bring. The extra 1p on tax would be better spent elsewhere.

<P>

<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> We are back to a previous argument when I asked whether the Information Commissioner should be part of the same body as the Data Protection Commissioner. The Minister is talking about requests for information that are about persons, and are of benefit only to individuals. What lies behind the amendment tabled by the right hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross is an index of the kind of information that is more generally available. The spirit of subsection (2)(a) requires the publication scheme to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``specify classes of information which the public authority publishes or intends to publish''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is exactly what the Government are doing. What the amendment requires could be put on the internet. It is no big deal, but it would be useful to members of the public, and help them to know what information was available to them and how they could get hold of it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> I accept the hon. Gentleman's point, but, as I said earlier, a large number of requests will, inevitably, be mixed requests containing an element of personal and non-personal information. Producing a clear distinction between them is not practicable.
<P>
The fantastic cost of the enormous administrative burden and the relatively small benefit of every public authority keeping am index militate against the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> I wonder how carefully the Parliamentary Secretary has estimated the cost. Has he considered what happens in other countries? Has he bothered to look at the federal agency scheme in the United States?
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> I assure the right hon. Gentleman that I have not examined every freedom of information scheme to determine the nature of the indexing requirements and the cost to public authorities. I hope that that helps the right hon. Gentleman.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> I think that makes my point. The Minister produces chimerical objections that are based not on evidence but on pure supposition.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Stephen O'Brien:</B> It is clear that if we accepted the suggestion of my hon. Friend the Member for Ryedale to put the information on the internet, most of the administrative burden would fall on the desk of the person who has to provide the information anyway. It would not be difficult to take the small extra step to put it on the internet as part of a total index. Rather than costing more, it is likely that there would be a massive saving. The internet could combine the indexes of public authorities and stop the duplication of information between authorities when collective guidance is requested. The issue of cost favours the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, who is probably right. The Government's attempt to rubbish the amendment with chimerical bogeys of cost illustrates how they are increasingly setting their hard, thin-lipped faces against the purposes of the Bill as they have been explained. Had the Parliamentary Secretary given the slightest indication that he had some sympathy with the objective of helping the public to know roughly what information is being held, I would have listened to him. But he had no sympathy even for that; he just wanted to say no. We are getting used to hearing the word no, but the Government will have to change it to yes before the Bill is completed, although I realise that we may not hear it in the Committee. The Parliamentary Secretary would be wise to pay attention to the advisability of listening to the merits of arguments that we make here. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 115, in page 10, line 11, after `to' insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`any'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
After the dizzy heights of discussing more fundamental issues, we are back to the mundane task of teasing out whether the wording is correct. I reassure the Parliamentary Secretary that my query merely concerns drafting, but, if we are right, the implication is severe.
<P>
Line 11 of clause 17(3)(a) states that a public authority's publication scheme must have regard to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``allowing public access to information held by the authority''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is not comprehensive because it does not mean all or any information. Other references to information are clarified by a definition. Will subsection (3)(a) allow the public access to unlimited information? The absence of the word ``any'' implies that that may not be the case.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> The reference in clause 17(3) relates to the public interest in allowing public access to as much of an authority's information as possible. Clearly there are categories of information, such as employee personnel records, that are held by a public authority but in which there is no public interest in disclosure. The vast majority of records and other information that is held by a public authority will become disclosable as a result of the Bill's provisions. The subsection promotes the public interest in the appropriate disclosure of information to which authorities will have regard when they construct publication schemes. The Information Commissioner will also refer to it when she decides whether to approve those schemes. I hope that that reassures the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am grateful to the Parliamentary Secretary. I have a sense of déjà vu, because our brief but worthwhile exchange brought to mind debates on data protection. It is, however, our job in Standing Committees to test the wording of legislation. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 17 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 18</center></H4>
<H4><center>Model publication schemes</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 117, in page 10, line 27, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(1A) subject to subsection (3), the adoption of such a model publication scheme by an authority shall be conclusive evidence that the authority has met all reasonable requirements of the Commissioner.
<P>
(1B) The Commissioner may from time to time modify or revise any such model publication scheme.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, it will be convenient to take the following: Amendment No 118, in page 10, line 28, leave out subsection (2).
<P>
Amendment No. 119, in page 10, line 34, leave out subsection (3).
<P>
Amendment No. 120, in page 10, line 36, leave out subsection (4).
<P>
Amendment No. 121, in page 10, line 40, leave out subsection (5).
<P>
Amendment No. 122, in page 11, line 1, leave out subsection (6).
<P>
Amendment No. 123, in page 11, line 4, leave out subsection (7).
<P>
Clause stand part.
<P>
My advice is as before: if Committee members want to make observations on any part of the clause, they should do so in this debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> The amendment relates to an earlier group of amendments which in an exchange with the Under-Secretary, allowed us to discuss the intention of model publication schemes. We have, therefore, covered most of the important points and the amendment would have been part of the scheme of proposals that we no longer think is entirely necessary. However, I refer the Parliamentary Secretary to the beginning of clause 18(1), which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Commissioner may from time to time approve''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
a model scheme. I shall not labour the point about ``may'' being ``shall'', because clearly the approach will not work unless he approves them. From what we were told, there is no doubt that the authorities will have to have a modern publication scheme that the commissioner will draw up and recommend be adopted. That will be a requirement, but I am happy to leave it as a discretion or option.
<P>
We must be clear that that also means that the commissioner may from time to time revise any model publication scheme. Public authorities that have adopted the model publication scheme to meet their requirements must be similarly required to adopt any modification for which the commissioner has asked. That is a detail.
<P>
On balance, we are grateful that the Parliamentary Secretary has confirmed what is intended on this occasion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> Yes, the question is purely one of language. Clause 18 provides a degree of certainty, and that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Commissioner may from time to time approve, in relation to public authorities falling within particular classes, model publication schemes prepared by him or by other persons.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Subsection (4) provides the power for the commissioner to revoke a scheme. Clearly, he would modify a scheme by giving notice of his intention to revoke the scheme previously approved and, one would hope, substituting am alternative model scheme.
<P>
For example, the commissioner may approve a model publication scheme for local authorities and provide that it will operate for a period of, say, three years. Everyone will know what to do for three years, but, depending on how the Bill works and in the light of experience, the commissioner may seek to modify the scheme by revoking and substituting.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> The Parliamentary Secretary caused a slight flutter of alarm in my mind by using the phrase, ``one would hope''. The Under-Secretary agreed to consider clause 17 afresh to see whether it needed any redrafting, so perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary needs to consider the two clauses together to ensure that there is some certainty.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> I used that phrase because the administrative requirements of the commissioner are such that, as the hon. Gentleman has noted, approving 50,000 individual schemes may be beyond administrative capacity. The commissioner has no obligation to approve any model scheme proposed by a trade or collective body, but there is a common interest between the commissioner and, say, local authorities or health trusts in agreeing the way in which a scheme should work. There are benefits on both sides. When considering whether to modify the scheme by revoking it and substituting a new scheme, the commissioner is required under subsection (6) to give reasons. That is a good caveat to ensure that the process of improving the schemes—no doubt they will be improved as the Bill's workings are understood—proceeds logically and sensibly. I hope that that assures the hon. Gentleman that the draft provides clarity and will allow the commissioner to propose model schemes.
<P>
There will be sufficient confidence on both sides to enable the schemes to be improved. There will be sufficient confidence on both sides to enable the schemes to be improved by modification.

<P>

<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am tempted to say that I am confused, but I am not: rather, there is a confusion in our discussion. I accept that the commissioner may, from time to time, approve model publication schemes, but the Under-Secretary envisages that the commissioner himself would draw up a model publication scheme for many small businesses and that such businesses would be encouraged to adopt it. That seems sensible for doctors' or dental practices.
<P>
There is an alternative approach for much bigger and better resourced organisations, such as trade associations, groups that belong to the Local Government Association or police authorities: they may well draw up their own model publication scheme for the commissioner to approve. Do both approaches apply, or only the latter?
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> The answer is both, as subsection (1) refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``model publication schemes prepared by him or by other persons.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The hon. Gentleman's alternative scenario is appropriate, should the bodies decide that they want it. Clearly, there would be a role for the Local Government Association, for example, to liaise with the commissioner to reach agreement on a workable and sensible scheme that will meet the demands of legislation and be acceptable to local authorities. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am most grateful and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 18 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 19</center></H4>
<H4><center>Information accessible to</center></H4>
public by other means
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 124, in page 11, line 25, at end add—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(4) A public authority shall take all reasonable steps to inform an applicant of where the information can be obtained if it declines a request for information by virtue of this section.
<P>
(5) Cost shall be taken into account in determining the reasonableness of steps taken under subsection (4).'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Clause 19 is important. It is relevant to what was said earlier by the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central, as it is another example of language coming down in favour of public authorities and against individuals. All information is exempt if it is
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``reasonably accessible to the members of the public even though it is accessible only on payment'';<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and it is regarded as accessible
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``if it is information which the public authority or any other person is obliged by or under any enactment to make available to the public, whether making it available for inspection or otherwise and whether free of charge or on payment''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Information is exempt if it can be acquired in some other way. That does not, however, place any obligation on the public authority to take any steps to inform an applicant how he can acquire the information.
<P>
It would be no bad thing if the Bill made it clear that if public authorities are to take advantage of the absolute exemption, they should have a clear duty and obligation at least to provide the applicant with details of how and where he could obtain that information. There should also be some restriction on the cost of determining the reasonableness of steps taken to give such advice. That cost is sometimes greater than expected.
<P>
There have already been difficulties in that respect. Although technically the information is supposed to be available by other means—I realise that the phrase ``reasonably accessible to members of the public'' ought to cover the point—it frequently turns out not to be accessible and some of the entitlements for obtaining it by other means are difficult to enforce. The Parliamentary Secretary may wish to take away this important point and give it thought. I have suggested that it could be covered by the code of practice. I feel strongly that if a public authority is to take advantage of an absolute exemption, there should be an obligation to tell an applicant how he can obtain information, even though we must assume that the public authority could have provided it—which is another key point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> The Parliamentary Secretary missed an earlier speech from the right hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross in which he referred to his constituents' problem with accessibility because of having to travel around a huge constituency. I took the point about his constituency, and the point about remote rural constituencies, while not at the time thinking about accessibility in my constituency.
<P>
Many of the bodies referred to in schedule 1 are in London. Making information accessible under clause 18 and simply telling applicants, ``Come to London and look at it; it is perfectly accessible'', will be of little use to my constituents, the right hon. Gentleman's or those in other rural areas. They might as well be on the moon. I am sure that that was not the Government's deliberate intention. They may not even have envisaged problems. After all, one of the purposes of a Standing Committee is to point out such perfectly sensible and human elements as may not be immediately apparent to the draftsmen, who are not parliamentarians with remote constituents. However, I think there is a point here. If the Parliamentary Secretary accepts it, some redrafting will be necessary to ensure that accessibility becomes a more proactive concept.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> As the hon. Member for Ryedale said, amendment No. 124 proposes the introduction of two new subsections, the first of which is a key measure. Under the clause, a public authority can claim an exemption if an applicant asks for information that is reasonably accessible to the public by other means. The proposed new subsection in amendment No. 124 is designed to ensure that the applicant knows how to obtain the information if his application is refused under the exemption provided in the clause.
<P>
The Government believe that the Bill already provides that. Under clause 15, the notice that must be served on an applicant whose request is refused must specify the exemption in question. The notice would specify if information was being refused because it was publicly available, and would state, if it was not otherwise apparent, why the exemption applied. In the case of a request for information published by The Stationery Office, the notice would state that the information requested under clause 1 was not required to be provided under clause 19 because it was reasonably accessible to members of the public. It would also explain why the exemption applied—in this case, because the information was available from The Stationery Office. The provision is designed to provide an explanation of why the exemption applies, and clearly covers different exempt information categories. It does not refer purely to the exempt information category in clause 19. Under clause 19, it would point the applicant in the direction of the public information that is available. I hope that that is reasonably clear.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central made a good point. Information is not practically available if it is held many hundreds of miles away and the public authority states that, at its convenience, the applicant may visit its offices and read the information, so it will not send a copy. Under subsection (3), information will be counted as reasonably accessible to members of the public only if that is allowed under the terms of the authority's publication scheme. The publication scheme must be approved by the Information Commissioner, who will, I am sure, read the record of our debate and, in approving a publication scheme, bear in mind the fact that merely informing an applicant that he may inspect the information, if he travels 200 or 300 miles, may not constitute a proper way of disclosing information to the public. Accordingly, it would not be part of the approved publication scheme, and would, therefore, not be covered by the exemption in clause 19.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> I am grateful that the Parliamentary Secretary is sympathetic to our point and is trying to meet it. However, as I interpret clause 18, the commissioner's powers under the model publication schemes are not absent. In approving public authority publication schemes, she may from time to time deal with authorities that do not operate a publication scheme. His words may not, therefore, apply.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> If I may correct my hon. Friend, under clause 17, every public authority must operate a scheme. Discretion is exercised only in relation to model schemes. It is a complex matter, and I shall consider his points over the next few days and write to him. If I have slightly erred in trying to meet any of his points, I shall correct the error in correspondence and will provide copies to other hon. Members. On that basis, and on the basis that paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of clause 15(1) provide the information requested, I invite my hon. Friend to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> Our exchange has illustrated the interaction between some of the provisions. The Minister asks us to accept that the phrase in clause l5(1)(c),
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``states . . . why the exemption applies'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
is bound to cover the point made by amendment No. 124, because that confirmation would direct an individual towards where he can obtain information. I think that that was the Minister's point. I should like to think about it, because I am not sure that it is necessarily the case, although I understand that it may be the Government's intention.
<P>
The hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central raised the inaccessibility issue, and the Minister said that he would write to him about it. I should be grateful if that letter was circulated to the Committee.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> Before the amendment is withdrawn, I should say that I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Minister for his offer to write to me, which will be for the greater information of the Committee. When he does so, will he ensure that there is not an inadvertent legal hole in his bucket and that we do not go round in circles? To try to meet the point, he is relying on something that is non-statutory, as it will not be in the Bill. If something goes wrong, there will have to be a challenge in law. Many people will not be able to afford that.
<P>
A note on the clause from the Campaign for Freedom of Information refers to a case when Rochdale metropolitan borough council did exactly what should not be done. It said, ``Come and get it'', and the person in question could not. The case was taken to law and the judgment was that the council had failed. Such a case would be an inefficient and undesirable way to ensure that the law applied. My hon. Friend the Minister, despite being a lawyer, would not want the legislation to work by the creation of business for his former colleagues.

<P>

<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> It might be for the convenience of the Committee if, having taken that intervention, I allowed the Minister to respond.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> Let me assure my hon. Friend that my desire is not to make a job creation scheme for my previous colleagues. The protection under clause 19 is statutory. The question is about whether the information is, as is said in clause 19(3),
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``reasonably accessible to members of the public''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In the circumstances that he described, I imagine that there would be a good case for saying that it is not. That matter would be determined under the statutory authority of the Information Commissioner. Therefore, one would not need the full panoply of a judicial review. I shall clarify the matter in a letter to my hon. Friend and all members of the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> That debate was clearly helpful, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

Clause 19 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 20</center></H4>
<H4><center>Information intended for future publication</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 76, in page 11, line 28, leave out `at some future date (whether determined or not)' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`within six months of the date of the request'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 87, in page 11, line 29, leave out `(whether determined or not)' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`which has been determined'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 125, in page 11, line 29, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`within twenty-eight days'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> The amendment is intended to raise concerns that have been made to me by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. As the Bill stands, information is exempt if it is intended to be published at a future date, even if that date is not determined. The RSPB has proposed that the exemption is acceptable for information that is earmarked for publication within six months of the request, and in doing so the society cites the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. To obtain prosecutions under that Act, for such matters as poisoning wild birds, evidence must be presented to the court within six months of the offence. Much of the evidence comes from the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and it is vital that it is delivered quickly. There may be difficulties in achieving that purpose, but we have a legitimate concern, and should be grateful if the Minister will consider it.
<P>
The related amendment No. 87 would solve the problem from a slightly different direction. It would restrict the exemption to information intended to be published on a particular date. It would limit the scope for authorities to make spurious claims that they intended to publish the information, but could not say when. Requiring authorities to have a date in mind will make it possible for the applicant to reapply when that date arrives. Failure to publish the information would then be far more difficult to substantiate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> I am sympathetic to the intention behind the amendments, but the Government have given much consideration to ensuring that the clause is as effective as possible. We want to exempt information that authorities intend to publish when it is reasonable that the information should not be disclosed until the date of publication. At the same time, we want to guard against authorities claiming the exemption by paying lip-service to the intent to publish without a real commitment to do so. Our problem has been how to achieve that aim for the many disparate authorities covered by the freedom of information provisions.
<P>
The clause, as drafted, provides an exemption from the duty to provide information when there is a present intention to publish within a reasonable time. The applicant will be told of that intention and will be expected to await formal publication. The Information Commissioner can determine whether an authority has acted properly in applying the exemption, including forming her own view as to whether the authority intends to publish the information. She will decide whether, in all the circumstances of the case—including the requirement for information to be laid within six months, as under the Wildlife and Countryside Act, referred to by the right hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross—it is reasonable to ask the applicant to wait for formal publication.
<P>
What is deemed to be a reasonable time would emerge quite clearly for items such as annual reports, statistical information, inquiry reports and reports of research projects, which might cover information that has been collected over a long time. When an authority's publication scheme states that information will be published on specified dates or at specified intervals, the authority could normally rely on that exemption in relation to requests for such information.
<P>
The issue on other information is less clear cut. It may help if I give some examples. The Treasury holds information about the performance of different sectors of the economy and about whether it intends to raise or lower taxes. Such information can have an effect on the United Kingdom economy; its release is market sensitive, so it needs to be carefully managed. Secondly, some parts of public authorities, such as Ordnance Survey, operate in a commercial environment, selling the information that they hold at commercial rates. Making that information available under freedom of information would affect the ability of those authorities to realise the full commercial advantage of such information.
<P>
Clause 20 allows for those different examples. Our proposed arrangements for the adoption of a publication scheme, combined with the enforcement of the powers of the Information Commissioner, provide an effective exemption. If the RSPB were to say that waiting for nine months until an annual return is published, when information would be published in any event, is not reasonable because it is investigating a possible prosecution, the Information Commissioner might decide that in all the circumstances it was not reasonable to require the applicant to wait. I understand that that decision would remove the information from exemption, and that the authority would be under a duty, rather than a discretion, to publish it. I hope that the RSPB will be reassured by that response.
<P>
An amendment to impose a time limit of, say, six months, could adversely affect research projects that could easily run for longer. It may be reasonable to restrict the disclosure of information until the research is complete. Although the Government are sympathetic to the right hon. Gentleman's views, I hope that he will accept that there is provision already in the Bill and that he will not press his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> On this occasion, I find the Minister's arguments compelling. I accept his point about research projects, and I am satisfied that I have not drafted amendments that deal fully with the problem. I am also somewhat comforted by what the Minister said about the Government's awareness of the problem and his belief that the commissioner's discretion can be exercised not just retroactively after the damage of long disclosure has been done, but even in expectation that information might reasonably be required before it would otherwise be forthcoming. That line might be worth pursuing. I am glad to hear that the Government are cognisant of the difficulties. If there is still a problem that has not been fully covered, we shall return to the matter later. In the meantime, I express my appreciation to the Minister and beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 88, in page 11, line 35, leave out subsection (2).
<P>
Subsection (2) allows authorities to refuse to confirm or deny the existence of information intended to be published if doing so would disclose information that was intended to be published. The provision contains no test of harm. It is difficult to conceive of a circumstance in which confirming or denying the existence of such information could be harmful. The amendment would, therefore, delete subsection (2).
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I have considerable difficulty with the clause. We toiled at some length to see how we might amend it. Although we understand why such an exemption is needed, it is wide ranging. There is no requirement for a timetable to say when the information will be published. As the right hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross said, there is no requirement to demonstrate harm. We understand the Government's difficulty, and I do not mean that in a derogatory way. I am sure that it has proved difficult to convert the existing code into a statutory format, but I share the right hon. Gentleman's concern that, in the process, the Government have watered down the code's provisions to an alarming extent. The clause is just another example of that.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Perhaps I may remind the Committee of the exemption in the code. Succinctly and with a clear intention, it states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Information which is or will soon be published, or whose disclosure where the material relates to a planned or potential announcement or publication could cause harm (for example, of a physical or financial nature)''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That suggests that the exemption should apply if the information is about to be published but allowing access to it now would harm either that publication or the commercial value of the work that had been done prior to publication, or would in some way cause physical difficulty—for example, if the release of the information would destroy a project that was about to come to fruition. As drafted, however, the clause goes way beyond what appears to be intended by the code. The Minister owes us an explanation. We may want to return to the issue if the Government do not amend this wide-ranging proposal.
<P>
One sees throughout the Bill the fingerprints of the data protection legislation to which I referred. The Minister will remember that we had great difficulty with an exemption from the application of the data protection principle that individuals should be able to get hold of and amend or destroy data relating to them. A huge exemption applied if the information was about to be published by someone. We drew the analogy of someone producing a great tome about the goings on at Westminster. If we wanted to have access to information that was being held in preparation for that great publication—on the ground that it might be personally damaging to us—we could not do so, because it would be being held with the intention of future publication. I note that the right hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross appreciates the point. I can see the same philosophy at work in the drafting of the clause.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I have been listening with some care to the hon. Gentleman. Although he is addressing clause 20, he is ranging far beyond amendment No. 88.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am grateful, Mr. O'Hara. I have no intention of detaining the Committee. Indeed, I had hoped that by speaking now, I would avoid having to raise the issue in the stand part debate. If there could be a meeting of minds on that, I would give you that assurance.
<P>
The amendment would make some improvement, but the clause's reference to time is too loose and the lack of any harm test makes the whole thing too vague. In essence, such an exemption ought to provide an opportunity to protect information only when publication is imminent or relatively soon and when the pre-publication release of that information would do harm or cause some financial loss. I suppose that the best example I can give is of someone wanting access in the next couple of hours to the shorthand writer's excellent report of our deliberations. We ought to say to them, ``No, you can't have it because it is going to be published in two days' time, when you'll jolly well have to pay for it.'' That seems a perfectly reasonable position.
<P>
If Ministers held information that had been gleaned to exercise their thinking in relation to a forthcoming White Paper, that information ought to be in the public domain. Under the clause, however, its disclosure could be blocked by Ministers saying that it would all be in a White Paper. Given all the other exemptions in the Bill, this provision goes too far and I hope that the Government will reconsider their position.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> I have listened carefully to the observations of the right hon Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross and the hon. Member for Ryedale. I have considerable sympathy with the wish to structure the provision relating to future publication in a narrow enough way to ensure that public authorities do not use it as a way of riding a coach and horses through the Government's overall intention of ensuring that the maximum amount of appropriate information is released in as timely a manner as possible.
<P>
As I explained, clause 20(1)(c) will ensure that information falls within the future publication exemption only if it is reasonable for a public authority to reach the view that disclosure at this point would be inappropriate. Furthermore, it is not the public authority's view but the Information Commissioner's view as to whether that decision is reasonable which will determine whether the information is disclosed in advance of its anticipated publication date.
<P>
The amendment would remove subsection (2), thus compelling a public authority to disclose whether it held information of the type sought. I know that the Campaign for Freedom of Information said that it was difficult to conceive of a situation in which confirming or denying the existence of such information could be harmful, so it may help the Committee if I give some examples.
<P>
If the Treasury confirmed that it held information relating to proposed amendments to taxation, that would reveal that the amendment of tax rates was under active consideration. It would therefore be reasonable for an authority receiving such a request not to have to confirm or deny the existence of that information. Conversely, if, having been asked for papers on a proposed tax change, the Treasury were forced to disclose that there were no such papers, that would be a clear signal to the applicant. That information could be commercially sensitive and inappropriate to disclose in advance.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I understand the Minister's point, but he may have used a bad example because the information that he mentioned could easily be covered by the class exemption in clause 27.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> There are other examples. Public authorities have much information that is intended for publication, but premature disclosure could have undesirable effects. Premature disclosure that the Home Office holds information on the consequences of legalising cannabis, for example, could send misleading signals about drugs or the police. Premature disclosure that the Department of Health holds information on trials of a new drug could give false hope to those wanting to benefit from treatment, as well as affecting the price of shares of the company that developed it. Alternatively, it could send out a false scare about the drug. After fuller analysis, many of the complaints may be shown to be false and rejected. Premature disclosure that a local authority has information about planning development in specific areas could have an impact on house prices, but, when that confidential information is properly analysed, it might become clear that the planning applications would never have been granted.
<P>
The hon. Member for Ryedale said that the clause does not carry a prejudice test. Clause 20(1)(c) makes it clear that the clause can be relied on only if it is reasonable to do so. It is difficult to conceive of a situation in which there is no harm and no prejudice, yet in which it remains reasonable to rely on advance information—unless other circumstances apply. In effect, the same sort of test is built into the provision.
<P>
Finally, the hon. Member for Ryedale said that the exemption goes way beyond the code. It may not be identical, but it is not a significant departure. The exemption may not be limited in time, but it applies to a wide range of public authorities and to many classes of information that could extend over greater time periods than the code. I refer to research studies over a long period. Under statute, the information can be withheld only if it is reasonable to withhold it. There may be no further material restrictions. In any event, the code is statutory and the reasonableness will be decided not by a public authority but, eventually, by an Information Commissioner. That adds up to a more effective enforcement mechanism than under the code.
<P>
I accept that it is a difficult issue and that a balance has to be struck. However, in view of my explanation of the structure of the clause and the types of information to which it will be applied, I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> On the assumption that this is a stand part debate, I hear the Minister and do not want to labour the point, but his explanation is unsatisfactory and I remain deeply concerned that the clause goes way beyond what it necessary. We shall doubtless wish to return to the matter on Report.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> I also do not wish to detain the Committee any later than necessary when there is a long list of issues to consider. However, the Minister's reply shows that the Government are not determined to govern a society in which genuine freedom of information exists. The Minister's examples were pretty far fetched. The public are not as sensitive to the disclosure of thinking in Departments as the Minister's examples suggest. In the Treasury, for example, studies of possible tax changes are constantly undertaken. Again, drugs are constantly investigated for all sorts of reasons, and disclosure is unlikely to cause them to be accepted or rejected.
<P>
Freedom of information often helps to calm people down about what the Government do. Hypothetical examples do not support the Minister's case at all. They reveal a distinct unwillingness to allow information to be disclosed and a determination to stop it. I deeply regret that, but it is too late to do other than beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

Why should information that does not prejudice security matters nevertheless be exempt? I would be grateful to hear his explanation.

Amendment No. 54 would provide that if a public authority received an application for disclosure of information it held that had been supplied by or related to the work of a listed national security or intelligence body, it would be under a duty to disclose the information unless disclosure would prejudice the work of the body. Amendment No. 56 would have a comparable effect in relation to the duty to confirm or deny that information is held.
<P>
Many people who know about the delicacy and importance of the work carried out by our security services would be astonished by these amendments. Until now, there has been a solid body of consensus that it is right that, at the very least, there should be the strongest possible protection for information relating to the work of the security and intelligence agencies. Such protection is necessary if we are to retain and foster the exchange of information between jurisdictions that underpins the intelligence effort. That is why clause 21 effectively removes all information supplied by or relating to the work of the agencies listed in subsection 21(3) from the scope of the Bill.
<P>
It is highly unlikely that information relating to security matters would be disclosed because of the operation of the other exemptions in the Bill. The effect of these amendments would be to encourage the applicant to believe that information would be disclosed, but, in practice, that would be an entirely unreasonable expectation given the nature of the information covered by the clause and the sources from which it has been obtained. To create an expectation that could not be met and therefore led to large numbers of refusals by the authority would be improper.
<P>
Amendment No. 63 has a different focus. Unlike my position on the previous amendments, I had some initial sympathy with No. 63. It seeks to introduce a statutory definition for the term ``prejudice''. I certainly recognise that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``actual, real and of substance''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
is precisely what is commonly understood by the term. However, the word prejudice is well understood by the courts and is used in the Data Protection Act and others. It stands alone and therefore it would not be right to seek to define it within the Bill. It would not be appropriate to tell the courts what the word means. It is frequently used and the courts know precisely what it means. The inclusion of the phrase suggested in the amendment would not improve the drafting. I hope that my explanation has satisfied my hon. Friend on that part at least. The Government cannot accept the restrictions that my hon. Friend seeks to put on the types of information relating to national security and national security organisations. I invite to him withdraw his amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I rise simply to say two things. We have a great deal of sympathy with what the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central is trying to achieve with amendment No. 63. We shall debate the whole issue of prejudice and harm when we come to other clauses. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will, as I shall, give further thought to how we might achieve that because it is a serious weakness of these provisions. We ended up discussing substantial harm late on Tuesday and here we are debating it again. We need a good debate on it. In that respect, I support the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
However, we also agree with the Minister and the Government that clause 21 should be an absolute exemption.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> I do not want to press amendment No. 63 at this point as I rather agree with the hon. Member for Ryedale. We need a proper debate and this is probably not the time to have it. I accept what my hon. Friend the Minister said. When, as we surely will, we debate harm and harm tests his words will be a helpful starting point to the Government's attitude.
<P>
Nobody in the Committee or in the House wants to prejudice security matters, but my hon. Friend's blanket response to amendments Nos. 54 and 56, which are quite modest, surely took us back to the old days when everything to do with Government information was secret so that, absurdly, one could not even know what was on the menu at the Ministry of Defence restaurant because it was covered by the secrecy Acts. Those days must be over.
<P>
The security services listed in the clause should rightly be exempt because they have information that needs to be secure: it concerns the security of the realm and should not be published. But that does not apply to all the information held by these bodies. Only information that threatens the security of those organisations and the nation should be covered. The clause is worded in such a way that everything about these organisations will be covered and would affect someone who, for example suspects corruption and is pursuing a malpractice in the contracting of furniture to Government Departments. That is a purely hypothetical example, but it would be a perfectly reasonable source of inquiry to pursue. He could do that with the other bodies covered by schedule 1 but not with these organisations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> The hon. Gentleman enables me to make the point that I would have made when he moved his next amendment. If he is saying that, under the clause, information on, for example, the day-to-day running of the National Criminal Intelligence Service or its Service Authority would not be generally available, I would agree with him, but he will find that information on the day-to-day running of those bodies is published anyway. It is in the Home Office's annual report. If the clause had that effect I should be unhappy, but that is not how I read it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> Plenty of information that is absolutely non-prejudicial to security would not be in annual reports and would not normally be published. We would not normally publish the details of contracts for furniture or for food, but in certain circumstances they could be extremely germane to a public inquiry into the correct expenditure of public money. The catch-all element of subsection (1) means that any information about those bodies would be covered. I cannot imagine that that is the intention, and I urge my hon. Friend the Minister not to be quite so blithe about saying that we all agree on security. Of course we all agree, but this goes much wider. I shall withdraw my amendment, but I should like him to give some thought before we consider the matter again at a later date.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> I have listened carefully to my hon. Friend. I will reflect on it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 55, in page 12, leave out lines 14 and 15.
<P>
Those lines refer to the National Criminal Intelligence Service and its Service Authority. This is a probing amendment. Not being an expert on these matters, I do not know a great deal about these two services, but, from the little I do know, I feel they are more akin to the police service than to the security services. As I understand it, they are much more public bodies. They deal with matters such as money laundering rather than intelligence and the security of the realm. Indeed, the NCIS has an internet site on which it invites people to become delegates to its annual conference. It invites journalists to apply for accreditation. It is an admirably open organisation and it appears to be in rather strange company. Is my hon. Friend the Minister sure that it is in the right pot with the Security Service and the Secret Intelligence Service?
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for raising this issue. The National Criminal Intelligence Service and its Service Authority are closely related to and work in a comparable way to our intelligence agencies. They are not a police body but an intelligence service. In practice, a clear distinction can no longer be drawn between intelligence relating to national security and criminal intelligence. The two overlap and the NCIS plays an important role in dealing with terrorism as well as criminality and tackling police corruption. One only has to ask how terrorists are financed to realise that there is often no distinction between intelligence services and criminal activity. Therefore, much of the work of the NCIS is within the intelligence bracket. I am therefore confident that it is in the right pot.
<P>
I can give my hon. Friend one assurance: although part II of the Bill deals with exempt information that does not mean that no information will ever be published about the authorities in any circumstances. The authorities will have to consider whether the prejudice of publishing information overrides the interest in publishing it. They will have to carry out that harm test. Of course, if the applicant is unhappy with the balance as applied by the authority, he can apply to the Information Commissioner who, in turn, can give a recommendation about that specific information. Putting them in this pot, so to speak, does not mean that no information will ever leak out. That is not the Government's intention. Given their functions, they are undoubtedly in the right part of the Bill. I invite my hon. Friend to withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that reply. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 21 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Clause 22 and 23 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Further consideration adjourned.—[Mr. Mike Hall.]
<P>
Adjourned accordingly at nineteen minutes past Six o'clock till Tuesday 25 January at half-past Ten o'clock.
