					<a name="070510105000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">Welcome
back to the Chair, Mr. Cook. May I echo your comments about
the evidence that you are receiving, which you are turning around
remarkably quickly? I am sure that all members of the Committee are
grateful for that. The transcript of the informal committee was turned
out particularly quickly&#151;I will call it that rather than
&#147;select committee&#148;, as you referred to it, Mr.
Cook, to save further debate on the subject. I also made sure that hon.
Members were given it directly, so they have probably received two
copies. I hope that it will prove to be useful for the remainder of our
deliberations.</div>
					<a name="070510105000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Electroconvulsive
therapy&#151;the subject of clause 30&#151;has always been a
contentious issue. The treatment is particularly controversial, and
gives rise to a number of concerns when applied to children. Amendment
No. 9 would inject some assurances about how ECT may in extremis be
used for the benefit of children. The amendment is in my name, those of
my hon. Friends and those of the Liberal Democrats. It endeavours to
provide that ECT may only be given to under-18s with consent and a
second opinion. The consent would be from the young person when they
are capable of giving it, or that of a parent when they are incapable.
The amendment would allow consent to be given by order of the court in
the case of parents who do not feel comfortable with the responsibility
of giving consent, or who might not make decisions in their
child&#146;s best interest. That would ensure that both young
people&#146;s and parents&#146; needs are protected.</div>
					<a name="070510105000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is difficult for parents
who are asked about applying ECT to a vulnerable child who is going
through a traumatic time to make a decision. We want to make the
application procedure for ECT easier.</div>

					<a name="070510105000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">As it is,
children and young people can have ECT on parental consent alone or,
with a second opinion authorisation, it can be administered against
their 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column289" />Column number: 289</div>wishes and the wishes of the parents. ECT is an invasive treatment and
the pre-legislative scrutiny Committee has expressed concerns about it,
too. It can have a number of side effects, including short or long-term
memory
impairment.</div>

usually reserved for cases where there is a perceived life-threatening
situation or where extensive alternative treatments have failed.
Without controlled trials, the evidence for its efficacy is
limited.&#148;</div>
					<a name="070510105000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">Everyone would
agree that the adolescent brain is developing. Its structure is
changing. We could have great debates about how the brain develops in
the early years and how attachment can affect it. The brain of a
teenager is certainly not fully developed, as I am sure parents of
teenagers will
concur.</div>
					<a name="070510105000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not a
clinician, but&#151;technically&#151;synaptic pruning, which is
believed to be essential for the fine tuning of the functional networks
of the brain, takes place throughout adolescence, as do changes to the
frontal cortex. That is essential to functions such as response
inhibition, emotion regulation, analysing problems and
planning.</div>

Friend the Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin), in one of
his lighter
moments.</div>
					<a name="070510105000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">We need to
make sure that, when used, ECT is used for the best therapeutic benefit
of the young person in extremis when there are no alternatives and
when, ultimately, their condition could be life threatening. It is
important that such an invasive treatment, with its potential
psychological as well as cognitive adverse effects, is not imposed
against the will of a young person with decision-making
capacity.</div>
					<a name="070510105000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
amendment would provide for a second opinion under the second opinion
approved doctor system for both formal and informal patients. That
would go some way towards achieving the safeguard. The amendment would
also require that either the young person&#146;s doctor or the SOAD
is a child and adolescent practitioner. Again, carrying on last
Tuesday&#146;s debate about the importance of age-appropriate
treatment carried out by age-appropriate qualified practitioners, that
is more essential in the case of extreme forms of
treatment.</div>
					<a name="070510105000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">The joint
scrutiny Committee recognised the importance of using specialist
clinical knowledge when working with children and young people. Members
of that Committee agreed with the ECT safeguards provided for under-16s
in the draft Mental Health Bill, but considered that they should be
extended to 16 and 17-year-olds. We are recognising that in extremis
ECT may ultimately be a suitable treatment for a child. I am talking
about a small number of cases. It is absolutely essential that proper
safeguards are attached to the treatment for the benefit of the child
and the parent who may have decision-making powers for that
child.</div>

cases, the choice to consider 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column290" />Column number: 290</div>ECT would not arise in an emergency, so the need to obtain a second
consent would not be inhibitory to a proper consideration? It would not
prevent essential treatment from being

								Tim
Loughton:
						</b> That is indeed right. A future amendment will
deal with emergency situations. We are not looking to take away the
powers of a clinician to administer such treatment in an emergency. If
a decision had to be made in life-threatening circumstances, we would
not want to overrule a clinician&#146;s opinion. I hope that the
Committee will regard the amendment as helpful. It would give further
assurances that children received appropriate treatment&#151;a form
of treatment that is probably the most invasive that we have discussed
so far in
Committee.</div>

							<b class="B">Dr.
Ian Gibson</b> (Norwich, North) (Lab): I just want to say
something about ECT. Unless people see it, they do not understand what
a dreadful episode that procedure can be in somebody&#146;s life.
Basically, a person goes into a fit. We do not know what ECT does in
the brain. The best explanation that I have seen is that it resets the
computer, whatever that means. We hear of side effects, and we also
hear of deaths. There have only been seven deaths in the past year, but
it is a dreadful treatment. We have to be very careful when we allow
that treatment to be used.</div>
					<a name="070510105000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I will put
my cards on the table and say that I am absolutely against ECT even in
desperate situations. There is always an alternative. I want to amplify
the need for real safeguards for whoever gets that treatment,
particularly children, because their protection should be no different
from that of an adult. The treatment is drastic and we need to ensure
that there are safeguards. At different periods, the Government have
looked into the matter to see that safeguards are in place. I look
forward to hearing what the Minister says. I know that I speak for my
hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, North-West, who is not here. In his
campaigning on mental health, he, too, has worried about the issue. We
should be wary about the safeguards. They must be high enough to ensure
that we do not get any cowboy effects from the treatment of our
patients, particularly our young
ones.</div>
					
					<a name="070510105000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="070510105000163"></a>
							<b class="B">Dr.
John Pugh</b> (Southport) (LD): I may possibly be the only
member of the Committee who has assisted in the administration of
electroconvulsive therapy. I was working as a nursing assistant without
any nursing or medical qualifications during a gap year from
university, which proves that the mental services have progressed
significantly since then.</div>
					<a name="070510105000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I can
remember exactly what happened very vividly. People were wheeled in,
jewellery and false teeth were removed, they were sedated, and there
was a brief application. Patients had a fit and it was expected that
amnesia would be an automatic consequence of the treatment.
Incontinence was one of the other automatic responses that sometimes
occurred. The regime under which I was working assumed that the
treatment could be used almost casually. It was used to treat cases of
endogenous depression&#151;when people are very deeply depressed. It
was not used in life and death situations, but in circumstances in
which the psychiatrist thought it was an appropriate
treatment.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column291" />Column number: 291</div>
					<a name="070510105000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">Even in those days, some
psychiatrists refused to use ECT. Even those who used it recognised
that there was a limit to how far they could use it. After a while, the
treatment itself became addictive and the patient simply became more
and more depressed unless they had the repeated treatment. The
interesting thing about ECT, as the hon. Member for Norwich, North has
said, is that there is no explanatory paradigm as to how it works;
people just know that it works, in the same way that people, in years
gone by, used to go around travelling fairs and use electricity to cure
all sorts of ailments. Occasionally, it worked on conditions such as
rheumatism. In the absence of an explanatory paradigm, I found it very
interesting to read in the clause, the
phrase</div>
					<a name="070510105000122"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;that the patient
is capable of understanding the nature, purpose and likely effects of
the treatment&#148;.</div>
					<a name="070510105000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do
not think that we understand the full nature of the treatment. I can be
corrected by experts who may tell me that they now understand precisely
how it works.</div>
					<a name="070510105000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
treatment has been used in mental health services for a long time with
people knowing that it has an effect, but not knowing very much about
what other effects it might have. That is a real reason to have extra
precautions put in place, particularly in the case of children because
the child and adolescent brain is still evolving and developing in a
way that the adult brain is not. There are very strong reasons for
putting in place every adequate precaution because, even in the adult
scenario, it may not be a completely satisfactory treatment, especially
if we do not know what is going on.</div>

Browning</b> (Tiverton and Honiton) (Con): I want to add my
support to what has been said. In replying to the scrutiny Committee,
the Government responded very positively to recommendation 44 and
pledged to amend the Bill as far as young people are concerned. I have
experience with a relative who&#151;I suspect as a result of his
service in the far east in the second world war&#151;regularly
received ECT treatment, which appeared to have results for a short
time, but they were not long lasting. I can share people&#146;s
concern about how it affects adults, but here, in looking at how it
affects young people, it is interesting to note the 2003 NICE guidance
on ECT:</div>
					<a name="070510105000123"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
risks associated with ECT may be enhanced...in children and young
people, and therefore clinicians should exercise particular caution
when considering ECT treatment
in&#148;</div>
					<a name="070510105000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">that
group.</div>
					<a name="070510105000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">The numbers
show that clinicians are cautious in recommending the treatment,
particularly for young people. The point was made about the need for
additional protection for younger people in such a determination, but
if they are under 18 also for their parents. The parents might be asked
to make that decision, which would be difficult. So, however the
legislation is amended, it must take account of patients who are under
18 and of those who have parental responsibility for them. Adding such
precautionary principles into the Bill would be a good
thing.</div>

Williams</b> (Caernarfon) (PC): I, too, was involved in
administering ECT, a number of years ago when I was trained as an
approved social worker. I have first-hand experience of the distress
caused, albeit to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column292" />Column number: 292</div>adults. If it caused that sort of distress to adults, there is even more
reason to be cautious with
children.</div>
					<a name="070510105000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would
like to point out that ECT is not a one-off experience, but is given in
courses of up to six treatments. From my direct experience, there was,
then at least, a fear of future treatment among the patients that I
dealt with. The reassurance of the involvement of parents would
certainly be very useful&#151;essential, I think&#151;with young
people.</div>

						The
treatment of patients with ECT was debated at length in the other
place. As a result, the Government tabled amendments to the
Bill&#151;clauses 30 and 31 &#151;providing that, where a detained
patient has capacity to give consent, it must be given before ECT can
go ahead. It is important to be clear about the issue of children from
the outset. If a child has capacity to consent and refuses treatment,
then that treatment cannot go ahead. That is the first point that we
need to be clear about and it is provided for by new section 58A, which
we propose to add to the Mental Health Act. It will also be possible by
regulation to subject additional treatment to the safeguards in new
section 58A, which applies to detained patients of all
ages.</div>

treatment, but as other hon. Members have conceded, its use in treating

recommends that information leaflets should be available, too. That is
an important part of the process. It should not just be a doctor

that information available, according to NICE&#146;s

						</b> I am not sure whether the hon. Lady is
referring to the idea that consent must be given for ECT. If she is, I
say to her that we listened to the debate in the other place and
introduced amendments. I hope that that is helpful&#151;we have
listened to some of the points
made.</div>
					<a name="070510105000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
amendment before us would apply to both detained and informal patients
under 18. It raises the difficult issue of parental responsibility. The
hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham is quite right to say that
for such parents, what is happening to their child is obviously
extremely distressing and difficult. We do not believe that it is right
for a parent to authorise treatment where a patient is detained,
because that is not how the Act works for any treatment of detained
patients.</div>
					<a name="070510105000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						As for
informal patients aged 16 or 17 who lack capacity, the Mental Capacity
Act 2005 would, obviously, apply. A parent&#146;s ability to make
decisions about their child, including their right to authorise
treatment, is subject to something called the concept of the parental
zone of responsibility. That means that the parent&#146;s ability to
make the decision depends on the facts of each case, having regard to
such factors as the age of the child, whether the child is refusing,
and the nature of the decision.</div>
					<a name="070510105000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of course, in most cases it is
appropriate for a parent to make decisions about treatment for a child,
when the child is an informal patient and is not competent to make a
decision. However, the courts may view some forms of medical treatment
as so invasive that deciding whether to give them to a child would not
be a normal 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column294" />Column number: 294</div>parenting decision. I am thinking of cases in which a doctor, perhaps a
second opinion doctor, might have reservations about the treatment to
which a parent had consented on the child&#146;s behalf. We should
not seek to anticipate such cases through legislation, because they may
have to go before the family courts for a decision about what would be
in the child&#146;s best
interest.</div>

							<b class="B">James
Duddridge</b> (Rochford and Southend, East) (Con): I apologise
if I am broadening the issue by making this intervention, rather than
probing on the Minister&#146;s specific point, but I have a problem
with putting the matter into context. How many people under 18 have ECT
at the moment, and at what age can it be given? I presume that it
cannot be given to a baby, but can it be given at 11&#151;or at 16?
Is there any breakdown of numbers? I know that that is quite a specific
question; I should like the Minister to give an overview now, but
perhaps she could provide more detail for the Committee
later.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="070510105000174"></a>
								Ms
Winterton:
						</b> Perhaps I may explain how things work now under
the Mental Health Act 1983. If a child who is detained consents to the
treatment, it must be approved by a clinician in charge of the
treatment, or by a second opinion doctor. If a child who is detained
refuses the treatment, and is capable of making the decision, the ECT
cannot be given except in an emergency. If the detained patient is not
capable of consent, that must be certified by a second opinion doctor
appointed by the Mental Health Act Commission.</div>
					<a name="070510105000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">Nine cases were referred to
the commission in the past three years, as I said earlier. Of those,
two involved refusal of the treatment, while seven involved patients
who were not capable of giving consent. Of those seven, only five were
certified by the SOAD so that treatment could go ahead. There are
already safeguards, because the question whether the treatment is
appropriate for the child is carefully examined. We have, as I have
said, amended the Act, with reference to the provision that if a child
capable of making the decision refuses, the treatment will not go
ahead.</div>

							<a name="070510105000175"></a>
								Mr.
Boswell:
						</b> I think I had understood that message earlier and
what the Minister says appears to be mutually consistent with it, which
is always a good thing. However, I do not think she mentioned the
figures in response to my hon. Friend the Member for Rochford and
Southend, East&#151;which I too was feeling after&#151;in respect
of cases in which a child under 18 has given consent. Will she say how
many children are being treated at the moment, so that we have some
idea? I understand that the hard cases are the important ones, but an
overall figure, which the Minister may yet be able to share with the
Committee, would be useful to set the
context.</div>
					
					<a name="070510105000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="070510105000176"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> I do not have those figures, but I shall try to
obtain them, if that would be helpful. We have amended the Bill so that
anyone who is not consenting and is not capable cannot have
ECT.</div>
					<a name="070510105000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						There
are some issues to consider, including in some instances the fact that,
if the child is detained under the 1983 Act, a doctor and a second
opinion doctor need to make the decision. There is independence in that
provision. In a sense, for the parental responsibility to override 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column295" />Column number: 295</div>
						that in the case of detained patients is against
everything else that happens under that Act. I realise that this is
difficult and, on first reading, one would imagine that the parental
responsibility could override the provision, but it is important to
recognise that, sometimes, it will be necessary to administer
treatments, with all the safeguards that there are, to ensure that a
child gets the treatment that is
needed.</div>
					<a name="070510105000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
refers to cases going to the High Court. We do not believe that it is
right to require the court to approve treatment with ECT in every case
in which a parent cannot or will not consent. The court should be able
to intervene in a limited number of cases, rather than routinely. If a
parent objected to ECT for their child, they could apply to the court
under the Children Act 1989 for an injunction stopping treatment,
pending a full consideration of the case, when the court might order
that the treatment not be given. In such cases, the child would be
represented by the Official
Solicitor.</div>
					<a name="070510105000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">With
regard to 16 and 17-year-olds, a deputy would be appointed by the Court
of Protection. If a capable patient is required to consent to
ECT&#151;for example, a 16 and 17-year-old patient who lacks the
capacity to do so with a deputy who has been authorised by the court to
take decisions about treatment&#151;their deputy should be able to
refuse consent as if they were the patient. That is how section 58
works.</div>
					<a name="070510105000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">Hon. Members
may say, &#147;If a deputy can do it, why can&#146;t a
parent?&#148; The difference is that the court has appointed somebody
who stands in its shoes to make decisions about treatment, hence the
difference between that and the parental
issue.</div>

							<a name="070510105000177"></a>
								Mr.
Boswell:
						</b> The Minister has given the Committee some
valuable assurances and reassurances about how parents can express
their views and have them taken into account by the court, perhaps by
an injunction procedure. As I recall, it would also be possible, if the
parent was unhappy about the deputy&#146;s view that such treatment
should proceed, for them to make an application to the Court of
Protection for that to be
overturned.</div>

						</b> Yes, I believe that that is the case. However,
there are some elements of the amendment that we do not want to
include; in particular, the idea that a SOAD should always be involved
in certificating ECT for child patients except in emergencies. As I
have said before, there is also the question of whether to include
further safeguards with formal child
patients.</div>

Pugh:
						</b> The Minister has explained the legal safeguards well
and has provided some powerful reassurances in some areas. Aside from
legal safeguards, there is the question of whether ECT is ever
clinically necessary. The Minister said that the number of cases in
which ECT is used is limited. Presumably it is possible to give the
Committee some written indication&#151;not necessarily here and
now&#151;of the clinical reasons that have been given for the use of
ECT on children and whether the same clinical reasons are used in other
countries. It might be that the practice simply does not occur in other
countries.</div>

can gather information on that. I suspect 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column296" />Column number: 296</div>that it is an area in which there are differences of clinical opinion,
so I think that we would need to be cautious about in any way
indicating that we wanted to override decisions. In the debate in the
other place, some psychiatrists said that, although they had always had
some reservations about ECT, it could be effective in some instances. I
shall see whether I can obtain advice. However, I hope that the

to remove some elements of the amendment, particularly those regarding
SOAD responsibility for certification, which would strengthen what we

						The
amendment is another probing one in relation to ECT. Its purpose is to
amend the 1983 Act to restrict the right to give emergency ECT without
the normal safeguards to patients lacking capacity, and instead to
limit treatment to situations in which it is given to save the
patient&#146;s life. We agreed earlier that, although we might not
like the use of ECT&#151;some hon. Members have questioned whether it
ever has any efficacy, and I share that concern&#151;in
emergency life or death cases, we must rely on the opinions of
clinicians at the coal face.</div>
					<a name="070510105000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">Section 62 of the 1983 Act
covers urgent treatment. It severely limits the emergency provision of
treatments that are hazardous or irreversible. It is generally
accepted, and I think that there is general agreement in the Committee,
that ECT is hazardous, although the risk to individuals will vary
depending on general health and other factors. Indeed, as the hon.
Member for Norwich, North has said, there is a question mark over the
issue of its effect, and its possible side effects. It is therefore
possible, under section 62, that it should not be available except
under section 62(1)(a), as immediately necessary to save the
patient&#146;s life.</div>
					<a name="070510105000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is not clear, however, that
section 62 can be interpreted in that way. The form of wording implies
a relevant treatment not being irreversible or hazardous 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column297" />Column number: 297</div>of itself, although it might be either irreversible or hazardous in an
individual case. I know that the Mental Health Alliance believes that a
treatment that is potentially hazardous and irreversible should not be
given without a second opinion, except in the most compelling
circumstances, such as when it is immediately necessary to save life. I
agree with that view. It is, also, extremely unlikely that ECT would
ever be the only alternative for a patient. We have heard in an earlier
debate the Minister&#146;s reassurance about how little ECT is used
for children. There have been a couple of handfuls of cases in the past
few years, so the practice is not widespread, but it is important that
safeguards should exist for the relevant people; they should be
protected.</div>
					<a name="070510105000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the
debate on this subject in the House of Lords, Baroness Murphy
said:</div>
					<a name="070510105000126"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
only circumstance where one is justified in giving emergency
ECT&#151;in other words, to give it without a second opinion in a
life-threatening illness&#151;is where someone has stopped eating and
drinking. Under those circumstances they have nearly always stopped
speaking as well.&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 15
January 2007; Vol. 688, col.
483-4.]</div>
					<a name="070510105000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment is a
probing one, to attempt to instil some safeguards into the
arrangements. There appears to be some doubt in the wording of the 1983
Act about the potentially hazardous nature of ECT. We want more
safeguards on ECT, alongside those for other potentially hazardous
treatments covered by the
Bill.</div>

								Dr.
Gibson:
						</b> I think that we all welcome the changes that have
been made in the Lords, on the administration of ECT to patients with
capacity who refuse it. I am still concerned, however, about the
possibility of urgent treatment provisions being used to give ECT to a
refusing patient, in situations that are clearly not an emergency. For
example, violent behaviour, it seems, could in certain instances
justify the use of ECT. The Minister and I are both familiar with the
case of Rocky Bennett, who showed violent behaviour, was restrained in
a certain way, and sadly died. I know that there is no parallel, but it
might be possible, in such circumstances, to arrive at an
interpretation in which ECT is thought better for someone than having
six people sitting on him. I do not know, but the Minister should say
something about that type of case. It can never be right to give
someone ECT just to control behaviour, and I should not want
justification of that to be an aspect of the passage of the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="070510105000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">I can see that
there might be some situations, involving for example patients who are
catatonic, in which ECT would be used, but in my opinion emergency ECT
should never be given simply to control violent behaviour. I hope that
nothing in the Bill will be taken as justifying or permitting
that.</div>

Boswell:
						</b> I very much agree with the remarks of the hon.
Member for Norwich, North. The Committee should bear something else in
mind: we are confident in general of the good faith of clinicians, but
in circumstances in which the patient is, perhaps I should say,
behaving badly, which we as lay people would find difficult to handle,
and which may be difficult for some clinicians as well, we may have an
underlying fear that something might be presented as an emergency when
it was in fact a continuing clinical situation, requiring a more
deliberate clinical decision, and that some reversions to ECT for a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column298" />Column number: 298</div>patient who was being violent might use the alleged emergency as a
pretext for ECT. I think that the Committee&#146;s overall message
across all parties this morning is the less ECT the
better&#151;certainly not unless it is absolutely necessary or
without due consideration and, if at all possible, consent. I concur
with the sentiments already
expressed.</div>

								Dr.
Pugh:
						</b> I am not sure how I am going to get this
clarification; maybe the Minister can help me. We were talking about
the possibility of ECT being used to control somebody in an emergency
situation who is being violent. My supposition is that the
administration of ECT normally involves sedation. If somebody is
already sedated, they will not be violent at all, unless it is
suggested that ECT be used on people who are not sedated, which I think
most would regard as cruelty. The case that we need to worry about is
one in which somebody is chronically violent and ECT is seen as a
remedy for it, which is
different.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="070510105000186"></a>Dr.
Gibson:
						</b> Is it not part of ECT for an anaesthetist to be
present in the room as well? The drug is administered and the patient
is quieted in that way; then the pads are put on the
brain.</div>
					
					<a name="070510105000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="070510105000187"></a>Dr.
Pugh:
						</b> My point is that using it to deal with a
particularly violent episode would not be the right strategy, because
sedating someone resolves a violent
episode.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="070510105000188"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> Again, the issue was certainly debated in the
other place. My hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, North raised the
tragic case of Rocky Bennett. I should like to confirm that it does not
appear to me that using ECT to control a violent situation is the right
thing to do, as a general anaesthetic is administered before it
occurs.</div>
					<a name="070510105000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.
Friend also made a point about NICE guidance and whether it must be
taken into account as part of the process when patients consider ECT.
The patient is required to understand treatment, which means of course
that best practice is to use information that explains the treatment
fully. In such circumstances, I would consider NICE guidance to be
included in that.
</div>
					<a name="070510105000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 10, a
probing amendment, quite rightly examines the situation regarding what
is considered emergency treatment, and attempts to say that ECT should
be used simply for emergency treatment&#151;in other words, only in
cases where treatment is immediately necessary to save the
patient&#146;s life. During the debate in the other place, Lord Hunt
and Baroness Royall agreed that the Government would consider the
point, but they felt that to limit the circumstances in which treatment
can be given in urgent situations to those in which it is immediately
necessary to save life would be too restrictive. I agree, and I will
try to explain the sort of conditions where flexibility is needed,
although I understand completely the concerns that prompted the
amendment.</div>
					<a name="070510105000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">We do not
want our commitment to requiring consent if a patient has the capacity
to give it to be overridden by clinicians wanting to use the urgent
treatment provisions as a mechanism for providing ECT to patients who
object to it. There are strong 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column299" />Column number: 299</div>arguments that it is inappropriate that all the criteria in section
62(1) should apply when considering whether to give ECT to a patient as
an urgent treatment. The criteria include treatments that are given to
alleviate serious suffering or to prevent a patient from behaving
violently or being a danger to himself or others. However, I am
concerned that amendment No. 10 would prevent treatment for a patient
who does not yet need to have their life saved, but whose condition
risks them suffering irreversible effects if treatment is not urgently
provided. ECT can be effective in treating some patients with
depression. Sometimes, such patients refuse to take any
sustenance&#151;to eat or to drink. If that continues for long
enough, they will
die.</div>
				
					
					<a name="070510105000131"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.15
am</div>
					<a name="070510105000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">The problem
with the amendment is that it would allow for a patient who continues
to refuse ECT to receive it only when they get to a point at which
their condition is immediately life threatening. It is true that during
that time, clinicians may consider other
treatments.&#151;<i class="I">[</i>

respond to anti-depressant medications. There may be situations in
which that will be too late.</div>
					<a name="070510105000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before such patients would be
considered to be in immediate need of treatment to save their life,
there will be a time when their continued refusal to take food or
water, while not life threatening, puts them at immediate risk of a
serious deterioration in their condition. Their internal organs, such
as their kidneys, might be irreversibly damaged, which could result in
life-long disability or illness. In such a situation, it would be wrong
to deny a patient urgent ECT treatment when they have either refused it
or are not capable of giving their consent. Also, it would be wrong to
ask a clinician with responsibility for a patient who lacks capacity to
wait either until their condition deteriorates to the point at which
they are on the verge of death, or until the SOAD arrives to certify
the treatment. There are therefore instances in which we would not want
to see clinicians constrained by the effects of the
amendment.</div>
					<a name="070510105000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having
said that, I understand the thinking behind the amendment, but we have
to be realistic; there may be situations in which ECT will need to be
administered.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="070510105000191"></a>Angela
Browning:
						</b> Will the Minister clarify how much ECT would be
used in the circumstances she described? Will a clinician recommend ECT
to deal with the psychological factors when a patient has unilaterally
stopped taking fluid or other sustenance to the extent that it has had
a physical effect? I am not knowledgeable enough to know whether that
would be the course of treatment in those circumstances&#151;I do not
know, and I do not know whether she knows. Withdrawal of fluid from the
body over a sustained period can have a dramatic effect. Would ECT be
so much as considered in such
circumstances?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="070510105000192"></a>Ms
Winterton:
						</b> Yes, the example I gave was of someone with
serious depression who, as may well 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column300" />Column number: 300</div>happen, has stopped eating and drinking. Anti-depressants can be used,
but they take time to take effect. ECT will be used at some stage, but
the amendment, which is in the hon. Lady&#146;s name, would mean that
the clinician had to wait until the patient was near death, as opposed
to putting their internal organs at risk of
damage.</div>

the circumstances that led up to the situation and informed his or her
clinical decision?</div>

Loughton:

talking about some technical clinical situations that the Minister and
myself are probably not capable of analysing in great detail. I did say
that this was a probing amendment and that we might want to return to
this matter. She signalled that there were points in the amendment that
might merit further attention should we return to ECT on Report. We may
consider this further, because I think that we are both trying to

treatment.</div>

						</b> Most of my comments relate to new clause 4, which
is an attempt to put the Bill, which we are trying to improve, on a par
with the Mental Capacity Act 2005. That Act allows a person to make an
advance directive on refusing further treatment. Such a directive is
most commonly used when people are aware that they have
Alzheimer&#146;s or another degenerative disease. In such
circumstances, people often reach a decision when they are well that
they will reach a stage when they may not want further treatment, so
the directives are commonly associated with a refusal of
treatment.</div>

important in the context of mental health legislation to realise that
there is another aspect to this. Patients can make a positive
recommendation when they are well of how they would prefer to be
treated. They may have received a number of different treatments in the
past and have strong ideas as to which is the most effective and useful
for them. Being allowed to make such decisions empowers
patients.</div>
