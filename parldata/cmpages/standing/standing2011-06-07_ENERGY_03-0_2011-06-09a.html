               <p class="hs_AmendmentLevel0">‘and that the
recommendations have been made without bias toward, or in promotion of,
the products or services of any one green deal provider, and that
person has disclosed (in writing and verbally) their connection with
any green deal installer or green deal provider to the improver and the
bill
payer.’.</p>
               <p class="tabbed">Good
morning to you, Mr Leigh, and to members of the Committee. It is good
to be under your stewardship again on this lovely day. We had a good
debate in the previous two sittings, and I am sure that we shall have a
good debate today. The amendment deals with the assessment of property,
and I know that a lot of Members are concerned to ensure that we get
this right. We discussed, in the previous sittings, making sure that
people have real confidence in the process. Ultimately, it comes down
to the moment when someone walks through the door. Householders must
have strong trust in that person, because they are entering into a very
long-term relationship with the supplier and
assessor.<a class="bkMark" name="11060942000016">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
amendment focuses on disclosure, and clause 4(2) deals with
the authorised person. All aspects of the clause try to bolt down
certainty with regard to the first visit; the clause states that the
person must be authorised, must be well trained and skilled, and must
give an estimate of the likely savings resulting from the green deal
assessment. They have to give an estimate of the payback period and
have to say that the householder can pay by instalments. All those
things are good. As we discussed in previous sittings, to avoid what
happened elsewhere when versions of the scheme were tried in haste, we
need to make sure that the scheme is
right.<a class="bkMark" name="11060942000017">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
amendment focuses on disclosure. That is about knowing that, when the
person puts a foot beyond the door, there will be frankness in the
dialogue between them and the customer about who they are, who they 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 94<a class="bkMark" name="Column94">&#160;</a>
                  </div>represent, where their strengths are in offering advice and their
limitations, particularly if that individual represents a company that
also provides certain products from a specified range. I want to make
it clear that disclosure is the key. We think that the amendment will
help the Minister, because it will strengthen what he has already put
forward. I am quite complimentary about the work that he and his
officials have done; only in the past few weeks, we have seen a good
document, “Consumer protection in the Green Deal”, which
sets out how confidence can be given, and I wish to cite briefly from
it. Paragraph 1.2, “Trusted and reliable energy assessment and
Green Deal advice”,
states:<a class="bkMark" name="11060942000018">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“This

base”—<a class="bkMark" name="11060942000154">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>I
stress
“impartial”—<a class="bkMark" name="11060942000019">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“on
which to choose a Green Deal that is right for them. It will also
ensure Green Deal Providers have clear and impartial information on
which to base their
offer”.<a class="bkMark" name="11060942000155">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>That
is what the amendment is all about. Its aim is to ensure that green
deal assessments are carried out in a proper, objective and frank
way.<a class="bkMark" name="11060942000020">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
main reason for proposing what would be a welcome change to the Bill is
that, under the current measures, if there were not full disclosure of
who that person represented, there would be nothing to prevent a green
deal assessor from being incentivised by the provider to attract
business when making an assessment. We must bear in mind human nature
and corporate behaviour; there would be the potential for the assessor
to say, “We have some very good solutions for your property
under the green deal and, by the way, I have the precise
product”, and not suggest a better policy that might do the job
better and far more
cheaply.<a class="bkMark" name="11060942000021">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
stress to the Minister that that does not mean that the assessor should
not be able to say, “Yes, I am here from a subsidiary of
Kingfisher”—or a small independent retailer, B&amp;Q,
Tesco, or British Gas Centrica—“and, based on our
assessment, we have some good products that will do the thing for
you.” However, full disclosure is an imperative. If the measure
was a blanket behind which people could hide their true colours, it
would be likely to damage consumer confidence and greatly jeopardise
the green deal’s chance of success, and we all want it to be a
great success.<a class="bkMark" name="11060942000022">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Understandably,
the Minister is very optimistic about the green deal, as we are. We
want to ensure that it succeeds. He has talked about it being a
game-changer in how we deal with energy efficiency and, to come back to
our earlier discussion, how we tackle the low-carbon agenda and fuel
poverty, which I am sure we will debate more. It is, however,
predicated on confidence in the human interaction that takes place when
the assessor comes through the
door.<a class="bkMark" name="11060942000023">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As
I understand from the discussions that my hon. Friend the Member for
Liverpool, Wavertree, and I have had with the Minister and his
officials, the types of businesses interested in taking part in the
green deal imply that assessors are likely to fall into at least two
categories. First, there might be genuinely independent green deal
assessors, who are not tied to any company whatever, but make a living
carrying out assessments. In the same way, independent energy
performance certificate assessors may act as individuals or as part of
an assessment company. Many of us are familiar with that. I have been
through the process in my home, and I knew that the 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 95<a class="bkMark" name="Column95">&#160;</a>
                  </div>individual who came in was not tied to anyone else; he simply did his
job as an assessor and did not push, promote or sell anything. That is
the first
type.<a class="bkMark" name="11060942000024">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
second type will be far more likely, because the source of the green
deal is the idea that we should energise the market to drive take-up,
as the Minister has said clearly and repeatedly. We do not disagree
with that approach; if it can be made to work, that is fantastic.
However, that means that it is far more likely that assessors will be
employees of small, medium or large green deal installers. By
employees, I do not mean shop workers who are given a little additional
training, but properly qualified assessors. As we have discussed, the
assessors will have to be trained to the same standard as energy
performance certificate assessors, or probably to a higher standard,
but they will still be employees of, and have their wages paid by, the
green deal
provider.<a class="bkMark" name="11060942000025">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We
have to energise the private sector industry, just as we have to
acknowledge that providers have a vested interest. Many of them show
great corporate responsibility and wish to make the green deal work for
several reasons, but they also want to make business out of it. If we
do not capitalise on that, there is no way that enough assessors will
be trained to meet the Government’s ambition of refitting 14
million homes by 2020. Does the Minister share my view of the types of
assessors there will be, and what proportion does he anticipate will be
purely and genuinely independent or, in one way or another, tied to a
small, medium or large branded
company?<a class="bkMark" name="11060942000026">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Although
I accept the need for the scheme to operate successfully, I think that
the majority of assessors will be linked to green deal providers. The
amendment seeks to provide more confidence that consumers will have
complete protection in receiving unbiased assessments and full
disclosure, and to avoid any suspicion of mis-selling. If there is not
disclosure, the company will be not a gamekeeper turned poacher, but a
gamekeeper and a poacher at the same time. Inserting a requirement for
disclosure will prevent that happening. As the Bill stands, it is easy
to imagine a scenario in which companies incentivise their assessors to
push improvement packages containing only, or limited by, their
products, and not recommend other, possibly better, solutions that
would improve the property’s energy efficiency but are outside
their range of products and
services.<a class="bkMark" name="11060942000027">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Such
an assessment could in theory lead to the creation of a green deal
package that is not accurate, is later found not to meet the golden
rule or, just as importantly, undermines the workings of the
competitive market that Ministers want, and which they tell us the
green deal is predicated on. It might also restrict consumer choice if
the full raft of improvements available to the property were not
properly disclosed. Alternatively, the assessor should say, “I
am from this company, but there are other companies that you could and
should go out and look for,” because choice is part and parcel
of the measure. I have questions to ask at some point during our
discussions about how we ensure that choice is extended to all parts of
the country, including remote, rural areas, where the choice of green
deal providers might be narrower simply because of the
geography.<a class="bkMark" name="11060942000028">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Without
disclosure, the assessor might recommend measures that were best suited
not to the tenant, home owner or landlord, but to the product portfolio
or the profit margins of a particular business. It might also 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 96<a class="bkMark" name="Column96">&#160;</a>
                  </div>result in a significant benefit to large businesses, particularly big
companies, which might dominate the market. We know that good work is
being done with some larger companies in preparing for the green deal,
with training facilities and so on for assessors. However, we might end
up with a market that is flooded by assessors who are linked to the
main, big utility companies and others.<a class="bkMark" name="11060942000029">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Would such a
situation worry the Minister? I am sure that he shares my concern to
ensure that market growth around the green deal, and the other societal
benefits that will come from it, are on a level playing field, so that
there is at least an opportunity for many smaller providers to benefit.
Disclosure would assist in that, because as people sat in their living
rooms with an assessor, they could say, “Thank you, energy
provider; I came to you first, but now I’m going to look around
at one or two others.” We need disclosure for that to happen.
Companies cannot simply say, “Look, you trust us. We’ve
been servicing you with your energy bill for the past 10 years and you
haven’t bothered switching,”—as many people do
not—“so trust us; we’re the biggest player around.
Stick with us.” That company may be the best, but it must say,
“We are linked, and our advice is based on what we’re
offering within our products and services—you should go out and
look at some others. Let’s make that clear.”<a class="bkMark" name="11060942000030">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The amendment
is supported by consumer protection bodies such as Which?<em> </em>and
others, as the Minister will know. They recognise, as we do, that
proper disclosure—provided for in the Bill, rather than wished
or hoped for in secondary legislation—by a person promoting
green deal services and products would be a sufficient and necessary
safeguard. With it, customers can make an informed choice in full
knowledge of a provider’s strengths and limitations, and they
would be more likely to shop around. The amendment would not prevent or
prohibit green deal assessors being trained by, employed by or linked
to a green deal provider that promoted its products and services. It
would, however, require assessors to disclose clearly and early on to
consumers that they were linked to a provider, and to conduct an
assessment without bias.<a class="bkMark" name="11060942000031">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I am sure
that the Minister will respond that he is fully aware of those issues
and that they are all dealt with in the document, “Consumer
protection in the Green Deal”, which he has released in the past
couple of weeks and to which I have referred. I welcome that document,
which contains good, sensible proposals, particularly on the green deal
code, which is to be developed with industry, and the green deal
helpline. He and his officials have been rushing to bring detail
forward, but it would have been helpful if it had been available when
the other place debated the Bill, all things being equal; we could then
have debated it here. We should focus on it now.<a class="bkMark" name="11060942000032">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Although I
support the Minister’s announcements in “Consumer
protection in the Green Deal”, voluntary approaches,
consultation and Department documents are simply no substitute for what
the consumer bodies are asking for: measures that will pass into law.
If Ministers are saying that consumer protections will be in place when
the scheme is operational, it would be strange if they did not support
the amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11060942000033">&#160;</a>

                  </span> My hon. Friend the Member for
Ogmore discussed the disclosure of the relationship between the green
deal assessor, the provider and the installer. Clause 4 outlines the
conditions relating to the green deal plan and the assessment of the
property, which give rise to a whole number of concerns. As we have
agreed, consumer confidence is a key issue with the green deal as a
whole, and it is essential that we have consumer confidence if the
green deal is to be successful.<a class="bkMark" name="11060942000035">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We have made
a number of presumptions. We have presumed that members of the public
will welcome the assessor into their homes, but that presumption is
fraught with great difficulties, particularly when it comes to the
elderly and the vulnerable. They will probably see the visit as some
sort of investigation into their private lives to scrutinise how they
live. We therefore have a lot to do if the assessor is to gain access
to people’s properties, and we need to make sure that the people
being visited have confidence in the
assessor.<a class="bkMark" name="11060942000036">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">My
hon. Friend outlined some of the problems we face. Another problem is
mis-selling on the doorstep, which has haunted successive Governments,
and the Select Committee on Energy and Climate Change recently raised
the issue with the big six electricity generating companies. We must
make sure that such things cannot take place in relation to the
assessor or any part of the green deal.<a class="bkMark" name="11060942000037">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">A BBC news
bulletin said that an energy firm had been guilty of mis-selling to
doorstep customers. It frightens the life out of me that people will,
whether they are accredited or not, be knocking on doors and saying,
“I’m the new green deal assessor. You need your house
assessed. Can I come in and have a look?” People do not
understand what that means. I know that that is simplifying things, but
we need to bear it in mind.<a class="bkMark" name="11060942000038">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We should
listen to some of the language used about the mis-selling by the big
six companies. These are reputable companies; they are the top six in
the country—they hiked their prices up yesterday, but that is
another issue. Scottish and Southern Energy was found guilty of
tricking people into switching from their existing energy firms.
According to the BBC bulletin, the<a class="bkMark" name="11060942000039">&#160;</a>

               </p>
               <p>They were accused of
“deliberate and wilful mis-selling” and “dishonest
sales techniques”. The bulletin included a quote pointing out
that<a class="bkMark" name="11060942000041">&#160;</a>

               </p>
               <p>We
must make sure that there is a proper relationship, because although
assessors will be accredited, that does not necessarily mean that they
will not be forced to do what the likes of salespersons from the big
six do and mis-sell on the doorstep. Mis-selling is therefore a big
issue.<a class="bkMark" name="11060942000042">&#160;</a>

assessor’s independence and accountability are of paramount
importance, and people must be comfortable and confident that the green
deal assessor is wholly independent. However, the clause does not
provide for that in any way, shape or form. The Department of Energy

                     </span>
                  </strong> Thank you, Mr Leigh. Amendment 35 refers to the
green deal assessors, who are accredited advisors. They will assess the
energy performance of a property. That will be calculated, and certain
measures will be recommended to improve energy efficiency. Although a
code of practice will list the approved products, materials and
specification standards, tighter regulation is required. When the
assessor recommends the energy efficiency improvements for a particular
property, those recommendations must be made without any bias or
favouritism for any specific product or green deal provider. It is only
right and proper that, regarding disclosure, a means of regulating the
assessor should be in place. The assessors should disclose, in writing,
any connection they have with any green deal installer or provider to
both the improver and the bill payer, as outlined in the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11060942000045">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Depending on
which report one reads, the figure for the number of homes to be
included in the green deal varies from 20 million to 31 million; it
will perhaps be more than that. The figure bandied about for the
average cost per household of the energy efficiency measures is
approximately £6,500, with no upper limit. That is an awful lot
of money—billions of pounds. The DECC document suggests that at
least £7 billion of investment will be required. As the old
saying goes, where there is money, there is corruption. The Bill needs
to avoid any criticism that it does not tackle potential issues of
corruption. It is essential that the accredited assessors are
accountable. That will protect not only the improver, but the assessor.
May I respectfully request that the Minister carefully considers the
amendment, which simply asks the assessor to disclose any connection
with any green deal installer or green deal provider to the improver
and the bill
payer?<a class="bkMark" name="11060942000046">&#160;</a>

shall be brief. I want to express my support for amendment 35 and make
the point about the importance of the reputation of, and trust in, the
green deal—a point that I think the Minister himself made a
number of times on Second Reading and earlier in Committee. I am sure
that everybody in Committee wants the green deal to be a success. For
it to be a success, we need people to have confidence in it. There is
not necessarily anything wrong with a connection between an assessor
and a provider of particular products or particular measures; that is
not what the amendment is saying. The issue is disclosure, and
disclosure at an early stage. If there is no disclosure, there is a
risk that confidence in the green deal could be undermined at the very
start.<a class="bkMark" name="11060942000047">&#160;</a>

number of my constituents have concerns about door-to-door selling by
energy companies, an issue to which my hon. Friend the Member for
Wansbeck alluded. I accept completely that that is a very different
issue, but in many cases, my constituents will see the practice that we
are discussing as part of the same issue—the same scam, as they
might think of it. Having disclosure early on, and having a requirement
for disclosure set out clearly in legislation, would prevent
newspapers—the <em>Daily Mail</em> or whoever—alarming
people with all sorts of headlines about how people are going door to
door to try to rip them off. The extent of that alarm among some of the
people who I think will benefit most from the green deal should not be
underestimated. The issue is really about the importance of confidence,
reputation and trust in the green deal. That is why it is important to
set out that requirement in the Bill, and I hope the Minister will look
kindly on the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11060942000048">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> Good morning, Mr Leigh. May I thank
the hon. Members for Ogmore, for Wansbeck and for Rutherglen and
Hamilton West for their contributions this morning? I think that we are
singing from the same hymn sheet on these issues. We are coming from
the same place and also looking to end up at the same destination. They
are absolutely right. Consumer protection will be essential to the
success of the green deal, particularly, as the hon. Member for
Rutherglen and Hamilton West said, at the early stages of the
programme, so that it does not get derailed by unfavourable headlines
in newspapers. The concern about assessment and assessors is part of a
wider concern that has been expressed by the Committee about the need
for robust consumer protection. There is also a need to ensure that any
measures installed are fully guaranteed for a minimum period during
their operational lifetime while green deal payments are being
made.<a class="bkMark" name="11060942000049">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">This
would be a good point to mention that the existing market for
guarantees and warranties is complex and mis-selling could arise,
particularly where there is a mix of arrangements that could confuse
consumers who are interested in the green deal at the point of
purchase. I am therefore pleased to announce that we plan to require
green deal providers to provide a single guarantee to their customers.
Not only will the original customer be protected, but future occupants
of a green deal property during the repayment period will enjoy the
same coverage. Providers will guarantee all the installed measures for
their operational lifetime under green deal
plans.<a class="bkMark" name="11060942000050">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Furthermore,
we will consider requiring green deal providers to contribute to an
insurance scheme that will protect customers should the providers go
out of business. We expect that to operate in a similar way to the
scheme operated by the Association of British Travel Agents for the
travel sector, where consumers are brought home from abroad if a travel
company goes bust. As always, we are collaborating with stakeholders on
the details, and we will introduce secondary legislation in the
autumn.<a class="bkMark" name="11060942000051">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">On the
specific issue of people coming in to the homes of potential green deal
customers and receiving impartial assessment, hon. Members are
absolutely right, but I can assure them that we want to go further than
simply voluntary agreements or the code of practice that we have
already disclosed. Will the assessor be obliged to disclose whom they
represent? Absolutely, 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 100<a class="bkMark" name="Column100">&#160;</a>
                  </div>yes—if they are offering products, they will
need to make it clear whom they represent. That detail will be set out
in the code of practice in secondary legislation. Notwithstanding that,
we will require the first part of the assessment to be impartial
advice, exactly as the hon. Member for Ogmore
requested.<a class="bkMark" name="11060942000052">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
know that it can be frustrating for the Committee to understand why we
need details in secondary legislation rather than in the Bill. The fact
is that we need to ensure that we do not have requirements that overlap
or conflict with the principles of the Consumer Credit Act 1974.
Therefore, it is better to enshrine such requirements in secondary
legislation, which is a better place to put them into effect. That
approach not only allows us to act quickly if any loopholes are
subsequently discovered, but it is a more flexible means of adapting to
unexpected
problems.<a class="bkMark" name="11060942000053">&#160;</a>

potential for assessors to be in competition with other providers? For
example, could there be two or three assessors going to one property
and offering the best deal? If so, that could present huge problems. I
simply want clarification.<a class="bkMark" name="11060942000054">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I am not absolutely certain what the hon.
Gentleman is getting at, but there will be a cost for a green deal
assessment. A proper, thorough, professional assessment of any given
property will incur a charge. If the consumer goes ahead with a green
deal implementation on the property, the charge will either be rolled
up into a green deal package, or it may be that some retailers or green
deal providers will offer it for free and write it off in return for
going with them. That will be down to their commercial discretion.
There will be a cost to the assessments. The assessors are not being
asked to come in and give a quote; it is much more akin to an MOT in a
garage. It is a robust assessment rather than a visit to give a quote,
such as for double
glazing.<a class="bkMark" name="11060942000055">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I see what the hon. Gentleman is getting at. There
is a difference between the assessment and the cost of the assessment.
One hopes that assessments will be done to the same exacting
professional standards. Of course, assessments may vary, because a
human element is involved, but they should result in an objective
prescription for that property. That prescription is then costed. It
might be costed by the firm represented by the assessor, but it will be
open to the householder to take that prescription to another provider,
or as many providers as they like, and get them to quote. I would hope
that they would. The improvements might cost £10,000 or more, so
the notion of always getting three quotes is particularly well placed
in this instance.<a class="bkMark" name="11060942000057">&#160;</a>

not be the right one for the property. Comparison and competition are

                  </strong> Again, I think that the hon. Gentleman has
slightly misunderstood the difference between the impartial assessment
of the property’s requirements and the offer of installations or
products at a range of prices to meet those problems. The assessment
will basically say, “You require the following treatments,
interventions or installations.” Part two of the assessment will
say, “and this is our response to that.” However, the
assessment should be entirely independent and not tied to any provider.
I said in my opening remarks that the assessment should and will be, as
prescribed in secondary legislation, entirely independent and
interchangeable.<a class="bkMark" name="11060942000059">&#160;</a>

not right, where is their redress? Is it a commercial situation? Can
they get a second assessor to come in? Technology and the
interpretation of it changes. The situation will be fluid as we pass
through the years, and there will be different variables, and different
ideas and perceptions about how money can be saved. Can a second or
third assessor be asked to a property after the first assessment,

a different view?<a class="bkMark" name="11060942000060">&#160;</a>

assessment because of unprofessionalism or lack of a proper service. If
someone just did not fancy what was said to them, it would be their
prerogative to get another opinion, but they would have to pay for it.
In exactly the same way, a person is entitled to get an opinion from a
second doctor, and to take their prescription somewhere other than
Boots or the local chemist. There are those two parts to the
assessment.<a class="bkMark" name="11060942000063">&#160;</a>

problem that if someone gets three or four quotes, as the Minister has
rightly recommended, they will inevitably start to incur a lot of
costs? It is likely that the green deal provider will do the assessment
for free only if the customer then decides to go with its product. I am
concerned that that will be a barrier to the take-up of the scheme, and
am worried about how interchangeable the assessments will be. For
example, when someone has more than one company do a survey on a
property before they buy it, the assessments can be very different; one
says that the property will fall down tomorrow, and the other that it
will survive for another 500 years. The sense that the assessment is
objectively independent and will always be the same whoever does it is
misplaced.<a class="bkMark" name="11060942000066">&#160;</a>

professional assessment process. Obviously, we cannot rule out some
difference based on the individual going in, but one would expect the
assessment to be objective, not subjective, and to be done to a clear
set of agreed, uniform criteria. The assessment is the prescription for
what is required. We can think of it like an MOT. If someone takes
their car for an MOT and is told that four things need
doing—brakes repaired, and work on headlights, indicators and
clutch—they might phone another garage, and perhaps a third one,
and ask them for a quote for fixing the four

                  </strong> Mr Leigh, your guidance is absolutely
right: we should focus on the amendment. The amendment, which is on
disclosure, goes to the heart of how the assessment is carried out in
the two phases. Now that we are getting into the detail, does the
Minister have some pro forma that shows us what phase 1 of the
treatment assessment is, and how that is completely disassociated from
phase 2, which must look like a different sheet? That would be the
commercial company saying, “We have things to fix to ensure your
energy efficiency.” Does he have that? Could he share that with
the Committee? The MOT analogy may be misplaced, because we are all
aware of having been ripped off by garages when we have taken our cars
in for an MOT. Garages may give us things that we do not need, so that
we spend a lot of
money.<a class="bkMark" name="11060942000074">&#160;</a>

that we can stress-test the type of pro forma that the hon. Gentleman

commitment to disclosure—yet it can be brought in under codes
and secondary legislation. Why is that? Perhaps the Minister can
intervene on me and tell me why that is. Disclosure is part and parcel
of many other areas of consumer protection in many other Bills. We are
not asking for the detail now; we are asking for the broad statement.
For industry that is keen to get on with this work and consumers who
want the benefits of it, such a statement would mean that they know
that the Minister, Parliament and this Committee intend people to be
up-front and honest about who they are and who they are representing
when they conduct the phase 1 assessment—the broad terms of
treatment—and phase 2, in which they say, “Here are our
products and services.” Why is that a
problem?<a class="bkMark" name="11060942000085">&#160;</a>

with the hon. Lady’s comments. Amendment 105, which I have

about the unknown overall cost of the green deal package, due to the
uncertainty over interest rates in particular. Over a 20-year loan,
even

			Column number: 108<a class="bkMark" name="Column108">&#160;</a>
                  </div>relatively small differences on those interest rates
could make a significant difference to the overall cost of a green deal
package. My amendment, therefore, seeks to clarify that the golden rule
is calculated on the basis not only of the up-front cost of measures,
as paid for over time, but in comparison with the bill savings that the
measures will deliver. If the amendment is agreed to, it will be clear
that any energy efficiency measure installed under the green deal,
including the entire cost of the financial package, must not exceed the
expected resultant savings on the customer’s energy bills over
the period of a
loan.<a class="bkMark" name="11060942000102">&#160;</a>

the year before the assessment of where the golden rule should be

cost undertaken in the house and advice on how equipment and energy
could be used in the house to reduce bills. Alternatively, the
householder might simply be on the wrong tariff; had they been put on a
different tariff, their energy bills could have been considerably
lower.<a class="bkMark" name="11060942000114">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">All
that information is important in determining how the golden rule will
apply, because the decision where the golden rule cuts off can make a
considerable difference to how much assistance can be supplied within
the terms of a cheaper energy bill in future. That can make a great
difference between whether there is a small amount of passive
insulation or a lot more work. That cut-off point is therefore
important.<a class="bkMark" name="11060942000115">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The question
then arises as to who ensures that all the information is there to
allow the golden rule decision to be made. Is it, as we have said this
morning, the MOT-style assessor? Is it the green deal provider, who
must put the measures in place and relate them to the golden rule? They
must decide how the offer works competitively in terms of the maximum
amount of work that can be done, given the money available. Does
someone else give the advice? The quality of the amendments lies in the
fact that they would fix the idea that somebody must give that advice
at some point and make sure that the decision takes everything into
account.<a class="bkMark" name="11060942000116">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">If we do not,
one way or another, have an assurance that the information will be
there, there remains a substantial possibility that such considerations
will simply fall between the cracks. The Minister gave assurances that
the golden rule would be applied conservatively, but the subsidiary
danger is that unless the information is clearly there and is gathered
before the decision is made, we may, in a reflection of the possibility
that life is not as it looked when the golden rule decision was made,
end up applying a series of golden rule decisions that gravely
underestimate what could be done in a household. As a result, the
programme that is undertaken could be much more conservative”
than would be the case if we had got things right in the run-up to the
golden rule decision being applied.<a class="bkMark" name="11060942000117">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
amendments go to the heart of getting these things right so that we can
have a guarantee at the point of decision that everything has been
taken into account and properly applied for. We could therefore get the
maximum steam out of the machine in terms of future energy efficiency
improvements.<a class="bkMark" name="11060942000118">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Wells and
the hon. Member for Brighton, Pavilion for tabling the amendments,
which have allowed us to have a useful discussion. They address the
important issue of ensuring that the calculation of the golden rule
includes all the costs of taking out a green deal.<a class="bkMark" name="11060942000119">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As set out in
clause 4, we propose to use the framework regulations to specify how we
will apply the golden rule—the principle that the charge
attached to the energy bill should not exceed the expected savings at
the time of the assessment. We envisage the golden rule taking account
of the total cost of the green deal package, including the expected
cost of finance and labour, as well as the interventions and
products.<a class="bkMark" name="11060942000120">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">An amendment
is not needed to achieve those aims. Indeed, the point raised by the
hon. Member for Southampton, Test is an argument for specifying these
things in the much more detailed way that secondary legislation would
allow and allow to be subsequently amended. Once the green deal is
under way, the market develops and there are new
technologies—there may be an advance in the way these
energy savings are calculated—we may have reasons to revisit the
regulations. That will be much easier to achieve, and it will be much
more effective, if things are dealt with in secondary legislation
rather than in primary legislation, which would have to go through
Parliament.<a class="bkMark" name="11060942000121">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">That
flexibility to come back, tighten up and improve the regulations is
important. We are clear about what we want to achieve, and
there is unanimity across the Committee on that. None of us can have
absolute 20:20 vision on how these things will be
implemented at scale, until the market is up and running. I am sure
that there will be, perhaps not immediately but in years or Parliaments
to come, opportunities to improve the framework even further. That
said, we should remember, as we have said previously, that the Consumer
Credit Act 1974 applies to domestic green deal plans in full, bar a few
essential amendments that we have made to clauses 25 to 28 of the Bill,
to allow the green deal to operate smoothly. That provides a high
starting point for consumer protection, particularly in respect of the
information that must be given to consumers about the total
cost of finance. To the extent that specific additional provision is
needed for the green deal, clause 5 will enable the Secretary of State
to put additional protections into the regime via the terms of the
plan.<a class="bkMark" name="11060942000122">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In
conclusion, my hon. Friend the Member for Wells and the hon. Member for
Brighton, Pavilion are absolutely right to have drawn the issue to the
Committee’s attention, but it is not necessary to include the
provision in the Bill and I hope that my hon. Friend will be content to
withdraw the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11060942000123">&#160;</a>

               <p>Those

and consumers, and a clear distinction needs to be made between energy
plans and green deal

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
amendment hits at the heart of what the Secretary of State has said
about the green
deal:<a class="bkMark" name="11060942000131">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“A

               </p>
               <p>The
Minister earlier compared the green deal assessment to an MOT, but it
is likely that it will be much rarer. Legally, an MOT has to be
completed every 12 months on cars that are more than three years old,
but green deal assessments will not have that legal push behind them.
The same is true of an energy performance certificate, an assessment
for which has to be conducted on a property every 10 years. A green
deal assessment is voluntary and is therefore less frequent, so it is
vital that as many measures as possible are identified during the
assessment of the property, regardless of whether they would be part of
a green deal plan or an energy
plan.<a class="bkMark" name="11060942000132">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
amendment seeks to ensure that every single assessment identifies
improvements that would meet or exceed golden rule repayment standards,
so that consumers have access to information about all energy-saving
improvements suitable for their homes. The amendment would also ensure
that assessments were standardised for all assessors, particularly for
evaluations of measures outside of the green
deal.<a class="bkMark" name="11060942000133">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
basis for the amendment is that if the Energy Bill aims to promote
energy-saving measures and reduce the UK’s carbon footprint, it
is vital that home assessments for energy-saving measures are as
comprehensive as possible, and provide consumers with information about
all the ways in which they could reduce energy consumption within their
homes. A comprehensive assessment would thus need to include measures
that will meet golden rule standards and—I reiterate
this—measures that would not qualify under the green
deal.<a class="bkMark" name="11060942000134">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Back
in March, at DECC Question Time, my hon. Friend the Member for Bolton
West (Julie Hilling) asked the Minister what steps he was taking to
ensure that consumers received advice on energy-saving measures. He
answered:<a class="bkMark" name="11060942000135">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“Reliable
advice will form an important part of the new green deal framework to
be introduced in 2012. Having a comprehensive assessment setting out
energy efficiency measures that are likely to be suitable for each
individual property along with the potential opportunities for
microgeneration and renewable heat will be a crucial step in every
green deal journey.”—[<em>Official Report</em>,

               </p>
               <p>The
purpose of the amendment is to ensure that the Minister’s
statement works in
practice.<a class="bkMark" name="11060942000136">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It
is necessary for absolutely all feasible energy-efficiency measures
that can be implemented to be included in all assessments, because even
devices as simple as a thermostat can greatly affect our energy
consumption. We did not explore thermostats on Tuesday. Information
provided by the Association of Controls Manufacturers reveals that
around 8 million UK homes do not have a simple room thermostat and that
70% of existing homes have fewer controls than specified in building
regulations. The absence of such controls means that comfortable
conditions cannot be maintained, so the expected savings from other
energy-saving measures, such as insulation, will be lower than
estimated. Many energy-saving improvements may not qualify under a
green deal plan, but would none the less substantially benefit
consumers. The recent DECC paper, “What measures does the Green
Deal cover?”,
states:<a class="bkMark" name="11060942000137">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“Whilst
Green Deal finance supports measures that pay for themselves through
savings, if we are to make significant in-roads in cutting overall
household emissions we must look beyond these measures to the next most
cost-effective
measures.”<a class="bkMark" name="11060942000168">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>Again,
our amendment seeks to ensure that when an assessor comes to
someone’s home, they provide all the options
available.<a class="bkMark" name="11060942000138">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I know that
there is a challenge with relatively small supply chains making
energy-saving measures too expensive to qualify under the green deal.
We will discuss and explore solid-wall insulation and microgeneration
in later clauses on energy company obligations. Measures such as those
should still be identified to consumers if they are suitable for a
property, not only because of their energy-saving benefits, but because
the more they are identified, the more they could be taken up. Demand
would increase and prices would fall, leading to more measures being
available and included in a future green deal
package.<a class="bkMark" name="11060942000139">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">While
other provisions aim to ensure that green deal assessors work
independently and provide unbiased assessment, the Builders Merchants
Federation suspects that there will be assessors who, for whatever
reason, will give biased or incomplete advice to favour a particular
business or solution. The amendment seeks to ensure that all
assessments are standardised to include all feasible energy-saving
measures, not just those under the green deal or those provided by a
particular installer or company. That goes back to some of the
discussions that we had on earlier amendments. That would mean that
even for measures that are not green deal compatible, consumers are
receiving the same recommendations and fully comprehensive evaluations
for the optimal energy efficiency improvements to their
property.<a class="bkMark" name="11060942000140">&#160;</a>

the Government insist many times that they will be the greenest

that all energy-saving measures are identified by assessors, not just
those that qualify under the green deal’s golden rule or those

that only include green-deal qualifiable measures may be green, only
comprehensive assessments that identify all possible energy saving

assure her that we support the principle that the assessment must be of
a robust and high quality and be able to deliver a reliable indication
of suitable measures, including those likely to be eligible for green
deal finance, to help householders and businesses make informed
decisions. That has always been at the heart of the measures that we
introduced.<a class="bkMark" name="11060942000142">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It
is also essential to deliver estimated savings that can be used by the
green dealprovider to provide their quotes and the final green deal
plan. The distinction between energy plans and green deal plans results
from legal drafting and not policy. A green deal plan must meet all the
conditions set out in this Bill and must be paid for via energy bills.
An energy plan is simply an arrangement to install improvements and can
be paid for in any way.<a class="bkMark" name="11060942000143">&#160;</a>

energy efficiency and how it can be improved. I have to say to the hon.
Lady that there is a degree of consumer protection, as we have ensured
that the green deal covers only those interventions and assessments
that are green deal approved. If we extended it to cover absolutely
everything, we might be in the reverse position whereby people start
trying to push outside the green deal—under the cover of green
deal protection—to use unproven quack technologies that do not
qualify for green deal status. Moreover, I do not know how we would

                  </strong> I thank my hon. Friend for that, but if the
suggestions are cost-effective they will, by their very nature, be
included in the green deal. The only reason for not including them in
the green deal is that they are not cost- effective. They have up to 20
years to pay for their cost under the green deal. Something that takes
more than 20 years to pay for itself is not, by definition,
cost-effective. I totally appreciate my hon. Friend’s point, but
the water-saving measures that she mentioned do not fall into that
remit. However, I am cautious about extending the remit on
energy-saving
measures.<a class="bkMark" name="11060942000149">&#160;</a>

                  </span> Although I understand
the sentiments expressed by the hon. Member for Liverpool, Wavertree
and by my hon. Friend the Member for Devizes, it is a very dangerous
path for us to go down. If we go back to delivery of the green deal and
the effectiveness of this piece of legislation, the danger is that we
lose people’s trust. They will be offered all sorts of things
outside the green deal, some of which will be proven to be false or
misleading, which could lead them to say, “I don’t want
to do this because this thing is far too
complicated.”<a class="bkMark" name="11060942000150">&#160;</a>
