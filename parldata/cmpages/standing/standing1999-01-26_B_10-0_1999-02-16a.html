<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Good morning. Hon. Members may 
remove their jackets for their greater comfort if they wish.
<P>
We now move to clause 15, and I note from the earlier 
debates that many of the matters covered in clause 15 are 
also covered in clause 14 and have already been debated. 
I am sure that hon. Members on both sides of the 
Committee will take that into account when debating the 
amendments.
<H4><center>Clause 15</center></H4>
<H4><center>Orders under section 14: procedure</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Bernard Jenkin (North Essex):</B> I beg to move 
amendment No. 211, in page 11, line 14, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(1A) Before the Secretary of State makes an order under section 
14 he shall obtain an assessment from the Audit Commission of the 
impact on any business of the order he proposes to make, 
including 
<P>
(a) any trading advantage that may be obtained by a best value 
authority or any trading entity with which it may be 
associated; and
<P>
(b) the benefits of such a proposal in accordance with section 
3(1).'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take 
the following amendments: No. 212, in page 11, line 18, 
leave out `and'.
<P>
No. 213, in page 11, line 19, at end insert `; and
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(c) including a copy of the application received by him under 
subsection (00) above, and
<P>
(d) including a copy of the assessment provided by the Audit 
Commission under subsection (1A) above.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 214, in page 11, line 24, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(3A) Where an order under section 14 makes different provision 
for different cases, the period of sixty days under subsection (3) 
above shall commence only after it has been the subject of a hearing 
of a committee of both Houses of Parliament.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The purpose of clause 15 is to apply some 
procedure to the orders in clause 14. The purpose of the 
amendments is to circumscribe those procedures to 
provide some control over the way in which the Secretary 
of State may exercise the orders under clause 14. The 
Secretary of State is required to consult under clause 
15(1), but we propose to add a new subsection which is 
set out in amendment No. 211.
<P>
I fully anticipate that the Government will suggest that 
the requirement to assess any trading advantage is beyond 
the remit of the Audit Commission as is the requirement 
to assess the benefits of such a proposal in accordance 
with clause 3(1). Clause 3(1) deals with the fundamental 
tenets of best value: efficiency, effectiveness and I have 
said them so often that I have forgotten what they are. 
[Hon. Members: "Economy."	]
<P>
The purpose of adding the amendment is to avoid the 
situation where a local authority is given additional power 
to enter into a trading arrangement with another company 
and a cosy, anti-competitive relationship between them 
is created. The original purpose of open and competitive 
tendering was precisely to prevent those unaccountable 
relationships from forming.
<P>
If there is to be a power in the Bill to allow the 
Secretary of State to allow new kinds of relationships and 
partnerships to develop, they must not confer an 
advantage on one contractor over another, permanently or 
temporarily. Otherwise we are opening the door to all 
kinds of improper relationships between a public authority 
and the private sector. Secondly, and this seems a simple 
and honest requirement, they should be for the purpose of 
achieving the objectives of best value.
<P>
The onus must be on the proposers of any new power 
under clause 14 to demonstrate that it will achieve greater 
economy, efficiency and effectiveness, and is not just for 
the convenience of the council in question. The 
amendment would require the Audit Commission to 
produce a view on the matter.
<P>
After consultation under clause 15, the Secretary of 
State lays an order and is required under subsection (2) to 
set out his proposals as a draft order and to provide details 
of the consultation. We propose in addition that the 
Secretary of State should include a copy of the application 
received under a proposed new clause. My drafting may 
be deficient but the power under clause 14 will not be 
exercised unless a local authority makes proposals and 
applies to do something that it would otherwise not be 
able to do.
<P>
My proposed subsection 3(A) in amendment No. 214 
does not refer to such an application, but where a change 
in the law is sought by a local authority, the draft order 
and consultation on it should include a copy of that local 
authority's application. As consultation is being made, it 
would then be possible to view the germ of the idea from 
first principles and understand the motive behind it.
<P>
In amendment No. 213, we propose that the 
consultation should include a copy of assessment by the 
Audit Commission as specified in amendment No. 211. 
Thus consultees could see for themselves the basis on 
which the commission had decided that the local 
government function met the criteria of economy, 
efficiency and effectiveness.
<P>
The concern must be that, because the arrangements 
under clause 14 are not just for implementation but are a 
permanent feature of best value and because the primary 
legislation might be amendable at any time for an 
indefinite period, proper processes are in place to ensure 
that the power is used only for the purposes intended by 
the Bill.
<P>
In our unwritten constitution, power is a fluid 
commodity. Sometimes powers not used for a long time 
become altogether unusable; but it is not unknown for 
powers brought into existence under one form of 
legislation to be used for completely different and 
unconnected purposes. It cannot be the Government's 
purpose to create powers so wide that they could be used 
for purposes other than best value.
<P>
The amendments would ensure that the procedures 
governing orders under clause 14 were bound tightly to 
the original purposes of the Bill and would prevent 
businesses from pressing local authorities for a change in 
the law that would work to their own advantage and to 
the detriment of their competitors, the efficiency of the 
local authority function and best value itself. The onus 
would be on the Secretary of State to be convinced that 
best value was the prime and only purpose of a change in 
the law before it could be made.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford </B>(Mole Valley): Being much older 
and greyer than my hon. Friend the Member for North 
Essex (Mr. Jenkin), I should like to thank him. 
I remember that when I was in London in the late 1970s, 
the private sector particularly contractors for housing 
repairs and maintenance had a hard time because of the 
virtual monopolisation by direct labour organisations in 
many inner London areas. Like my hon. Friends, I am 
concerned that this could lead to municipal trading a 
point that I have raised several times but on which I have 
failed to get reassurance or to a form of municipal 
trading, with preferential backing being given to a firm as 
a partner and backed by public sector money, to the 
detriment of other firms such as housing repair 
contractors. I fear that we could gradually slide back to 
a position of there being no contractors, as happened in 
Wandsworth, Lambeth and other areas in the later 1970s. 
I want the Minister's assurance that that will not happen. 
Purely and simply, will the Government act to prevent 
municipal trading, which effectively allows firms to be in 
partnership with the direct labour force?
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Mr. Alan Meale):</B> The Government understand the concerns there 
may be about this group of amendments. The powers in 
clause 14 are, as the hon. Member for North Essex said, 
tightly focused on achieving best value. We concede that 
they are also far reaching and that they require a careful 
process of consultation and value. Clause 15 provides for 
this process of consultation, scrutiny and positive 
affirmation in Parliament. However, there is room for 
reflection, which is why we agreed at our previous sitting 
to consider whether there might be a role for scrutiny by 
a Committee. It may also be desirable to establish a 
non-parliamentary group to ensure complementary 
consultation requirements and scrutiny under the clause. 
Unfortunately, as the hon. Gentleman accepted, the 
Opposition's amendments do not meet that aim.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> I recognise and am pleased by 
the Under-Secretary's concern. However, there are a few 
borders that he could draw at this stage: extreme among 
them is municipal trading. Surely he could make it clear 
now that municipal trading will not be tolerated.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meale:</B> Let me get past the introductory remarks 
before answering the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
Amendment No. 211 surprises me because the 
conditions that it lays down could not be achieved without 
an immense increase in bureaucracy. The Secretary of 
State would be required to obtain an assessment from the 
Audit Commission before exercising powers to make an 
order conferring new powers on best value authorities or 
amending or excluding the application of certain 
provisions in primary legislation, particularly to facilitate 
best value achievement.
<P>
We do not envisage applications for individual 
authorities being the only route or even the most likely 
one for the use of clause 14 provisions. Possibilities were 
being identified in the paper prepared for the Committee 
of which I spoke, and ideas from the private or voluntary 
sectors might, of course, be submitted to the Secretary 
of State.
<P>
Hon. Members are perhaps concerned about the way 
that orders made under the clause might affect private 
businesses. I can reassure them. Clause 15 provides for 
all interested parties to express their views during draft 
consultation: those representations will be considered by 
the Secretary of State before he make an order.
<P>
Amendment No. 214 fails to convince in its attempt to 
ensure proper scrutiny of clause 14 orders. It is difficult 
to understand why the provisions of clause 14(3)(d) 
should be singled out for extra scrutiny in this way. 
I made it clear in previous debates that it would not be 
used to allow for specific provisions for individual 
authorities. It allows for features of different types of 
authority to be taken into account in an order under the 
clause. The scrutiny procedure outlined in clause 15 
provides for full account to be taken of local 
representations, which may inform how such differences 
should be reflected. It also provides for a thorough 
examination of any proposals in Parliament. I therefore 
hope that Opposition Members will withdraw the 
amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> That was quick. The Under-Secretary did 
not satisfy me on the key question of the impact of changing 
primary legislation. He said that amendment No. 211 is too 
bureaucratic. However, the alternative is that the Secretary 
of State will take action under clause 14, regardless of the 
consequences for particular businesses. The Minister for 
Local Government and Housing, the hon. Member for 
North-West Durham (Ms Armstrong) is shaking her head. 
I welcome that gesture: the Secretary of State will not act 
regardless of the consequences.
<P>
The Secretary of State will make a judgement, but we 
do not know how. We do not know on what information 
he will base that judgment: we suspect that it will be on 
the basis of how he is influenced. In that case, the 
consultation will have a purpose.
<P>
The consultation, however, is not a neutral process. No 
one in the Government pays a blind bit of notice to the 
guidance issued by the Cabinet Office on how 
consultations should be conducted and reported. How 
often has a consultation been presented to the House 
which shows how many respondents said yes and how 
many said no, and also indicates the size and nature of 
each response? Such a consultation would attach 
weightings to, for example, representations made by 
voluntary organisations, based on their membership 
Currently, a two-man-and-a-dog operation that sends a 
response is counted as one representation, as is a trade 
union with millions of members.
<P>
Consultations are therefore not necessarily scientific 
processes. However, the Minister says that that is the basis 
on which the Government will judge whether the matter 
is fair on the private sector, and whether it will create a 
level playing field for companies wishing to make 
provisions for local authorities.
<P>
<B>Mr David Curry </B>(Skipton and Ripon): I hope that my 
hon. Friend will not denigrate consultations too much, 
because we will shortly debate a part of the Bill dealing 
with council tax benefit. Every single respondent to a 
consultation on that matter was hostile to the 
Government's proposals. We would like the Government 
to take note of that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Of course, consultations have a role. 
However, changing the law will have an effect on the 
nature of operations and the relationship between 
businesses and local authorities. Such matters cannot 
easily be turned into an opinion poll and require 
professional assessment. I was disappointed by the 
Minister's response to amendment No. 211.
<P>
I will explain to the Under-Secretary why we single 
out clause 14(3) (d) as requiring especially careful 
consideration. The Bill is reasonably comprehensible 
when it treats all local authorities the same. However if 
my understanding is correct in some parts it treats 
different authorities differently, and orders will be made 
specific to particular authorities. Authorities will therefore 
become hybrid cases. The Minister is beginning to 
swoon with 
<P>
<B>Mr. Graham Allen </B>(Nottingham, North): Boredom.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Yes, that is probably right.
<P>
An explanation is required. When we discussed 
amendment No. 156, we did not receive a satisfactory 
explanation of the need for different provisions in 
different cases. All we are saying is that some scrutiny 
procedure should be available in Parliament to justify 
doing so.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> While the Under-Secretary was 
reading out his remarks I intervened to press my point 
about municipal trading. I sound as if I am harping on it, 
but I am doing so for a good reason. I am interested in 
the point at which a preventive limit should be set. The 
Minister paused from his reading and said that he would 
continue and that an explanation would follow. It did not. 
He finished reading and sat down. If I might interrupt 
further reading that is going on now so that he can hear 
the question, perhaps he could use this opportunity 
<P>
<B>The Minister for Local Government and Housing (Ms Hilary Armstrong):</b> Jealousy.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> No, I can read from my notes, but 
I do not think I need to.
<P>
What is the Minister's definition of municipal trading? 
Does he understand that a partnership between the private 
sector and local authorities could effectively amount to a 
form of municipal trading? Why can he not draw a line 
now? He needs only to say that he has drawn such a line, 
to forbid the practice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meale:</B> I remind the hon. Member for Mole Valley 
that local authorities already have the power to trade with 
the private sector, particularly with respect to public 
duties. There have been several examples of that, some 
involving private sector firms that have been deeply 
involved in providing services locally.
<P>
We believe that the extension of trading powers beyond 
that would require careful justification. We will not rule 
it out entirely. That is as far as I can go in drawing a line.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> Is the Under-Secretary saying that 
he would bring about changes to the Local Authorities 
(Goods and Services) Act 1970?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meale:</B> I am saying that I do not rule out the 
relevant matter at this stage.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the 
amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 15 ordered to stand apart of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 16</center></H4>
<H4><center>Contracting out</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 215, in 
page 12, line 6, at end add 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(3) No order of the kind mentioned in subsection (2) above shall 
be made unless a draft has been laid before, and approved by 
resolution of, each House of Parliament.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Clause 16(1) provides for another order making power, 
under section 70 of the Deregulation and Contracting Out 
Act 1994. I can do no better than to outline the concern 
raised by the Local Government Association, which 
states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Clause 16 allows for Best Value authorities to contract out 
certain functions."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is encouraging. It continues.
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"It is unclear whether this will be used at an authority's request 
or in consultation with authorities. Clarification is being sought on 
this issue."	<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Can the Minister clarify it?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meale:</B> I hope that the amendment is based on a 
misunderstanding of the aim of the clause. Clause 16 
extends the application of section 70 of the Deregulation 
and Contracting Out Act 1994 to cover all best value 
authorities. At the moment, it applies to only some of 
them. Police and fire authorities and the Greater London 
authority and its functional bodies will not be captured by 
it. Section 70 powers in the 1994 Act are already subject 
to affirmative resolution procedures as set out at section 
77(2). The amendment would therefore have no effect on 
the way in which clause 16 powers would be used and 
scrutinised.
<P>
The order to transfer the powers of the Secretary of 
State to the Welsh Assembly is being laid before 
Parliament today, but consideration is still being given to 
whether the powers in section 70 should be transferred to 
it. The final version of the Bill will need to be consistent 
with the outcome of those deliberations. Subject to that 
consideration, the amendment would simply establish the 
scrutiny procedures that already exist to govern the use of 
clause 16. In the light of that information, I hope that the 
hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for 
that clarification. However, he did not clarify whether the 
powers will be exercised at the request of an authority, or 
in consultation with an authority. Can the Under-Secretary 
now answer that question, which the Local Government 
Association raised?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meale:</B> I repeat a point that was made earlier. 
When it seems right for best value authorities to contract 
out specific functions, other safeguards in the 1994 Act, 
such as consultation procedures, will apply. The orders 
will have to be approved by affirmative resolution of both 
Houses of Parliament.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Will orders be made after consultation 
with local authorities or at the request of local authorities?
<P>
<B>The Minister for Local Government and Housing (Ms Hilary Armstrong):</B> Both.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meale:</B> As my hon. Friend says, the answer is that 
orders will be made both after consultation with local 
authorities, and at their request.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am grateful for that clarification on the 
exercise of the power. It is understandable that the LGA 
was unclear. The circumstances under which the powers 
will be exercised remain unclear; we shall have to leave 
it at that.

I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Sanders:</B> Happy Chinese new year to the 
Committee! It is the year of the rabbit.
<P>
I hope that the amendments will lead to a general 
debate on clause 17. Amendment No. 226 would 
empower local authorities and broaden the process that 
the clause outlines. I hope that its drafting would enable 
broad national specifications and allow authorities to 
trigger the process. However, the other amendments in the 
group would narrow the clause. Clause 17 gives rise to an 
example of the Jekyll and Hyde attitude of the official 
Opposition to aspects of the Bill.
<P>
Amendment No. 226 is little more than a probing 
amendment. Our substantial proposals are in the second 
group of amendments to the clause. Amendment No. 226 
would provide protection from malign Secretaries of 
State. The current wording of the clause would not curb 
the possibility of a Secretary of State reverting to CCT. 
Yet the official Opposition's amendments would limit the 
provision's scope.



<P>
I hope that the debate will draw out the precise 
intentions of the Government and the official Opposition. 
In view of Conservative amendments' references to clause 
3(1), and the definition of best value, do the Opposition 
accept that CCT was discriminatory and wrong?
<P>
If amendment No. 226 was accepted, the Bill would 
empower local authorities. Throughout our proceedings, 
Liberal Democrats have supported giving local authorities 
power, and not leaving everything to Secretaries of State.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The clause is one of the most significant 
in the Bill, because the purpose of competitive tendering 
was to ensure that all contractors were treated equally and 
that any internal organisation a direct service 
organisation or a direct labour organisation competing 
with contractors was treated on the same basis. The clause 
refers to section 17 of the Local Government Act 1988, 
which explains a specified matter. Section 17(1) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"It is the duty of every public authority to which this section 
applies, in exercising, in relation to its public supply or works 
contracts, any proposed or any subsisting such contract, as the case 
may be, any function regulated by this section to exercise that 
function"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
this is the key point 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"without reference to matters which are non-commercial matters for 
the purpose of this section."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It was the habit of many local authorities going through 
the competitive tendering process to arrange for their 
contracts to contain extraneous and irrelevant conditions. 
That would ensure that their own work force obtained the 
contract and that no private sector contractor would be 
bothered to apply. For example, if the company had any 
trading links with South Africa, that disqualified it from 
taking part 
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Ms Sally Keeble </B>(Northampton, North): Local 
authorities did not do that. It was well known that such 
action was outside the law and most borough solicitors 
would advise members of local authorities that they could 
not take such matters into consideration. The hon. 
Gentleman must produce examples, because what he 
claims is absolutely not true.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I was giving an example, but as the hon. 
Lady says that such things never happened, out of 
courtesy to her I will check my facts. The fact that she 
was so ready to jump to her feet suggests that she was 
ready to fall into a trap; she well knows that there are all 
kinds of examples. If she really wants me to look them 
up in the Library and recite them to the Committee, I shall 
do so, but I did not think that would be necessary.
<P>
If, as the hon. Lady claims, such things do not happen, 
the restrictions are perfectly justified, and they should 
stay. Section 17(5) of the 1988 Act states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The following matters are non-commercial matters as regards 
the public supply or works contracts of a public authority, any 
proposed or any subsisting such contract, as the case may be, that 
is to say <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) terms and conditions of employment by contractors"	.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Under clause 17 it will be possible for the Secretary of 
State to make an order that the local authority shall be 
able to decide what the subcontractor's union 
representation should be. That might become a relevant 
factor, so that local authorities that choose not to have 
subcontractors that do not recognise trade unions to 
negotiate on behalf 
<P>
<B>Ms Keeble:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman please go through 
his points clearly? Talking about union representation is 
rather fatuous given that the fairness at work proposals 
clearly set out the union representation procedures and then leave matters to the work force. Will the hon. Gentleman try again to find an example of abuses that 
might actually apply?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I can think of plenty of examples in which 
a local authority would be required to tender for a 
particular function. The members might decide that 
certain contractors were not their sort of people and that 
they did not want them to 
<P>
<B>Ms Keeble:</B> Can the hon. Gentleman give an example?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I think that I am best just going through 
the Act because the onus is on the hon. Lady to justify 
<P>
<B>Ms Keeble rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. the hon. Gentleman is not 
giving way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The onus is on the hon. Lady to justify 
why these specified matters are relevant to local 
authorities, because it is the Government who want to 
change the law. They want to relax the restriction.
<P>
<B>Ms Oona King </B>(Bethnal Green and Bow): Will the 
hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I shall give way to the hon. Lady in a 
moment.
<P>
Why are the terms and conditions and conditions of 
employment by contractors relevant to the selection of a 
contractor, provided that the contractor complies with the 
law? The hon. Member for Northampton, North said that 
the Government were changing the law on union 
recognition; she called it fairness at work. I remember 
when trade unions made things pretty unfair at work. 
What is the justification for relaxing the restriction? Let 
us suppose that there were trade union activists which a 
Conservative local authority did not like or want in its 
work force. That might create circumstances in which a 
local authority could have a blacklist of subcontractors 
who employed those trade union activists.
<P>
<B>Ms Keeble:</B> It is illegal.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The hon. Lady says that it is illegal, so 
what is the purpose of changing the law?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. All members of the Committee 
have been in the House long enough to know that they 
should not intervene from a sedentary position. If they 
wish to do so it is for the Member who is on his or her 
feet to give way, and unless that Member is called by the 
Chair he cannot intervene. Members must wait their turn, 
catch the Chairman's eye and make a speech.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am interested in the reaction that is being 
provoked as it means that there is red meat in the proposal 
which at last some Labour Members welcome. They 
might actually want this part of the Bill, as opposed to the 
rest of it, during discussion of which they have sat rather 
quietly, perhaps resenting what their Government are 
doing.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> I can give my hon. Friend one 
small example from a local authority. Prior to the changes 
that ensured that non-commercial functions were not to be 
taken into account, when the street sweeping and dustbin 
service was put out to tender, the trade union side of the 
direct labour force did its level best to ensure that the 
conditions under which its members worked continued. 
Those conditions were lax, to put it mildly. Everyone had 
a second job, most people clocked on and went home; the 
force actually working was half what it should have been. 
Someone who was not known to the family, who did not 
have the right name and who was not white and male did 
not stand a chance of being taken on "the dust"	, as it 
was called. People had to be on the list, which was a 
dead-man's-shoes arrangement. That is the sort of thing 
that causes many of us deep concern because we have 
lived through it. We do not wish it to continue, or to 
return.
<P>
<B>Ms Oona King rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I give way to the hon. Lady.
<P>
<B>Ms King:</B> I agree with some of the remarks made by the 
hon. Member for Mole Valley. Is he perhaps also thinking 
of the expense in his own borough of Wandsworth where a 
refuse collection was put out to tender and in about two 
years it went from a public monopoly to a private 
monopoly, because no other bid was made? The estimated 
cost to the taxpayer was £2 million, which suggests that we 
need to find a middle ground between the two ideological 
dogmas that previously held sway.
<P>
The hon. Member for North Essex asked whether 
compulsory competitive tendering was fair to one or the 
other. There is an example of CCT favouring the private 
sector, where the set level of profit on CCT contracts 
applies to the private sector but not to the public sector. 
The Government want those anomalies to be removed.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Member for Mole 
Valley made a lengthy intervention and the hon. Member 
for Bethnal Green and Bow (Ms King) responded in kind. 
Interventions are not speeches.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> At last someone is making a case for a 
change in the law, instead of trying to pretend that 
everything in local government was marvellous until the 
Conservatives won the 1979 election.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> This is just a short intervention. It 
is a shame that the comment by the hon. Member for 
Bethnal Green and Bow was inaccurate. She failed to 
understand that there was always a DLO price put up. 
That ensured that there was no cartel. If the hon. Lady 
contrasts the savings in real terms on a like-for-like basis, 
she will find that it was something like 45 per cent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> To continue with the list, section 17(5)(c) 
of the 1988 Act refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"any involvement of the business with irrelevant fields of 
Government policy."	<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Paragraph (d) refers to "workers in industrial disputes"	. 
Subsection (5)(e) reads:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the country or territory of origin of supplies to, or the location 
in any country or territory of the business activities or interests of, 
contractors"	<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Subsection (5) (f) refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"political, industrial or sectarian affiliations"	.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Goodness me. It would be dreadful to go back to a 
situation where the only companies that contracted with 
individual local authorities reflected the party affiliation 
of the majority group on that authority.
<P>
Paragraph (g) refers to support by contractors for any 
particular institution and (h) refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the use or non-use by contractors of technical or professional 
services"	.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
What is the justification for diluting any of those 
restrictions? When I suggested that they want to dilute 
these restrictions, Labour Members were ready to jump 
up to say that it would be illegal anyway. Why on earth 
should any of those restrictions be diluted?
<P>
Amendments Nos. 216 to 218 aim to ensure that any 
order under the clause is objectively justifiable in 
accordance with the fundamental duties. For example, a 
local authority may want to provide a service in order to 
employ more women. That might be a laudable aim but 
it raises a big question about the local authority's role. Is 
it a social employer or a provider of services? We would 
want to ensure that the provision of social employment is 
in a separate bracket from the provision of services. 
Problems arise the minute the two start to overlap. When 
local authorities were run as sources of social employment 
we got into problems of poor efficiency and delivery, high 
expense and bad value for the council tax payer.

<P>

<B>Ms Keeble:</B> I accept some of the points about the local 
authority's role being that of service provider. However, 
would the hon. Gentleman not accept that a large 
commercial organisation, such as the local Asda in Surrey 
Quays, makes a big point of the fact that a certain 
percentage of its work force is recruited locally? It would 
be completely appropriate in such an area for the local 
authority to apply similar standards to its own contractors 
and such issues might be extremely pertinent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I would accept that, but with the proviso 
that it is compatible with the objectives of best value. 
What has tended to happen it is not worth the hon. Lady 
giving me a whole load of examples as everyone knows 
what we are talking about is that local authorities have 
made decisions about the nature or make up of their 
labour force regardless of efficiency. Indeed, they almost 
prided themselves on their beneficence as an employer, 
regardless of the provision of the service. That is not what 
Asda is doing. Its prime objective is to serve its 
customers. If, as a secondary issue, it can employ local 
people it is right that it should try to do so, as it would be 
for a local authority.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> The suggestion made by the hon. 
member for Northampton, North (Ms Keeble) is fine as 
far as it goes but when one reaches a certain level it could 
go against the best value authority, particularly if one is 
looking for an expertise that may not be competitively 
available within the locality. A broad sweeping suggestion 
such as she has just put forward could be detrimental.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend: that is 
exactly the point of the amendment. We are not just 
rampaging against the clause, but wish to ensure that 
orders pay heed to the duties set out in clause 3(1). I use 
the words "objectively justified"	 advisedly they are used 
by the European Court of Justice in dealing with sexual 
discrimination, for example. Treating part-time workers, 
in another example, differently from full-time workers can 
be justified provided that it is "objectively justified"	. Here 
I am saying that any discriminatory employment 
provisions must be objectively justified in accordance 
with the specified duties.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
Amendment No. 217 proposes a new subsection (1A) 
and states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Secretary of State shall only make any order under this 
section upon an application from a best value authority containing 
a justification of the need for a new power, which shall have regard 
to the duties on a best value authority pursuant to section 3(1)"	 
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
a reasonable restriction on the clause. If the Secretary of 
State is going to relax the restrictions in the Local 
Government Act 1988, a proper case should be made 
as, for example, when a local authority makes an 
application. It should not emanate from some vague 
consultation, which might not suit anyone's purpose 
except that of the local authority.
<P>
Amendment No. 218 proposes another new subsection 
(1B) and states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Before the Secretary of State makes an order under this section 
he shall obtain an assessment from the Audit Commission of the 
impact on any business of the order he proposes ... including ... 
any trading advantage that may be obtained"	.
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is an effort to maintain a level playing field for 
different contractors in different local authorities. The 
benefits would be assessed by the Audit Commission in 
relation to the Bill's objectives.
<P>
I honestly do not think that the amendments are at all 
unreasonable. The provisions are about re-empowering 
local authorities, not taking power away from the 
Secretary of State. More discretions are being given to 
local authorities to decide what distortions they want to 
the contracting process. However, that should relate to the 
objectives in the Bill, not favour certain private 
contractors over others, and should be as limited as 
possible. For all the hunger of Labour Members for 
tearing up the provisions of the Local Government Act 
1988, a proper case for relaxing any of its restrictions has 
yet to be made.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> This is an interesting clause and it was 
interesting to hear the amendments proposed by the two 
opposition parties.
<P>
The clause reflects the Bill introduced last year by my 
hon. Friend the Member for Bethnal Green and Bow, 
which had a smooth passage through this House until the 
final stage when it was blocked by an hon. Member who 
was not content to allow any private Member's Bill 
through. However, in Committee, Opposition Members 
agreed with my hon. Friend's points and the Government 
were also pleased to support the Bill. Following those 
discussions, we were confident about including such 
matters in the Bill.
<P>
The hon. Member for North Essex (Mr. Jenkin) said 
that that changes part II of the Local Government Act 
1988. Under that provision, local authorities have not 
been allowed to take into account certain so-called 
non-commercial matters in selecting tenderers and 
awarding contracts. That has advantages, as the hon. 
Gentleman says, as it prevents authorities from pursuing 
ideological idiosyncrasies at the expense of value for 
money. That is why we do not propose to repeal the 
measure.
<P>
However, part II of the Local Government Act 1988 
also has manifest disadvantages, because it prevents local 
authorities from making a thorough and reasonable 
assessment of the quality and capability of tenderers. 
Important considerations, such as a company's training 
policy, have been off-limits simply because of how 
non-commercial matters have been defined.
<P>
The fact is that good procurement practice has moved 
on in recent years, especially since the Local Government 
Bill 1988 was enacted. It is therefore high time that the 
legislative framework was amended to reflect that. That 
is not just the Government's view: it is shared by local 
authorities and the private sector. I have already 
mentioned the private Member's Bill promoted by my 
hon. Friend the Member for Bethnal Green and Bow; the 
Committee may remember the widespread support for 
that measure.



<P>
We must move away from the position in which 
short-term gain is more important than long-term 
capabilities. Authorities must have confidence in their 
private sector partners, and private companies must be 
able to demonstrate that they are well run organisations, 
capable of fulfilling contracts and annually improving the 
level of service in a way that delivers efficiencies. The 
provisions of the 1988 Act are an obstacle to that.
<P>
Clause 17 therefore gives the Secretary of State the 
power to remove categories of non-commercial matters so 
as to bring the framework into step with good 
procurement practice and with best value. Such power 
will balance the provision in the 1988 Act which allows 
for additional non-commercial matters to be specified.
<P>
The hon. Member for North Essex got into trouble with 
his examples. However, I will put my toe in the water and 
use the following example: work force matters have been 
specified as non-commercial under section 17(5) (a) of the 
1988 Act. Local authorities cannot make inquiries about a 
contractors's work force and management practices, even 
when such matters are relevant to the quality and value 
for money of a contract. That restriction does not apply 
to the rest of the public sector. As my hon. Friend the 
Member for Northampton, North made clear, the private 
sector does not impose such a restriction on itself when it 
develops independent activities.
<P>
One possibility is that we might consider using the new 
power to modify that restriction so that local authorities 
have proper regard to work force matters in cases in which 
there are relevant quality and value for money 
considerations. However, any changes would be in 
keeping with our obligations under the EC procurement 
rules mentioned by the hon. Member for North Essex, 
and with Government procurement policy, which requires 
value for money contracts.
<P>
The Committee will recognise that clause 17 must be 
used carefully and on the basis of broad consensus. That 
is why we welcome the helpful and constructive work 
done by the social partners, demonstrating that that 
consensus exists. I will circulate to Committee members 
the results of the social partners' recent deliberations and 
the agreements that they reached, especially on the 
clause's powers.



<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I have been reflecting on the Minister's 
comments about training, and confess to being mystified. 
I give as an example a local authority having a range of 
bidders for a particular function, and the skill of the work 
force being a significant factor in its efficient delivery. It 
might be obvious, or become so after investigation, that 
the cheapest bidder did not provide sufficient training to 
enable its work force to deliver the function well into the 
future. If a higher bid was ultimately accepted, there 
would be a referral to the Secretary of State to question 
why the lowest bid had not been accepted.
<P>
But is that not the fundamental understanding of 
competitive tendering? The lowest bid need not be 
accepted if there is a sensible reason for not doing so. If 
the Secretary of State agreed, he would be able to wave 
through the award of the contract without punishing the 
local authority for accepting a higher bid. Or have I 
misunderstood? Flexibility is already there, but the 
provision would open the way to the sort of 
discriminatory contracting that existed before competitive 
tendering was properly regulated.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right in saying 
that an authority does not automatically have to accept 
the lowest bidder. However, I suspect that evidence of an 
authority's dissatisfaction with training provision would 
be acceptable to the Secretary of State, and he would 
reject the bid. The issues are, how do we define 
commercial activities, and how can it be made clear that 
a defined area is relevant to an activity, even if in strict 
terms it may be defined as non-commercial? We seek a 
way forward. If the hon. Gentleman will be patient until 
I have done a little more, he will find that we are content 
to ensure that the power is used with caution.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Ms Keeble:</B> My hon. Friend gives a good example. One 
firm competed for a lot of grass cutting around south 
London, and usually tendered the lowest bid. Its contracts 
collapsed many times, and the only way people were able 
legally to detect and exclude them from the tendering 
process was by looking carefully at the number of staff 
that it employed and proving, after much careful effort, 
that that number of people could not cut that amount of 
grass. A much simpler and more honest approach that 
examined capability and training and so on would have 
saved local authorities millions of pounds and given a 
much better service.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I thank my hon. Friend. The 
Government recognise the need to use the clause carefully 
on the basis of broad consensus. That is why we have 
worked closely with social partners and drawn up certain 
types of agreement that they consider useful in moving 
forward. We shall have to consider this point to decide to 
what extent we agree with their conclusions. It is none the 
less encouraging that the CBI, the TUC and the LGA are 
working together on such issues.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> I make two brief points. First, the 
hon. Member for Northampton, North shows a lack of 
understanding of compulsory competitive tendering. If 
specifications are properly set, what counts is the 
requirement to produce the work, regardless of the 
number of staff, and failure to do so would mean a firm 
losing the contract. If, as I suspect, the firm that the hon. 
Lady had in mind is the one that I think it is, I confess to 
having contributed to its downfall, because it failed to 
produce the contract specifications and was withdrawn 
from the tendering process.
<P>
As to the comments of my hon. Friend the Minister for 
North Essex, a local authority might set training standards 
that would be excessive for a local authority contractor. 
A small firm that was contracted to do a specific job 
might be required to meet a level of ethnic minority 
training, which was extensive in the local authority, but 
not outside. Such a burden on the firm could force it to 
withdraw from the contract. In such a case, competition, 
which the Minister emphasises, would not happen.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> The hon. Gentleman is being 
obstructive. If Conservative Members had read the clause 
properly, examined the debate on the private Member's 
Bill that my hon. Friend the Member for Bethnal Green 
and Bow promoted last year, and listened to my speech, 
they would know that the Secretary of State's use of the 
powers in the clause will be carefully scrutinised. Nothing 
can go beyond the European Community's procurement 
rules. Councils that were unreasonable, and specified 
activities that were not relevant to the company's 
eligibility for the contract, would put themselves outside 
the law.
<P>
As the hon. Gentleman knows the Secretary of State 
does not monitor every local government contract. It is 
not for the Secretary of State to decide whether training 
is relevant in a contract; it is a matter of law. Under 
part II of the 1998 Act, it is currently illegal to take 
training into account. An authority that did that could 
be challenged by the contractor and seen to be outside 
the law.
<P>
The clause simply provides for our law to catch up with 
modern procurement practices in good business. We want 
to ensure that modern procurement practices colour local 
authorities' approach to public-private partnerships, 
contracting and their relationship with the private sector.
<P>
The public and private sectors have a lot to learn from 
each other. They must work together to drive up standards 
and improve services. If we bind local government 
practice by a contracting law that does not apply to the 
private sector or the rest of the public sector, we do not 
allow local authorities to catch up with modern 
procurement practices.
<P>
Amendment No. 217 seeks to remove the Secretary of 
State or the Welsh Assembly's discretion to determine 
when an order under the clause should be promoted, and 
instead permits an order to be made only following an 
application from a best value authority on the basis of a 
justification of need, related to the general duty of best 
value in clause 3. I should make it clear in relation to all 
the proposed amendments to clause 17 that any use of the 
power should be on the basis of a broad consensus. That 
is consistent with the European directives and with the 
principle of achieving value for money. That underlies our 
approach to the clause.
<P>
Amendment No. 226 also relies on individual best 
value authorities to trigger action, and would thus narrow 
and restrict the power in an unhelpful and unconvincing 
manner. We consider that decisions about the use of 
legislative powers to bring the framework into line with 
good procurement practice and remove obstacles to best 
value should be taken by, and at the discretion of the 
Secretary of State, at a national level, rather than by 
individual best value authorities.
<P>
In addition, the clause makes it clear that any order 
would already be subject to affirmative resolution 
procedure in both houses. Thus any proposal from the 
Secretary of State would be subject to full parliamentary 
scrutiny. The requirement additionally to bring a 
document before both Houses of Parliament to explain 
how a specified matter is to be treated is unnecessarily 
bureaucratic. Both Houses would hear the Secretary of 
State's view during the debate on the affirmative 
resolution. I therefore invite the hon. Member for Torbay 
(Mr. Sanders) to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment No. 216 seeks to provide that the use of 
the order-making power conferred by clause 17 on the 
Secretary of State should be objectively justified in best 
value terms. I understand the concern of Opposition 
Members about the additional powers being taken by the 
Secretary of State and about this specific issue. I am 
happy to listen to what the hon. Member for North Essex 
says as we are seeking to achieve the same end. However, 
the amendment is unnecessary because the clause relates 
to best value authorities. Therefore they cannot act outside 
best value in coming to an agreement with any other body, 
be it private sector, voluntary sector or other public sector 
in pursuance of the duty.
<P>
Amendment No. 218 would require the Secretary of 
State to seek an assessment from the Audit Commission on 
the likely impact of an order made under clause 17 before 
such an order is exercised. I appreciate that Opposition 
Members may be concerned that the power in clause 17 
should be exercised with due care and attention to coin a 
phrase and with regard to possible consequences. I hope 
that I have been able to reassure them on that point. The 
power contained in clause 17 will be used to promote best 
practice in procurement and contracting. That will be to the 
benefit of both private sector businesses and authorities in 
achieving best value. The work of the social partners has 
helped us to see that broad consensus can be achieved in 
relation to the clause 17 provision.
<P>
Of course, we will not use the power indiscriminately 
or without taking on board other views. In fact, I am 
amazed that Opposition Members think that we would or 
even imagine that we might. We are well aware of the 
importance of ensuring that clause 17 is exercised in the 
interests of best value. That also means that it is in the 
interests of good and productive relations between best 
value authorities, private companies and the voluntary 
sector. That includes ensuring that best value authorities 
operate, including when they are trading, within a 
framework of fair competition. That is inherent in best 
value.
<P>
As with any other piece of legislation, we want to 
ensure that we get it right. We will therefore consult 
widely before an order is made. We shall, as a matter of 
course, share our proposals with both the Audit 
Commission and the private sector, as well as local 
government and others, before anything is done. There 
will be no shortage of scrutiny in the exercise of the 
power. Consultation in advance of legislation is simply 
good government. There is no need for the Bill to make 
provision for additional scrutiny of the exercise of the 
power contained in clause 17. I hope that hon. Members 
are reassured and will not press the amendment.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> I thank the Minister for her 
concerns and her understanding of our concerns. The 
point of my hon. Friend's amendment was to raise those 
concerns. The hon. Member for Northampton, North said 
that solicitors would have stepped in if any local authority 
members had tried to impose such ghastly, 
non-competitive conditions. She is essentially right 
because legislation provided that the solicitor, auditor, 
chief executive, monitoring officer or whoever was 
appropriate stopped individual elected members on the 
council from imposing non-commercial and sometimes 
outrageous conditions on contracts. My hon. Friend 
showed that the law worked.
<P>
Many of us remain concerned about attempts by local 
authority members to get round that legislation and I 
assume, because of the emphasis on the importance of 
scrutiny, that the Government accept the validity of such 
concerns. We will want to watch carefully to establish 
whether the reassurances that we have been given prove 
to be justified.
<P>
Some local authority members have become notorious. 
I could cite my favourite local authority, Barnet, which 
tried to get rid of the reasonable, well known and able 
contractor underbidding it, by concocting fictitious rules 
and regulations even quibbling abut the size of the truck 
used by the contactor, ignoring the fact that the job 
specifications required it. Amusingly, the local Member 
of Parliament found himself jammed in the street because 
the direct labour organisation's truck was too large 
precisely the reason Barnet council had tried to use to get 
rid of the contractor.
<P>
Conservative Members have a good understanding of 
why the Government want to move down this road. We 
are distinctly concerned about abuse. Monitoring will 
have to be extensive and close. If the Government believe 
that real competition utilising the private sector should be 
used by local authorities, I must warn them that there will 
be attempts to ensure that the direct labour organisation 
has the upper hand to the disbenefit of those being served 
who have to pay for the best value service that they are 
supposed to be receiving from a supposedly best value 
authority.

<P>

<B>Mr. Sanders:</B> I am not sure that the Minister took our 
purpose into account. It is not an either-or but a together 
amendment: the local authority and the Secretary of State 
are to work in harmony, not the local authority on its own. 
As we have seen time and again, the Government believe 
that the Secretary of State and nobody but the Secretary 
of State is the proper authority. We will withdraw the 
amendment but return to the issue later. I beg to ask leave 
to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 63, in 
page 12, line 12, leave out `subsection (1)' and insert 
`this section'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take the following:
<P>
Amendment No. 227, in page 12, line 14, at end 
insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(bb) provide that authorities shall have regard to specified 
matters;'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Amendment No. 228, in page 12, line 16, at end 
insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(d) include matters relating to equity and sustainability.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Government amendments Nos. 64 and 65.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> Would it assist the Committee, 
Mr. Gale, if I spoke to the Government amendments first 
and responded to the other amendments later, or should I 
deal with them all together?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> It is not for the Chair to direct but it 
would probably be to the Committee's convenience if the 
Minister dealt with all the amendments in one go. I could 
them formally move the appropriate amendment when she 
has finished.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> Thank you, Mr Gale.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 63, 64 and 65 are Government 
amendments to enable the Secretary of State to issue 
guidance to best value authorities following the exercise 
of the power contained in clause 17. The clause provides 
a power that will allow the Government to modify current 
restrictions on contracting, which take the form of 
specified, non-commercial matters in the Local 
Government Act 1988. The important point, therefore, is 
exactly how those matters should be specified in the 
context of best value. The hon. Member for Mole Valley 
raised that matter in an earlier debate.



<P>
It is not our intention to weaken the safeguards against 
abuses of contract compliance. On the contrary: we will 
promote best practice and value for money.
<P>
Best value authorities must take properly informed 
decisions when selecting tenderers and awarding 
contracts. Current restrictions are an obstacle to that, 
preventing reasonable consideration of a contractor's 
work force policies, even when such policies are relevant 
to the performance and value for money of the contract.
<P>
Government amendment No. 65 will enable us to issue 
guidance that will reinforce the value for money message, 
following the provision in clause 17 for the exercise of 
power. In other words, the statutory guidance will act as 
a safeguard to ensure that best value authorities do not 
misunderstand the changes that have been made.
<P>
<H5>11.45am</H5>
</P>

<P>
I recognise that Committee members may be concerned 
that clause 17 should not introduce changes that might 
undermine the value for money of local government 
contracts. I hope that the amendments provide reassurance 
on that point.
<P>
Amendment Nos. 227 and 228 are grouped with the 
Government amendments. In our consideration of 
previous clauses, we debated extensively how other 
matters feature in the best value regime. I know that that 
remains a concern to Liberal Democrat Members, so I will 
briefly restate our position.
<P>
Best value is about delivering quality services at 
acceptable costs to those who use and pay for them. It is 
essential that authorities focus principally on service 
outputs and outcomes to enable local people and those 
responsible for audit and inspection to assess real 
performance and achievement.
<P>
Under the effectiveness banner, we are examining 
national indicators which reflect fair access to services: 
that is equity under any other name. Those will be key 
indicators against which best value will be assessed, but 
they will not be the only ones. Local authorities will be 
free indeed, they will be encouraged  to develop their 
own indicators, so far as they reflect the views and 
priorities of local people.
<P>
We fully accept the argument that quality services are 
more likely to be delivered efficiently and effectively if 
those who are employed to deliver them are treated fairly 
and considerately, are well motivated and well trained. 
I have heard about a private sector company seeking to 
provide additional training for what, in the past, were 
known as blue collar workers. Our fair employment 
agenda recognises such policy thrusts.
<P>
Race relations and equal opportunity will be similarly 
recognised. We agree, for example, that the Government 
and public bodies should take a positive lead in setting 
key targets for developing all their staff and in considering 
the impact of policies on those who are affected. We have 
done that in central government, setting ourselves targets 
on recruitment and involvement of ethnic minorities at 
every level of the civil service, not just the lower grades. 
We are determined that we will do what we can to ensure 
that fairness prevails in central government bodies.
<P>
We take the same view in the public sector generally. 
In statutory guidance, for example, we will ensure that 
authorities fully consider the impact of all options when 
reviewing their services.
<P>
We have made clear our commitment to the principles 
of sustainable development. The White Paper on local 
government confirmed our manifesto commitment to 
place a new duty on local authorities to promote the 
social, economic and environmental wellbeing of their 
areas. We want them to play an active role as 
community leaders.



<P>
The new duty will put sustainable development at the 
centre of community planning. The principles of sustainable development will underpin authorities' policies not only for the services that they deliver but for 
the activities that they undertake in partnership. Local 
authorities are already drawing up strategies under local 
agenda 21 that give effect to sustainable development 
principles. We have published new quality-of-life 
indicators that can be fashioned for local government also. 
We therefore have policies and plans to legislate in ways 
that will affect these other matters.
<P>
The prime focus of the best value legislation is on 
securing genuine improvement in the services on which 
people depend. We do not wish to dilute that process but 
we shall issue guidance under best value provisions that 
ensures that authorities link the implementation of best 
value with wider issues such as sustainability and the 
quality and values that they attach to their work force. 
Therefore, in our view, the amendments are unnecessary, 
and I ask the hon. Lady not to press them.
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard  </B>(Taunton): I am sorry to disappoint the 
Minister but I intend to press amendments Nos. 227 and 
228 because I am unconvinced by her answer, although I 
was fascinated at her ability to give me such a robust 
response before I had made my speech. This is where civil 
servants come in useful, I am sure.
<P>
Amendment No. 227, seeks, rather than merely lifting 
a ban, to allow the Secretary of State to identify certain 
matters which local authorities and others would be 
required to consider. We have talked about equity and 
sustainability. I recall trying the first time to find three 
more Es: I could have used the word "ecology"	 instead of 
sustainability, but my brain works so slowly that it has 
taken me three weeks to work that out.
<P>
In the past, we have tried to have equity and 
sustainability written into the Bill. As the Minister has 
just reiterated, the Government have expressed support for 
the idea of local authorities considering the issues. The 
support was expressed but the Minister clearly does not 
consider those issues as important as the original three Es 
that are in the Bill.
<P>
As for equity and equality, the Commission for Racial 
Equality is convinced no doubt the Government agree 
that public bodies should be able to use the leverage of 
their purchasing power to help prevent racial 
discrimination and promote the adoption and application 
of good equal opportunities policies and practice by 
employers. I agree that there have been times I hope 
that I shall not be required to be specific when local 
authorities were more eager to put duties on outside 
contractors than on themselves, and have been tempted to 
use the procurement process to persuade the private sector 
to employ good equal opportunities policies while not 
necessarily carrying them out themselves. I am glad that 
there has been no intervention on that I hope that hon. 
Members can think of examples.



<P>
The Commission for Racial Equality argued that 
provisions in the Local Government Act 1988 which 
enabled authorities to ask specific questions and include 
draft terms in contracts, and then consider responses, did 
not go far enough. Local authorities used this facility 
variably because they considered that it had serious 
defects, such as not allowing authorities properly to assess 
contractors' responses nor requiring them to take action. 
The Minister, rather than seeing this as an exception to 
the rule which rather lowered the status the CRE prefers 
to see it as part of the duty given to all public bodies 
said that commercial considerations should not undermine 
value for money. Our view, which I am sure that the 
Government share, is that money should not be the only 
issue to be taken into account. This is where I suspect we 
differ from Conservative Opposition Members in that we 
consider wider issues also of importance. The public do 
not generally consider money the only issue to be taken 
into account, as is obvious from the pattern of voting in 
local elections. The party that promises the lowest council 
tax does not always win the election.

<P>

<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> Value for money is a different matter. 
Saying that money is not the critical issue does not detract 
from our determination to get value for money by getting 
the best quality and the most efficient service. That is one 
of the problems; simply saying that money is not the most 
important thing should not mean that we do not recognise 
that whatever money is spent, we must get the very best 
out of it for the sake of the public whom we seek to serve.
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> There is no disagreement; I should 
have said that cost was not the most important issue and 
that value for money would take into account other issues. 
It is a matter of how value for money is defined.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am at one with the Minister on the issue. 
It was only ever a caricature of competitive tendering that 
it was about the price of everything and the value of 
nothing. On the contrary, some of the first beacon 
authorities that the Minister may select will be authorities 
that have used the competitive tendering framework 
effectively. It is all about providing better value in its 
widest sense for council tax payers. That is why we share 
the Bill's objectives. We should not get involved in 
arguing about which of us has a certain view about value 
for money. We should be discussing how the Bill will 
work in practice rather than caricaturing each other.
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> I am sorry to have rattled the hon. 
Gentleman's cage but I am delighted that there is an 
outbreak of sweetness and light in the Committee and that 
everyone is in agreement. [Interruption.] Obviously this 
is the third way; we are all in the same tent and all agree 
on everything, all the time. It is very dull. I hope that 
when the hon. Gentleman talks about value for money he 
includes matters such as the impact on the environment, 
on equity, racial equality, training the work force and the 
other issues that we have discussed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Lady Thatcher made the environment an 
issue.
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> I am sure that Lady Thatcher would 
be distressed to hear that.
<P>
The Minister talked about the service output and 
outcomes and she would agree that they are affected by 
input, the example being how the work force is treated. 
The Minister mentioned how the work force is motivated 
"etc."	 An authority may appear to score highly in the 
performance indicator charts, for example in the speed 
with which it deals with planning applications, but the 
outcome of its impact on the environment, for example, 
may be negative; its speedy response may have been at 
the expense of public consultation or of good design, so 
outputs do not necessarily measure people's interests.
<P>
To return to the amendments, although I have not 
strayed far from them, only by specifying equity and 
sustainability in the Bill will it show that the Government 
attach high importance to these issues. The Minister keeps 
saying that such issues should be at the centre of local 
authority plans because the Government think that they 
are important, but she resists our attempts to help her to 
legislate to put real power into her avowed principles. I 
hope that she will not continue to do so.
<P>
<B>Ms Oona King:</B> I am grateful for the opportunity to 
speak in the debate. Members may be aware of my 
previous interest in the matter.
<P>
I speak to Government amendment Nos. 63, 64 and 65 
about issuing guidance. I was interested earlier to hear 
the hon. Member for North Essex say that Back-Bench 
Members were jumping up and down with a certain 
hunger to get the guidance incorporated, and thus to 
change part II of the Local Government Act 1988.
<P>
The private sector, as well as trade unions and local 
government, believes that the changes need to be made 
and that current legislation is a barrier to fair competition.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I have had representations from private 
sector interests that are suspicious of the clause. it creates 
an opportunity for cosiness between local authorities and 
some contractors and for the exclusion of new entrants. 
We must be careful about that. Much depends on how the 
clause is used. I am sure that the hon. Lady is sufficiently 
generous to acknowledge that risk.
<P>
<B>Ms King:</B> I do not think that cosiness is necessarily a 
sin. However, it is wrong to prevent other contractors 
from having a fair crack of the whip.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> I have also received extensive 
representations from the private sector, which is worried 
that the clause could be used to eliminate competition.
<P>
<B>Ms King:</B> The Confederation of British Industry backs 
the clause. [Interruption.] We will now hear the usual 
charge 
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> The CBI group of companies is 
not involved in the majority of public services for which 
bidding with local authorities is required. The hon. Lady 
should talk to the right people.
<P>
<B>Ms King:</B> The hon. Gentleman might be aware that the 
business services sector will be greatly affected by the 
Bill. That sector is specifically involved with local 
authorities. As chair of the all-party group on business 
services, I have spent a lot of time speaking to employers 
who have been involved in the social partner dialogue. 
I appreciate that "dialogue"	 constitutes a swear word for 
the hon. Member for Mole Valley, but when agreement 
has been reached, the Government should try to 
incorporate the views of the social partners so that we 
can progress.



<P>
The Government amendments would ensure that the 
contracting process was not abused, as it was in the past. 
We have witnessed outrageous public sector abuses of the 
contracting process. After the introduction of CCT, we 
witnessed outrageous private sector abuses. I have a list 
of the abuses that occurred in the constituency of the hon. 
Member for Mole Valley. I shall not go into that because 
it might prevent us from holding a constructive dialogue.
<P>
The current system encourages neither fair competition 
nor best value. We must escape the ideological, myopic 
viewpoint that prevents us from envisaging a way forward 
that would benefit the private sector and employees. Why 
is that coincidence of interests so terrible? The clause and 
the Government amendments would marry the compatible 
and interdependent aims of value for money and fair 
employment. Time and again, we see proof of the simple, 
self evident truth that you get what you pay for.
<P>
Work-force matters are not non-commercial. That is a 
double negative, but I mean that work-force matters have 
a commercial impact. That is self evident. I am delighted 
that the social partners have agreed that that is so. We 
now need legislation to reflect the changes in procurement 
practice and to prevent abuse of the contracting procedure.
<P>
The measure must not be a barrier to business. It must 
ensure that there is no discrimination against whoever can 
deliver the service, whether that is the private, public or 
voluntary sector.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> Does the hon. Lady agree that 
there is a distinct possibility that a local authority might 
wish to use the changes to ensure that there is no real 
competition? She said that one gets what one pays for. 
However, she should ask the people of Barnet if they are 
getting what they paid for. The are paying £500,000 over 
the budget. The contract for bin services was £1 million 
over budget, compared with the private sector. The people 
of Barnet are not even receiving a service.
<P>
<B>Ms Oona King:</B> It appears that the hon. Member from 
the valley of the moles I am sorry, I should have said 
the hon. Member for Mole Valley has an obsession.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman can quote chapter and verse at me, 
and I can do the same to him, but that does not progress 
matters.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> That does not help the people of 
Barnet.
<P>
<B>Ms King:</B> Oh my goodness, that really is astonishing.
<P>
I cannot resist giving the hon. Gentleman a horrifying 
example from 1996. It involves school dinner ladies in 
Wandsworth and demonstrates how health and safety 
guidance would be useful in ensuring that the contract is 
carried out to a minimum standard. There were three 
proven cases of staff being electrocuted by equipment 
which had been downgraded to save money. Following 
privatisation and contracting out, there was no hot water 
supply to schools, so trolleys carrying cauldrons of boiling 
water were wheeled around.
<P>
<B>Ms Keeble:</B> My hon. Friend spoke about the ruling out 
of competition. Does she agree that the CCT regime 
excluded competition because it prevented a large number 
of smaller local firms from bidding for contracts and was 
carved up by the big multi-nationals and national 
companies? The measure will aid competition and have 
dramatic beneficial effects for local economies if it frees 
up small firms to bid for and get contracts.
<P>
<B>Ms King:</B> That is exactly right.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> Will the hon. Lady give way?
<P>
<B>Ms King:</B> No. I will not. I am sick and tired of 
Opposition Members' tone and attitude, which does not 
befit this House.
<P>
We need guidance to reinforce the value for money 
method, as hon. Members on the Opposition Front Bench 
have said.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> And the Government.
<P>
<B>Ms Oona King:</B> That goes without saying.
<P>
We need guidance to ensure that best value authorities 
do not misunderstand the changes that have been made. 
Provisions submitted by the social partners took more 
than a year of careful and painstaking negotiations and 
are a tribute to employers, employees and local 
government. I am pleased that the Government 
amendments will allow such guidance to be issued in a 
manner that promotes best value.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The Committee has come to life debating 
clause 17. At last, Labour Back Benchers have found 
something in the Bill on which they can really back 
their Government.



<P>
Clause 17 will give another power to the Secretary of 
State. The Minister said earlier that best value was about 
outputs, not inputs. The amendment is about inputs, 
allowing local authorities the freedom to specify those 
inputs

<P>

<B>Ms Armstrong indicated dissent.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The hon. Lady is shaking her head, but 
she should reflect on and accept what I say. We are 
talking about local authorities being able to specify what 
contractors shall do in order to achieve certain objectives 
relating, for example, to training or local employment 
policy. As I say, that means inputs not outputs.
<P>
I am always suspicious when the Government say that 
they will act in accordance with consensus. Ultimately, 
they are the arbiters of that consensus. The consensus 
could be the perspective of the CBI, which tends to 
represent big business interests. When the hon. Member 
for Northampton, North intervened on her hon. Friend the 
Member for Bethnal Green and Bow, she said that she 
hoped that many smaller enterprises would have the 
opportunity to contract for local authorities. However, I 
fear that in respect of specified matters in the 1988 Act, 
she is barking up the wrong tree.
<P>
If smaller companies are able to do more work for local 
authorities, those authorities must split their contracts 
more the worst offending authorities keep their contracts 
as large as possible to ensure that they are as difficult to 
organise as possible but the clause has nothing to do 
with that. It underlines why the CBI supports the 
provision: the CBI supports big business, which likes 
big contracts.
<P>
The CBI also has an ambivalent attitude towards 
regulation I hope that the hon. Member for Bethnal 
Green and Bow is listening to this. Many CBI members 
favour regulation because it ensures that the big boys who 
can carry the regulation do much better than the small 
boys who can be put out of business by over-regulation. 
If local authorities create more regulation in their 
contracts, it could suit the big and not the small 
companies.
<P>
<B>Ms Oona King rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> May I give way first to the hon. Member 
for Bethnal Green and Bow because of her special interest 
in the subject?
<P>
<B>Ms King:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right that regulations 
preventing cowboy contractors from gaining contracts are 
good for reputable businesses, but I see no reason why 
we should object to that. Yes, the CBI supports the 
provision but so too does the Business Services 
Association, the contractors group of the Construction 
Industry Federation, the Independent Healthcare 
Association and the Environmental Services Association.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> What about the public contractors 
association? It is difficult to universalise: there is 
definitely suspicion as well as enthusiasm about the 
clause.
<P>
The Government amendments, which deal with 
guidance, are interesting. The Minister said that guidance 
could be exercised after the power was exercised. 
However, Government amendment No. 63 does not mean 
that. It would allow the Secretary of State to issue 
guidance about specified matters in relation to section 17 
of the Local Government Act 1988, which might be a 
better way of proceeding than altering legislation. For 
example, training of employees could be a relevant matter 
to consider when it will have an outcome on the 
performance of the contract.
<P>
Ultimately one has to decide whether the contractor 
will be able to deliver for the price. It is no good just 
taking his word for it. It was never intended that the 
legislation should insist that local authorities take a 
contractor's word for it. If issuing guidance instead of 
altering the legislation made the atmosphere around the 
interpretation of those provisions more conducive to deal 
with problems, it might be a better way to proceed. I 
wonder whether the Minister feels that guidance should be 
used where alteration of the law might not be necessary.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The two Liberal Democrat amendments are interesting. 
Enabling the Secretary of State to specify a new matter to 
which the authorities will have regard is a most interesting 
way of proceeding. The Minister's rejection of that 
amendment rather blows the gaff on the pretence about 
the clause as whole. Amendment No. 227 is a mirror 
image of the clause as drafted. If the Secretary of State 
can remove a thing, surely that is like "having regard"	 to 
it. It is alright for local authorities to have regard for that 
specified matter. The fact that the Minister rejected the 
amendment raises a question as to what the clause is 
about. It does not make sense to reject amendment No. 
227 and yet support the clause.
<P>
I ask the Minister to reflect on that again. If it is right 
for a local authority no longer to be prohibited from 
having regard to what is currently a specified matter, why 
would it be wrong for the Minister to have a power to 
provide that local authorities shall have regard to specified 
matters. I do not understand that. The position is not 
logical from the Government's point of view which leaves 
a question mark in my mind about where the clause will 
lead.
<P>
It is incumbent upon the Government to allay the fears 
of uncompetitiveness that still exist, certainly in the minds 
of contractors, who feel that they will be squeezed out. I 
described them to the hon. Member for Bethnal Green and 
Bow as cosy arrangements. We are in favour of cosiness 
but not of cronyism and protectionism there is enough 
of that in local authorities as it is. We want to make sure 
that we do not create new opportunities for cronyism by 
passing such a clause without carefully questioning how 
the powers will be used.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> I, too, wish to emphasise the 
concern that many contractors share about cosiness and 
the difficulties they will have if the clause is abused. The 
Minister keeps telling us that competition is a vital part 
of the Bill. In fact, the previous clause talks about 
competition and is supposedly put in to enhance it. That 
has now been upset somewhat by the comments of two 
Labour Members.
<P>
The hon. Member for Northampton, North explained 
that the way that the CCT legislation works means that 
the large contractors have a better chance than the smaller 
ones. She fails to understand that that is down to the local 
authority and the way it sets up the specifications.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bethnal Green and Bow, talking 
about the private sector abuses in one particular local 
authority, mentioned health and safety. However, she 
failed to look a little further. Had she done so she would 
have seen that health and safety was used by that local 
authority to sack a large American catering firm. When 
the bid went out again the in-house team won. In other 
words the claim that there is a one-sided view of that local 
authority is disproved by its actions. I put it to my hon. 
Friend the Member for North Essex that at the end of the 
day we will have to suck it and see whether the private 
sector's fears will, as I suspect be realised.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I fear that there will be plenty of private 
sector companies vociferous in defending their own 
interests, to the detriment of other private sector firms 
who may have been squeezed out. We will never have a 
clear answer because of the nature of contracting; there 
are always winners and losers, people able to stay on the 
inside under these arrangements and others who will be 
excluded. I hope that it will not be the small businesses 
to which the hon. Member for Northampton, North 
referred that are excluded.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> My hon. Friend is right, but he is 
only telling half the story. The contracts could be 
manipulated by local authorities if they are not 
monitored I would love to see the army who will have 
to monitor the contracts. It would stop the private sector 
even being interested in bidding.
<P>
<B>Ms Keeble:</B> The hon. Gentleman mentioned two 
contracts in one local authority that collapsed and said 
that that vindicates his arguments about CCT. Does he 
think that an adequate way to provide stable services to 
the local community is to have a regime that sets up 
contracts that fail? Is it not better to have a sound, best 
value regime that gives contracts that will last, be stable 
and deliver sound services at good value?
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> The hon. Lady fails to understand 
that only a small number of contracts fail. They fail 
because of their inability to reach a certain quality and 
standard. Allowing the private sector to compete through 
CCT has engendered an expertise and an entrepreneurship 
previously lacking in the provision of local government 
services. The quality of services prior to CCT and the 
local authority's understanding of those services was 
abysmal, and so were the costs. The hon. Lady knows 
that, because when she and I were in local government 
we shared borders with a local authority that was, and 
still is, notorious for incompetence and corruption. If the 
private sector had been allowed to bid properly with that 
local authority under CCT, and if it had succeeded in 
getting some of the contracts it did in some other 
cases the quality of services would have given best 
value. I think that the hon. Lady will accept that, albeit 
reluctantly.
<P>
<B>Ms Keeble:</B> I do not want to prolong our debate, but 
will the hon. Gentleman accept that the problems in that 
local authority were with management? Whether the 
services are provided in-house or not, if they are not 
properly managed, a private contractor can deliver a bad 
service too.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> The hon. Lady is right. 
Southwark's housing management and repair system, 
in-house and outside can be compared and contrasted. She 
might like to reflect on the fact that the outside firm was 
lambasted for providing in excess of 90 per cent. of the 
contract not 100 per cent. whereas the in-house team 
was barely providing 45 per cent. but was let off the hook. 
That shows an unpleasant bias, which I hope will not be 
reflected when the Bill is enacted.



<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> We have had an interesting debate, 
although the argument has not moved on much further.
<P>
The clause and the Government amendments will 
enable both the private and the public sectors to be much 
more involved in modern procurement practices. The 
Government want to ensure that local authorities adhere 
to the very best practices in the procurement and delivery 
of services.
<P>
The hon. Member for Taunton (Jackie Ballard) again 
raised issues that are currently covered by the three Es, 
which is why I say that the argument does not seem to 
have progressed very much. Her amendments would 
return the clause to specified matters rather than moving 
it in the direction that we wish. The effect of amendment 
No. 228, to which the hon. Member for North Essex also 
referred, would be that when the Secretary of State or the 
Welsh Assembly made an order under clause 17, which 
would provide for a specific matter to cease to be 
non-commercial under part II of the Local Government 
Act 1988, the order could provide for best value 
authorities to have regard to specified matters. The 
amendment would also increase the number of specified 
matters. I am not convinced that that is the best way of 
ensuring good procurement practice, which takes account 
of the nature of the work force and matters that are 
relevant to a specific activity.
<P>
I shall give an example of modern procurement 
practice. The right hon. Member for Richmond, Yorks 
(Mr. Hague) recently went to America to speak to the 
Mayor of New York, among others. The Mayor of New 
York favours a specific method of securing bidders for 
contracts. I spoke to a senior executive of a British street 
furniture business. He told me that the company had been 
invited to put in a tender for New York. That was a great 
opportunity. The company was not asked about the details 
of the contract or proportions and percentages; it was 
asked three questions. The first question was, "What 
values do you hold in relation to your work force?"	 The 
second was, "Can you deliver this service at nil cost to 
the city?"	 Advertisements were involved, and the 
company had to work everything out. The senior 
executive said that those questions had totally transformed 
his view of the company. The employers had had to work 
out with the work force the meaning of equal 
opportunities, and how the company valued its employees. 
That process has taken two to three years, but the senior 
executive claims that the company has emerged a more 
competitive business because it had previously never 
taken account of those matters. We should begin to view 
procurement practices more positively.
<P>
The clause enables modern procurement practices to be 
introduced into contracting. The example that I gave is 
not the only method of doing that, but it reflects the 
experience of one company and one senior executive, who 
had been through a specific process. Current legislation is 
so restrictive that it does not allow that sort of approach. 
The clause alone will not achieve our aims, but it will 
help to move towards being able to consider more openly 
methods such as those that I described, and to consult 
more widely

<P>

<B>Several Hon. Members rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I was responding to points that the 
hon. Member for Taunton made, but I hope that my 
comments also covered the points of the hon. Member for 
North Essex.
<P>
<B>Mr. Owen Paterson </B>(North Shropshire): The Minister 
mentioned three criteria. What was the third criterion?
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> To be honest, I cannot remember. I 
shall get back to the hon. Gentleman if he is interested.
<P>
I gave an example of a very different method of 
proceeding in the relationship between a public body and 
a private sector company. That method tries to secure the 
best for the people of New York. I did not claim that that 
was the best way of proceeding in this country. It was 
simply an example of the way in which procurement 
practice has moved on since the 1988 Act was passed.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Hayes (South Holland and the Deepings):</B> 
The question is not whether wider considerations about a 
potential supplier should be taken into account as part of 
the relationship. That has always taken place. I have been 
involved with hundreds of contracts in business, and on 
the other side of the fence, in local government. The real 
point is whether they should be specified. The contractual 
relationship and the partnership are different things. The 
provision would load more requirements for example, a 
more detailed specification and would obviate 
competition and prevent some people, who might be very 
strong in terms of forming a partnership or relationship, 
from bidding in the first place and securing the contract.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> The hon. Gentleman was not present 
when we discussed the general thrust of the clause and 
I covered the many issues that he mentioned. The 
reality, of which the hon. Gentleman may be aware, is 
that current legislation forbids anything other than 
strictly commercial matters being taken into account. 
Our debate, prior to the hon. Gentleman joining us, 
made it clear that issues which at present would be 
seen as enabling and helping current activity were 
outlawed by the previous legislation. Clause 17 seeks 
ways through that without opening the gates so wide 
that his concerns would become a reality. They will not 
do so under the way in which the clause would 
legislate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The hon. Lady gave an illuminating 
speech after departing from her officials' notes and that 
is not meant as a slur on her officials. A touch of the 
vision thing came through, for which I am grateful.
<P>
On my earlier question about the use of guidance, will 
she undertake to reconsider issuing guidance on the 
specified matters, as a precursor of, or as an alternative 
to, legislating? It might be possible to issue guidance that 
would enable local authorities to have regard to 
apparently non-commercial matters in relation to the 
overall commercial imperative of getting a good value 
contract.
<P>
<B>Ms Armstrong:</B> I shall, of course, take another look. 
My understanding is that current legislation is so 
restrictive that we cannot issue guidance on matters that 
current legislation does not allow. It would put the 
Government, as well as local authorities outside the law. 
We need clause 17 to enable us to deal with this matter 
effectively. I assure the hon. Gentleman that hon. 
Members will be able to examine these matters through 
the affirmative resolution procedure of the House. We 
want to offer guidance to local authorities. and it is right 
that we do because some of them are small and, in 
themselves, without access to the legal interpretations that 
others have. I trust that the hon. Gentleman will accept 
that we are attempting to do this in a manner that moves 
us forward. Therefore, we believe that the clause is 
necessary.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The hon. Member for Taunton said 
some time ago that she wished to divide the Committee 
on one of these amendments.
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> May I speak, Mr. Gale?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> No. The hon. Lady may make a point 
of order if she wishes. I am moving to the next group 
of amendments.
<P>
Amendments made: No. 64, in page 12, line 17, leave 
out `subsection (1)' and insert `this section'.

Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 18</center></H4>
<H4><center>Transition from compulsory competitive tendering to best value </center></H4>

<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 219, in 
page 12, line 20, leave out `2nd January 2000' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`the date on which any provision of this Part comes into force'.<P>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take 
the following amendments: No. 229, in page 12, line 20, 
leave out `2nd January 2000' and insert `30th September 
1999'.
<P>
No. 15, in page 12, leave out lines 31 to 33.
<P>
No. 230, in page 12, line 31, leave out `2nd January 
2000' and insert `30th September 1999'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Our two amendments in this group relate 
to the timing of the commencement of the Bill. I do not 
understand the present arrangements. Clause 18(1) says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The following provisions shall cease to have effect on
2 January 2000"	,<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
but it is not clear when the Bill will come into force. Our 
amendment is designed to ensure that there is no hiatus. 
We cannot see why the provisions of competitive 
tendering and the Local Government Acts as they are at 
present should cease to apply for three months before best 
value comes into force.
<P>
Amendment No. 219 suggests that the existing 
arrangements should simply fall away at the same time as 
these arrangements come into force. Amendment No. 15 
therefore strikes out the part of the clause that is no longer 
necessary once that provision is made. This is only a 
probing amendment. I am sure that there are relevant 
issues which the Minister can address. I simply seek an 
explanation of why we do not have a seamless join 
between best value and competitive tendering.
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> I wish to speak to amendments Nos. 229 
and 230. Our amendments are the exact opposite of the 
Conservative amendments. I hope that the Minister's 
response will reflect the fact that there is not unanimity on 
the Opposition Benches on this. In her opening remarks at 
our first sitting the Minister said that there was widespread 
welcome not just in local authorities but in the private 
sector for the abolition of CCT and for the introduction of 
best value. Yet, if we follow the current timetable, CCT will 
continue and the spectre will continue to haunt local 
authorities. The timetable for the abolition of CCT puts 
unnecessary burdens on some councils for some services. 
Clearly not all local authorities and not all services will be 
affected.
<P>
The Government have accepted that CCT is a 
discredited process and they want its abolition at the 
earliest possible time. It therefore seems perverse to force 
authorities to let contracts under the CCT regulations in 
the next 10 months, especially as authorities are not sitting 
around waiting for best value to be put into legislation. 
They are already starting to implement it and we have 
heard examples not just from pilot authorities but from 
others that are welcoming the opportunity to get out of 
the straitjacket of CCT.
<P>
This has a particular impact on unitary authorities. 
Those which started on 1 April 1998 had exemptions from 
the CCT regulations for blue collar work in particular. 
Those exemptions end on 1 October this year. They will 
have to establish systems to meet the requirements of 
CCT from 1 October to 1 January a three moth period 
and at the same time prepare for best value. That is 
wasteful, time-consuming and benefits no one. The people 
in the authority who ought to be working on best value 
will be working for that period on CCT.
<P>
The Government have also argued that best value will 
allow the integration of services. We have discussed how 
that might work, for example across children's and other 
services. To use their buzz words it would enable 
joined-up thinking. However, that will be difficult to 
achieve if the defined service areas are operating under 
CCT while others are under a best value regime. In those 
circumstances, the private sector may not even bid for 
contracts because of uncertainty over the length of the 
contract and the impact of best value. Continuing CCT 
for the rest of this year until January next year is not 
economic, efficient or effective.
<P>
Amendment No. 229 would bring forward the date 
for the cessation of the provisions detailed in clause 
18(1) from 2 January 2000 to 30 September 1999, 
which would still provide plenty of time for Royal 
Assent. Amendment No. 230 would similarly change 
the date in subsection (2)(a).
<P>
<B>Mr. Brian White </B>(Milton Keynes, North-East): I am 
slightly confused. Is the hon. Lady saying that a unitary 
authority should either have CCT or best value, or is she 
saying that nothing should happen?
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> I am saying that having to meet the 
requirements of CCT for a three-month period is a poor 
use of a local authority's resources. It would be better if 
an authority were advised to introduce a best value regime 
in advance. As I said earlier, many authorities are already 
doing so. If the date were moved forward, many autumn 
tenders particularly those covering the new unitary 
authorities would no longer be necessary and the 
authorities would have six clear months to prepare for 
best value.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Given that the ultimate sanctions on CCT 
are at the discretion of the Secretary of State, I fail to 
see the problem. Either the Secretary of State carries on 
enforcing CCT or he does not. Worst of all would be a 
complete absence of any discipline or regime because the 
Act had not come into force. This is the main problem.

<P>

<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> I would contend that the ultimate 
discipline on local authorities is the ballot box and that 
council tax capping and this is dealt with later in the 
Bill council tax benefit capping are other disciplines. 
Local authorities already face such disciplines to convince 
them to obtain best value for their council tax payers, but 
continuing the CCT regime between this summer and 
January 2000 will not encourage them to provide it.
<P>
<B>Sir Paul Beresford:</B> Does the hon. Lady feel that local 
authorities will be able to meet best value requirements 
by the implied start date of January 2000?
<P>
<B>Jackie Ballard:</B> I have no reason to believe that they 
will not, though the Minister would be better able to 
answer than me. A question mark hangs over the small 
local authorities and parish councils, which we discussed 
during our second sitting, because of uncertainty over the 
de minimis level and whether they will be subject to it. 
Those smaller authorities will be in a hiatus, but the larger 
ones are already preparing for best value. Preparation 
would be more effective if authorities were not subject to 
CCT at the same time in the three-month period. I hope 
that the Minister will respond positively to the 
amendments.
