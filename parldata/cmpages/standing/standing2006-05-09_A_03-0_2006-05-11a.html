<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051145000245"></a>The

Financial Secretary to the Treasury (John Healey):</b> I beg

to move amendment No. 1, in page 10, line 4 [Vol. 1], leave

out</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;, where VAT is charged in

respect of the

use'.</div><a name="06051145000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">I

welcome you back to the Chair, Mr. O&#146; Hara, and I welcome hon.

Members from all parties back to the Committee. If you permit me a

degree of indulgence, I propose to refer to the purpose of clause 9 in

explaining amendment No. 1. It is rather difficult to do the latter

without the former.</div>

<a name="06051145000024"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051145000246"></a>The

Chairman:</b> As long as the Financial Secretary realises

that, in the light of that, I may judge that we do not need a clause

stand part

debate.</div><a name="06051145000025"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051145000247"></a>John

Healey:</b> I would be grateful for your guidance on the

clause stand part debate, Mr. O&#146; Hara, if and when you choose to

give

it.</div><a name="06051145000026"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051145000248"></a>The

Chairman:</b> We will see how the debate on the amendment

goes, and then we shall determine

that.</div><a name="06051145000027"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051145000249"></a>John

Healey:</b> Thank you, Mr. O&#146; Hara. The clause amends

the scope of the exclusions to general betting duty in existing excise

law and it does so with retrospective effect from 6 December last year.

It ensures that any bet made using a gaming machine, within the meaning

of section 23 of the Value Added Tax Act 1994, is excluded from a

charge to general betting duty where VAT is charged in respect of

use.</div> <a name="06051145000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the clause

were not amended, bets made on gaming machines would be excluded from

general betting duty only if they were charged with VAT. This means

that if the bookmaker providing the machine were trading below the VAT

registration threshold, VAT would not be charged and the bookmaker

would continue to have to account for the general betting duty on the

gross take of the machine. That would put smaller businesses at a

disadvantage because general betting duty is charged at 15 per cent.,

while the net rate of VAT is typically about 12 per cent., which was

clearly not what we intended in our pre-Budget report announcement or

the drafting of clause 9.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column85" />Column number: 86</div><a name="06051145000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment will ensure the

removal of the charge to the general betting duty from all machines

defined as gaming machines for VAT purposes, andit is

designed to have retrospective effect from6 December 2005. As

a consequence of the VAT changes we announced in the pre-Budget report,

bookmakers&#146; fixed-odds betting terminals have become gaming

machines for VAT purposes. As it is not the Government&#146;s policy

to charge both VAT and general betting duty on the same transactions,

we announced in the pre-Budget report that general betting duty would

not apply to fixed-odds betting terminals from 6 December.

However, the exclusions to general betting duty that are provided by

the Betting and Gaming Duties Act 1981 could be amended only by primary

legislation, which is what we are doing in the clause. On that basis, I

hope that hon. Members will accept the amendment and the

clause.</div>

<a name="06051145000030"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06051145000250"></a><b class="B">Mr.

Paul Goodman</b> (Wycombe) (Con): It is certainly a pleasure

to see you back in the Chair, Mr. O&#146; Hara. I have to confess

that I did a double take when I arrived in the Committee this morning

and saw these red boxes flying around. I thought that the Government

had greatly enlarged their ministerial team and that my hon. Friends

and I would have to work even harder than we already

are.</div><a name="06051145000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have no

quarrel with the amendment. This is the first amendment in the

Committee where the Government have had to correct a drafting error in

the Bill. I have not led for my party in debates on any of the

Bill&#146;s provisions before, but I recognise that this often

happens in legislation. The quality of a Bill can often be judged by

the number of such amendments that are tabled, so my hon. Friends and I

shall be watching Ministers closely. We have no intention of opposing

the amendment. If we did, we would make bookmakers liable for general

betting duty when the measure in the clause is trying to separate

betting duty from VAT.</div>

<a name="06051145000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have no problem with the

amendment, but if you, Mr. O&#146;Hara, want me to refer to the

clause at this point, I could certainly do

so.</div><a name="06051145000033"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051145000251"></a>The

Chairman:</b> As the debate is going, I do not think it is

necessary to group the clause stand part debate with this one. We shall

have a separate clause stand part debate.</div>

<a name="06051145000034"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06051145000252"></a><b class="B">Mr.

Colin Breed</b> (South-East Cornwall) (LD): Some of us at this

end of the room are struggling to hear. I do not know whether that is

because people have quieter voices, but we can only just about hear. I

do not know whether we have the microphone system on, but it is

difficult to hear at this end. I suspect that it is impossible at the

far end of the room.</div>

<a name="06051145000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">I often receive letters from

constituents&#151;perhaps other hon. Members do

too&#151;complaining that they get doubled taxed. They pay tax in

their working lives and then they tend to get taxed on all sorts of

things after they have retired. They may not be sympathetic to the idea

of letting the gambling industry off from double taxation. It is a

sensible amendment and we have no difficulty in accepting

it.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column86" />Column number: 87</div><a name="06051145000036"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06051145000253"></a><b class="B">Rob

Marris</b> (Wolverhampton, South-West) (Lab): I would like a

slightly greater explanation from the Financial Secretary as I am not

sure that I followed it. I thought that the amendment was designed to

protect betting agencies or companies that are below the VAT threshold,

but the VAT threshold is well below the 2.5 per cent. levy

referred to in clause 10, which we have not yet come to. I may have

misunderstood the amendment, but my understanding is that, if it goes

through, someone running a betting operation below the VAT threshold

will pay only 2.5 per cent. tax. If that is the case, it is far too

low.</div>

<a name="06051145000037"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051145000254"></a>John

Healey:</b> Levying VAT, rather than general gaming duty, has

two consequences. First, those small bookmakers who are not registered

for VAT will have to register. We estimate that there will be around

200 of those. There are approximately 500 to 800 small

bookmakers&#146; premises that belong to bookmakers who fall below

the VAT threshold. They will be affected by clause 9 if we do not amend

it, because they will not be able to levy VAT and will therefore have

to charge the general betting duty, which is not our intention. They

would, in effect, be penalised. While the general betting duty is

levied at a rate of 15 per cent., the effective rate of VAT is around

12 per cent.</div>

<a name="06051145000040"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051145000255"></a>Mr.

Goodman:</b> As the Minister said in view of the amendment,

the Government are attempting, as a result of the European Court

judgment&#151;the Financial Secretary did not refer to that&#151;to

separate out general betting duties and VAT. This is clearly something

that has to be done in the light of the judgment. Unless some point is

raised in this debate that would make us want to look at this clause

again, we have no intention of opposing

it.</div><a name="06051145000041"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051145000256"></a>John

Healey:</b> I welcome the intention of the hon. Member for

Wycombe (Mr. Goodman) not to oppose this clause. I hope that the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051145000257"></a>John

Healey:</b> We move on here to gaming duty and gaming duty

bands. Clause 10 will increase the gaming duty bands in line with

inflation for accounting periods starting on, or after, 1 April 2006.

Increasing the value of the duty bands in line with inflation ensures

that the real value of the thresholds above which the casino operator

is liable to pay the higher rate of tax are maintained.</div>

<a name="06051145000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">In looking at the decisions on

gaming duty bands, there has been a question on the taxation of remote 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column87" />Column number: 88</div>gaming. As we confirmed in the Budget, we are not looking to make

announcements on the taxation of remote gaming until Budget 2007 so

that the tax system can reflect detailed regulations for the sector.

They are currently being developed by the Gambling Commission and are

planned to be ready by the autumn.</div>

<a name="06051145000203"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.15

am</div><a name="06051145000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">The industry

acknowledges the international nature of the remote gaming industry and

recognises that it raises difficult issues for taxation. Nevertheless,

the Government will continue the work with the industry over the coming

months to consider the shape and rate of a valid tax regime for remote

gaming. It is not an easy issue. There are many factors influencing the

decision by remote gaming operators about where to locate. It is not

clear that the rate of remote gaming duty will be the decisive factor.

There may not be a tax solution to the aspiration of bringing remote

gaming operators onshore into the United Kingdom and therefore under UK

jurisdiction for social regulation purposes.</div>

<a name="06051145000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">The decision to delay an

announcement resulting from the Budget 2006 on the remote gaming system

and bands has been warmly welcomed by the Remote Gambling Association.

Officials and I met members of the Remote Gambling Association before

the Budget and shall continue meeting them to discuss the implications

of this issue. Clause 10 therefore revalorises the existing duty

bandings. That is in accordance with the industry expectation and has

been the practice of the Government in recent years. I commend the

clause to the

Committee.</div><a name="06051145000049"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051145000260"></a>John

Healey:</b> The clause is about the definition of gaming

machines. It amends the scope of legislation so that all machines

capable of being used for gaming are subject to amusement machine

licence duty. It will remove non-gaming machines, such as pinball and

video machines, from the scope of the AMLD.</div>

<a name="06051145000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause defines a gaming

machine by reference to section 23 of the Value Added Tax Act 1994.

That section will be amended by clause 16, which we will 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column88" />Column number: 89</div>consider shortly. With stated exemptions, a gaming machine will be

defined as a machine designed or adapted for use by individuals to

gamble, whether or not it can also be used for other

purposes.</div> <a name="06051145000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause

ensures that any machine classified as a gaming machine under the

Gambling Act 2005 and the VAT Act will pay AMLD from 1 August.

Fixed-odd betting terminals, known as FOBTs, and so-called section 16

and 21 machines are included. Those machines are not currently liable

to AMLD because they use a remotely sited random number generator. The

current definition of a gaming machine, which we update under the Bill,

relies on the outcome of the game being generated by means of the

machine itself.</div><a name="06051145000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

changes in the clause will come into effect on1 August. They

will bring the definition of gaming machines more in line with social

regulation, technological developments and current industry practice.

We have delayed their implementation to give both traders and Her

Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs time to adjust their systems and

to help to ensure smooth transition to the new regime. As set out in

the regulatory impact assessment, the compliance-cost effects are

minimal. I commend the clause to the

Committee.</div><a name="06051145000058"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051145000261"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051145000263"></a>John

Healey:</b> To some extent, the clause is a companion of

clause 11. It will amend existing excise legislation to align amusement

machine licence duty categories with the categories under the Gambling

Act 2005, as we announced in the pre-Budget report. In addition, it

will set the new duty rates. As I said in respect of clause 11, changes

will take effect from1 August 2006 to give both traders and

Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs the time that they need to

adjust their systems and ensure that, from both sides, the transition

to the new regime will be as smooth as

possible.</div><a name="06051145000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">When we

announced in the pre-Budget report that we would align the AMLD regime

with the Gambling Act, it was generally agreed that the intention was

desirable as a simplification measure. It will give 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column89" />Column number: 90</div>operators a greater consistency between the tax and the social

regulatory regimes. In general, the new duty rates on gaming machines

reflect a revalorisation in line with inflation, following a freeze in

last year&#146;s Budget and a freeze in the Budget

2003.</div><a name="06051145000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">To ensure what

we believe is a more fair and equitable tax treatment for machines, the

clause will introduce a new &#163;5,000 annual rate for the unlimited

stake, unlimited jackpot machines to be located in the one regional

casino in future. It will introduce a &#163;2,500 annual rate for

other high-value casino jackpot machines. From the end of October last

year, those machines saw their stake and prize limits double from

&#163;1 and &#163;2,000 to &#163;2 and &#163;4,000.</div>

<a name="06051145000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">A new rate of &#163;1,780

will be introduced for jackpot machines with a maximum prize of

&#163;250. That reflects the inclusion in that category of some

jackpot machines that offer the relatively low stake of just 10p. We

decided not to wait for the implementation of the Gambling Act before

the change. That is essentially because changes in the machine market

mean that the old system of rates and categories is increasingly

outdated. On that basis, I commend the clause to the

Committee.</div><a name="06051145000067"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051145000264"></a>Mr.

Goodman:</b> The Minister will know that the British Amusement

Catering Trade Association welcomed the abolition of amusement machine

licence duty on non-gaming amusement machines. However, it said that it

was disappointed and concerned at a range of other AMLD increases,

particularly in relation to the treatment of B4 machines that will now

include 5p and 10p club machines whose duty will increase from

&#163;665 to &#163;1,780 and &#163;1,415 to &#163;1,780

respectively. If they look at the clause, members of the Committee will

find that I am referring to the bottom entry in the fifth

column.</div> <a name="06051145000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

association said that the change was an enormous hike and that it would

cripple community and political clubs. I stress

&#147;political&#148; because, who knows, that may include Labour

clubs. The association said that such clubs often rely on the revenue

from gaming machines for their existence, and it urges the Treasury to

reconsider the rates. I look forward to what the Financial Secretary

has to say about

that.</div><a name="06051145000069"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051145000265"></a>Mr.

Breed:</b> To some extent, we do not have any qualms with the

clause only in the sense that we worry about 2p machines and those that

provide only a &#163;5 prize. I wondered why amusement and gaming

people bothered about them, but I found out why on a recent ferry

crossing. Early in the morning, I discovered that vast numbers of

schoolchildren were whacking their money or somebody

else&#146;s&#151;perhaps it was their lunch money&#151;into those

low-value machines. They do not provide much of a prize, but I suspect

that they enable people to commence on the road to higher

stakes.</div> <a name="06051145000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not have

any qualms about how the Government wish to regulate or tax such

machines. They are used, probably perfectly satisfactorily, in clubs

and similar places. I have some difficulty accepting that they should

be used in more public areas such as ferries, but I am happy to support

the clause.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column90" />Column number: 91</div><a name="06051145000071"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06051145000266"></a><b class="B">Stewart

Hosie</b> (Dundee, East) (SNP): I seek a point of

clarification from the Financial Secretary on the difference between

categories B1 and A. The 12-month licence fee for category B1

machines&#151;machines accepting a &#163;2 stake for a

&#163;4,000 maximum prize&#151;is &#163;2,500. Category A

machines, as he described them, accept unlimited stakes for effectively

unlimited prizes, yet the 12-month licence costs only twice as much. If

the prize from such machines is &#163;50,000, &#163;100,000 or

whatever, is not &#163;5,000 for a 12-month licence on the low side?

I am trying to find out the Government&#146;s thinking on the

matter.</div><a name="06051145000072"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051145000267"></a>John

Healey:</b> The British Amusement Catering Trade Association,

which the hon. Member for Wycombe quoted, is an important trade body.

It represents the fragmented and diverse industry that uses amusement

machines and therefore has an interest in amusement machine licence

duty.</div><a name="06051145000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">Officials and I

have had regular discussions both during and after the formal

consultation that we launched a couple of years ago on the future of

AMLD. We went over BACTA&#146;s arguments in detail. We went over the

complexities of the industry and the categories and, in the end, we

came to the judgment that the package we are offering in clause 12 is a

fair balance given the competing factors at

stake.</div><a name="06051145000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.

Gentleman mentioned the situation that political, community and sports

clubs might be faced with regarding category B machines. That seemed to

be the emphasis of the BACTA view that he told the Committee about.

Three main categories of machine tend to be operated in registered

clubs: 5p jackpot machines, 10p jackpot machines and higher-stake

jackpot machines. We have tried hard to work with BACTA to reassure the

industry that the approximately 4,000 5p machines that are located in

such clubs&#151;including some political clubs&#151;and about which

he was particularly concerned will not be liable for AMLD at

&#163;1,965 from 1 August. Rather, they will be liable for the

&#163;735 a year rate, as was always

intended.</div><a name="06051145000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new

rates reflect the mix of machines in the new categories. The presence

of about 6,000 10p jackpot machines in category B4, although that is

fewer than the number of higher-stake club machines, is reflected in

its lower rate than that of B3. That is the judgment and the overall

package that we have come to. We have tried to keep the differentials

in place where justified and to make rate changes reflect the

development of machines and their distribution in the industry. I shall

take BACTA&#146;s representations through the hon. Member for Wycombe

as early representations for the 2007 Budget. We will inevitably have

to take decisions at that point about the rates of amusement machine

licence

duty.</div><a name="06051145000076"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06051145000268"></a><b class="B">Mr.

Brooks Newmark</b> (Braintree) (Con): I should like

clarification, because I was not clear about how the Financial

Secretary was responding in respect of the 5p club machines. I

understood that my hon. Friend the Member for Wycombe was saying that

the duty on 5p machines&#151;those in the community, political and

working men&#146;s clubs&#151;will increase from &#163;665 to

&#163;1,780, which is an almost 200 per cent. 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column91" />Column number: 92</div>increase. Is that still going through, or have I misunderstood the rate

increase for those

machines?</div><a name="06051145000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">I

raise this issue because, as we all know, following the smoking ban,

working men&#146;s clubs and political and community clubs feel that

they will find business difficult. This measure seems to be another

nail in the coffin of such small community

clubs.</div><a name="06051145000204"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.30

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051145000269"></a>John

Healey:</b> I said in my opening remarks that we are generally

revalorising the bands and rates of amusement machine licence duty and

we are conscious, as the hon. Gentleman said, that the prospect of the

smoking ban creates a degree of uncertainty for the trading future.

That is part of the overall judgment that we have come

to.</div><a name="06051145000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the hon.

Gentleman&#146;s specific point, I just said that the 4,000 or so 5p

jackpot machines in clubs are intended to be, and will be, liable to

the duty rate at &#163;735 a year. That is our intention and that is

what will happen, despite BACTA&#146;s fears. I hope that the

assurances that we have been able to give BACTA directly will give it

the reassurance that it seeks&#151;and I am grateful for the

opportunity that the hon. Member for Wycombe has given me to put

another assurance on the

record.</div><a name="06051145000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">I did not

catch where the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Stewart Hosie) got his

information from; I am not sure whether it was sourced from the

<i class="I">Daily Mail</i>, which takes a close interest in this field. There

has been a certain amount of misunderstanding about the new

&#163;5,000 per annum rate that we are proposing for unlimited stakes

and prizes machines, which will be in the new regional casinos once

they are up and running. The hon. Gentleman asked for the rationale

behind our setting that rate. We set it because we think that that is a

fair rate of duty to be paid on the expected profit from such

machines.</div><a name="06051145000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">Experience

overseas and the assessment work done by the Department for Culture,

Media and Sport in considering the social regulation implications

suggests that such machines could deliver an annual average profit of

around &#163;50,000, which means a duty-to-profit ratio of around

&#163;5,000:&#163;50,000, or 10 per cent. That is comparable with

the rate that applies in the other

categories.</div><a name="06051145000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope

that that was a useful explanation of the essential assessment and

rationale behind the judgment of this as a new rate for a new category

of gaming machine in this country, once the new regional casinos are

introduced.</div><a name="06051145000083"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06051145000270"></a><b class="B">John

Hemming</b> (Birmingham, Yardley) (LD): I thank the Financial

Secretary for his response, which makes it clear that the objective is

some form of equity in respect of a proportion of the return on the

machinery. However, it also refers back to the social questions

considered by the DCMS in respect of the licensing regime. Have the

social issues for unlimited return gaming machines, which tend to

attract people into depending on them and becoming addicted to that

process, not been taken into account at all in determining the

rate?</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051145000271"></a>John

Healey:</b> The purpose of social regulation and the new

Gambling Act is precisely to put in place the sort of controls regarded

as appropriate for the development of the industry in future. The hon.

Gentleman knows that such matters have been exhaustively debated in

Parliament over the past couple of years. The purpose of the tax system

is to ensure that we can get for the taxpayer and the public purse a

reasonable, fair rate of tax on the profits that will be made from

these activities. That is the purpose of the tax decisions that we have

made and set out in the clause. The concerns about the social impact of

new casinos and new forms of gambling are properly matters for social

regulation and for the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. They

are not properly an object or a purpose of the taxation system set out

in the

clause.</div><a name="06051145000085"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051145000272"></a>John

Healey:</b> I have explained the purpose of the clause,

referring to it in my remarks on clause 9. Its material effect is to

align section 23 of the Value Added Tax Act 1994 with schedule 9 to

that Act and therefore give full legal effect to a situation that has

been in place administratively since 6 December.</div>

<a name="06051145000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause also allows us to

amend the meaning of &#147;games of chance&#148; by Treasury order.

We will do that later this year to ensure that both section 23 and

schedule 9 take account of the definition of a &#147;game of

chance&#148; that is contained in the Gambling Act. We have further

work to do both with the industry and internally on pinning down that

definition. That is why we propose to do it by Treasury order later

this year, rather than now. I commend the clause to the

Committee.</div>

<a name="06051145000090"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06051145000273"></a><b class="B">Mr.

Mark Francois</b> (Rayleigh) (Con): May I also welcome you to

the Chair, Mr. O&#146;Hara? I look forward to serving under your

beneficent guidance and that of your fellow Chairmen as we plough our

way through the Bill over the next few weeks.</div>

<a name="06051145000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also take this opportunity to

welcome the Economic Secretary to our proceedings, and to congratulate

him on his early promotion to the Government Front Bench. Someone has

clearly smiled upon him and I think we all know who it was.</div>

<a name="06051145000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have moved on to part 2 of

the Bill, which deals with the VAT regime. When VAT was introduced in

the United Kingdom back in 1973 it was apparently billed as a simple

tax that would be easy to understand and to administer. In the next few

hours, I suspect that the Committee might disagree with that original

assertion. </div><a name="06051145000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause

deals with VAT and gaming machines. It represents a relatively gentle

introduction to this part of the Bill and is relatively

non-controversial. The Financial Secretary helpfully wrote to members

of the Committee on 8 May, outlining the Government&#146;s 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column93" />Column number: 94</div>rationale behind the clause, which seeks, in essence, to update the

definition of gaming machines for VAT purposes and the related

definition of a &#147;game of chance&#148;. Anyone embarking on a

political career might have their own definition of that.</div>

<a name="06051145000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have one question to put to

the Minister at this juncture. The final full paragraph of the

Financial Secretary&#146;s letter mentions that the updated

definition of a &#147;game of chance&#148; is intended to comply

with the definition in the Gambling Act. In itself, that seems to be a

sensible provision. However, the letter also refers to a nuance

concerning the fact that the Gambling Act does not apply in Northern

Ireland. As the Financial Secretary said, confirmation is awaited that

this will not cause any problems in using the definition in tax law.

Before we allow the clause to stand part of the Bill, will the Minister

expand a little on that point? Will he explain, at least roughly, when

the Government expect that work to be complete? When do they expect

that confirmation to be forthcoming so that the order can be

issued.</div>

<a name="06051145000095"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051145000274"></a>Mr.

Breed:</b> I believe that this measure is a useful

clarification. Much of the work will be done in the next year or so,

before the next Budget. We look forward to the complexities of that. In

the meantime, the proposal is sensible to ensure that the definitions

and so on are comparable.</div>

<a name="06051145000096"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051145000275"></a>John

Healey:</b> The hon. Member for Rayleigh(Mr.

Francois) describes this provision as a gentle introduction to the VAT

section of the Finance Bill. It was not designed as such; it was

designed for the fairly narrow purpose of dealing with the definition

of a &#147;game of chance&#148;. The simple answer to his direct

question is that the Gambling Act does not apply to Northern Ireland,

which has its own legislation in that area, although tax legislation

does. We propose to draw heavily on the definition of a &#147;game of

chance&#148; in the Gambling Act. We have more work to do before we

can confirm that, particularly checking with the Northern Ireland

Office whether or not there is any inconsistency or potential problem

that we have not yet

foreseen.</div><a name="06051145000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">In such

circumstances, rushing to confirm the definition when we do not need to

at this point does not seem sensible. We will do that by Treasury order

later this year. Essentially, we need to complete some technical work

in order to do so with a certainty and confidence that means we are

much less likely to have to return to the Committee and to the House to

put right any technical deficiencies that we could have avoided. That

is the purpose of the timetabling in those stages. I hope that that

gives the hon. Gentleman the reassurance that he

seeks.</div><a name="06051145000098"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question put

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051145000276"></a>Mr.

Francois:</b> I take the opportunity to welcome the Paymaster

General to our debate on this part of the

Bill.</div><a name="06051145000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">In essence

clause 17 is enabling, designed to permit the redrafting of schedule 10

of the Value Added Tax Act 1994, which deals specifically with the

taxation of buildings and land. As the explanatory notes to clause 17

of the Bill point

out:</div><a name="06051145000189"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The VAT

option to tax land and buildings legislation in Schedule 10 to the VAT

Act 1994 is one of the most complex parts of the VAT

legislation&#148;.</div><a name="06051145000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">The eyes of

the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris) are

positively lighting up as he reaches for the explanatory notes. I can

see that he is not about to disappoint

us.</div><a name="06051145000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">The chief reason

for this degree of complexity has been the piecemeal addition to

schedule 10 since its introduction, chiefly by means of secondary

legislation usually designed to add anti-avoidance measures to the

original schedule. For instance, as just a small sample of the changes

over the past 12 years or so, we have seen the Value Added Tax

(Buildings and Land) Order 1994, which was the first attempt to tackle

lease-back and similar anti-avoidance schemes. Then, as a further

example, the Value Added Tax (Buildings and Land) Order 1999 closed a

perceived loophole in the earlier anti-avoidance provisions. The Value

Added Tax (Buildings and Land) Order 2004 aimed to head off further

avoidance schemes used by partly exempt businesses, which the Treasury

perceived to be another

loophole.</div><a name="06051145000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

accumulation of secondary legislation has made the amended schedule 10

increasingly difficult to interpret in practice, to a point where

HMRC&#146;s partial regulatory impact assessment, which was released

to accompany that proposed rewrite, admitted with admirable

frankness,</div><a name="06051145000190"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Adding

layer upon layer of anti-avoidance provisions on to legislation that

also has to deal with the complexities of English and Scottish land law

has led to complaints about its complexity and virtual

incomprehensibility.&#148;</div><a name="06051145000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">Indeed,

the introduction of the consultation document provided advice that

should perhaps inform the whole of our proceedings, with the

recommendation

that</div><a name="06051145000191"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;taxpayers would

benefit from tax law which is clearer and easier to understand, and

HMRC would benefit from being able to explain the law more

easily&#148;.</div><a name="06051145000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finding any

member of the Committee who would contend with that would be

difficult.</div><a name="06051145000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">There

appears to be a broad consensus about the need for schedule 10 to be

rewritten. The consultation document, which was issued in December

2005, laid out the general lines along which this would be undertaken.

Moreover, the Paymaster General helpfully wrote to members of the

Committee on5 May, providing copies of the draft Treasury

order that would in effect rewrite the schedule. Members of the

Committee should have had the opportunity at least to glance at that,

although there has not been an opportunity to consult the professional

bodies, because that draft order has only just

emerged.</div><a name="06051145000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">In

particular, I note that the draft order is now designed to come into

force on 1 October 2006. We have a timetable for

implementation.</div>

be critical of the Treasury. It undertook what I actually think in this

instance was quite a good consultation&#151;I will make a few remarks

about the consultation process shortly. I was not in any way trying to

have a pop at Government Ministers; I was simply making the point that

we now have the draft order but because it has only just come out we

have not had as much time as we would have liked to scrutinise it in

detail. However, I am not knocking the fact that it is based on an

original consultation which came out in December&#151;and which I

think was well conducted. I hope the hon. Gentleman will appreciate

that

nuance.</div><a name="06051145000115"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051145000281"></a>Rob

Marris:</b> Is the hon. Gentleman revealing to the Committee

that he has not read this draft order rewriting schedule

10?</div><a name="06051145000116"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051145000282"></a>Mr.

Francois:</b> No, he is not, because he has read it. However,

if there were any problem, I am sure I could rely on the hon. Gentleman

to help.</div><a name="06051145000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">In essence,

the schedule is being rewritten in three areas: first, by outlining the

effect of an option to tax and the exclusions to those options;

secondly, by including the revised and now consolidated anti-avoidance

provisions; and thirdly, by outlining the mechanics of the

administration of the options themselves, including their territorial

scope, timing, revocation, notification and the operation of so-called

permission options. The process also involves the repeal of certain

aspects of the old schedule 10 which have effectively become

time-expired, and which are therefore no longer needed. Therefore, it

is fair to say that in this instance the Government have repealed some

outdated legislation, and we should give them some credit for

that.</div><a name="06051145000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore, so

far so good, but there are still some general questions that arise

about the proposed rewrite, and I should like to go through them in

turn with the Minister. First, why does this have to be done by order,

instead of being written into primary legislation, which is what

schedule 10 itself is? As an Institute of Indirect Taxation briefing

note pointed

out:</div><a name="06051145000192"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We think

it would be more appropriate for amendment to primary legislation to be

made by primary legislation, not secondary legislation. In the case of

buildings and land, as the draft legislation has already been exposed

for comment it is unclear why it cannot be included in the Finance

Bill, rather than 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column96" />Column number: 97</div>including the best part of a page of enabling legislation, which will

presumably have no use once the proposed Treasury order has been

approved by the House of Commons.&#148;</div>

<a name="06051145000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Institute of Chartered Accountants

has also expressed reservations about this process. It, too, has argued

that such changes should have been brought about through primary

legislation rather than by means of statutory

instrument.</div><a name="06051145000120"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051145000283"></a>Mr.

Newmark:</b> I was interested to read that the august

institution, the Chartered Institute of Taxation, also commented. It

said:</div><a name="06051145000193"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We doubt

whether the suggested changes will have any impact on lay persons, so

the only people to benefit are likely to be

advisers.&#148;</div><a name="06051145000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is a

concern, because it is important that whatever changes are made are

sufficiently clear, so that lay people can understand the proposed

changes.</div><a name="06051145000122"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051145000284"></a>Mr.

Francois:</b> I thank my hon. Friend for that point. As I will

discuss, the law has been particularly complex in this area, and that

has been a particular challenge&#151;for instance, for small

businesses. Therefore, my hon. Friend makes a valid point.</div>

<a name="06051145000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think it is fair to say that

what has been produced is simpler and less complex than what it

replaced, and the Government should be given credit on that point.

However, my specific question to the Minister is: why were they not in

a position to do that by primary legislation? Why did the Government

decide to do this by secondary, rather than primary, legislation? Was

it because the revised schedule was not available in time, perhaps

because the consultation&#151;which I think was well

conducted&#151;only finished at the end of February 2006 so

parliamentary draftsmen could not come up with a proposed new schedule

in time to include it in the Finance Bill when it was published on 7

April? I would accept that point, but I would then ask another

question: could the Government not subsequently have tabled a new

schedule to the Bill in Committee and put the proposal into primary

legislation, rather than relying on an enabling clause and a subsequent

statutory instrument? Is there a technical reason why the Government

have done that? It would be helpful to have an answer from the

Paymaster General when she replies to the

debate.</div>

<a name="06051145000124"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06051145000285"></a><b class="B">Stephen

Hesford</b> (Wirral, West) (Lab): I should like to raise the

hon. Gentleman&#146;s quotations from the two institutions with the

VAT and duties sub-committee of the Law Society, which

said:</div><a name="06051145000125"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The Law Society

welcome the proposal to rewrite schedule 10 VATA 1994 in more

accessible language and look forward to reviewing the draft statutory

instrument to give effect to this

proposal.&#148;</div><a name="06051145000126"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051145000286"></a>Mr.

Francois:</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for his intervention.

Far be it from me to provoke a dispute between the professional

institutions, not least the Law Society, as I am always wary when

dealing with m&#146;learned friends.</div>

<a name="06051145000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">Several bodies expressed

reservations about why the Government acted as they did. The hon.

Gentleman quoted the fact that the Law Society was interested in 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column97" />Column number: 98</div>seeing the draft order; that did not necessarily mean that it endorsed

that way of doing it, just that the Law Society was looking forward to

seeing it and will now have a chance to do so. I look forward to the

Paymaster General&#146;s response to that

point.</div><a name="06051145000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, in

respect of the consultation exercise, the Government consulted a number

of interested bodies about the proposals, including, but not limited

to, the British Property Federation, the British Retail Consortium, the

Chartered Institute of Taxation, the Confederation of British Industry

and the Law Society. The explanatory notes to the Bill

state:</div><a name="06051145000194"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A

consultation document containing draft legislation, which might replace

schedule 10 in its current form, was published in December 2005. This

was very positively received by

business.&#148;</div><a name="06051145000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">If that is the

case, can the Minister give us some idea of the types of responses that

were received? Will she say specifically whether any additional changes

were made to the draft order as a result of that consultation? In other

words, will she give us examples of what was published in December

having been amended to prove that the Government were listening to

those whom it took the trouble to

consult?</div><a name="06051145000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thirdly,

there is the effect of the changes on small businesses. Under the

heading &#147;Sectors and Groups affected&#148; the regulatory

impact assessment states that the changes will

affect</div><a name="06051145000195"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;virtually all

businesses registered for VAT in their capacity of landlord, tenant or

owner-occupier.&#148;</div><a name="06051145000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,

under the associated heading &#147;Small Firms Impact Test&#148;,

the regulatory impact assessment

states:</div><a name="06051145000196"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It has

not been possible to consult with small businesses before the public

consultation stage, but small businesses often complained about the

cost of professional advice incurred in relation to VAT land and

property transactions. We will be taking soundings from small

businesses alongside the formal

consultation.&#148;</div><a name="06051145000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">Can the

Minister give the Committee some idea what comprised the

&#147;soundings&#148; of the small business community? How were

they conducted and which organisations were involved? Can she show that

some changes took place in the recently published new draft schedule as

a result, particularly in relation to how it might affect small

businesses?</div><a name="06051145000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is an

especially technical area of VAT law and there appears to be a

consensus on the need to rewrite schedule 10. The Opposition do not

challenge that and the Government have responded to it, initiating what

appeared to be a good consultation exercise. They then published the

draft order, which they hope will be in force in October.</div>

<a name="06051145000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">To summarise, before we allow

this enabling clause to stand part of the Bill, will the Minister tell

us, first, why the Government did not use primary legislation?

Secondly, will she provide examples of the draft order being informed

by the consultation exercise and of changes having taken place since

December? Thirdly, how was the small business community consulted and

what changes have been initiated as a

result?</div><a name="06051145000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">I look forward

to hearing contributions from other members of the Committee and I will

listen to the Paymaster General&#146;s no doubt thoughtful

reply.</div><a name="06051145000136"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051145000287"></a>Rob

Marris:</b> I merely want to congratulate the Paymaster

General and her team on producing the 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column98" />Column number: 99</div>draft Treasury order in time for this debate. The Treasury is good at

that. Too often when we are considering legislation there is a lack of

draft orders but not when they are Treasury

proposals.</div><a name="06051145000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have one

small question for the Paymaster General. Am I right in looking at page

18 of the draft Treasury order that there is a schedule to the

schedule? Because if that is the case&#151;namely schedule 1 to

schedule 10&#151;that is a new one on me in

legislation.</div><a name="06051145000138"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06051145000288"></a><b class="B">Julia

Goldsworthy</b> (Falmouth and Camborne) (LD): I will extend

the general introduction to the VAT section of this Bill and merely say

that of course we welcome the simplification of one of the most complex

parts of the existing VAT legislation and would echo concerns that have

already been expressed.</div>

<a name="06051145000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">If a consultation took place in

December 2005 and was generally positively received I do not understand

why it is not possible to get this primary legislation in the Bill.

That is all I have to say.</div>

<a name="06051145000140"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051145000289"></a>The

Paymaster General (Dawn Primarolo):</b> I beg your pardon for

being slow to stand up, Mr. O&#146;Hara. I was lulled into a false

sense of security in believing that lots of other Members would want to

speak, although I was perplexed as to why they would want to. Just to

remind the Committee, this is a rewrite of current legislation. It

always worries me&#151;this has happened before in finance

Bills&#151;that when legislation, particularly VAT legislation, is

rewritten in the tax law rewrite style, it has often led to a

misunderstanding, particularly from Conservative Members, that somehow

new legislation is being introduced. I remember having to explain to a

Conservative Member, who used to be a Minister and who is now in

opposition, that all that had happened was that the legislation that he

introduced had been rewritten into the tax law rewrite style and if he

was shocked about the contents of the legislation I wondered how he had

not noticed it when he introduced it in the first place.</div>

<a name="06051145000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps I

could answer the questions posed by the hon. Member for Rayleigh (Mr.

Francois) succinctly, in the spirit of the rewrite. The reason why this

is a schedule by order is that the original legislation in 1989, drawn

up under the Conservatives, and consolidated in 1994 by a Conservative

Administration, provided new legislation for it to be done this way and

a rewrite follows; otherwise it cannot be just a rewrite.</div>

<a name="06051145000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">To answer my hon. Friend the

Member for Wolverhampton, South-West, no it is not a schedule to a

schedule; it is an order schedule, or a schedule to an order. I always

fear when my hon. Friend gets up because I know that he studies all the

papers assiduously and I fear that he will find something that I have

missed&#151;he often does. But I can reassure him on that point at

least.</div> <a name="06051145000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">In terms of

the responses and the changes to the two drafts, I am happy to take the

general areas but I would say to the hon. Member for Rayleigh that, of

the responses received in the consultation, The CBI welcomed the new

format and considered it an improvement on the existing legislation,

much easier to understand, and the British Property Federation welcomes

the Government&#146;s decision to rewrite schedule 10, believing that

this is an &#147;excellent 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column99" />Column number: 100</div>initiative&#148;. The Institute of Chartered Accountants welcomes the

rewriting of complex legislation to put it into plainer English. I will

come in a moment to the differences, the points that were raised in the

consultation and how I propose to deal with those in the order, having

listened to the consultation, once I have given

way.</div>

<a name="06051145000144"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051145000290"></a>Mr.

Newmark:</b> As always I remain concerned when Ministers use

selective quotes. I have a comment from the British Property Federation

in response to this

consultation:</div><a name="06051145000197"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Notwithstanding

our support for the government&#146;s decision to rewrite

legislation&#148;&#151;</div> <a name="06051145000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">the

Paymaster General was absolutely right to point that out, but the

comment continues&#151;</div>

<a name="06051145000198"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;we do believe there are a number

of improvements that might be made to the draft

legislation.&#148;</div> <a name="06051145000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would

encourage the Paymaster General to talk to the British Property

Federation to understand what those improvements might

be.</div><a name="06051145000206"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10

am</div><a name="06051145000147"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051145000291"></a>Dawn

Primarolo:</b> I was just coming to those points. I am aware

of them, and they will be reflected in the draft. We have returned to

the point raised by the hon. Member for Rayleigh concerning the nature

of the consultation and how things will change. I shall just briefly go

through the small number of proposed changes. The original order was

less positively received and I hope that in responding to these points,

we have now dealt with that. Discussions are still going on, and the

order will be dealt with by the affirmative procedure, so there will be

ample time to ensure that the draft reflects people&#146;s

concerns.</div> <a name="06051145000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to

give hon. Members an absolute assurance: our purpose is to rewrite the

legislation. The Department and my officials will do everything

possible in that rewrite remit to ensure that we respond to those

points. They basically fall into three broad

areas.</div><a name="06051145000149"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051145000292"></a>Mr.

Newmark</b> <i class="I">rose&#151;</i></div>

<a name="06051145000150"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051145000293"></a>Dawn

Primarolo:</b> Perhaps the hon. Gentleman would allow me to

tell him about the three broad areas that the consultation wanted us to

consider and how I am prepared to deal with it. I will be happy to give

way to him

afterwards.</div><a name="06051145000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">The first

area concerns the anti-avoidance test. The hon. Member for Rayleigh

touched on the complexities involved. I agree with what he said about

passing piece after piece of anti-avoidance legislation; we often do

not have a choice about that. The issue in question, which has been

discussed in Committee before, concerned the definition of</div>

<a name="06051145000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">&#147;wholly or mainly for eligible

purposes&#148;.</div> <a name="06051145000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">That was to

be changed to</div> <a name="06051145000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">&#147;wholly or

almost wholly for eligible purposes&#148;.</div>

<a name="06051145000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">For those who really want to study the

VAT regulations, the original intention was to ensure that the

provision reflected more closely the application of HMRC&#146;s

understanding of the meaning of 80 per cent. or more.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column100" />Column number: 101</div><a name="06051145000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">I propose a change to the draft

legislation that will enable HMRC to define by tertiary

legislation&#151;a discussion is going on with those concerned about

the rule&#151;the 80 per cent. figure with a discretion to accept a

lower amount; the point being that those in certain circumstances

should be reassured that a lower figure could be taken.</div>

<a name="06051145000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">The next major issue concerned

the condition relating to non-residential buildings intended for use as

dwellings and residential accommodation. That can be treated as outside

the option to tax. We really do not need to discuss the option to tax,

nor would we want to; it is complex. The current provisions cause

problems because the supplier of the building, who has to decide

whether to charge tax, faces uncertainty in knowing their

customer&#146;s intention. That has always been a problem.</div>

<a name="06051145000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">A great deal of clarification

was sought as to whether the proposed wording was insufficient to give

that certainty. Therefore, I have decided to introduce a certification

requirement with clear rules on timing and content of the certificates,

so that the customer will give a certificate to the seller, indicating

how he or she intends to use the building. That removes that

uncertainty for the seller. If further work needs to be done to ensure

that it works properly, there are always the guidance notes. I stress

again that we want to get it right.</div>

<a name="06051145000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another issue that emerged in

the consultation is that when businesses opt to tax, they have to check

whether the land is exempt. However, they have to go all the way back

to 1 August 1989, which is quite a long way. I was asked whether that

was fair or reasonable. Because it is a fixed date, I cannot change it;

to do so would involve retrospection, and I am sure that Opposition

Members would have something to say about that. None the less, such a

period of look-back is difficult, so I propose limiting it to 10 years.

If the hon. Member for Rayleigh wonders where that figure comes from,

my officials advise me that it is the period of adjustment under the

capital goods scheme. It works well for that scheme, and it seems

sensible to adopt it. Those were the major points from the

consultation.</div> <a name="06051145000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">In

answer to the hon. Member for Braintree(Mr. Newmark), he can

see that certification could help small businesses enormously, because

if there was any question the Department would go to the buyer, not the

seller. I promised that I would give way to the hon. Gentleman; if I

have not answered his questions, I can do so

now.</div><a name="06051145000161"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051145000294"></a>Mr.

Newmark:</b> I am always encouraged when the Paymaster General

tries to answer my questions. Unfortunately, I have to go back a bit.

She said that the purpose was to rewrite schedule 10. As I see from the

explanatory notes, and to reiterate a point made by my hon. Friend the

Member for Rayleigh, the purpose of rewriting the schedule is to make

its language clearer and easier to use. Once again, I reflect on the

comments of the Chartered Institute of Taxation and its concern about

the impact that the changes will have on lay persons. I want an

assurance from the right hon. Lady that the changes will be in a format

that is clearer and easier to

use.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column101" />Column number: 102</div><a name="06051145000162"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051145000295"></a>Dawn

Primarolo:</b> I assure the hon. Gentleman that it is being

done. I am struggling with the idea that the bedtime reading of

citizens of the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland might be schedule

10 to the 1994 Act on land and property options. Who knows? I

would prefer something slightly lighter at that timeof

day.</div> <a name="06051145000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.

Gentleman is in danger of over-egging the pudding. I doubt whether the

Chartered Institute of Taxation would put it that strongly. It knows

full well who will use it. The tax law rewrite was established by a

previous Government, it has proceeded under the present Government, and

it is widely welcomed as delivering precisely the point that the hon.

Gentleman now makes. He may remember that rather a lot of legislation

is affected by the

rewrite.</div><a name="06051145000164"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051145000296"></a>Mr.

Francois:</b> My hon. Friend the Member for Braintree said

that the British Property Federation still had some concerns. In

fairness, the Paymaster General has given some thorough answers, for

which I am grateful. However, the federation has one outstanding

question on the definition of beneficial ownership of land and

buildings. As the right hon. Lady will know, beneficial ownership is

not always the same as the physical ownership of the land itself. It is

a technical point, which follows from a High Court case Abbey National

plc <i class="I">v</i>. Commissioners of Customs and Excise in 2005. We have

Treasury questions in the Chamber in a few minutes, so perhaps it would

be sensible if, rather than reading all of this into the record, I were

to write to the right hon. Lady so that she could look into the

matter.</div> <a name="06051145000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,

because the order will, rightly, be subject to affirmative resolution,

and because it will come into effect on 1 October, I take it that we

will pass that affirmative resolution before the House rises for the

summer recess and that, no doubt, the Paymaster General and I will be

involved in debating it. Can she confirm

that?</div><a name="06051145000166"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051145000297"></a>Dawn

Primarolo:</b> On the question of further observations from

the British Property Federation, I am happy for the hon. Gentleman to

write to me. I will ensure that my officials chase up any issues that

need to be pursued. As to the date on which the order will be debated,

it will not, alas, be fixed for the convenience of my diary or that of

the hon. Gentleman, but will be set by negotiations through the usual

channels. Clearly, the sooner we discuss the order the better. However,

I also want to be sure to leave ample time for all those who have been

consulted to express their views and to digest the way in which the

that since 1999 the UK has charged VAT at 5 per cent. on the sale of

works of art that are held in a temporary import regime, and also on

the auctioneers&#146; commissions that are associated with them.

However, the European Commission challenged that procedure under the

auspices of the so-called second simplification

directive&#151;something with which I am sure that the hon. Member

for Wolverhampton, South-West is very familiar&#151;arguing that the

auctioneer&#146;s commission should be standard rated at 17.5 per

cent. For the record, the UK Government challenged that interpretation,

and the Commission referred the matter to the European Court of Justice

for determination in 2002. In February 2005, Advocate-General Kokott of

the ECJ delivered her opinion in favour of the Commission, and that was

upheld by the Court in the spring of this year, necessitating the

change that we are

discussing.</div><a name="06051145000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the

explanatory notes to the Bill point

out:</div><a name="06051145000199"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Buyers

premium, a commission charged to the purchaser of goods at auction,

will now attract VAT at the standard rate where the goods are within a

temporary importation regime when sold and are subsequently finally

imported into the European

Union.&#148;</div><a name="06051145000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">Unfortunately,

some elements of the press have reported that as meaning that the

standard rate of VAT will be levied on the imported objects themselves

as well as on the buyer&#146;s premium. My understanding, following

consultation with representatives of the British art market, is that

that is erroneous; the judgment applies only to the buyer&#146;s

premium. The confusion arose partly because there was some ambiguity in

the judgment, which allowed room for doubt.</div>

<a name="06051145000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">My interpretation is that

buyers on the London market will continue to pay 5 per cent. VAT on the

hammer price of objects held within the temporary import regime, and

will pay 17.5 per cent. only on the auctioneer&#146;s commission.

That can vary, but it is usually between 12 per cent. and 20 per cent.

of the hammer price of an object. It would provide welcome reassurance

both for potential buyers and for practitioners in the market if the

Paymaster General were to make it clear beyond peradventure that that

is

correct.</div>

am</div><a name="06051145000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">We then have an

issue about the time at which the measure should come into effect,

which takes us to the heart of amendment No. 2. The changes are

envisaged to take place via an order under clause 18(4) which states

that that order should come into effect</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column103" />Column number: 104</div><a name="06051145000200"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;on such day as the Treasury may by

order made by statutory instrument

appoint.&#148;</div><a name="06051145000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand

that the implementation date has been a matter of some discussion

between the market, its representatives, HMRC officials and in

particular the British Art Market Federation which speaks principally

for the industry on this issue. Among its constituent bodies are the

Antiquities Dealers Association, Bonhams, Christie&#146;s, the

Association of Art and Antique Dealers, the Society of Fine Art

Auctioneers and Valuers, the Society of London Art Dealers and

Sotheby&#146;s.</div><a name="06051145000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

BAMF was keen for me to stress this afternoon the constructive dialogue

that it has had with the Paymaster General&#146;s officials on this

matter and that they are grateful for the time and trouble to which

those officials have gone. They wanted me to place that on the record,

which I am happy to

do.</div><a name="06051145000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">The key point,

however, is that the market is seasonal, so it is important that the

change should not be brought in mid-season. That could have an

unsettling effect, as Anthony Browne, the chairman of the BAMF,

explained in a letter to me. He

wrote:</div><a name="06051145000201"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The

changes require primary legislation and we have discussed the changes

with HMRC. The implementation date for the change is a crucial factor

for the market, since the judgement requires changes to computer

systems, contracts and catalogue rubric. The EC expects rapid

compliance with the judgement and we have been told that the latest

date for implementation is 1st September

2006.&#148;</div><a name="06051145000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">Mr. Browne

continued:</div><a name="06051145000202"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This

date seems appropriate if, as we have been told, we cannot delay until

1st January 2007. An introduction date between the two would be likely

to cause more confusion than it would be worth, since it would involve

changing the rules during one of the busiest times of the year for the

art market.&#148;</div><a name="06051145000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">That seems

to be a reasonable point and I am happy therefore to put it to the

Paymaster General. On that basis, is she prepared to accept our

amendment? It would not obstruct the court, but merely allow time for

the UK market to adjust. Alternatively, if she is not minded to accept

the amendment, which specifies 1 September 2006, will she explain her

rationale and perhaps offer an alternative implementation date, if that

is what she has in

mind.</div><a name="06051145000182"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051145000299"></a>Rob

Marris:</b> I congratulate the hon. Member for Rayleigh on

speaking well and cogently. I like it when, while discussing the

Finance Bill, we get occasional flashes of politics. Earlier this

morning, we debated Government amendment No. 1 on VAT and now we are

debating amendment No. 2. I may stand to be corrected, but it strikes

me from the numbering that the most important thing that the

Conservative party have locked on to is the date of implementation of

those VAT changes on imported works of art. I recognise that the London

art market is important, but it does not play huge around the country.

It is not a huge issue in Wolverhampton, South-West, yet it appears to

be their No. 1 priority.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column104" />Column number: 105</div><a name="06051145000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">That appears to be the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051145000302"></a>Julia

the substance of the clause is sensible&#151; compliance with the

European Court of Justice 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column105" />Column number: 106</div>ruling&#151;however, there is a great degree of sense to the

amendment. It reflects the seasonality of the art market and would

allow time for people and the market to adjust before implementation.

We will support the

amendment.</div><a name="06051145000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">Debate
