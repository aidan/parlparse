<H4><center>New Clause 15</center></H4>
<H4><center>Detention of Girls Under 18</center></H4>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`An offender who is convicted of any offence punishable with 
detention and who is a girl under the age of 18 shall be kept separate 
from adults and shall be detained in a separate institution, or in a 
separate part of an institution also holding adults, unless, after 
assessment and in exceptional circumstances, it is held to be in the 
best interests of the offender to be held with adults for a temporary 
period.'. [Mr. Allan.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Brought up, and read the First time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Allan </B>(Sheffield, Hallam): I beg to move, 
That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
The principal purpose of the new clause is to make it 
unlawful for girls under 18 to be held with adults in prison 
except in the most exceptional circumstances. It is 
necessary to bring Britain into line with the United 
Nations convention on the rights of the child, article 37 
of which deals with this issue. We recognise that the 
Government entered a reservation about exceptional 
circumstances, but we believe it is now time to take the 
issue forward.
<P>
In some senses, we rehearsed this debate when we 
discussed previous amendments on 15 and 16-year-old 
boys being held in Prison Service institutions. However, 
there are differences for women under the age of 18. The 
first is the numbers involved. Between 60 and 80 were in 
the system at any one time in 1997, with a total of 300 
held in custody over the year. The smaller number of girls 
held in detention means that the Government would be 
able to achieve the goal of removing them from the Prison 
Service system.
<P>
Specific young offenders institutions are not available 
for women in the same way as they are for men. Young 
women offenders are put into women's prisons and are 
not held in separate institutions for young offenders. 
Again, that is because of the numbers of involved.
<P>
I refer the Committee to the excellent report "Lost 
Inside" that was produced by the Howard League and 
Baroness Masham of Ilton. It highlighted many of the 
issues relating to the position of young women in prison 
and it interviewed a prison officer who said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Prison doesn't deter them. When they leave here they have a 
criminal record so employment is impossible for them and mostly 
they will only have a hostel to go to where they'll get little support. 
If they have a drug problem they will go back to shoplifting or 
prostitution to fund the drug habit. It's a circle. It's sad. They don't 
know any other life."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>

<P>
Such testimony from those involved in the system shows 
the extent to which it does not serve the wider public or 
girls under 18.
<P>
We hope that the Government will make a commitment 
to holding such women in local authority secure 
accommodation. That is far more appropriate except for 
the most severe offences. Occasionally serious crimes will 
require a prison sentence, but most girls are convicted of 
ordinary, run-of-the-mill offences. Local authority secure 
accommodation is most appropriate for them.
<P>
I also refer the Committee to the thematic report on 
young prisoners, which was conducted by the chief 
inspector of prisons, Sir David Ramsbotham. He 
expressed grave concerns about putting youngsters into 
main Prison Service institutions and wished to see 
separate institutions set up.
<P>
Amazing problems are caused by the mixing of adult 
and juvenile prisoners. For example, the Howard League 
came across a 15-year-old who was placed in a cell next 
to a woman convicted of procuring 15-year-olds for 
prostitution. Such coincidences are unfortunate, but they 
are inevitable if the mixing of adult and juvenile prisoners 
takes place.
<P>
The new clause would make it clear that young women 
should be taken out of Prison Service institutions.
I understand the Government's reservations about similar 
proposals for young males; they did not want to accept a 
provision that they could not deliver. However, a small 
number of young women would be covered by the new 
clause, so it outlines an achievable goal. It would enable the 
Government to tackle the issue and they would receive 
widespread praise if they accepted it.



<P>
<B>Mr. James Clappison </B>(Hertsmere): It is well worth 
discussing this subject. It is important to bear in mind that 
the new clause covers the detention of girls aged 15, 16 
or 17, and would prevent them being kept in prison 
alongside adult offenders. By now, the Committee will be 
well aware of the Opposition's views about mixing the 
age ranges; our views apply to young women as well as 
to young men. We have advanced strong arguments that 
15 or 16-year-old young men, or boys, should not be held 
on remand in adult prisons. The same arguments would 
apply to young women.
<P>
We should take the issue seriously. It has often been 
said, under Governments of all political complexions, that 
young girls look up to older women, who mother them 
while they are in prison. The hon. Member for Sheffield, 
Hallam (Mr. Allan) gave an example from the Howard 
League report of a 15-year-old girl who was put in a cell 
next to a woman whose offence was the procurement of 
15-year-olds for prostitution. That example illustrates the 
argument.
<P>
We should debate the matter to consider how we might 
deal better with young women who are in need of secure 
accommodation. That brings us back to the question of 
the availability of local authority secure accommodation 
as an alternative to prison. Again, the Committee wil be 
well aware of the views of Conservative Members on 
that subject.
<P>
<B></B><P>
The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the 
Home Department (Mr. Mike O' Brien): As the hon. 
Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison) has rightly 
pointed out, this is a serious issue and I have some 
sympathy with the anxieties expressed by the hon. 
Member for Hallam.
<P>
On the face of it, the notion of detaining vulnerable 
young girls with hardened adult prisoners seems 
unacceptable. If all under-18s were vulnerable and all 
over-18s were hardened criminals, we should certainly 
need to ensure that they were not held together. However, 
as we know, the world is not like that. We should 
remember that important point and keep it in the 
forefronts of our minds when considering the proposal.
<P>
The real issue for the Prison Service is to minimise the 
risks of holding vulnerable prisoners with those who 
might have a negative influence on them. We are all 
aware that neither vulnerability nor negative influence are 
absolutely correlated with age. We must be careful to 
ensure that we do not inadvertently put in place, for 
apparently good reasons, what might turn out to be 
impractical and possibly arbitrary cut-offs that adversely 
affect those we want to help.
<P>
The new clause covers two issues: first, that of 
accommodation and, secondly, that of mixing offenders 
of different ages during activities. The root of the problem 
is the small number of girls aged under 18 that the Prison 
Service has to deal with. There were only 91 such girls 
within the Prison Service estate at the end of March this 
year. They are, therefore, a minority, wherever they are 
placed. However, we are duty bound to do our best for 
such girls under the circumstances.
<P>
The Prison Service is currently considering the possible 
solutions to the problem. There are a number of 
alternatives. The first alternative is to create a separate 
secure estate specifically for juvenile females that would 
parallel that being planned for juvenile boys. A population 
of about 91 girls might justify the establishment of only 
two separate units. Such units could well be of a suitable 
size to provide effectively the range of programmes that 
might be required under the proposed detention and 
training order. That is the plus side.
<P>
The down side is that the establishment of only two 
units would separate many of these girls from the valuable 
support of their families. As the hon. Member for Hallam 
will know, the Select Committee on Home Affairs, in its 
report on juvenile crime, pointed out that contact with 
families is very important in reducing the likelihood of 
the offender re-offending in the future, when he or she 
leaves custody.
<P>
The two units would probably have to be placed so that 
there was one in the north and one in the south of the 
country. With only two units there would be no possibility 
of the girls moving to open conditions as part of their 
preparation for release, as is possible at present. Those are 
two serious down sides, which make the creation of two 
sites one in the north and one in the south 
unacceptable.



<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I understand that Lord Williams of Mostyn 
announced in another place that the Government's policy 
was to set up two units one at HMP New Hall, near 
Wakefield, and the other at Holloway.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I shall come on to our planned approach 
to that. The hon. Gentleman seemed to be talking about 
different institutions, but the setting up of units is also 
being considered.
<P>
Another option would be a single juvenile estate, for 
both sexes. The advantage would be that a larger estate 
would overcome the geographical problems I mentioned 
and allow effective remedial programmes to be provided. 
However it would entail problems. The mixing of boys 
and girls in regime activities might raise more difficulties 
than mixing girls and women would particularly, 
perhaps, in cases where there had been sexual abuse. 
Girls' needs might be more akin to those of women than 
those of boys. That solution would therefore not be ideal.
<P>
A further option would be to make use of the secure 
training centres, when those became available, or local 
authority secure accommodation. The first secure training 
centre came on stream in April. Both options raise the 
issue of capacity. The STC estate will comprise 200 
places when completed and will probably be most suited 
to younger children. The local authority secure estate is 
already used for a number of purposes: welfare cases, 
section 53 custodial sentences and some remands. The 
secure remands that we discussed under clauses 89 and 
90 will make use of those facilities. The question that this 
alternative raises is whether it is right to hold girls who 
are nearly 18, who might be difficult and might have 
convictions for serious offences, with much younger boys 
and girls.
<P>
The last option is to create several separate units to 
accommodate juvenile girls in the women's prison estate, 
and to ensure that any mixing of regime activities is 
closely monitored and controlled and is in the best 
interests of all concerned.
<P>
The issues are difficult. I am sure that we will all have 
the interests of juvenile girls at heart in trying to resolve 
them. However, the upshot is that there is not at present 
a simple answer; the new clause would make the situation 
worse by restricting the options even further.
<P>
One of the strengths of the proposed detention and 
training order is the built-in flexibility. The ability to place 
offenders in custodial facilities best suited to their needs 
is a feature of the new arrangements. The proposed new 
clause would restrict how the new order might operate in 
practice, as it would require a girl serving a detention and 
training order to be transferred to adult facilities on 
reaching 18. That would necessarily interfere with the 
purpose of such a sentence, which is not what the 
Government would want.
<P>
We must also remember that there are those who may 
need to be accommodated elsewhere. Within the small 
population of female under-18-year-olds that we are 
concerned with, there are some girls who may pose a 
particular risk to the rest. They have to be accommodated 
somewhere and allowed to associate, but it may not be 
appropriate to house them with other under-18s. Section 
1C of the Criminal Justice Act 1982 allows, on a 
case-by-case basis, for named juveniles to be sent to
a prison rather than a young offenders institution for a 
specified reason. Placement in a mother and baby unit 
is one acceptable reason, as is the need for medical or 
psychiatric care.



<P>
The Prison Service has a responsibility to protect young 
and vulnerable prisoners from detrimental influences, but 
it also has a duty to look after all prisoners with humanity 
and to help them to lead useful and law-abiding lives in custody and after release. If the service is to achieve those 
aims, all prisoners must have access to meaningful 
activity, such as education or training and appropriate 
programmes to help them address their offending 
behaviour.
<P>
As I have said, the question of how best to meet the 
needs of young offenders is complex and there is no 
quick-fix solution. The hon. Member for Hallam has 
already warned of the dangers of quick-fix solutions. If 
we supported the clause we would be in danger of 
thinking that there was a quick-fix solution when there 
is not.
<P>
There are very small numbers of sentenced under-18s 
in women's prisons. The average number at any one time 
is around 90. The need for these girls to be near their 
families has to be balanced with the need to be with others 
of their own age. Work is in hand to address the issues of 
age mixing in female prisons and the regimes provided 
for these young offenders.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
The Government, when debating this issue in the other 
place, promised to report back to Parliament on progress 
when the new detention and training order was 
implemented, and this will be done. In the mean time, a 
considerable amount has been achieved by the Prison 
Service in separating those sentenced to detention in a 
young offender institution from those over 21.
<P>
A framework for enhancing the regimes for women and 
female young offenders in prison is part of the major 
initiative on regimes being undertaken by the Prison 
Service this year. The impetus for this work has come 
from a number of sources, not least from the strongly held 
belief shared by the Prison Service and the Government 
that custodial sentences are not an end in themselves but 
can make a real difference to the offender and to the 
public. The aim is to provide positive and constructive 
regimes which prevent offending.
<P>
Again, I fully understand and share the concern 
expressed by the hon. Members for Hallam and for 
Hertsmere and those in the other place about the 
inappropriate mixing of vulnerable female prisoners with 
other female prisoners who might have a negative impact 
on them. However, I feel that the arrangements we are 
seeking to put in place will provide sufficient flexibility 
to allow us to continue to work toward addressing the 
issues. I must stress that I recognise that we are not there 
yet. We still have a way to go.
<P>
While I can endorse the concern about the need to 
separate under-18s from women who may have an 
adverse influence on them, we need to ensure that we do 
not undermine the flexibility that can enable us to address 
the real problem of the under-18 females, both through 
our review of juvenile secure accommodation and through 
the Prison Service's review of its policy on age mixing. 
Therefore, I do not believe that the amendment is either 
necessary at this stage or the best way to address the needs 
of vulnerable female prisoners.
<P>
I hope that I have set out clearly the Government's 
position, and that in the light of what I have said, the hon. 
Member will not seek to press the new clause.

<P>

<B></B><P>
Mr. Allan: I am grateful to the Minister for his 
courteous reply and in particular for two factors that he 
brought out: first the Government's intention to report 
back on this issue and secondly their open recognition that 
not all the work has been done. The issue is a growing 
difficulty. The Minister said that 90 offenders in this 
category were in prison at any one time. My 
understanding is that in 1992 that figure was more like 
25. Clearly the number of young women being sentenced 
to custodial sentence is growing all the time.
<P>
Some of the measures in the Bill may drop the lower 
age limit down to 12 for detention and training orders, for 
example. It will continue to be an issue that need urgent 
attention. We are assured that the Government have 
recognised that. I am particularly encouraged that the 
Minister has recognised regimes as a critical aspect. Our 
principal concern is that the regimes in adult prison are 
frequently unsuitable for these offenders who need a 
fundamentally different regime. The experience for young 
boys, even those held in segregated units within adult 
prisons, has not always been as positive as it might have 
been.
<P>
We are encouraged that the Government are looking at 
the problem. We will continue to hold a close watching 
brief on this and look forward to reports from the 
Government and particularly from the chief inspector of 
prisons, who has done a tremendous job of demonstrating 
how an independent inspectorate can truly be independent 
and can make a critical response if it feels it is necessary. 
Other important new clauses in which we have a serious 
interest are coming along, so I shall not be seeking to 
press this one to a vote. I beg to ask leave to withdraw 
the motion.
<P>
Motion and clause, by leave, withdrawn.
<H4><center>New Clause 17</center></H4>
<H4><center>Increase in sentences for aggravation based on sexual </center></H4>
orientation (No. 2)'
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(1) This section applies where a court is considering the 
seriousness of any offence.
<P>
(2) If the offence was aggravated for the purposes of this section, 
the court 
<P>

towards members of a group based on their sexual 
orientation or based on their membership of, or association 
with, such a group.'. [Mr. Allan]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Brought up, and read the First time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a 
Second time.
<P>
There are three areas that I should like to cover in 
setting out the reasoning for the new clause. We should 
like to spend a little time on it, as it is important.
<P>
First, I wish to examine the background and why the 
clause is necessary at this time. Secondly, I will talk about 
the phrasing of the new clause and how it would fit into 
the Bill. Thirdly, I will refer to august and learned support 
for the changes that we are proposing.
<P>
A survey by the Stonewall group entitled "Queer 
Bashing"  covers the background to the new clause. I will 
quote some of that report's key findings and examine 
some of the examples given in it.
<P>
The most important finding of the report which was 
a comprehensive survey covering a several thousand 
people was that one in three men and one in four women 
have experienced some form of violence. Those figures 
will shock anyone who comes across them. Thirty-two per 
cent. of those surveyed had been harassed in some way 
and 73 per cent. had been verbally abused. They felt that 
that was as a result of their sexuality and was because of 
what they were.
<P>
I will quote some examples from the survey that are 
relevant to our debate. The first concerns a lesbian from 
Yorkshire who went to Ripon for the weekend with her 
lover. She says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"we went out for a meal. We passed two lads sitting on a wall. 
Shortly after, we retraced our steps. . . The guys started shouting at 
us. . . One of the men came running after us . . . He kicked my lover 
in the back of the head.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We ran across the road to the pub for refuge. We went to the bar 
and ordered a drink then they came in, pushed us to the ground, 
all the time kicking and punching and they started to drag us out of 
the pub." <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The victim was unable to see what was happening because 
her jacket had been pulled over her head. She remembers:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"I was in the pub doorway holding onto my lover's legs. Her head 
was on the pavement. I covered her body with mine . . . We ran . . . 
to the house we were staying in. During the fumbling for the key, 
one of the men came running down and continued to kick and 
punch us." <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Fortunately, the women got into the house, and called the 
police. Both of the men involved were arrested. the 
victim says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"I got over my physical injuries within about a week but the metal 
stress caused is still there although I do feel much better.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>It's the fourth time I've been queerbashed since I came out in 
1980." <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The mental scars remain with individuals who are 
assaulted in such cases. Their sexuality will not change, 
so they know that every time they are in a similar situation 
they will be exposed to similar dangers. The new clause 
addresses that issue. It would ensure that, in addition to 
physical assault, mental anguish is recognised in open 
court.

<P>
My second example deals with people who are harassed 
in their flats and who are forced to move on. It concerns 
a gay man and his lover who live in a flat in south-west 
Britain. He says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"A group of local boys, aged 16-20, took great pleasure in hurling 
abuse every time myself or my partner left our flat. On several 
occasions objects were thrown at us, including tomatoes and stones. 
Windows were broken and graffiti was written on the block we 
lived in." <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
On another occasion the man remembers being
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"jumped by three lads, one wielding a snooker cue. I was badly 
injured resulting in hospital treatment and time off work. The 
incident was reported to the police but nothing ever came of it. They 
were in fact very helpful and sympathetic, but because I couldn't 
give descriptionsthey were powerless." 
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The man continues,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Most of the physical scars have gone, except for a few on my 
face, but it still haunts me to this day." <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I hope that the Bill will provide some remedy for such 
situations through the anti-social behaviour orders. I was 
pleased that in an earlier debate Ministers clarified the 
fact that the orders are intended to provide protection for 
those who are picked on because of what they are, and 
are not meant to be used to victimise such people.
<P>
We believe that offences that involve assault and 
criminal damage as in the tales that I have just recited 
should be tried in court, regardless of any order that is 
issued. New clause 17 would come into play when such 
offences came to court.
<P>
The Government's official position on attacks is 
crucial. My hon. Friend the Member for Southwark, North 
and Bermondsey (Mr. Hughes) asked questions about this 
issue on 22 April 1998. The Minister of State's response 
was:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"From the information collected centrally, it is not possible to 
determine offences or incidents of homophobic crime"  [Official 
Report, 22 April 1998; Vol. 310, c. 636.]
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
which is one of the key issues addressed in subsection 
(2)(b) of the new clause. It is a serious problem when a 
Minister of the Crown, responsible for the oversight of 
the criminal justice system, is unable to provide the 
figures because the criminal justice system does not make 
provision for such information always and consistently to 
be taken into account when courts consider relevant 
crimes. We are keen to ensure that whenever a crime has 
a homophobic element, an open declaration of that fact is 
made in court. We feel that the climate is right, with a new 
Government formed by a party that has long professed an 
interest in promoting tolerance and fighting bigotry. We 
recognise shared objectives in that respect, which is why 
it is appropriate to bring the proposal forward when the 
Government are taking action elsewhere against 
intolerance as in the race clause in the Bill.
<P>
We also recognise that even the Conservative party has 
now come out as a champion of equality and an enemy 
of bigotry. We were particularly impressed by the 
comments of the former right hon. Member for Enfield, 
Southgate at the Conservative party conference, which 
took us some way forward. We may hear from his 
successor, the hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate
(Mr. Twigg) later in the debate. However, we are not 
merely trying to test the Government or force them in a 
macho way to adopt our proposals and claim a victory: 
we genuinely want to achieve a step forward on the issue. 
It is not a partisan, point-scoring issue: we want to achieve 
a result.



<P>
The new clause is phrased with great care so as not to 
dilute the excellent provisions elsewhere in the Bill for 
dealing with racially motivated offences. We considered 
whether to replicate the wording of the race provisions 
exactly but decided that that would not be helpful. We 
thus considered the other avenue of what happens in the 
court process.
<P>
We were pleased to contribute to expanding the scope 
of racially motivated offences when my noble Friend
Lord Dholakia persuaded the Government to accept an 
amendment on racially motivated criminal damage. As I 
said, we are in no way seeking to dilute such provisions; 
we want only to provide the prosecutor with a vital new 
tool in dealing with homophobic offences.
We considered other groups that may suffer from 
intolerance and bigotry, but rejected the option of 
expanding the provisions more widely. I know that if a 
provision is expanded widely enough, it can cease to have 
any meaning whatever. However, in view of the evidence 
from Stonewall and others, there is a specific and defined 
problem of homophobic incidents, which can be tackled 
through legislation. Many thousands of our fellow citizens 
have direct and painful experience of the problem.
<P>
As I have said, the solution to the problem need not 
dilute other provisions. Giving the prosecutor a tool to use 
in an offence of this kind will not detract from the fact 
that he has a different tool to use in a racially motivated 
offence. There will not be much crossover. The Crown 
Prosecution Service will be dealing with a particular 
offence, and if a prosecutor is dealing with a homophobic 
crime he will be able to use the new tool provided in the 
new clause.
<P>
 I said earlier that I wanted to quote from an august and 
learned source in support of our proposals. I wish to cite 
the current Home Secretary who wrote the foreword to 
the book on queer bashing and is explicit on the 
seriousness of the problem. He states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The violence and fear to which gay people are subject is 
something which diminishes us all." <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He also rightly said that it is not just a matter of law and 
order, but about underlying barriers of discrimination. He 
also made a useful speech to Stonewall on the eve of the 
general election last year. He launched the survey and I 
support the sentiments that he expressed. He said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"If we want to be tough on discrimination we have to be tough 
on crime too." <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He pointed out that the poor, those from ethnic minorities 
and those who appear to have different life styles, such as 
gay and lesbian people, are more likely to be victims of 
crime than the general population.
<P>
The Home Secretary added:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"As Stonewall's survey shows, only too graphically" 
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
similar gangs to those who attacked Stephen Lawrence in 
the most tragic circumstances in London
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"have gone in for `queer bashing' and in some cases their victims 
too have been left for dead. Often, it starts in an apparently small 
way, with bullying. They begin with taunts and insults. They 
graduate to graffiti and criminal damage. Then, as they discover just 
how ineffective the law is in dealing with `lower level' disorder, 
they become intoxicated with the power they have over the 
community...It is why we are committed to a strategy of `zero 
tolerance', to make the streets safe for everyone, regardless of the 
colour of their skin or their sexual preference." <P>

<P>

<B>Mr. Edward Leigh </B>(Gainsborough): I am listening 
with interest. Anybody who beats someone up because of 
his or her sexual orientation does something that is very wicked. However, anybody who beats someone up for any 
reason does something very wicked. It is wicked to beat 
people up because they are old, frail, have money or 
because they are black, brown, Protestant or whatever. 
How does one differentiate between the various 
motivations? They are all, by their very nature, equally 
wicked.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I do not disagree with the hon. Gentleman's 
sentiments about the difficulties involved in defining 
levels of wickedness. There are two ways in which a court 
can pass judgment on a crime. The first is to consider the 
individual circumstances and pass a sentence relative to 
them. For example, if an elderly person were beaten in 
the most heinous circumstances, every normal court in the 
land would consider the victim, the assailant and the 
nature of the assault and pass a heavier sentence.
<P>
The second approach is to have enshrined in legislation 
particular offences or particular directions to courts that 
cover categories of people. Categories of people should 
be covered when two clear criteria are established. The 
first is that there is evidence that that category of people 
is regularly offended against purely and simply on the 
basis of what they are. Older people who are assaulted by 
muggers are not necessarily assaulted because they are 
old; they are assaulted because they are weak and the 
mugger wants to target a weak person.
<P>
The new clause makes it clear that hatred must be 
expressed at the time of the offence. It would not be a 
matter of guesswork. Assailants would make it clear that 
they are assaulting someone because he or she is queer or 
is black. Such offences take place and the categories of 
people involved can be clearly defined.
<P>
The second crucial criterion is based on the fact that 
public policy should send out a message to the victims 
in particular. Such crimes are drastically under-reported 
and it is crucial that all our citizens, no matter what their 
background, have confidence in the criminal justice 
system. One way of doing that is to make it clear that if 
such offences are taken to court, a statement will be made 
in open court. Whatever the sentence imposed, a 
statement will be made to show that it was a crime of 
bigotry and of hatred.
<P>
The new clause passes those tests. We considered 
expanding its scope to cover other groups; religious 
groups would pass similar tests and we are still 
considering tabling provisions for them. The community 
covered by the new clause passes the criteria that I have 
set out. It requires protection and it must have confidence 
in the criminal justice system. We welcome the interest 
that the Home Secretary has shown and the fact that he 
quite properly bracketed that community with other 
groups who suffer similar violence from frequently the 
same bigots.
<P>
I believe that I have established that the new clause is 
sufficiently tightly drawn to deal with the problem. The 
thinking of the Minister's boss is in line with the 
sentiments that I have expressed. I am confident that the 
Minister will not reject our concerns out of hand even 
though I know that he has expressed fears about the 
workability of the new clause.
<P>
Rejection out of hand would be most unfortunate, so 
we look for the following responses from the Minister. 
The most felicitous outcome would be if the Minister could accept that the new clause is appropriate to be added 
to the Bill. We can give him a categorical assurance that 
we will not attack him for U-turning on this. In the great 
traditions of parliamentary democracy and as Ministers 
before him have frequently done, he can safely add an 
Opposition new clause to the Bill simply because it is 
right.
<P>
If he is not prepared to accept the new clause now, we 
hope that he can tell us of some future plan to deal with the 
issue, which recognises that the issue is serious and looks at 
the workings of the new race provisions and how those pan 
with the CPS and the police. If he argued that it was 
necessary to see how that worked in practice, assuming that 
the technical difficulties can be overcome, and that in 
principle he would like to make a similar provision, it 
would be a good indication of the Government's absolute 
commitment to fighting intolerance.
<P>
The third area on which I should be pleased to hear 
from the Minister is any other ways in which the 
Government, having accepted the problem, are prepared 
to act on it and to indicate through sentencing guidelines 
or other instructions to the CPS, the courts or the police, 
ways in which they can take the matter forward. The 
police have already published a report on dealing with 
homophobic offence and the gay community in general. 
That has led to some improvements. The chief constable 
in my area, Richard Wells, who is retiring soon, has taken 
that initiative very seriously and there have been some 
good advances. Any other steps that the Minister can tell 
us that the Government are taking or will consider taking 
would be of interest.
<P>
I hope that the Minister is swayed by the argument and 
that we will hear other forceful arguments. I hope that we 
can see some real progress in defending our fellow 
citizens from attacks by outrageous individuals who have 
no more sense than to go out and attack people purely 
because of what they are. That is the crucial difference 
between this and other crimes and we all need to send out 
a firm message about it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I am sure that the hon. Member for Hallam 
is very sincere and I recognise that there is a problem with 
homophobic attacks. However, there is a difficulty with 
the new clause which relates to the question that I put to 
him. Society has always viewed violent attacks against 
particular groups very seriously. If someone comes to a 
court and is charged with a violent offence, the judge and 
the court will have to consider what motivated that 
violence, and particularly whether it was premeditated.
<P>
There are surely two kinds of violence. There is 
violence which is premeditated against a person because 
of the nature of that person or because of what he is doing 
at that time. He may, for example, be carrying money. 
The court would deal seriously with that. Another kind of 
violence is not premeditated such as a fight when an 
argument blows up between friends or people in a pub. 
While a court would also deal seriously with such an 
offence, there might be mitigating factors.



<P>
The problem with the new clause is that it starts to 
promote a particular group in society for protection. All 
groups in society should be protected. Blind people should be protected. Old people should be protected. Religious 
groups should be protected. The nature of our society 
should surely be that we are all equal before the law 
although we are all very different. We have different 
political views in Committee and different convictions 
and different ways of doing things. But the law is blind 
to our differences as individuals.
<P>
The severe difficulty with the new clause is that if the 
hon. Gentleman singles out a group, other groups who 
might feel threatened in particular circumstances will also 
demand protection. The hon. Gentleman might say that 
that was fair enough; that a group might feel threatened 
because of its racial origin. However, other groups of 
which we are not immediately aware might also feel 
threatened. The trouble with picking out a particular group 
is that it results in downgrading the protection that society 
should give to other groups and to the rest of society.
<P>
It is surely better to maintain firmly and clearly that no 
one is to use violence against another member of society 
for whatever reason and that such violence will be dealt 
with severely. The courts should be given full powers to 
deal with that and to impose lengthy sentences. A court 
presumably has the power to deal severely with a person 
whose unpleasant actions are committed not on the spurt 
of the moment, but clearly in a premeditated way, out of 
violent aversion to a section of society. I understand the 
sincerity with which the hon. Member for Hallam moved 
the new clause, but the provision would be dangerous.
<P>
<B></B><P>
Mr. Stephen Twigg (Enfield, Southgate): I congratulate 
the hon. Member for Hallam on bringing this important 
issue before the Committee and taking up the question of 
attacks on people because of their sexuality. It provides an 
opportunity for us to consider the Stonewall report and 
some other evidence, as well as the more general issue of 
hate crimes.
<P>
The Bill has, quite properly, focused on hate crimes of 
a racist nature; our party pledged to do that at the general 
election. However, it is proper now to examine hate 
crimes more widely. I shall not present the evidence, 
because it is well documented and has been set out by the 
hon. Member for Hallam.
<P>
In recent years much progress has been made. The 
police now take queer bashing more seriously than they 
did and the Association of Chief Police Officers recently 
issued guidelines on homophobic attacks. The Committee 
should consider sentencing, as well as the monitoring of 
those crimes. I am not convinced that the new clause 
would necessarily be the most effective approach. I hope 
that the hon. Member for Hallam will not divide the 
Committee on the matter, but I should like an assurance 
from ny hon. Friend the Minister that the Government will 
consider the matter further in the light of our debate.
I should particularly like him to consider whether the 
powers under clause 76 could be used to direct the new 
sentencing advisory panel to issue guidelines on hate 
crimes in general, including homophobic hate crimes. 
That might also permit the issue of religion to be 
considered.

<P>

<B>Mr. Humfrey Malins </B>(Woking): This has been an 
important debate. I respect the views and arguments of 
the hon. Members for Hallam and for Enfield, Southgate (Mr. Twigg). However, although they have rightly 
identified a problem, the suggested solution is 
misconceived. As my hon. Friend the Member for 
Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh) said, judges and other 
sentencers must take into account the factors involved in a 
case. In sentencing, I and anybody else acting in a judicial 
capacity must take on board all the evidence and any 
mitigating factors. Undoubtedly, any judge would take 
into account, as a particularly nasty aspect of a case, the 
type of violence covered by the new clause. That would 
utterly knock out any mitigation. By definition, the crimes 
that we are discussing are premeditated. Courts take those 
issues into account. It would be dangerous to draw up lists 
because others could produce genuine arguments for their 
right to be included in the list. My hon. Friend the 
Member for Gainsborough correctly mentioned attacks on 
blind people and I would add that disabled people might 
also be considered. Although the hon. Member for Hallam 
distinguished those two groups from the cases under 
consideration, when he said that we need to cure the 
mischief of regular attacks on specific groups, such 
distinctions might widen the debate too far.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
There is some anxiety about adding to lists of groups 
who need special protection. Not long ago, in a certain 
part of the country, there was a series of nasty attacks on 
prostitutes, who were attacked because they were 
prostitutes. Courts would obviously take such matters into 
account when sentencing. A premeditated attack on a 
person because of his or her sexuality is particularly 
vicious and all mitigation would be cut away and 
disregarded.
<P>
I respect and understand the arguments advanced by 
hon. Members in support of the new clause, but these 
matters are covered, in practice, by sentencing procedures. 
Furthermore, there is a risk of establishing lists that could 
grow and grow and that would not be satisfactory.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> I join my hon. Friend the Member 
for Enfield, Southgate in congratulating the hon. Member 
for Hallam on his sincere attempt to raise this serious 
problem and on giving the Committee the opportunity to 
debate it.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hallam referred to the document 
published by Stonewall, which deals with queer bashing. 
I, too, read that document with particular interest, bearing 
in mind the Home Secretary's comments on these matters. 
The Government readily acknowledge that attacks on gay 
men and lesbians are a serious cause for concern. I share 
the hon. Member for Hallam's anxiety about such attacks, 
but I am not convinced that the new clause is the way to 
address the problem.
<P>
The gay and lesbian community has come a long way 
in recent years, although its members still have many 
challenges to overcome. The Government want fair 
treatment for gays and lesbians and hon. Members may 
soon have an opportunity to vote on one issue relating to 
that matter, if Madam Speaker allows it. That is the issue 
of bringing equality to the age of consent, at 16, for both 
homosexual and heterosexual conduct. I voted for that on 
a previous occasion and hope to do so again. There will 
be a free vote and I suspect that the House will change 
the law.
<P>
However, the House should not accept the change in 
the law proposed by new clause 17 and I will explain 
why. The new clause is modelled on clause 88, which 
brings into statute the current law on aggravating features 
of a crime of violence or harassment. The subsection on 
which the new clause is modelled makes statutory the 
current position in case law, whereas another part of the 
Bill changes the law by increasing the maximum 
sentences for racial violence and racial harassment. There 
would be a practical effect only if the two provisions were 
taken in conjunction; only then, would there be a change 
in the law.
<P>
The Government are tightly focused on tackling racist 
crime. That is why we want to make case law on racial 
offences statutory and why we have introduced the 
provisions in clauses 25 to 30. Any attack on any person 
damages the health and safety of the community, but it is 
especially damaging when the victim is a member of a 
vulnerable or targeted group; for example, women, 
pensioners or children. There are many problems quite 
apart from whether a person is gay or black. Racial 
attacks, however, tear a hole in the fabric of our 
multiracial society and the Government want to send a 
clear, specific and focused message about racial 
motivation, which is why we included it in the Bill.



<P>
The problem with Governments seeking to send a 
message is that there are always temptations to dilute it. 
There are many deserving causes for which there are good 
arguments for inclusion in the Bill. Our aim is to 
implement our manifesto commitment on racial violence 
and harassment. That derived, in turn, from the Select 
Committee on Home Affairs' inquiry into racial violence. 
I had the privilege of serving on that Committee several 
years ago. It recommended a specific provision on racial 
violence and harassment.
<P>
Throughout the debates of the Select Committee, the 
main argument against having such a tightly focused 
anti-racist message was as rehearsed today others 
would demand equal provision in sentence tariffs and 
other inclusions. It is always difficult to draw the line. 
Why not include victims of religious discrimination, for 
example? Some religious groups have met me and asked 
for inclusion in the Bill. Why should the disabled, for 
example, be excluded when they can be victims of 
harassment and violence?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The hon. Gentleman may have 
referred inadvertently to religious discrimination when he 
probably meant to say religious attacks, which are 
different.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Yes, religious attacks and harassment. 
The same applies to the disabled the blind or people in 
wheelchairs if they are targeted. Should not society 
express its abhorrence of attacks of that nature? What 
about children? Much popular concern is expressed in the 
press and more widely about attacks on the most 
vulnerable people in our society. Should not they be 
included? Should not greater penalties be applied to those 
who commit offences against children?
<P>
Women too are often the victim of assaults and 
harassment simply because the are women. Surely they 
should also be included in the Bill? What of the elderly who often live in fear of violence and harassment from 
young people? Why not include them in the Bill? The 
hon. Member for Hallam tries to deal with the problem 
when he said that the people attacked may happen to be 
elderly, but the fact is that some people are attacked 
simply because they are elderly. It cannot be dismissed so 
easily by saying that they were attacked for money they 
might not have been attacked if they had not been in the 
vulnerable elderly group.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> Does the Minister accept that any 
sentencer in such circumstances would be bound to regard 
the crime as the more culpable because of that fact?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I am coming precisely to that point, if 
the hon. Gentleman will bear with me.
<P>
Members of the Committee will doubtless share the 
concern recently expressed by my right hon. Friend the 
Secretary of State of Health about nurses who were 
assaulted on duty. We could consider other occupations 
focused on caring for the community. Any group sharing 
a common vulnerability could make a case for inclusion. 
Each can make virtually the same argument that they 
suffer from specific injustices, that they are targeted 
because of who or what they are and that to exclude them 
is to ignore or demean the injustices perpetrated against 
them.
<P>
If we included all the groups that I have mentioned and 
the gay community, the only people effectively excluded 
from the Bill would be white heterosexual males aged 
between 18 and 65 not engaged in certain occupations 
a minority of the population who have not yet asked to 
be included in the provisions.
<P>
I do not wish to demean the importance and seriousness 
of the issues. However, we must be clear about what we 
are trying to do, which is send a tightly focused message 
on race crime. I am worried that if we were to expand the 
provisions, it would affect our ability to send that 
message.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I am listening to the Minister's arguments 
with care and interest. I hope that we will move on to 
positive ground in a minute.



<P>
We recognise a fundamental difference between 
individuals' race and sexual orientation and a phase that 
they may be going through. One cannot argue that 
drawing the provision wider to include people because of 
what they are means that groups such as nurses, doctors, 
Members of Parliament and others who are passing 
through a particular phase should be included.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right to some 
extent. I do not think that he would argue that the 
provision should be extended to cover all the groups that 
I have identified. Even if we exclude occupational groups, 
other vulnerable groups still expect the Government to 
take note of them. The Government do recognise them. 
However, we must use the Bill to send a sharply focused 
message on racial violence and harassment.
<P>
The new provisions relating to racial offences are 
intended to protect everyone from racial crime. Anyone 
can be a victim of such crime, which has uniquely 
damaging and divisive effects on our community, on race 
relations and on social cohesion.
<P>
That is the message we wish to send. We cannot afford 
to complicate it if it is to be understood by racist thugs. 
We must ensure that we do not identify black or Asian 
people as the targets of racist offences. We want to protect 
the hon. Gentleman and everyone else from being 
attacked on the grounds of race. I am sure that the gay 
community would want to join the Government in sending 
an undiluted message on racial violence, just as it may 
shortly be able to send a focused message on the law on 
the age of consent.
<P>
It is time for the Government to deal with homophobic 
attacks. In October, the Home Secretary, the Minister of 
State and I launched the report of Her Majesty's 
inspectors of constabulary, which dealt with homophobic 
attacks. It requires the police to liaise with gay and lesbian 
groups on policing matters and on dealing with 
homophobic attacks. Such offences must be investigated 
with sensitivity and with understanding. The report 
received strong support from the Home Secretary and 
from other Ministers and had the full backing of Her 
Majesty's inspectors of constabulary and of chief 
constables across the country.
<P>
The police know that they must deal more sensitively 
with homophobic attacks. The Association of Chief Police 
Officers is currently taking forward guidelines for dealing 
with homophobic incidents. Those guidelines identify 
good practice, such as ensuring that victims of crime are 
dealt with fairly, regardless of their sexual orientation, and 
ensuring that effective means are in place to monitor, 
detect and prevent hate-motivated crime, including 
homophobic crime. The guidelines include a definition of 
what should be regarded as a homophobic incident. That 
definition is as follows:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"any incident which appears either to the victim or to any other 
person including the reporting or investigating officer to be 
motivated by homophobia".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In addition, a national advisory group on policing the 
lesbian and gay communities has been established. It 
includes lesbians and gay men who have experience of 
working with the police, together with police officers who 
work in that area. The group provides for liaison between 
the police and lesbians and gay men at a national level. It 
provides a source of expertise on which all police forces 
can draw and collects, promotes and disseminates 
information of good policing practice. It was consulted on 
the content of the ACPO guidelines to which I have 
referred.
<P>
Change in society can be achieved in many ways. 
Honest and legitimate claims of vulnerable groups can be 
recognised without those claims being included in the 
Bill. Not being included is not equivalent to exclusion. 
That is not the way forward.



<P>
The gay community should not feel excluded by our 
wish to address racism. I hope that the gay community 
will realise that this party has no intention of disregarding 
the need to crack down on homophobic crime, as well as 
on crimes against women, the disabled and other targeted 
vulnerable groups. Seeking to address one issue does not 
suggest a failure to recognise others.
<P>
The essence of the case against new clause 17 is that 
in seeking to amend only an aggravating factor, it misses 
out the central distinction in our changes. In other words, 
it muddies the message without substantially changing the 
law. As the hon. Member for Woking (Mr. Malins) 
acknowledged, the common law currently requires 
aggravating features to be taken into account by judges 
on sentencing. Homophobic attacks are already an 
aggravating feature. The new clause thus achieves nothing 
new while unintentionally muddying the message on race 
and failing to deliver much to the gay community on 
homophobic attacks.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
Clauses 25 to 30 involve changes in the law on race, 
and clause 88 will have a significant impact in relation to 
those other clauses. The combination of those clauses 
sends our message. Clause 88 alone cannot do so because 
it would make little change in itself. Only in conjunction 
with other clauses does it make an impact. Accordingly, 
new clause 17 does little in itself.

<P>

<B>Sir Robert Smith </B>(West Aberdeenshire and 
Kincardine): Does the Minister have any evidence of 
homophobic attacks being regarded as an aggravating 
factor in court sentencing? In considering aggravation, 
surely the courts reflect the prejudices they perceive in 
society. Most courts would perceive that society frowns 
heavily on beating up old ladies. Society is changing 
slowly but social prejudices remain latent and the courts 
may not view homophobic attacks so seriously. Does the 
Minister have evidence to the contrary?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Judges are required to take any 
aggravating features of an offence into account. As the 
hon. Minister for Woking who sits in court cases said, the 
motivation of the perpetrator in committing a homophobic 
offence is surely an aggravating feature. It must be by the 
nature of the offence, just as it was in relation to racial 
crimes. I return to the point that we are achieving progress 
on racial crimes because of the combination of clauses in 
the Bill.
<P>
The penalties for homophobic attacks are the same as 
for attacks on anyone else but in practice the sentence 
for such an attack is likely to be higher because of the 
aggravating feature of homophobia. The penalties are 
already severe, depending on the crime. There is life 
imprisonment for wounding with intent to cause grievous 
bodily harm; actual bodily harm and malicious wounding 
have a maximum of five years; and assaults face a 
maximum of six months or a fine of 5,000.
<P>
Admittedly the sentences for racist offences will be 
raised, but if new clause 17 is rejected the maximum 
penalties for homophobic attacks will remain in equality 
with those for the vast majority of the population. Gays 
will not regret achieving such equality: their case has 
always been to demand equality rather than special 
treatment.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hallam and my hon. Friend the 
Member for Enfield, Southgate also asked me whether it 
would be appropriate to look not only at homophobic 
attacks but at religious attacks and harassment, perhaps through the new sentencing advisory panel. Yes, these are 
the sorts of issue that could well be considered at a later 
stage once we know how the new offences relating to 
racial harassment and violence operate. That will give us 
some guidance.
<P>
If we pass the Bill unamended now a clear message 
will be sent to racists. Once we have had advice on 
sentencing it might be appropriate to consider whether 
these or different provisions may be needed to address 
other issues and other vulnerable groups. It would be 
unfortunate to divide the Committee on the new clause as 
it would not send the right message to the gay and lesbian 
community. The message the Committee would want to 
send is that we all take the issue very seriously. The 
Government intend to take it seriously and will do so in 
various different ways, including implementing some of 
the policies that we have already set out in relation to the 
police and homophobic attacks.
<P>
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the new 
clause. I have given him some reassurances about our 
intention to tackle homophobic attacks, particularly their 
investigation. I have also said that we do not close our 
minds to doing something on this issue in the future but I 
suspect that this is neither the Bill nor the clause that 
would make the difference that he seeks.



<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I listened carefully to the Minister's 
full and detailed response. I appreciate that he went to 
some lengths. The longer I heard him, the more I came to 
the conclusion that the Government have a problem 
arising out of the way in which they have approached the 
question of racial attacks, which we all deplore and about 
which we are all determined to send a signal. The 
problem, and the new clause is evidence of that, is that 
sending out a signal about racial attacks and extra 
sentences for racial offences as an aggravating feature 
within legislation is all very well but we then have all the 
other groups who come along.
<P>
The new clause relates to gays and lesbians and no 
doubt other groups will watch proceedings with interest 
too. They will doubtless also ask for similar special 
treatment in legislation. The Government will tell them 
that they will be dealt with on the basis of what was in 
essence the old system, with the particular ingredient of 
the offence being treated as an aggravating feature in 
terms of sentencing under one of the later clauses in the 
Bill. But that will not be entirely satisfactory for the 
various groups who come along. They will seek to be 
recognised, as those subject to racial attacks have been 
recognised, as having a particular problem which they 
wish to have a signal sent out about.
<P>
There is a growing problem for the Government and 
the clause is evidence of it. The religious case which the 
Minister mentioned is a particularly clear example. In the 
minds of many people religious attacks, particularly those 
on certain religious groups, will come very close in the 
factual circumstances to racial attacks. I suspect that we 
shall hear of this problem in future and that the 
Government do not have a solution.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> It has been a useful debate and it was 
interesting to hear the Government set out their position 
at length. I am grateful to the Minister for spending the 
time to do that. The hon. Members for Woking and for 
Gainsboroguh and the Minister himself referred to the 
ability of the courts to use their discretion to deal with 
these issues. My hon. Friend the Member for West 
Aberdeenshire and Kincardine (Sir R. Smith) highlighted 
one of the crucial issues that despite the natural 
sympathy towards elderly people, disabled people and 
some vulnerable groups that is a part of the criminal 
justice system, evidence such as that emerging from the 
Stephen Lawrence inquiry, with respect to black people, 
suggests that that natural sympathy has not always been 
present. The homosexual panic defence used in courts is 
clear evidence of its opposite. It works against gay men, 
by making someone's homosexuality an excuse for an 
offence, instead of a factor to which the court should 
respond in a positive manner.
<P>
I am grateful to the hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate 
for supporting the principle of the new clause and asking 
the Government to consider the matter further. I hope that 
the Minister will agree to keep his door open to me, the 
hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate and the many other 
hon. Members who share our concerns as well as the 
groups that have campaigned on this issue.
<P>
The Bill will make community safety strategies an 
important part of the criminal justice system. In response 
to a written question from my hon. Friend the Member 
for Southwark, North and Bermondsey the Minister of 
State stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Consultation with gay and lesbian groups is recognised as an 
important means by which police officers can gain an understanding 
of the problems and issues that exist for lesbians and gay men", 
[Official Report, 22 April 1998; Vol. 310, c. 638.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Crime audits and community safety strategy 
proposals under the Bill are to be an essential part of that. 
I think that I can prejudge the outcome of some of the 
consultations; I expect the issues that we are considering 
to be raised by many gay and lesbian people.
<P>
If the new strategies are to mean anything, I hope that 
it will be that there will be a path to the Minister's door, 
so that communication form the bottom up, arising from 
many community safety strategies, can feed in, and 
receive an appropriate Government response.



<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> The hon. Member for Hertsmere 
suggested that the Government had a problem over the 
issue that we are discussing, but we do not. We need to 
explain clearly why we take certain action. I remind the 
hon. Gentleman that the Select Committee on Home 
Affairs was dominated by Conservatives when it 
recommended a specific racial harassment and violence 
provision. I remember the report well, and it was 
unanimous. It is true that many attacks on people from 
religious minorities would be caught by the race 
provisions in the relevant clause, as the motivation might 
well really be racial.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Not necessarily.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Not necessarily, but in many instances 
that would apply.
<P>
As to the remarks of the hon. Member for Hallam about 
the absence of natural sympathy in investigations, that is 
precisely why the Association of Chief Police Officers is 
putting forward new guidance. The police are determined 
to tackle the issues, and are not prepared to allow 
prejudice of any sort to cloud investigations. That 
message is, I hope now coming very clearly from Her 
Majesty's inspectorate of constabulary particularly in its 
October report, which we supported.
<P>
We have listened carefully to the point made by the 
hon. Member for Hallam and the concerns of the gay and 
lesbian community about homophobic attacks. We shall 
continue to listen, and to take action whenever we 
consider it appropriate. It is not always possible to 
respond immediately to group's concerns, but we want it 
to be understood that we treat such worries seriously. We 
intend to deal with them, though that may be by means 
other than the new clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I look froward to a continuing dialogue 
with the Minister. As I was about to say, I think that it 
may be ill-advised to divide on the new clause, although 
we shall pay close attention to the Minister's comments 
on Report. I accept that the police are going a long way 
to address the problems, but we need to ensure that the 
Crown Prosecution Service and the courts which are the 
other part of the holy, or unholy, triangle of the criminal 
justice system respond equally well. Many of the cases 
to which we have referred mention the sympathetic 
attitudes of police officers. It is not good the police being 
sympathetic if the homophobic element is not considered 
or pursued when cases are referred to the CPS, or is not 
taken seriously when they come before the courts.
<P>
We have had a useful debate and I hope that it will 
start a dialogue that will produce significant results. The 
Minister has suggested that that is his intention and we 
shall reflect on his words before the next stage of the Bill. 
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.
<P>
Motion and clause, by leave, withdrawn.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a 
Second time.
<P>
The new clause deals with another serious issue that 
should be addressed in the Bill. Many sexual offending 
issues are covered by the Bill, but some issues relating to 
prostitution have been overlooked and are long overdue 
for an overhaul, especially that of pimping in relation to 
younger girls. At present, the law covers girls aged under 
16; it is a specific, prosecutable offence under the Sexual 
Offences Act 1956 for an individual to pimp an under 
16-year-old, but 16 and 17-year-olds are not included. 
Such girls are a vulnerable group: Home Office figures 
show that between 1989 and 1996 there were 2,615 
cautions and 1,880 convictions secured against children 
and young people for offences relating to prostitution. 
However, between 1989 and 1994 there were only six 
convictions against adults for procuring children for the 
purposes of prostitution.
<P>
The problem is that girls are most likely to be the target 
of pimps when they reach the age of 16 or 17, but at that 
age there is no longer a legal recourse to protect them. Sir 
William Utting's report "People Like Us"  highlighted the 
problems of children in need, especially children in care 
who are sometimes drawn into prostitution by pimps. The 
report made some clear recommendations on those 
matters.
<P>
The horrendous case of Mrs. Irene Ivison has been 
brought to my attention. She lives in Doncaster which is 
outside my constituency, but she is well known in 
Sheffield. Some years ago, her 17-year-old daughter, 
Fiona, was murdered in a car park in Doncaster. Fiona 
had been drawn into prostitution, despite the strenuous 
efforts of her parents to control her. All their approaches 
to the police revealed that there were simply no legal 
remedies to help them. That situation is not untypical, 
although the case of Fiona was extreme because it resulted 
in her murder. A significant number of young girls of her 
age are working the streets.
<P>
The law on pimping is inadequate. The new clause 
would make only a small step forward, but it is a useful 
one and should be included in the Bill. There is a much 
bigger job to be done through an examination of all the 
legislation on pimping and prostitution. The existing law 
means that it is an easy and effective remedy to arrest 
prostitutes and fine them, but we know full well that they 
have only one way of earning the money to pay the fines. 
That allows pimps to get away with murder literally, in 
some cases, and by proxy when they lead girls into 
situations in which the result is murder. Pimps are rarely 
caught and little is done to prevent their activities, even 
when they are known to be consorting with 14 and 
15-year-old girls and grooming them for prostitution. 
Their typical modus operandi is to lead girls into 
prostitution at the critical age of 16 when the law provides 
no remedy.
<P>
Liberal Democrat Members hope that the Minister will 
look favourably on the new clause and that, in future, the 
law will provide a remedy to protect 16 and 17-year-old 
girls from the activities of pimps.



<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> It is vital to protect 16 and 17-year-old 
girls from pimping and to ensure that those with a duty 
of care provide it to the young people for whom there are 
responsible. As a member of the ministerial group 
considering the Utting report and the actions that are 
needed, I am keen that we should do everything that we 
can to deal with a difficult and intransigent problem. The 
hon. Member for Hallam will accept that a magic wand 
will not deal with the problem; we need to approach it in 
a number of different ways. The form of prostitution 
covered by the new clause is a form of child abuse. It is 
abhorrent. Therefore, I am sympathetic to the intentions 
behind the new clause and to what the hon. Gentleman 
said.
<P>
I return to a point that I made in debates on earlier new 
clauses. We are committed to considering the entire range 
of sexual offences and the penalties associated with them 
so that we achieve a coherent system. However, I am not 
convinced that the specific change proposed would 
succeed in providing any more protection than is already 
available, particularly as prosecutions under section 28 of 
the Sexual Offences Act 1956 are very rare.
<P>
If those responsible for a girl cause or encourage her to 
act as a prostitute, they are already liable under the law. 
They are aiding and abetting her procuration. However, 
in many cases, girls become involved in prostitution 
without the knowledge, or despite the best efforts, of their 
parents or carers. That may be why section 28 is so 
rarely used.
<P>
The Government are seeking ways to improve the 
protection of 16 and 17-year-olds from an abuse of trust 
by those in a position of authority or responsibility over 
them. That is an important part of our agenda. We have 
announced the setting up of an interdepartmental 
committee to co-ordinate strands of child protection, 
including strengthening the protection for young people 
who may feel fully adult, but who are still vulnerable.
<P>
The criminal law provides a wide range of offences to 
deal with those involved in pimping and the sexual abuse 
of children. It can be used much more generally against 
those who pimp or procure children, but that offence 
relates solely to those who have charge of a girl.
<P>
For example, under section 23 of the 1956 Act, it is an 
offence to procure a girl under the age of 21 to have 
sexual intercourse with a third person in any part of the 
world. That offence attracts the same maximum penalty as 
the offences under section 28 two years' imprisonment. 
Aiding and abetting that offence would carry the same 
penalty.
<P>
Similarly, anyone who caused or encouraged an 
indecent assault might be liable to charge of aiding and 
abetting or inciting the substantive offence and would face 
the same maximum sentence as for indecent assault 
itself up to 10 years' imprisonment. That is a much 
heavier penalty than is available for the offence covered 
by the new clause. Although I am sympathetic to the 
intention behind the new clause, I am not convinced that 
it is the way forward.
<P>
I underline the fact that the Department of Health is 
consulting about child protection issues in its 
consultation paper entitled "Working Together To 
Safeguard Children: New Government Proposals for 
Inter-Agency Co-operation"  the Department specialises 
in snappy titles. It has specifically asked for views on 
how best to deal with child prostitution and I am 
examining the Home Office's responsibilities in relation 
to such offences. The Home Office and the Department 
of Health have undertaken to produce joint guidance 
for the police, social services and the other agencies 
involved on how to deal with children involved in 
prostitution. That will be an effective way of increasing 
protection for them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> The Minister referred to child prostitution. 
Does the Government's definition of child prostitution 
accord with that in the Children Act 1989 and the United 
Nations convention on the rights of the child which 
applies to children under 18. Or does the Government's 
definition apply to children under 16? The ages from
16 and 18 are crucial, so we would be inclined to say that 
the age of 18 should be the cut-off. It should not be 16, 
which is the age referred to in much sexual offences 
legislation.
<P>
<B>Mr Michael:</B> Yes. I think that the hon. Gentleman 
makes a fair point. At the beginning of my remarks, I said 
that it was important to protect 16 and 17-year-olds. It is 
sometimes assumed that, because the age of consent for a 
girl is 16, that means that anything goes for those over 
that age. Children of 16 and 17 have a right to expect 
protection. However, those over the age of 18 should not 
be entirely unprotected from those who prey upon them 
and use a position of influence or authority to pursue their 
own ends. The hon. Gentleman makes a fair point because 
those under 18 are particularly vulnerable.



<P>
As a result of the Utting report, we are deeply engaged 
in tackling the problem of child prostitution and in 
protecting younger people. Younger people coming out of 
care are particularly vulnerable and we are keen to 
safeguard them by improving the law and the way in 
which our public services and those with a duty of care 
operate.
<P>
We are also considering the penalties for sexual 
offences. When we see a need, we shall increase the 
penalties, but only as part of a coherent approach. I assure 
the hon. Gentleman that I take seriously the points that he 
raised. With that assurance, I hope that he will withdraw 
the motion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I am pleased to hear that the Government 
are dealing with this issue. The Minister said that they are 
carrying out a review of the law on sexual offences. It 
will be welcomed by those involved in such matters and 
by those who have been the victims of pimps.
<P>
However, I wish to plant an idea in the Minister's mind 
that was raised with me by Mrs. Ivison in relation to her 
daughter. We have tried to work with existing legislation 
while thinking of future legislation that may start with a 
blank sheet. However, the problem is that no preventive order can be taken against known pimps who groom girls 
from the age of 13, 14 and 15 until they put them on the 
streets at the page of 16 and 17. A similar order to the sex 
offender order would be helpful in such circumstances.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> We are happy to receive constructive 
suggestions from Opposition Members and from our own 
Back Benchers. I shall certainly consider that suggestion. 
I do not want to give a direct undertaking, because we 
must examine the upside and the downside of the 
suggestion. However, the hon. Gentleman is right to draw 
attention to the fact that the Bill aims to prevent such 
offences in future as well as deal with questions of 
punishment.

indecent photographs of children
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`. Subsection (2) of section 6 of the Protection of Children Act 
1978 (Punishments) shall be amended by substituting for the word 
"three"  the word "five" .'. [Mr. Clappison.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Brought up, and read the First time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read 
a Second time.
<P>
This new clause deals with another aspect of the 
protection of children. It would protect children from 
indecent photographs of them being taken. For these 
purposes, the term "photographs"  includes 
pseudo-photographs and video recordings as well.
<P>
Under the Protection of Children Act 1978, the present 
maximum sentence for taking indecent photographs of 
children is three years' imprisonment. In the 20 years 
since then, technology has moved on apace and the 
internet poses additional risks to children.

<P>
The risks posed by new technology were brought home 
by a case in my constituency when a man pleaded guilty 
to a string of offences including breaking into a local 
school and installing a video camera in the changing room 
used by 14 to 16-year-old girls totally unbeknown to 
them. It came to light through a vigilant school caretaker 
who spotted cables on the roof leading to a power source 
and the camera which had been lowered down into the 
changing room.
<P>
I understand that the camera was being used by this 
gentleman, and it obviously came as a shock to the 
children in the school the Nicholas Hawksmoor school 
in Boreham Wood. The headmaster and staff handled the 
issue sensitively and the girls also adopted a sensible attitude. I met the girls last Friday and they told me that 
they believed children should be protected form such 
incidents.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>

<P>
It happened at several schools in Hertfordshire as well 
as the one in my constituency. The gentleman in question 
pleaded guilty to offences of arson and burglary. It was a 
problem to decide which offences he should be charged 
with: the gravamen lay in the indecency of taking video 
recordings of young girls rather than in the physical acts 
of burglary and arson. It is clear that the man in question 
had gone to considerable lengths to perpetrate his crime. 
The children feel strongly about it; I have already received 
a petition from parents and children at the school and I 
expect to receive more.
<P>
When I told the parents and children about the 
maximum sentence applicable, they thought that it was on 
the low side for an offence of taking indecent 
photographs. I feel that five years would be more 
appropriate and I ask the Minister for a sympathetic 
response. I may also return to him in the fullness of time 
on the separate issue of which offences someone 
committing such crimes should be charged with. There 
may be a gap in the law for dealing with people who go 
to such lengths to take indecent photographs and video 
recordings.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I certainly share the concern about the 
misuse of photographs of children and I welcome the hon. 
Gentleman's approach to the problem. A wider issue may 
be involved. Drawing on memory more than specific 
details, I recall some concern being expressed about a year 
ago about a landlord using similar techniques to take 
photographs of tenants in bed. If I remember correctly, it 
turned out not to be an offence in itself, so that wider 
issues may need to be addressed. If the hon. Gentleman 
would like to provide me with further details about his 
specific case, I would be pleased to respond.
<P>
We are fully committed to the protection of children 
and to ensuring that the courts have the necessary powers 
to deal with offenders. The Government take that 
responsibility very seriously indeed, as I have tried to 
make clear in relation to several other amendments.
<P>
The amendment would increase the maximum penalty 
for all offences under the Protection of Children Act 1978 
to five years' imprisonment on conviction on indictment. 
The maximum penalty on summary conviction would 
remain unchanged. The Act prohibits taking, distributing, 
showing or possessing an indecent photograph of a child.
<P>
I take a similar view to the hon. Gentleman in his 
introduction that these offences are the tip of a very 
large iceberg. That may be clear to the court, which would 
have to be satisfied as to the circumstances, so a degree 
of flexibility regarding the maximum sentence would be 
appropriate with lower sentences remaining unaffected.
I have already given an undertaking to the Committee that 
we will examine the pattern of penalties for sexual 
offences. I take the hon. Gentleman's point into account 
as part of that consideration.
<P>
We have said that we will increase the available 
penalties, when it is clear that that is necessary and when 
that will not distort the situation. Little evidence exists on such offences. The hon. Gentleman has given us anecdotal 
evidence. However, statistics show that in 1996 only 
seven of the 69 people convicted received a sentence of 
more than two years' imprisonment. The average length 
of sentence was nine months.
<P>
Those figures suggest that an increase in the penalty is 
unnecessary for most of the cases that come to court. Even 
if that were not so, it would be unwise to consider 
increasing the penalty for such offences in isolation. We 
must examine other offences, such as those under the 
Obscene Publications Acts 1959 and 1964 and, arguably, 
certain sexual offences. It would clearly be anomalous if 
the penalty for the possession of an indecent photograph 
of a child were greater than the penalty for unlawful 
sexual intercourse with a girl under 16.
<P>
In the light of my comments, I hope that the hon. 
Gentleman will withdraw the motion. I also hope that he 
will join the discussion about how to deal with these 
issues and about how to ensure that the courts have the 
powers to deal with cases appropriately. That will involve 
a longer time scale than acceptance of the new clause 
would have taken in Committee today.



<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I agree with the Minister that we must 
be vigilant about this type of offending. We must give 
such a serious subject further consideration in future.
I will contact the Minister about the wider issues. In view 
of the need to examine the broader picture, I beg to ask 
leave to withdraw the motion.

Channel Islands and the Manx authorities.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> When was the last conviction for piracy 
and what sentence was imposed?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I shall write to the hon. Gentleman with 
details of that. From memory, I think it was 1730 the 
provisions are very old. I suspect that the demand for the 
hanging, drawing and quartering of pirates is not as great 
now as it was then. I certainly hope not.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I understand that piracy is a serious 
problem in ceratin parts of the world, especially the far 
east.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I do not think that it is a problem in the 
Isle of Man or in the Channel Islands.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> That is precisely why I am asking the 
question. Apparently, the last breach of piracy legislation 
was in 1730. How far does the remit of the Royal Navy 
extend? Presumably actions have been taken against 
piracy more recently than 1730.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I shall write to the hon. Gentleman on 
the remit of the Royal Navy to deal with piracy in the 
south seas. However, if it found any pirates in the south 
seas whom it was thinking of hanging I suspect that it 
would not seek to bring them to the Isle of Man to do so.

<P>
The amendment is purely consequential to the 
introduction of the new detention and training orders. 
Schedule 1 of the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997 provides 
for the transfer of prisoners between the United Kingdom 
jurisdictions, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man. The 
provisions require the extension to the other jurisdictions 
of relevant parts of the sentencing jurisdiction's 
legislation. The amendment is a territorial provision 
enabling the provisions relating to detention and training 
orders to be extended fro the purposes of transferring 
persons only to the Isle of Man.

page 110, line 44, leave out from `be' to `deal' in line 46

</UL></FONT>
<P>
At this point it may be for the convenience of the 
Committee if I point out that all the Government 
amendments to the schedule are simply further 
pre-consolidation amendments which are intended to 
correct minor anomalies in existing criminal justice 
legislation. That is intended to pave the way for a 
consolidation Bill in a future Session that will bring 
together in a structured and coherent way all the existing 
legislation relating to the powers of the criminal court.
<P>
The amendments to schedule 8 are minor and technical 
or consequential to those already debated. Unless 
Opposition Members wish me to go into detail on any 
of the individual amendments or, if the hon. Member for 
Woking is in one of his questioning and challenging 
moods, into every one, I propose to move the remaining 
Government amendments formally when you put the 
Question, Mr. O'Hara. I shall be happy to write to hon. 
Members if they require details of any amendment.
I thought that it might assist the Committee if we moved 
fairly swiftly here.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am grateful to the Minister. I was 
not aware of the full background to which the Minister 
adverted. I should like his assistance on amendment No. 
199. Could I therefore take advantage of his offer and ask 
him to write 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We shall come to amendment 
No. 199 in due course, and the hon. Gentleman can put 
his question then.

The amendment relates to rehabilitation periods in the 
event that the Government give the courts the power to 
impose custodial sentences on 10 and 11-year-olds. There 
is provision for rehabilitation for 12, 13 and 14-year-olds 
under the Bill, but there is no specific provision for
10 and 11-year olds to have a shorter period of 
rehabilitation in a sentence imposed under the 
Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974. Will the Minister 
tell the Committee whether the Government plan to 
introduce custodial sentences for 10 and 11-year-olds? If 
that is the case, will the rehabilitation period for those 
children be shorter than that for 12, 13 and 14-year-olds?
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> My response will be brief, although I 
will give a longer explanation if that is the wish of the 
hon. Member for Hertsmere. As I said in an earlier debate, 
the Government are not contemplating immediately the 
detention of 10 and 11-year olds. We will respond to need. 
We would not take such an approach unless there was 
evidence of its value.
<P>
The amendment is unhelpful because it would 
unnecessarily reduce the length of the rehabilitation 
period from 12 to six months. Children under 12 who 
have been sentenced to a period of detention under the 
new order have been convicted of serious and persistent 
offending of such a nature that the court was of the 
opinion that only a custodial sentence would be adequate 
to protect the public from further offending by them. That 
points to a considerable degree of seriousness. If the 
individual were under the age of 12, even in those very 
serious circumstances, I have no doubt that the courts 
would give serious thought before using the new power. 
On that basis, there is little justification for treating the 
younger group any differently from 12 to 14-year-olds 
who have been sentenced for serious and persistent 
offending. I hope that in the light of my assurance about 
the Government's intentions, the hon. Gentleman will 
withdraw the amendment.



<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Twelve, 13 and 14-year-olds already 
have a shorter rehabilitation period than older offenders. 
We thought that there would have been some point in 
drawing a line between 10 and 11-year-olds and 12, 13 and 14-year-olds, simply to allow the younger group 
to put the past behind them as soon as possible. We may 
need to return to the issue in future. However, I beg to 
ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

Question proposed, That the Chairman do report the 
Bill, as amended, to the House.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> May I take this opportunity, Mr. O'Hara, 
to thank you for your judicious chairmanship of our 
proceedings. You have guided us with your customary 
wisdom and wit and on occasions you have brought us 
back to a point of substance when we were in danger of 
straying too wide or waxing too lyrical. The hon. Member 
for Woking has a breadth of mind that has occasionally 
taken us wandering off into interesting byways.
<P>
I am also grateful, Mr. O'Hara, for the way in which 
you and your co-Chairman have worked so well together. 
The Committee has been dealt with in a seamless fashion. 
I should like to pay tribute to your officials who have so 
ably assisted us. I am grateful to the Under-Secretary of 
State for the Home Department, my hon. Friend the 
Member for North Warwickshire (Mr. O'Brien) and the 
Minister for Home Affairs and Devolution, Scottish 
Office, who have helped pilot the Bill through Committee 
and given me the opportunity for the occasional breather.
<P>
I should also like to thank my hon. Friends behind me 
for their support, their staying power and their occasional 
contributions whose commendable brevity does not in the 
least detract from their immense value. I also pay tribute 
to Opposition Members for their constructive work in the 
Committee. There are a number of serious issues that have 
been debated seriously and in a grown-up way. It takes both sides of the Committee to achieve that standard of 
debate. Opposition Members have on several occasions 
proved passionate and persuasive advocates of causes that 
we might not have assumed that they would support.
I hope that they will recognise that we have sometimes 
been able to respond positively to their points although at 
other times we have agreed to differ.
<P>
May I also thank those who have been involved in the 
work of the usual channels to enable the Committee to 
deal with the Bill expeditiously without having to sit 
through the long hours of the night. That was a great 
disappointment to some hon. Members but others were 
willing to forgo that. Although a number of hon. Members 
said that they were prepared to sit through the night, we 
are all relieved that it was not necessary, largely because 
of the smooth arrangements that had been agreed.
<P>
I am grateful to others such as the police officers who 
maintained law and order in the Committee but 
fortunately not too actively. It has been a good example 
of how a Committee stage of a Bill should operate with 
sensible and constructive debates. We hope that the Bill 
will receive a positive reception on Report and Third 
Reading and will proceed to Royal Assent before the 
summer recess. I am keen to see the Bill enacted and its 
measures implemented for the benefit of all our 
constituents. I should like to thank everyone involved, 
including those who have supported us from the Home 
Office and Scottish Office, for a tremendous amount of 
work.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I should like to associate myself with 
the sentiments which the Minister has expressed about 
your chairmanship, Mr. O'Hara, and that of your 
co-Chairman. It has been a pleasure to serve under you 
and I know that I speak for all my hon. Friends. I join in 
the tribute that has been paid to the learned Clerk, the 
Hansard staff and all the other servants of the Committee 
who have assisted us. I am most grateful to my hon. 
Friend the Member for Epping Forest (Mrs. Laing) for her 
assistance, particularly with the Scottish part of the Bill. 
As a Scottish law graduate she brought her expertise to 
bear on that and helped to give it full and proper 
consideration.
<P>
I am also most grateful to all of my hon. Friends who 
have perhaps made more than an occasional contribution 
to the proceedings, entirely in accordance with the spirit 
of proper consideration, and often very succinctly. We 
have enjoyed giving the Bill proper consideration. That 
has been our main task and we have lived up to it, 
principally through the efforts of my hon. Friends. We are 
most grateful, to all of those who have made that possible, 
including you, Mr. O'Hara and your co-Chairman.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> The proceedings in the House are based on 
the presumption that we have a two-party system. Being 
third is always difficult. I am accustomed to a toast and a 
response, but making the response to the response is 
always tough. Rather than recite the list once more, I shall 
associate myself with the remarks made by the Minister 
and the hon. Member for Hertsmere. However, my hon. 
Friend the Member for West Aberdeenshire and 
Kincardine and I wish to thank you, Mr. O'Hara, and the 
co-Chairman and all the staff for the work that they 
have done.
<P>
I particularly want to thank my hon. Friend the Member 
for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine for handling 
Scottish matters and for loyally being present throughout 
the Committee. He is a member of the Liberal Democrat 
Scottish team and was supposed to be here for the debates 
on Scottish issues only. However, he managed to 
contribute across the whole range of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> We could not stop him.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> My hon. Friend is in there at every 
opportunity.
<P>
We have had good-humoured debates. I have enjoyed 
working from the Opposition Benches more than I expected 
to when we began our proceedings. I was pleased to see the 
creation of an alliance to defence civil liberties. The 
Howard League is not now the penal league for Howard 
reform, and its views are genuinely shared by Conservative 
Members, who have made valid criticisms in serious 
debates.
<P>
Once again, I thank you, Mr. O'Hara, and the officials. 
We have made a genuine contribution to law-making in 
this country.

<B>The Chairman:</B> One of the pleasures of being in the 
Chair is having the last word. I sometimes wish that my 
wife was in Committee.
<P>
I wish to associate my final remarks with my 
co-Chairman, Mrs. Michie. Her assistance has been 
enormously helpful. I thank the Clerk, who has been at my elbow for our proceedings. He has been of enormous 
assistance; he knows that, but I want to say it publicly.
I also thank the Official Reporters, who have served us so 
well, and the Attendants and others who have kept order 
in what, admittedly, has not been a difficult Committee. 
There has been much about crime, but little disorder.
<P>
The Committee has been interesting for the amount of 
agreement and common purpose that has been apparent.
I have listened to numerous accusations of changing and 
stealing political clothes, so I wish to quote Juvenal about 
Tiberius and Gaius Gracchus, two brothers who were 
noted revolutionaries in ancient Rome. Juvenal asked, 
"Who'd ever listen to the Gracchi if they were 
complaining about revolution?"  That is rather like asking 
who would listen to Gazza if he were talking about 
intemperate behaviour.
<P>
I thank those on my right who were seen, but not heard. 
They have not attracted the Chairman's displeasure at any 
stage even though that can happen on occasions.
<P>
Most of all, I thank members of the Committee for the 
good humour with which they have conducted their 
business and for the serious way that they have set about 
considering a Bill that will make a significant contribution 
to legislation on crime and disorder.
<P>
