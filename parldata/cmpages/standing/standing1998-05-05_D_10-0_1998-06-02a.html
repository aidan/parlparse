<P>
<H5>10.30am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> In view of the Minister's delay, I propose to adjourn the Committee for 10 minutes.
<P>
Sitting suspended.
<P>
<H5>10.37 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
On resuming--
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department </B>(Mr. George Howarth): On a point of order, Mr. Welsh. I apologise to the Committee for the delay--I was in Hackney launching a new drugs report. It was interesting, but unfortunately the London traffic defeated me.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> We all empathise as regards London traffic.
<H4><center>Clause 40</center></H4>
<H4><center>Cancellation of enforcement notice</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. John Greenway </B>(Ryedale): I beg to move amendment No. 212, in page 23, line 19, leave out from `notice' to end of line 22 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`subject only to his having the grounds to seek judicial review of that notice.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I trust that you had an enjoyable and relaxing recess, Mr. Welsh. In fairness to the Minister, his point of order made it clear how hard we work in this place. We welcome him back.
<P>
This morning, I will speak to several amendments on matters that the Data Protection Registrar has raised with Home Office officials. The registrar's concerns have been put on the record as a result of correspondence with members of the Committee and information that has been made available, even on the Internet. We are not privy to officials' answers, and it is right that we have some brief, sharp debates on those concerns, which have been so publicly expressed. That will give the Minister the opportunity to put on record his response to them.
<P>
Clause 40 provides a mechanism for the cancellation of an enforcement notice. It provides an opportunity for a data controller on whom an enforcement notice has been served to apply for cancellation or variation of the notice. The Minister should clarify the circumstances in which that would operate.
<P>
Under the Data Protection Act 1984, the commissioner may withdraw an enforcement notice for any reason, if there are grounds for judicial review. Clause 40(1) allows the Data Protection Commissioner to vary a notice. That is a welcome additional power. However, under subsection (2), the Data Protection Commissioner can cancel the notice only on the specific grounds of a change in circumstances. That requirement is far narrower than that in the 1984 Act, which stipulates merely that there must be grounds for judicial review.
<P>
Will the Minister tell the Committee why the Government made that change? Perhaps it is an oversight, and the Government did not intend to narrow the requirement in such a way. If that is so, amendment No. 212 would address the concerns that have been expressed by the Data Protection Register and her officials.
<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> Under the 1984 Act, the Data Protection Registrar may cancel an enforcement order by means of a written notification to the person on whom it is served. No express limitations exist regarding the grounds on which she may do so. Her exercise of that power is subject to the general rules of judicial review.
<P>
The 1984 Act contains no formal provision, backed by a right of appeal, for controllers to ask the registrar to vary or to cancel enforcement notices. Data controllers may make an informal approach to the registrar. She then has the power under section 10(8) to cancel, but not to vary, the notice. We believe that more flexibility is needed. That is the purpose of clause 40(2).
<P>
The Bill contains, at clause 40(1), a general power for the commissioner to cancel enforcement notices on her own initiative. However, it also adds a power for her to vary a notice so as to relieve a data controller of some, but not all, of its requirements. That important and useful new option will be available to the commissioner as part of her enforcement regime. It extends the registrar's powers under the 1984 Act.
<P>
The Bill introduces, at clause 40(2), a completely new facility for data controllers to take the initiative in submitting a formal request to the commissioner for cancellation or variation of an enforcement notice. The hon. Member for Ryedale (Mr. Greenway) asked why that is necessary. Clause 47(2) provides for a right of appeal against refusal of such a request. That is a significant new right for data controllers. It represents a direct route to the lifting of regulatory restriction, with the option of a complete review by the tribunal of the merits of any case that the commissioner refuses. As that is a new method of challenging an enforcement notice, it is essential for it to be limited. A challenge will be successful only if a genuine change of circumstances makes compliance with the notice unnecessary. That is a right and proper safeguard against abuse.
<P>
When an enforcement notice is issued in the first place, a right of appeal already exists. We cannot allow the new right of cancellation or variation to become nothing more than a means of challenging further the issue of an enforcement notice if an appeal has failed. It is not merely an opportunity for a second bite at that particular cherry. Something must have genuinely changed so as to require the basis or extent of the notice to be properly reassessed.
<P>
	The hon. Gentleman's amendment appears to seek to remove all restrictions on controllers' freedom to seek the variation or cancellation of an enforcement notice and to place it on a par with the commissioner's general power in clause 40(1).
<P>
	For those reasons, the amendment, though well intentioned, is misconceived. Clauses 40(1) and 40(2) perform different functions, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> Before we began this morning's deliberations, Mr. Welsh, we agreed that the Bill's provisions resembled the clues of a crossword puzzle--their meaning depends on what one reads into them.
<P>
	We acknowledge that the clause could cover a change in circumstances, but that would require a judicial review in any event. Our question was whether the Bill provided, a right of appeal. We wanted to ensure that it did not represent a narrowing of the provisions of the 1984 Act, but rather provided additional flexibility. The Minister has confirmed that that is the case.
<P>
	I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I wish only to ask a question about clause 40(1). I did not want to be provocative and table an amendment, but the subsection begins with the words:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``If the commissioner considers that all or any of the provisions of an enforcement notice need not be complied with.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Surely the words ``all'' and ``or'' are superfluous, as the word ``any'' must include ``all''. It seems strange that the commissioner might think that an enforcement notice was wrong throughout. If she did, why would she have introduce it in the first place?
<P>
I shall not labour the point, as we have already debated the clause, but I should be grateful for an explanation from the Minister about the necessity of the use of the words ``all'' and ``or''.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> Clause 40 provides the commissioner with the power to vary as well as cancel the conditions of an enforcement notice. It also allows controllers to request cancellations or variations of such notices, on the grounds that the relevant circumstances have changed.
<P>
The questions asked by the hon. Member for Ryedale hinge on flexibility, and the clause will give that to the commissioner and to data controllers. The Committee has already discussed the circumstances in which data controllers would be able to request the cancellation or variation of an enforcement notice. The flexibility in the clause strikes the right balance in enabling data controllers and the commissioner to have the necessary arrangements in place to make sensible decisions about any matter that arises.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With those extra crossword clues, I shall now ask whether clause 40 should stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 40 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Clause 41 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 42</center></H4>
<H4><center>Information notices</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 282, in page 24, line 24, after `purpose', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`or in a case falling within either subsection (a) or (b) such information as the Commissioner may require for the purposes of the notification process.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take the following amendments: No. 214, in page 24, line 26, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(3A) The Commissioner may serve an information notice on a data controller notwithstanding that the controller reasonably believes that the processing in which he is engaged is in whole or in part exempt from the data protection principles.<P>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(9A) A refusal to furnish the Data Protection Commissioner with any information may not be used or relied upon as a material fact in any criminal proceedings against the Data Controller other than an offence under this Act.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> These four amendments were suggested by the Data Protection Registrar--the commissioner elect, so to speak--to clarify some important questions.
<P>
Amendment No. 282 would allow the commissioner to require information to assist the notification process. Relevant information may be in the hands of third parties or data processors, but there does not appear to be a provision allowing an enforcement notice to be served on anyone other than a data controller. The need to compel is important in preventing reckless or false statements.
<P>
Amendment No. 283 would add an important additional offence of failing to respond without reasonable excuse. That is a fairly standard requirement in legislation, which we have already debated.
<P>
The Data Protection Registrar feels strongly that there must be a legal duty to respond to an information notice. If that is coupled with the requirement that an information notice could be served on a third party that had information, which would be important to the process of notification, that requirement should be in the Bill.
<P>
Amendment No. 270 to clause 42(9) provides an exemption from the requirement to furnish any information that might reveal evidence of criminal conduct by the controller. Obviously, it is important that individuals do not lay themselves open to prosecution for offences by supplying information to the Data Protection Commissioner, other than--it is an important caveat--the offences that are created under the Bill. A similar provision is needed for any refusal; such a refusal to supply information should not be a material fact in criminal proceedings, other than for data protection offences.
<P>
Amendment No. 214 provides that an information notice may be served when the commissioner has received a request under clause 41 in respect of any processing, or when the commissioner reasonably requires information for the purpose of determining whether the data controller has complied, or is complying, with the data protection principles. When a data controller claims an exemption from the principle in whole or in part relying on one of the exemption provisions, he is under no obligation to comply with the principles and it is not clear that the commissioner can serve an information notice in such a case. If she cannot do so, she may be unable to fulfil the obligation to check on a claim for exemption in fulfilment of article 28.4 of the directive. That is why we suggest the slightly different wording for subsection (3).
<P>
These are complex matters, but I hope that I have explained the purpose of the amendments. They bring out into the open the concerns that the registrar expressed, of which I am sure the Minister and his officials are aware, and they give the Minister a chance to respond.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> The power to serve an information notice under clause 42 is, as the hon. Gentleman said, new to data protection law. Indeed, it is one of the ways in which the Bill gives the commissioner greater powers than the registrar currently has. That power may be exercised when the commissioner has received a request for an assessment under clause 41--we discussed a few moments ago the arrangements that will exist in such cases--or when she reasonably requires information for the purposes of determining the data controller's compliance with the data protection principles.
<P>
The purpose of amendment No. 282 is to clarify whether an information notice may be used by the Data Protection Commissioner to seek the information that she needs in connection with the notification arrangements.
<P>
The short answer is that an information notice under clause 42 is not needed for that purpose. The arrangements for notification will be established under part III of the Bill. In particular, notification regulations will specify in detail the information with which data controllers will need to provide the commissioner in notifying her, and the form in which they must provide it. If the commissioner identifies a data controller whom she thinks should notify her but has not yet done so, or who has notified her but done so incompletely or incorrectly, she will be able to seek the necessary information under the arrangements in part III.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> Will the Minister confirm that the regulations--which the Minister and his officials still have the opportunity to consider--would extend to third parties and in particular to data processors, who would have a contractual obligation to a data controller?
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I understand the point that the hon. Gentleman makes, and I shall certainly think about it before any regulations are made. Further action is probably unnecessary, but I shall consider it.
<P>
Amendment 214 would widen the power provided by clause 42. It would do that in two ways. First, new subsection (3A) would make specific provision for the commissioner to serve a notice where a controller claimed an exemption from the principles. Secondly, new subsection (3B) would allow her to serve a notice on third parties whom she believed had relevant information. I shall deal with each part of the amendment in turn.
<P>
We do not believe that new subsection (3A) is necessary; it does not add anything. The commissioner may already serve an information notice where the controller claims an exemption. In such a case, the purpose of the notice is to seek information to allow the commissioner to consider whether the controller is in fact exempt from the principle or principles in question. To put it another way, it enables her to consider whether the processing in question complies with the principles as modified by the exemptions.
<P>
Turning to subsection (3B), we do not believe it right to give the commissioner power to serve an information notice on a third party. That answers the point that the hon. Member for Ryedale has just made. It is the controller's activities that the commissioner is investigating. It is right that she should be able to require him to provide her with the information that she needs. However, to extend that to third parties would, in our view, be to give the commissioner an unjustifiably wide power. It would effectively permit her to demand information from anyone at all, whatever their connection to a controller, on threat of criminal sanction. That would be excessive, intensive, and quite inappropriate to a regulatory authority of this nature, however general its remit.
<P>
Clause 42 is already a much stronger power than that in the 1984 Act, or, indeed, in the Bill as it was first brought forward. The Government brought forward amendments in another place to extend the grounds on which an information notice may be served. We accepted the view of the registrar that the provision as originally drafted was too narrow. We believe that it now strikes the right balance.
<P>
I hope that I can give the Hon. Gentleman a brief but helpful response to amendment No. 283. It is not necessary, as failure to comply with an information notice is already an offence by virtue of clause 46(1).
<P>
With regard to amendment No. 270, clause 42(9) allows a data controller on whom an information notice has been served to withhold information from the commissioner where that information would reveal evidence of the commission of an offence--other than an offence under the Bill--and expose him to proceedings for that offence. The amendment would add that a refusal to supply the commissioner with information may not be used as a ``material fact'' in any proceedings against a data controller, other than proceedings under the Bill.
<P>
I assume from the explanation given by the hon. Member for Ryedale that the amendment is aimed at cases in which the information is properly withheld, on the ground of the privilege against self-incrimination. I assume that is what he means. The Government believe that the amendment is unnecessary. Clause 42(9) is similar in effect to the first part of section 34(9) of the 1984 Act, although that is concerned with subject access. We have no reason to believe that the section has not worked well or that it has not provided sufficient protection for data users. No further protection such as that suggested by the hon. Gentleman has been shown to be needed in practice.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, data controllers are not required to articulate reasons for withholding information when they are entitled to do so. Information may properly be withheld on grounds other than self-incrimination, such as legal professional privilege. Data controllers must supply required information, but may refer to information properly withheld--if they refer to it at all--in general terms. For example, reference may be made to one of the exemptions under clause 42.
<P>
Little could therefore be read into general conduct of that nature. It is highly unlikely to be capable of material evidence of the commission of a crime. There are other reasons for withholding information. Even if a data controller told the commissioner that he was relying on the self-incrimination exemption, it would be very difficult to use that in proceedings against him. There would be no indication that the information withheld related to the specific offence for which he was being tried or, indeed, to any offence. In any event, the information would have remarkably little value as evidence.
<P>
I hope that my explanation in respect of all the amendments has persuaded the hon. Member for Ryedale that they are not necessary. I understand that they are intended to test the way in which the arrangements will work. I hope that he will feel able to withdraw them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> The Minister is exactly right--the Opposition have tested whether the provisions mean what we think they mean. I am grateful for his explanation.
<P>
I may have failed, with no reasonable excuse, to explain that amendment No. 283 sought to clarify the burden of proof, but we will let the matter pass. I am especially grateful for the Minister's assurance that he will consider our points about notification regulations. He acknowledged the importance of the Data Protection Commissioner having the power to obtain information to assist the information process.
<P>
On reflection, I share his concern about amendment No. 214. Proposed subsection (3B) suggested in respect of the registrar's office that an information notice may be served on any third party. I take his point that the amendment is probably too widely drawn. It is intended to catch data processors, who have a third party status distinct from the data controller. The Minister should ensure that they are so caught by the regulations that will be introduced under clause 15.
<P>
Debate of the amendments was important, and dealt with complicated matters, for which I apologise. On the basis of the Minister's response, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 42 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 43</center></H4>
<H4><center>Special information notices</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 284, in page 25, line 23, after `information', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`about the personal data being processed'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This is a short amendment to seek clarification of the word ``information'' in line 23, in respect of special information notices. Information is required under a special information notice for the purpose that is mentioned in subsection (2). That begs the question of whether the information includes details of the data that are being processed.
<P>
Subsection (1) refers to information that is
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``specified for the purpose specified in subsection (2).''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Subsection (2) states that that purpose is to discover
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``whether the personal data are being processed only for the special purposes, or . . . with a view to . . . publication . . . of any journalistic, literary or artistic material which has not previously been published''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That refers to the wide exemption in clause 31, which we discussed at length before the recess. Given the importance of the arrangement in clause 43, we must be sure that details of the data that are being processed are caught within the provisions.
<P>
<B>Dr. Nick Palmer </B>(Broxtowe): First, I apologise to the Committee for being late--I was stuck in a lift with six other people for 25 minutes.
<P>
The amendment does not deal with the questions that would usually arise under clauses 31, 41 and 43(1) on the processing of data. It is unusual for data controllers to be asked about data; they are usually asked about the uses to which data are put. The amendment would restrict the registrar to asking about data, but it is more likely that she will want to quiz the data controller about how he or she uses the data.
<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> Clause 43 is a crucial part of the arrangements that the Bill makes in connection with processing for the special purposes. It provides an essential safeguard against abuse of the arrangements for such processing.
<P>
The Committee will recall--my hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe (Dr. Palmer) referred to this--that clause 31 allows data controllers who are processing for the special purposes to make a claim to that effect in order to stay judicial proceedings that might be under way in connection with their processing.
<P>
There needs to be a mechanism for determining how long the stay on proceedings should operate. That turns on whether the controller's claim is justified. Clause 43 is, therefore, a crucial part of the mechanism.
<P>
The power that it provides may also be used where the commissioner has received a request for an assessment of processing for the special purposes. The commissioner has no power to issue what might be termed an ordinary information notice under clause 42 until she has determined that the same criteria that would justify a continued stay on proceedings are not satisfied. That partly answers the point that my hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe made.
<P>
The power is especially important in cases where a claim has been made under clause 31. It allows the commissioner to issue a special information notice for the purposes of determining whether the criteria justifying the continuation of the stay are satisfied.
<P>
It is a very closely focused provision. It relates only to processing for the special purposes; and it gives the commissioner a very specific power. It is, in fact, already so closely focused that it achieves the purpose suggested by the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Ryedale. That would require the special information notice to specify that the information that the data controller was required to provide was about the personal data being processed for the special purposes. It would do so by adding the relevant words in subsection (1).
<P>
The additonal words are not needed, however, as they are already covered by the wording of subsection (2). That makes it clear that the information that the commissioner may seek in a special information notice relates to whether the personal data in question are being processed only for the special purposes; or whether those particular data are being processed with a view to the publication of special purposes material which have not previously been published by the data controller.
<P>
In that way the clause already provides that the target of a special information notice must be the particular data being processed for the special purposes, and whose processing has triggered the issue of the notice.
<P>
Although the perspective of my explanation may have been slightly different from what the hon. Member for Rydale expected, I hope that I have allayed his fears.

<P>

<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> Let me narrow the matter down to one point. What is important is that the special information notice does not allow the data controller to say that, because he wanted to claim the special exemption, he would not release details of what he was processing. The Data Commissioner must be able to obtain information about the data: otherwise, she will not be in a position to assess whether the special purposes requirements are met. That is the key element of the debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> That issue is covered by the clause, which provides that a special information notice must be relevant to the particular data being processed. It must be justified in terms of the special purposes. That is the principle so the commissioner will have the power to examine any other data involved to ensure that they are consistent with the special purposes. There will be no barrier to any inquiry into whether the special purposes are justified or relevant.
<P>
	I understand the point made by the hon. Member for Ryedale, but I do not think that there is scope for the sort of abuse that he implies could take place.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am grateful to the Minister. The clause is an important one, and I suspect that we shall return on Report to some of what it contains, especially in relation to clause 31.

	I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 285, in page 27, line 25, after `notice', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`setting out the grounds for the appeal'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This is another amendment that deals with a point that has been raised by the Data Protection Registrar. Clause 47 provides an important right of appeal for data controllers and, potentially, for data processors on whom an enforcement notice, information notice or special information notice has been served. The Data Protection Registrar has expressed concern that there appears to be no requirement for the controller to specify the grounds for appeal. Data controllers should not be required to respond to oppressive or unduly onerous information notices. However, the registrar is worried about the practical effects of the appeal provisions if the data controller does not have to specify any particular grounds for the appeal. That has particular relevance to clause 28, under which such processes could be long and drawn out. The amendment would ensure that the Bill makes it clear whether grounds for appeal are required.
<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> As the hon. Member for Ryedale said, clause 47(1) provides a right to appeal against an enforcement notice.
<P>
That is not an open-ended provision: it merely states that a right of appeal exists. The hon. Gentleman's amendment would require such an appeal to spell out the grounds on which it was made. The Government do not think that that is necessary. The details of the form and content of a notice of appeal are best dealt with by the Data Protection Tribunal rules, which the Secretary of State has the power to make under paragraph (7) of schedule 6. Clause 47 follows the corresponding provision in the Data Protection Act 1984 that relates to appeals against enforcement notices.
<P>
The current requirement for applicants to state their grounds for appeal appears in the Data Protection Tribunal Rules 1985 at rule 3(2)(c). Those arrangements have worked well so far and we see no need to change them in the Bill. However, we shall be drafting new tribunal rules and we shall bear the hon. Gentleman's points in mind in doing so. It is likely that a provision similar to the present rule 3(2)(c) will be needed in the new rules. In the light of that indication of our intentions, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will agree to withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am grateful to the Minister. He clearly appreciates that this is an important matter and intends to deal with it under paragraph (7) of schedule 6. I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

We are moving at such a pace that I need to pause for breath. This is a probing amendment, because I do not entirely understand the logic behind the provision--doubtless the Minister will try to persuade me that it is logical. The clause does not state that there must be codes of practice. One takes as read the Secretary of State's involvement via order, although we may come back to that point when we discuss amendment No. 272. It is left to the commissioner to decide whether it is appropriate to have codes of practice.
<P>
There ought to be codes of practice and I cannot think of grounds on which the commissioner might disagree. If, however, the Minister says that the wording is necessary to give flexibility because in some situations codes of practice would not be necessary, while in others, they would, I will be content. The clause seems to introduce an idea without providing certainty that it will be implemented.
<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> The commissioner's general duties, as set out in clause 50, include the promotion of the following of good practice by data controllers. As part of that general duty, subsection (4)(a) requires her to encourage trade associations--that is, bodies representing data controllers--to develop codes of practice and to disseminate those to their members. The clause expressly says that that duty applies only where the commissioner considers it appropriate to do so. The amendment would remove that discretion.
<P>
It is difficult to see what value there would be in requiring the commissioner, in all circumstances--even those where it was inappropriate to do so--to encourage the promotion of codes. For example, to require her to encourage codes where they are unnecessary, or where such an intitiative was unlikely to succeed, would seem to be an unproductive use of her time and resources. The Committee should consider the fact that that could also lead to a lot of unnecessary work for trade associations, which might have to repond to requests for codes that were neither necessary nor useful. The commissioner needs to be in a position to determine for herself, in the light of all the relevant information and circumstances, whether encouraging a code would be appropriate at that particular time.
<P>
The Bill's current approach--that the commissioner should encourage codes where she considers it appropriate to do so--continues the approach in section 36(4) of the 1984 Act. The words that the amendment would delete are drawn directly from that Act. The commissioner's duty to encourage codes must also be considered in the context of her other duties in respect of codes. In addition to encouraging trade associations to issue codes, she must consider and give her opinion on codes drawn up by trade associations and prepare codes where she considers it appropriate to do so, or is directed to do so by the Secretary of State.
<P>
Taken together, the different provisions provide for considerable involvement by the commissioner in the development of codes.
<P>
As the hon. Member for Ryedale rightly said, codes have an important potential role to play in developing and fleshing out for particular sectors the general rules that the Bill establishes. I am sure that the commissioner will take full advantage of the opportunity that they provide, but there is no advantage in making the changes suggested by the hon Gentleman. The flexibility which the commissioner will have is sufficient to avoid unnecessary bureaucracy, while keeping a watchful eye on matters. With those assurances, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will seek leave to withdraw the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am grateful for the Minister's explanation, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to move amendnent No. 272, in page 29, line 42, leave out ``the Secretary of State'' and insert ``Parliament''.
<P>
This is a brief amendment. Subsection (8) allows the commissioner to charge such sums as she may, with the consent of the Secretary of State, determine for the services provided by the commissioner in respect of all the sections under part VI. It is for the Committee to consider whether the consent of Parliament, rather than of the Secretary of State, might be more appropriate. We shall discuss later the appropriate procedure for a number of order-making powers in the Bill; I believe that Parliament should consent to the fees that are charged, because it is an important power for the commissioner.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> Clause 50(8) permits the commissioner, with the Secretary of State's consent, to charge for the services that she provides under part VI of the Bill. It is an important new power which the registrar has been pressing for. At present, she has no power to charge for any of the services provided by her office.
<P>
The commissioner believes that it is desirable that she should be able to charge for many of the incidental services that she provides, and the Government agree. For example, the commissioner has no power to recoup the costs of expenditure involved in organising conferences or in speaking at conferences organised by others. In the circumstances, it is reasonable that those powers should be granted.
<P>
The power would also enable the commissioner to charge for publications and other promotional material. In many cases she may not wish to charge for them; she may take the view that it is better to ensure that they are available rather than to inhibit their dissemination by charging for them. For example, single copies of promotional material which involve comparatively little expense nevertheless might have an important information role. It might be appropriate not to make a charge in those circumstances.
<P>
However, the commissioner may wish to charge for the bulk orders of videos or other promotional material, which can be a drain on what is often a tight budget. Being able to charge in such circumstances helps limited resources to be stretched further, which I am sure the Committee will agree is important.
<P>
Whether the commissioner should have the power to charge for services is, as the hon. Gentleman said, properly a matter for Parliament: it is an issue of principle. However, whether the commissioner should seek the consent of Parliament for the detailed charging arrangements is a matter of a different order. It is doubtful whether parliamentary oversight at this level would be an effective use of parliamentary time. We are discussing ancillary services which currently consume only about 10 per cent. of the registrar's budget of some &#163;3.7 million. That is not a major amount of money for Parliament to deliberate on, although it is important.
<P>
It is essential that there should be proper and rigorous control over the charging regime. However, the system of control needs to be sufficiently flexible to permit timely responses to changing circumstances. Requiring the commissioner to seek the Secretary of State's consent satisfies the safeguards that are necessary because of the circumstances and the sums involved.
<P>
With that explanation of the scale of the operation and of the issues about which we are concerned, I hope that the hon. Member for Ryedale is happy with our proposal and will not press his amendment.

<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am grateful for the Minister's acknowledgement that the matter is important. I should have made it clear that we do not oppose the concept of people paying to use the commissioner's services--that goes without saying.
<P>
I have heard the Minister's comments, which we can take away and think about. We are, however, slightly concerned that the fees will simply be charged and decided and that people will not be able to do an awful lot about them if they do not like them. If Members of Parliament had to approve them, people would at least have an opportunity to lobby them.
<P>
We have aired the issue and it is on the record. On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<H4><center>Reports and codes of practice to be laid before Parliament</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 273, in page 30, line 3, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(1A) Each House of Parliament shall debate the reports laid before it by the Commissioner on an annual basis and within four months of each annual report being laid.'.<P>

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> Amendment No. 273 raises a narrow but important point. There needs to be a mechanism to provide for debate in Parliament of the general reports that the commissioner will lay before it. Doubtless, there will be a debate in due course about the precise form that the reports should take, but we are concerned about the debating mechanism.
<P>
It is important for the Committee to consider a mechanism for two reasons. First, I have 10 years' experience on the Select Committee on Home Affairs. Whenever we turned our minds to the Data Protection Registrar's work, I got the impression--I cannot speak for other members of that Committee--that she was grateful that somebody in Parliament had recognised her existence and the important work that she did. The Select Committee on Home Affairs--at least one member is present--might want to take on the task of debating the commissioner's reports. I am, however, always left with the feeling that we on the Select Committee--the same is not true of this Committee's deliberations--mostly turn our minds to matters such as drugs, crime, prisons and criminal justice. There are so many such issues that we do not have enough time for issues such as those before this Committee. It is important that Parliament deals regularly with the commissioner's work.
<P>
The second reason why Parliament should consider her work is that--as we have discovered during our proceedings over the past two or three weeks--the Bill moves into serious, uncharted waters. We are providing a range of new powers, offences, obligations and requirements. In addition, there are new opportunities for data controllers to process data about individuals under the special purposes. Hon. Members should be clear that the arrangements work properly. You, Mr. Welsh, have sat independently observing our discussion. Although I would not go so far as to say that the Committee has been leaving a great deal to chance, I am sure that you can see that the success of practical implementation, like the proof of the pudding, will be very much in the eating when the time comes.
<P>
The Minister may well say that an obligation to debate the reports annually goes too far and that Parliament is very busy. I would entirely understand such sentiments. I want to tease out from the Government a commitment to providing Parliament with a proper opportunity on the Floor of the House to debate the workings of the legislation and to reflect on experience. When the provisions are enforced and transitional arrangements are brought in, a range of people will find that they have come within the purview of the Data Protection Commissioner. The Bill will apply to manual records, and will effect a great many businesses. Hon. Members will write to the Minister and his successor asking what on earth it is all about and seeking help.
<P>
I seek assurance that Parliament will have the opportunity to reflect on the various reports in a structured debate in the House. I have made my views clear. The Opposition do not wish to press the amendment, but we ask the Government to acknowledge our serious concerns about debating the reports in the House. I seek the Minister's assurance that the Government intend to provide an opportunity to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Allan </B>(Sheffield, Hallam): New clause 3 is a drafting error. It is not usually necessary to propose a new clause when its wording is included in the Bill. Perhaps the proposal reflects a feeling that, by the time the Committee reached clause 51, it would need some light relief. As such, it is unnecessary to speak in support of it. If it were agreed to, people would say that clause 51 is so good they named it twice. New clause 3 is purely an error that reflects the complexity of the Bill.
<P>
I shall briefly comment on the points made by the hon. Member for Ryedale about amendment No. 273. I support his position--reports as serious as those in question should not disappear into a void. They merit proper parliamentary scrutiny. I agree that the Select Committee on Home Affairs may have a role. How does the Minister envisage the reports progressing? As the hon. Member for Ryedale pointed out, the legislation will have a far wider scope than the 1984 Act and it is therefore likely to cause more public interest. As parliamentary representatives, hon. Members are likely to come across people who feel that they are on the wrong side of the legislation in respect of the information held about them. We are also likely to encounter companies that have a problem with it. It would in some ways be a dereliction of duty for the reports not to have a decent and proper parliamentary airing.
<P>
Liberal Democrats do not intend to press new clause 3. We support the comments of the hon. Member for Ryedale on amendment No. 273.
<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> I am glad that the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Allan) agrees that new clause 3 is a duplication of clause 51, as that will pare two or three minutes off the observations that I must make. However, I confirm that the new clause is not necessary.
<P>
The hon. Member for Ryedale was uncharacteristically pessimistic about the Bill when he said that we were heading into uncharted territory.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> We are.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> To some extent, the hon. Gentleman is right, but he should accept that we have moved forward with the directive and built on the experience of the 1984 Act in such a way that we are not in entirely unknown territory. We are building on accumulated experience.
<P>
However, the hon. Member for Ryedale is right that clause 51 is important.
<P>
It requires the Data Protection Commissioner to give an account to Parliament each year of the work that she has been doing. Such a transparency provision for an independent regulator of this kind is essential. Parliament should be kept in touch with the work of the regulator and have the opportunity of debating that work, should it choose to do so, either in the Chamber or, perhaps, in a Select Committee.
<P>
It is, of course, for Parliament, or a Select Committee, to determine whether it wishes to be bound to spend time debating the commissioner's report each year. If experience is anything to go by, I suspect that that will not be Parliament's choice.
<P>
The Data Protection Registrar has laid reports before Parliament since that office was created. I am not aware that Parliament has yet seen a need to debate any of those annual reports. That gives a crude idea of how market forces work in the House.
<P>
The Government's preference would be to leave matters as they are. That would mean that the House of Commons could decide, in the light of particular circumstances, that it wished to debate a particular report of the commissioner, but it would not be bound to do so. The pressures on parliamentary time from both Government and Opposition are such that I do not think it right in principle to set aside time for any but the most important matters. I do not believe that there is either demand or necessity to require that the reports be debated, although it is right and proper for them to be submitted. Parliament may choose to debate a report, but it must have that choice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I shall deal with that reply briefly. It was important to have that debate and to stress that Parliament should have the opportunity to revisit the effects of the Bill. I look forward to the day when I shall stand at the Government Dispatch Box and introduce a debate on the Data Protection Commissioner's annual report.
<P>
I did not want to steal the thunder of the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam, but it did occur to me that new clause 3 merely replicated clause 51. I scratched my head and wondered whether I was reading a more up-to-date copy of the Bill. However, I suppose that it would be only fair to the hon. Gentleman, according to our earlier analogy, to say that the clue for 1 down appears to be the same as that for 1 across.
<P>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I seek an explanation from the Minister. We have already accepted clause 45, which contained the phrase ``substantial public importance''. Those words have particular relevance in clause 52, which gives the Data Protection Commissioner the opportunity to provide assistance to an individual wanting to bring proceedings under the Bill, particularly in relation to the data subject access provisions--the right of access under clause 7, the issue of causing damage or distress under clause 9, the issue of inaccurate data under clause 12, which will become clause 13, and the automated decision-making provisions in clause 13, which will become clause 12.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Subsection (2) provides that the commissioner will not grant an application for assistance unless
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``in his opinion, the case involves a matter of substantial public importance.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am sure that the Minister understands why we wanted to raise this matter in the stand part debate. I did not think that there was a suitably sensible amendment to be tabled. What are the matters of ``substantial public importance'' that the Government think the data protection commissioner ought to have in mind when deciding whether to grant assistance to an applicant? She might be faced with a David and Goliath situation, whereby an individual wanted to take on the big battalions of the press, say, or a large commercial enterprise.
<P>
The clause is important. The Opposition welcome its general intentions, but we need to know what limits there will be on the help that might be available from the commissioner to an individual pursuing proceedings under these four important clauses.
<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> As the hon. Gentleman said, the clause forms an important part of the mechanism relating to processing for special purposes. In respect of enforcement in such cases, the Bill puts particular emphasis on the individual seeking a remedy for a breach of his or her rights. The commissioner's enforcement powers are narrower than they are in other cases.
<P>
It is necessary to ensure an appropriate balance between an individual's rights and those of controllers. Additional assistance should be available to individuals who want to seek a remedy in the courts; that is the purpose of clause 52. It allows the commissioner to offer such assistance, as set out in schedule 10, but as the hon. Member for Ryedale rightly said, she may do so only in cases involving a matter of substantial public importance. That ensures that the power is focused where it is most likely to be useful.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman wanted to know what matters we had in mind. I will not be tempted down that path--it is impossible to say, because the grounds would vary from case to case. It is a matter for the courts. We want the commissioner to focus on matters of real importance--I accept that we must ensure that important cases are not missed through a lack of resources. That is an essential part of the arrangements relating to special purposes. It goes to the central point of article 9 of the directive: the reconciliation of the privacy rights of the individual with freedom of expression. It is therefore right that clause 52 should remain as drafted; although no one has sought to amend it--the hon. Gentleman rightly said that it would be difficult to do so--it would not be helpful to be overly prescriptive about the proposal. The arrangements are in place and they will vary, possibly by a wide margin, in each case. To state what the grounds might be would be impossible and unhelpful.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am disappointed with the Minister's answer, but I can understand why I have been unable to tempt him to specify what ``substantial public importance'' might mean. If I understand the Minister correctly, the intention is to provide a mechanism whereby a matter which the courts ought to determine does not go begging for want of a resource for the plaintiff. On that basis, we have at least clarified what the proposal intends; I am somewhat relieved that Members of Parliament will not receive letters saying, ``The commissioner won't help me,'' rather than, ``The ombudsman won't help me''--I have had a few such letters lately. I am sure that the Minister understands my point. It was important to raise the matter and I am grateful for the Minister's response.

<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 275, in page 31, line 25, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(7A) The Commissioner in making any general report under section 51(1) shall include reference to the exercise of his functions under this section.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This is a minor-looking amendment, but it refers to an important matter. We are simply asking that in the commissioner's annual report to Parliament on the exercise of her functions in clause 51, which we recently discussed, attention should be drawn to the important functions set out in clause 53. Not for the first time, I shall probably give the Minister the answer that he will give me: that clause 51(1) covers the point. I am grateful to you, Mr. Welsh, for selecting the amendment, which was tabled because I want the Committee to debate the matter. It relates to wide-ranging responsibilities in respect of our relations with overseas interests, especially the European Commissioner and the European Parliament.
<P>
I do not want to tempt my hon. Friend the Member for Esher and Walton (Mr. Taylor) to jump to his feet about any matter related to Europe, but I am sure that the Minister will recognise that the powers mean, in effect, that the commissioner will be doing a number of things of which, unless they are reported, Parliament will not necessarily be aware. The commissioner will not embark on some new directive, but she will reach agreement on co-operation in respect of other supervisory authorities in EEA states in connection with the performance of their respective duties. She will be exchanging information and exercising within the United Kingdom, at the request of a supervisory authority in another EEA state, the functions of the commissioner and so on. It is therefore important that we at least alert the House, through the report of our proceedings in the Committee, to the important functions of the commissioner set out in clause 53.
<P>
Amendment No. 275 would facilitate that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Taylor (Esher and Walton):</B> An invitation from my own Front Bench spokesman to get to my feet is one that I can scarcely resist. I support my hon. Friend's efforts to bring the matter to the Committee's attention, and that is why I am speaking to this amendment rather than waiting for the clause stand part debate. I should like to tease out from the Minister some of the underlying principles that are involved.
<P>
The interests of data protection are the same throughout the European Union, although they may be applied in different ways by national data commissioners. Any single market that has free movement of goods, services, capital and people must also have free movement and processing of data for commercial and other purposes. It is important to establish that principle, regardless of the data protection obligations that it creates.
<P>
I am unclear as to the significance of the clause heading, ``International co-operation''. The data protection directive refers to countries outside the European economic area that do not have--I paraphrase--comparable data protection systems. The most obvious example is the United States of America. This week I attended a conference on the regulation of cyberspace with delegates from America and Canada, and that issue occupied considerable time. There may be difficulties ahead--not necessarily a trade war, but serious problems nonetheless. International commerce is increasingly based on access to data, processing of data and transfer of data. Anything that obstructs that will cause a hiccup in international trade.
<P>
The Committee has reached clause 53 of the Bill without discovering the Government's position on that. The problem was not created by the Government; it is inherent in the directive, and the Bill will apply the directive in United Kingdom law. I should like to use the debate on the amendment as a peg on which to hang consideration of the crucial problem that underlies co-operation within the European Economic Area. What will happen when information within the European Economic Area goes outside to a country that does not have comparable legislation, bearing in mind the difficulties involved in regulating the international electronic networks that will convey the data?
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I shall make some observations on the hon. Gentleman's point in a moment. I turn first to amendment No. 275.
<P>
The amendment would require the commissioner to include in her annual report to Parliament information about how she has undertaken the international duties placed on her by clause 53. Those international duties are significantly wider than those undertaken by the registrar under the 1984 Act. I agree with the hon. Member for Ryedale, for the reasons just outlined by the hon. Member for Esher and Walton, that it is important that the commissioner's report to Parliament should cover those points. That is essential because of the speeding up of technological progress and technology's increasing complexity.
<P>
Clause 51(1) requires the commissioner to present
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a general report on the exercise of his functions under this Act.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The obligation imposed covers all the functions of the commissioner, including those relating to her international obligations. So the specific requirement in the amendment is unnecessary.
<P>
A provision corresponding to that in clause 51(1) is already made in section 39(5) of the 1984 Act. As a consequence, the registrar's annual reports always include a section covering the international work undertaken during the course of the year. Clause 51(1) will ensure that that excellent practice will continue.

<P>

<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> In deepest Surrey, ``Esher'' is pronounced with a long ``ee'' sound at the beginning.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I am sure that it is a delightful place and, given that the hon. Gentleman is its representative, firmly at the heart of Europe.
<P>
The clause deals with the Data Protection Commissioner's international functions. It goes a little further than the directive and covers a range of functions under the Council of Europe convention on data protection, including co-operation with other supervisory authorities such as those in the EEA states. It also covers functions that she might be directed to carry out by order of the Secretary of State in relation to other of this country's international obligations, such as those under the Europol convention, with which I know that the hon. Member for Ryedale will be familiar.
<P>
The clause also covers assistance that the commissioner might be directed by the Secretary of State to provide in relation to data protection matters arising in a colony. In that regard, we have Gibraltar specifically in mind. It also provides for functions relating to the transfer of data to non-EEA countries.
<P>
Those are important functions, some of them expressly required by the directive or by other international obligations. The Bill must provide for them, and that is what the clause does.
<P>
The relationship between the European Union and third countries is being considered by the Commission, which is also discussing with member states the question of international relations in cyberspace, to which the hon. Member for Esher and Walton referred. The United Kingdom is involved in preparation for an important ministerial conference to take place in Ottawa.
<P>
The clause offers the right framework for new international arrangements.
<P>
<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> It is simpler if I intervene on the Minister now. I understand what he has said and am aware of the talks taking place. However, it would be convenient for me, and I am sure for other members of the Committee, if he would write before the Bill returns on Report with details of any progress made. That would free him from having to make any such statement today, which I accept might be difficult.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> That would be a useful way to make progress. As far as I can, I give the hon. Gentleman some of the assurances that he seeks, but if he feels that it would be helpful to have an update before the Bill returns on Report I undertake to write to him and other hon. Members with that information.
<P>
I hope that the hon. Member for Ryedale agrees that amendment No. 275 is unnecessary and that the Government intend to progress our very important relationship with the rest of the world in an amicable and good-hearted way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his final comment and for his confirmation that clause 51(1) covers the point that we sought to include in the Bill. It is a serious matter. I am grateful, too, for the Minister's acknowledgement that the powers to the commissioner have wide-ranging implications. I take it from what he said that he would anticipate any matter of substance in relation to the exercise of those powers in a given 12-month period to be included and commented on in the Data Protection Commissioner's report. I am looking for the Minister to nod.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I did say that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I know, I was just making doubly sure. We will not press the amendment.
<P>
We shall shortly come to clause 63, when we will discuss whether order-making powers should be subject to affirmative or negative resolution. Clause 53(2) allows the Secretary of State to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``make provision as to the functions to be discharged by the Commissioner as the designated authority in the United Kingdom for the purposes of Article 13 of the Convention.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is a very important power. Under clause 63, it would be subject only to negative resolution. I make that point now to pray in aid of my argument later. It is one matter--at least--that the Government ought to reconsider.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Esher and Walton was entirely right in what he said. I hope that before we fully discharge our duties in this Standing Committee, we shall have the opportunity to debate the matter in a little more detail--perhaps when we consider the eighth principle in schedule 1(14). For now, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robert Syms </B>(Poole): Perhaps I may make a quick point. Under clause 53, the Data Protection Commissioner collaborates with data protection commissioners in other member states. Where there is a problem with a country outside the European economic area, there is a provision for a Community finding. Under article 31 of the directive, that is done under weighted majority voting within the European Community.
<P>
Will the Minister assure me that any decision in relation to a country outside the European economic area will be taken by Ministers and not be commissioners meeting collectively? They may make recommendations, but I want to ensure that the commissioners themselves will not take a decision relating to a third party country. I hope that I am making my point clear.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> As I understand it, such decisions involving a third country would be taken by the Council of Ministers, not by commissioners. Thus, I can give the hon. Gentleman the assurance that he seeks.
<P>
Clause 53 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 54</center></H4>
<H4><center>Unlawful obtaining etc. of personal data</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 274, in page 31, line 33, after `the', insert `written'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss amendment No. 217, in page 32, leave out lines 4 to 6.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway: </b>This too, is an extremely important clause. It creates a serious offence of unlawfully obtaining personal data. The key to any defence is the phrase in subsection </B>(1):
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``A person must not knowingly or recklessly, without the consent of the data controller . . . obtain or disclose personal data''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
How will that consent be demonstrated? That should be made explicit; otherwise there will be a lack of certainty. I am sure that the Minister can envisage someone saying in his defence, ``I rang the data controller and he said, `That's fine.''' There might be no trace of the call later and the person might say, ``I thought that I would have had the data controller's permission.''
<P>
Given the importance of the matter, I want to tease out a proper explanation from the Minister. If consent has to be in writing, we will be on firm ground and there will be certainty. The simple point is that consent must be made explicit for it to be certain, particularly because acting without consent will create an important offence.
<P>
We do not intend to suggest in amendment No. 217 that the Minister deletes subsection (2)(d) because there clearly needs to be a public interest defence. Under what circumstances, however, could the unlawful obtaining of data be regarded as in the public interest? The offence that the clause creates requires a person to act ``knowingly or recklessly''. By virtue of subsection (2), it would not apply where an action
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``was necessary for the purpose of preventing or detecting crime, or''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
when a person
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``acted in the reasonable belief that he had in law the right to obtain or . . . procure . . . the information''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That defence is extremely wide. I understand from the Data Protection Registrar's office that there is no such defence in the 1984 Act. It would, therefore, be helpful if the Minister explained what circumstances the phrase ``in the public interest'' covers.
<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> This clause creates offences concerned with obtaining, disclosing and procuring the disclosure of information without the consent of the data controller. Amendment No. 274 raises the issue of how that consent is to be signified, and the hon. Member for Ryedale gave examples of the confusing messages that might be involved.
<P>
To set the amendment in its context, it may be helpful if I say something about the background and purpose of the clause. It has its origins in subsection (6) and subsequent provisions of section 5 of the 1984 Act. Those provisions made it an offence to procure the disclosure of personal data in contravention of the data user's register entry. It is also an offence to sell of offer for sale any data obtained. The provisions were included in the 1984 Act by the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994. They responded to concerns about the activities of private investigators who made a business out of obtaining personal information. Parliament decided that that was undesirable and outlawed such activities.
<P>
The principle intention behind the clause is to preserve those very important and worthwhile provisions from the 1984 Act. We have, however, had to set about dealing with the matter in a different way. Under the 1984 Act, the offence is based on breach of the data user's register entry. That approach would not work in the Bill. As the Committee knows, notification under the Bill is very different from registration under the Act. They are totally separate. The notification arrangements cannot be used in the same way, for example, to create an offence of disclosing data. It was necessary to start from scratch.
<P>
As the register entry can no longer be used as the base point for determining what is lawful, the Government have had to find an alternative. We have adopted the approach of basing the offence on the absence of the data controller's consent. In other words, if the data controller consents to a particular disclosure, it is lawful. If he does not, it is an offence, subject to the defences for which the clause provides.
<P>
Among other things, the offence will cover cases such as those in which a person calls up information on a computer and reads it without doing anything more. The Committee will recall that in the case of Regina v. Brown, such activity was not found to be using personal data under the 1984 Act.
<P>
12.15 pm
<P>
The amendment would broaden the offence by making it unlawful to disclose personal data without the controller's written consent. That is not a practical approach. It may be relatively straightforward to provide for written consent to disclosures by a data controller's employees, provided that their processing activities are fairly routine and predictable, but in every organisation the unexpected sometimes occurs. Will people confronted by unique or unusual circumstances, in which immediate response is necessary, be required to delay dealing with those circumstances while they seek written consent to make a specific disclosure?
<P>
The clause will also make obtaining information about the controller's consent unlawful. In many organisations, obtaining personal data within the requirements of the data protection principles is a routine occurrence, and may, indeed, be central to the organisation's activities. If the amendment were accepted, every person would be required to have the controller's written consent to obtain information. It is difficult to see how that would work in practice.
<P>
Requiring written consent is not a sensible way of dealing with the problem, and it is not desirable. Any additional protection that written consent may offer is more than offset by the additional burdens that it would place on data controllers. Contrary to the amendment, we believe that persons obtaining or disclosing someone else's data should be able to rely on the general law of consents, which the courts are very used to applying, for example, in the law of theft of property, which has many parallels with the offences under discussion.
<P>
Amendment No. 217 raises the issue of the scope of the offence and asks whether defence should be made on the ground that the obtainment, disclosure or procurement is in the public interest. The Government are firmly convinced that such defence should be possible. Subsection (2) deals with a number of defences. They cover matters such as the prevention or detection of crime, statutory or other legal authority, and the reasonable belief of the person in question that he was acting with legal authority or with the consent of the data controller.
<P>
Those provisions do not, however, cover all circumstances in which it might be justifiable to obtain or to disclose data without the consent of the data controller. Let me give some examples, as requested by the hon. Member for Ryedale.
<P>
A ``whistle-blowing'' employee might want to draw attention to the proper authority about the behaviour of his employer, which is so seriously unacceptable, without necessarily being a criminal offence, that it should not continue. Unauthorised obtaining or disclosure may be justified, for example, when environmental safety is at stake or when public health is at issue. There may be circumstances in which someone would want to pass on, or obtain, information and it is of great importance to the public and to other agencies to know about it.
<P>
The Committee has had important debates about processing for special purposes; both sides of the Committee agree that it is necessary to ensure that the Bill does not inhibit freedom of expression by the media. Without the public interest defence in clause 54, journalists might find it difficult to obtain the information that they need to do their investigative public interest work. No doubt there are many other examples about the need for this defence; that is what makes it difficult to include an exhaustive list of situations in the Bill.
<P>
The hon. Member for Ryedale has hesitations about the defence, which I understand. I agree with him that many share his reservations, but I hope that I have been able to persuade him that it is necessarily so for good reason. Moreover, I draw his attention to the inclusion of the word ``justified'' in the provision. It is not sufficient that the obtaining, disclosing or procuring should be in the public interest; it must also be justified as being in the public interest in all the circumstances of a particular case.
<P>
That makes the threshold for the test being satisfied a little higher than the simple public interest test: the clear undesirability of unauthorised obtaining or disclosure must be outweighed, of course. We have included it expressly to help to narrow the scope of the provision, to limit reliance on the exemption to cases in which there is a genuine justification for what is being done. Of course, even if the unauthorised obtaining or disclosure does not fall within the immediate criminal sanctions of the provision, a civil liberty liability remedy may be available or it may engage the commissioner's enforcement powers if they are carried out by the data controller.
<P>
It is a complicated matter and important issues are at stake. I appreciate that a fine judgment must be made, and we have probably got it about right. In those circumstances, I invite the hon. Gentleman to reconsider his amendment and perhaps seek leave to withdraw it.

<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> Again, I am grateful for the Minister's response. In respect of the public interest issue, I feared that the interests of journalism might be mentioned in the Minister's reply as clearly the clause must be considered in the context of clause 31. Throughout the Bill, there are clauses that must be considered in conjunction with others. The Minister is right to say that there must be a difference, and we have had the opportunity of exploring what it means.
<P>
There are bound to be cases--finely balanced, as the Minister says--in which there is no consent, but the individuals involved thought that there was; whether or not the defence in clause 54(2)(b) will cover them will be for the courts to decide. We have explored the matter, however, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, we may take the following amendments: No. 287, in page 32, line 33, at end insert

</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 288, in page 32, line 40, after `Act', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`or under any other enactment'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> This, too, is an important clause. The commissioner's staff, as public servants, must respect commercial confidences and should not disclose information that could cause distress or damage to people without proper justification. The clause provides a criminal sanction that goes beyond what is required in the directive. That may not be a bad thing, but it creates quite serious offences if those public servants breach the confidentiality of any of the information available to them. The amendments will allow the Committee to discuss some of the anxiety that the Data Protection Registrar has expressed about the provision and with which I am sure that the Minister is familiar.
<P>
Amendment No. 286 deals with the question of harm. The Data Protection Registrar has made the valid point that it should be essential to carry out a harm test before a member of staff could be considered guilty of an offence of disclosing information in breach of confidence. The wording of the amendment is precisely that suggested by the Data Protection Registrar, and would require that the information disclosed would have to be
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``potentially damaging to any person''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
before the disclosure would be caught by the clause.
<P>
Amendment No. 287 deals with circumstances in which information is given innocently by a person in an official capacity. It would get around the problem caused when that function is not covered by the phrase ``lawful authority'' by using the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``in accordance with his official duty''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Subsection (2)(e) provides for the ``substantial public interest'' test. It was interesting that the Minister used the journalistic example when we discussed the public interest test under clause 54, because here the circumstances are similar, although the roles are reversed. A journalist may telephone a member of the Data Protection Commissioner's staff, who may give out information in all innocence, out of a sense of duty, only to discover that the disclosure was unlawful. Even if no harm was caused, that member of staff technically would be guilty of an offence--a serious matter, as I am sure that the Committee would agree.
<P>
Finally, amendment No. 288 would provide under subsection (2)(b) an exemption for information that is
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``provided for the purpose of its being made available to the public . . . under any provision of this Act,''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
One of the key facets of the legislation is that it will make large quantities of information available to the public. However, it does not extend to making information available under the provisions of any other legislation. I am thinking specifically of a freedom of information Bill, which the Government have promised but which has yet to come before the House.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Clause 56 should cover not only ``this Act'', but also ``any other enactment''. That would provide flexibility for the drafting of future legislation. The Committee can only speculate about the types of future legislation that may involve the Data Protection Commissioner and her staff in giving information to the public. However, we have been assured by Ministers that a freedom of information Bill will come to pass, It is a pity that the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam is not in the Room, because he would be interested in this aspect of the debate.
<P>
Freedom of information legislation would place obligations on public servants in many Departments. Do the provisions of clause 56 take account of that? It would be better to deal with the issue now than to find that the debate has to be held again among those souls fortunate enough to serve on a freedom of information Bill Committee.
<P>
Ought there not to be a harm test? Ought there not to be an exemption that covers information that is released because a public servant working for the commissioner believed it to be their official duty? Should we not ensure that the Bill covers the requirement to give information under future legislation?
<P>
<B>Dr. Palmer:</B> Personally, I think that amendment No. 286 is misguided, and I am surprised that the public servants involved are seeking an exemption of this kind. If data controllers are to deal with the commissioner with confidence, they must be sure that the data will be kept completely confidential, rather than confidential only if no harm appears to be caused. There are numerous circumstances in which the release of information would not necessarily be harmful, but it would nevertheless be wrong for the commissioner to chat casually to journalists or others about it.
<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> Clause 56 effectively puts a duty of confidentiality, subject to a criminal sanction, on the Data Protection Commissioner and her staff and agents in respect of confidential information that they acquire in the course of their functions under the Bill.
<P>
	We have included a provision of this kind in the Bill because it is required by the directive. Article 28.7 of the directive requires member states to ensure that the members and staff of the supervisory authority--the commissioner in our case--are subject to a duty of what the directive calls professional secrecy in respect of the confidential information to which they have access. That duty of professional secrecy is to apply even after their formal connection with the supervisory authority has ended.
<P>
The Committee may wish to know that the registrar was unhappy with the provision to achieve that effect, which was included in the Bill as it was introduced in another place. She felt that it was too heavy handed, and that it would have made life difficult for her and her staff. In view of her concerns, the Government took another look at the provision and came up with a revised version, in close co-operation with the registrar. That version was substituted for the original provision on Report in another place, and is the clause that we have before us.
<P>
The Committee should be ware that, although the registrar thinks that the clause is an improvement on the previous one, she is still not entirely happy with using a criminal sanction to discharge our obligation under the directive.
<P>
We have given much thought to the provision, and have made several attempts to rework it. However, we can find no better way than clause 56 of giving effect to the obligations under the directive. Moreover, the Committee will see that the clause provides wide exemptions for the disclosure of information in circumstances in which it is legitimate to make disclosures; and that the offence applies only where the disclosure is made knowingly or recklessly.
<P>
Having explained the background, I shall deal now with the amendments in the name of the hon. Member for Rydale. Amendment No. 286, about which my hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe expressed concerns, would limit the offence to the disclosure of information that was potentially damaging to any person. We cannot agree to the amendment for two reasons. First, it would not be permitted by the directive. Article 28.7 of the directive refers to the need to protect any confidential information to which the supervisory authority has access. It does not limit it to confidential information that would cause damage if disclosed. Moreover, allowing the commissioner and her staff to disclose information that was given to them in confidence where there was no likelihood of damage being caused could be counterproductive. If the information were disclosed, people might be less inclined to be as open with the commissioner as they would otherwise be. That might have a harmful effect on the future effectiveness of her operations.
<P>
Amendment No. 287 would allow the disclosure of information if it was made in accordance with the official duty of the person concerned. The amendment is not necessary. Clause 56(2)(c) already permits disclosures that are made for the purposes of and are necessary for the discharge of any functions under the Bill. That deals with the point that the hon. Gentleman's amendment raises. A similar consideration applies to amendment No. 288, which would permit disclosures that were provided for the purpose of information being made available to the public under any other enactment besides the Bill. Provision for that is already made in clause 56(1)(c). If the information is already available to the public from another source, whether or not under another enactment, clause 56 does not apply to it. If the hon. Gentleman is thinking of information that the commissioner may make public under any other enactment, I am not sure what information he has in mind. The commissioner's functions are limited to those under the Bill. She has no function in respect of making public information under any other enactment. That deals with the hon. Gentleman's point about a future freedom of information Bill.
<P>
The link between the Bill and freedom of information is complex. We are carefully considering the provisions that will need to be made for the Bill to work properly in the context of freedom of information. The link will be even more complex because we shall need to make sure that freedom of information arrangements can be operated properly within the terms of the directive. However, the process of read-across is continuing and the Government will encourage it.
<P>
I doubt that the hon. Member for Ryedale will be entirely satisfied with what I have said. Complex matters are involved and some of the judgments that have had to be made remain the subject of mild dispute. However, the balance of the clause is about right, and I can assure him we are aware of the need to reconcile freedom of information with what we must do to honour the directive.

<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> The Minister has accepted that some dissatisfaction remains with the wording of the clause. Clearly, there is some disagreement between the registrar and the Home Office. I accept the Minister's assertion that the judgments are finely balanced. If our roles were reversed, I am sure that I would have adpoted much the same line, but that is part of the process of Standing Committees.
<P>
The Minister was right to say that the Government attempted in another place to make some changes. They have not proved entirely satisfactory to the registrar, but I am sure that all concerned will be grateful for what he has said.
<P>
I am tempted to be less charitable about the question of freedom of information as the Government are finding it difficult to balance some of the conflicting obligations and objectives. Inevitably, the Committee charged with considering any freedom of information Bill will have to consider its interaction with the provisions of this Bill.
<P>
There is a third element in the Government's grand, tripartite package of freedoms, and that is the Human Rights Bill. Given that that will be discussed on the Floor of the House tomorrow evening, the debate on these amendments has been worthwhile and I understand why the Minister can say no more on the matter.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take the following: Government new clause 5--Prohibition of requirement as to production of certain records.--
<P>
Government amendments Nos. 256 and 257.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I shall speak first to new clause 5. It introduces a new offence to deal with what is known as enforced subject access, which we have debated in the past. That layman's term covers the circumstance when one person forces another to hand over his data protection subject access record as a condition of being considered for, or obtaining, some form of benefit, such as a job.
<P>
That happens mainly with criminal records. Some employers tell job applicants to hand over a data protection subject access printout obtained from the police if they want to be considered for a job. Sometimes they ask for Department of Social Security contributions records, believing that gaps in contributions show a period in custody. They may or may not be right in that belief, but they do it nevertheless. Also, some foreign embassies ask for convictions records from visa applicants. The police and the DSS believe that of the approximately 100,000 subject access applications they receive each year, the vast majority are enforced. Often the letters come in standard form, for example, as prescribed by employers.
<P>
It can be argued that, subject to the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974, convictions should be made known and that data protection subject access is just the means of providing that knowledge. Against that, it can equally be argued that forcing people to use a right originally given for their own protection is improper. Both points have some force, each within their own frame of reference. Reconciling them is extremely difficult, because so much depends on the circumstances--the information and the purpose for which it is wanted.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
In the case of convictions, Parliament has taken an important step towards such reconciliation. The Police Act 1997 provides new arrangements for criminal record checks. Three types of certificate will become available from a new Criminal Records Agency--the basic ones covering only unspent convictions, and the others including spent convictions. Who should be entitled to what will be set out by order? Once in place, the new arrangements should not be circumvented. In particular, we think it wrong for employers who are not entitled to see a higher level certificate to obtain information about spent convictions through the data protection route.
<P>
We issued a consultation letter in May last year discussing a range of possible approaches to enforced subject access--a criminal offence; a civil tort; Data Protection Commissioner enforcement notices; the Data Protection Commissioner filtering subject access applications; and allowing subject access only in person, not in writing. We considered the responses and the practicalities with great care. We believe that only an offence would work. The other possible solutions would variously weaken normal subject access, be burdensome or not sufficiently effective.
<P>
We do not propose an offence lightly. Criminalising behaviour places a special duty on the Government and Parliament to focus carefully on significant social problems. The offence is therefore tailored in several important ways. It is limited to certain types of records--criminal records, prison records and DSS records. Under amendment No. 256, the list is extendable by order subject to affirmative resolution--to which the hon. Member for Ryedale referred earlier--in case the practice is diverted elsewhere. The offence is committeed only where the data subject is required to provide the specified data. We do not want to criminalise straight requests for information. It is perfectly legitimate for a potential employer to ask a job applicant for details of any criminal record. It should be a crime only if he requires provision of that information through the applicant's subject access right.
<P>
We are confining the offence to the types of situations where systematic use is most likely to occur, and where people are least likely to be acting in their private, as distinct from their professional, capacity. Those are employment and appointments--which would include recruitment, continued employment, and preferment or promotion--placing contracts, and providing goods, facilities or services to the public. We propose defences where it can be shown that the requirement was authorised by law or court order, or was justified as being in the public interest. But bearing in mind the planned dedicated channel for the supply of criminal records under the Police Act 1997, the public interest defence will explicitly exclude crime prevention or detection. Anyone who has that as a genuine motive will have an alternative route for obtaining appropriate information.
<P>
Bearing in mind the close link we see with the introduction of criminal record certificates, amendment No. 257 provides that new clause 5 cannot be brought into force before they are available. As with other offences under the Bill, by virtue of clause 57 only the Data Protection Commissioner or the Director of Public Prosecutions could prosecute. The punishment on conviction would be a fine, and amendment No. 255 would allow a court also to order the forfeiture, erasure or destruction of documents.
<P>
I hope that that gives the Committee a clear picture of our proposals.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I give a general welcome to new clause 5, which deals with the very difficult issue of enforced subject access. I am sure that the House will want to debate the matter on Report, given the importance of the clause and concerns about a number of clauses. I cannot pre-empt the mechanisms that people will seek to use, but the matter is important.
<P>
The view of Conservative Members is well documented in the previous Government's White Paper, ``On the Record''. It was suggested under the previous Government that the present system of enforced subject access had led to considerable abuse. During consideration of the Police Bill, Ministers made clear the then Government's view that a means of resolving the difficulty was necessary. On Report in the House of Lords, my right hon. and noble Friend Baroness Blatch gave an undertaking that the then Government would seek a mechanism to close off the abuse. In February last year, the then Minister, Mr. Tom Sackville, indicated in the House of Commons that the Government intended to close the loophole not with the Police Bill, but with legislation implementing the data protection directive. As the Minister knows, the then Government had embarked on detailed consultation about the implementation of the directive. That consultation led in part to the Bill now before the Committee.
<P>
It is useful to put on record that background to our proceedings, so that the Committee knows that the Opposition support the Government's intentions. It is fair to ask for the opportunity to consider the precise provisions again in detail. In fairness to the Minister, I should say that I read new clause 5 as relatively narrowly drawn. It avoids some concerns, such as the issue of social security records, which was raised during consideration of the Police Bill by the former Minister, Mr. Tom Sackville.
<P>
Subsection (2) of new clause 5 is interesting, and shows the extent to which striking the right balance is important but not always easy to achieve. The subsection would provide that anyone
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``concerned with the provision . . . of goods, facilities or services to the public must not, as a condition of providing . . . any goods, facilities or services to another person, require that other person or a third party to supply him with a relevant record or to produce a relevant record to him.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In other words, a person wanting to borrow money or to take out an insurance contract cannot be required to produce a certificate. Both matters would be dealt with quite properly by a declaration signed by the applicant when seeking to enter into the contract. In the insurance industry, contracts can be voided if a false declaration is made. Commercial organisations therefore do not need enforced subject access certificates to protect their interests. Other mechanisms exist, as I have described.
<P>
Amendment No. 257 shows how far new clause 5 must be considered in conjunction with the provisions of the Police Act 1997 and the introduction of the three types of certificates from the new Criminal Records Agency. The amendment means that new clause 5 will not come into effect until the sections in the Police Act 1997 dealing with criminal conviction certificates, criminal recored certificates and enhanced criminal record certificates are all in force.
<P>
Two questions arise. First, what happens in the meantime, until those three types of certificate are in force? The abuse that we have described remains possible. I hope that the Minister will say something now about that problem, as I hope will the Secretary of State on Report or Third Reading. What he says may not have the force of law, but he could make an appeal to organisations practising such abuse. Those organisations, when they understand what Parliament intends, may then realise their ethical obligation to abide by the spirit expressed in this Committee.
<P>
Secondly, when does the Minister anticipate that the provisions of the Police Act 1997 will be implemented? I do not ask that in a spirit of mischief, as that Act was introduced by the former Conservative Government. Obviously, implementation will not happen until some considerable time after Royal Assent has been granted in respect of this Bill, but all those hon. Members interested in the forthcoming debate on Report--whether or not they are part of this Committee--would be grateful for some indication from the Minister of the time scale involved.
<P>
I was not an integral part of the deliberations on the Police Bill. I was surprised at that, but do not complain about it, and I have always understood that the intention was that this Bill should deal with the problems that have been described. As the Government appear to have honoured the commitment of the previous Conservative Government, which they repeated in another place, we give a general welcome to new clause 5.

<P>

<B>Mr. Brian White (Milton Keynes, North East):</B> I have one brief question. The hon. Member for Ryedale (Mr. Greenway) said that there have been abuses, but I do not accept that. Some local authorities have had to ask for subject access: new clause 5 sets out the social services aspects of the problem, but there are others, such as those involving taxi licences. Will my hon. Friend the Minister deal with those when he replies?
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> Somehow I doubt it, given how late it is.
<P>
The hon. Member for Ryedale asked what will happen in the meantime, and I can tell him that there will be no enforced subject access offence. We must recognise the practical implications for many organisations.
<P>
It being One o'clock, The Chairman adjourned the Committee without Question put, pursuant to the Standing Order.
<P>
