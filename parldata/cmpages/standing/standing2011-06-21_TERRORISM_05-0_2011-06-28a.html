morning.<a class="bkMark" name="11062853000020">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">To
recap, in Thursday’s discussions, the Opposition view was that
the early part of the Bill is the meatier one in relation to the issues
that we face. Our contention is that the Government could introduce
amendments to the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005, which would 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 122<a class="bkMark" name="Column122">&#160;</a>
                  </div>deal with those issues more tidily. That was not, however, the
Minister’s view, and we had a useful discussion of the changes
in the Bill’s
proposals.<a class="bkMark" name="11062853000021">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Government contend that those changes do not pose a significant risk to
the public: if there is an increased risk, it is mitigated by the
resources that will be given to the police and the security services to
deal with that risk. Our concern is that we do not want a lessening of
the risk, particularly when there might be more high-profile
attacks—for example, with the Olympics and the
Paralympics—and opportunities for those who wish us harm to do
us harm. We are firm in wanting to ensure that protections are in
place.<a class="bkMark" name="11062853000022">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
schedule is the meat of the regime for terrorism prevention and
investigation measures, as it enables a whole raft of measures to be
imposed, including measures on overnight residence, travel, exclusion,
movement directions, financial services, property, electronic
communications, association, work or studies, photography and
monitoring measures, many of which we will discuss this
morning.<a class="bkMark" name="11062853000023">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
first group of amendments concerns curfews. I well remember the House
being what I can only describe as full of laughter when the Home
Secretary, in either a statement on the counter-terrorism review or on
Second Reading, spoke about home residence and the overnight
requirement. As far as I am concerned, that is a curfew. Whichever way
the Minister dresses it up, it is a curfew. In their evidence, Mr
Osborne and the Director of Public Prosecutions said that, regardless
of the fact that we all want prosecutions, which is the first port of
call, we need to achieve consistency and an understanding of the
measures that are in place, and that the police and security services
were comfortable—“comfortable” might not be the
right word, but I will use it—with the way in which control
orders were
adopted.<a class="bkMark" name="11062853000024">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">On
the overnight residence requirement, the Government are changing the
language—I know that the hon. Member for Cambridge will not
agree with this—just to satisfy or placate the Liberal party.
Under their consensual agreement, they are changing the terminology, so
that it does not look so harsh. However, we are talking about ensuring
that people who pose a threat to our society in the ways that we have
all seen over the recent past are restricted in their movements at
home. Later, we will discuss amendments relating to accommodation, and
whether measures should be agreed or be introduced at the Secretary of
State’s
direction.<a class="bkMark" name="11062853000025">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Why
is there a need for the name change in having an overnight residence
requirement as opposed to a curfew? Why is there no definition of the
time frame of that curfew in the Bill? We have tabled amendments on
possible time frames. What is the Government’s thinking about
the, in my view, lessening of the current
position?<a class="bkMark" name="11062853000026">&#160;</a>

We heard from Mr Osborne that it will take 12 months to put all the
required assets in place, such as electronic surveillance and the
training of individuals, so we would expect consistency in the Bill.
The Minister must know that the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of

more restrictions on young offenders than this Bill will impose on
terrorists.<a class="bkMark" name="11062853000033">&#160;</a>

Punishment of Offenders Bill provides for the curfew period that can be
attached to a community sentence or a suspended sentence to be
increased from 12 hours to 16 hours. On the face of it, the

curfew provisions for anti-social behaviour are likely to be more
draconian than such provisions for
terrorism.<a class="bkMark" name="11062853000034">&#160;</a>

properly to manage the risk, which involves extra costs and resources,

third day of deliberations. I want to concentrate my remarks on
amendment 3 and amendments 4 to 7. My view is that we should either
remove the requirement that the residence measure can apply only
overnight, or, if the Committee is not minded to follow my preference,
we should at least define what we mean by “overnight”. My
first point develops the observations that my hon. Friend the Member
for Bradford South has already made, and they reflect the main theme
that emerged from our deliberations last Thursday. If the requirements
set out in schedule 1 represent a loosening of the conditions available
to the Secretary of State or the Department on suspects subject to
TPIMs, it is undeniable that the risk increases. The risk can be
mitigated, but it is essential to remember that mitigation is not the
same as elimination, as Lord Howard reminded us when he gave evidence
to the Committee. To mitigate that risk, there is a requirement for
additional resources, because there will be a requirement for more
surveillance teams, as Stuart Osborne told us when he gave
evidence.<a class="bkMark" name="11062853000049">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It
is important to remember that, as we begin the next phase of our
deliberations—the key phase—looking at schedule 1, a
loosening of the conditions means a greater risk, which can be
mitigated, not eliminated. That mitigation will require significant
additional resources.<a class="bkMark" name="11062853000050">&#160;</a>

because relocation is no longer available, the risk is greater.

additional surveillance measures that are being put in place will
address that additional
risk.<a class="bkMark" name="11062853000051">&#160;</a>

it clear that she is committing additional resources to the measure.
She quoted the director general 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 126<a class="bkMark" name="Column126">&#160;</a>
                  </div>of the Security Service on Second Reading saying that that would
mitigate—not eliminate—the risk. There was no comment on
whether that risk would be reduced to the level under control orders. I
applaud the Home Secretary for putting those additional resources in,
but I am sceptical as to whether they will be sufficient, given the
loosening of the requirements in the Bill, but I will be looking at the
measure
closely.<a class="bkMark" name="11062853000052">&#160;</a>

find it curious—this is a philosophical point and although I am
not much of a philosopher, I will stray that way—that those who
argued from a philosophical point of view on civil liberties that we
need to ensure that we do not encroach too far on to civil liberties
and that the demands and requirements of legislation such as this
should be reduced to an absolute minimum are prepared to see an
increase in the level of surveillance on those individuals. The hon.

civil liberties want to see a system where there is more, rather than
less,

deliberations, but I would hate it if we ran out of time for
considering all the important elements of the Bill because we kept
returning to whether we want prosecutions. Of course we want
prosecutions. That is the starting point and always has been the
starting point in control order legislation. It will be the starting
point for TPIMs. It is not an issue that Opposition Members contest.
Can we please just put that to one side and stop returning to it? It is
agreed territory between all parties in Committee. All I am pointing
out is that every hour less on a curfew or an overnight residence
requirement is an hour more of surveillance. That seems to be an
interesting rebalancing of civil liberties—replacing something
that is seen, understood, known and spelled out in the law with
something that is not seen.<a class="bkMark" name="11062853000058">&#160;</a>

operate surveillance, but that is something that follows an individual
rather than disrupts their behaviour. That was my right hon.

will press on with the problem with “overnight” and some
of the difficulties that the lack of a definition will cause for the

plenty to say about this, but it seems clear to me that the intention
behind introducing “overnight” as part of the residence
requirement is to lessen the period over any 24 hours in which someone
is required to be in a particular place. That will increase the amount
of time that they can be out and about and able to associate, albeit
that provisions elsewhere in the Bill will place restrictions on
association and the ability to go to certain places. There will
certainly be more hours in the day when those individuals can be out in
the community, which brings additional
pressures.<a class="bkMark" name="11062853000071">&#160;</a>

promised to say something about the case law on curfews and its
significance. There is an interesting case, which I am sure members of
the Committee were able to look at, called Secretary of State for the
Home Department <em>v.</em> JJ and others. The important rule is that a
curfew that lasts for 18 hours or more contravenes article 5 of the
European convention on human rights. In other words, it is a
deprivation of liberty and cannot be allowed within the curfew
requirements imposed under a control order. However, the court ruled in
the same case that 16 hours are permitted. We therefore know through
the challenge and the cut and thrust of what has gone on in the courts
that 16-hour curfews are permitted. The Home Office, in its own ECHR
memorandum that goes with the Bill, states
that<a class="bkMark" name="11062853000072">&#160;</a>

Gentleman’s powerful remarks with great interest. The position
of the Labour party, as I understand it, is that there is no difference
between a curfew and an overnight 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 129<a class="bkMark" name="Column129">&#160;</a>
                  </div>residence requirement. He has just told the Committee—correctly,
I think—that as a matter of law, a curfew can last for 16 hours.
How long does he think “overnight” is? Does he agree that
it is certainly not 16 hours? If so, is it not also correct that an
overnight residence requirement is different from a
curfew?<a class="bkMark" name="11062853000074">&#160;</a>

“overnight” that applies under the legislation should be
a reasonable person’s view of what “overnight”
means. I will come on to that in more detail in a minute. I do not know
any reasonable person who thinks that “overnight” lasts
for 16 hours. A residence requirement will therefore inevitably be
shorter than 16 hours, which means a greater risk and a greater
challenge to the police and the Security
Service.<a class="bkMark" name="11062853000075">&#160;</a>

shadow Minister nodding, but it follows from that that the point he

no difference between an overnight residency requirement and a

just undermined that

                  </strong> No. The principle is the same. In other words,
someone is required to be in a specific place for a specific period.
That is a curfew, and that will apply under the overnight residence
requirements. My argument, which is crucial to the debate, is that on
any interpretation of “overnight”, it will mean fewer
hours covered, which will mean more hours for the suspect to be in the
community, leading to a bigger risk and a bigger challenge for the
Security Service and the police. Frankly, I say to the hon. and learned
Gentleman and others that they need to weigh very carefully the balance
of that risk, because if they support the ill-defined overnight
residence requirement—if they tie the hands of the Secretary of
State and perhaps make it impossible for her to put the hours she
ideally wishes into an overnight residence order—they tip the
balance of risk in a way that is not helpful to the public or to the
police and security
services.</p>

			Column number: 130<a class="bkMark" name="Column130">&#160;</a>

for civil liberties with the need for collective public security. I
have said that several times on Second Reading and in Committee, but I
repeat it. I made that remark because the balance of risk crystallises
around such issues, but in raising that matter I did so for all members

curfew provisions in the Bill are reduced—they will be lesser
and the risk will be greater—and the argument is about whether
we have enough resources. I do not know what my right hon. Friend
thinks, but I am at a loss to reconcile those provisions with the Legal
Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Bill, which will increase
curfew provisions for people subject to a sentence from 12 to 16 hours,
which appears to be utterly inconsistent. People have pointed out that
there will have been convictions in such cases, but the point is about
managing risk. Why is dealing with some of the most dangerous people in
the country entirely

heinous crime, otherwise they would be sent to prison. Those who are
regarded as an acceptable risk to the community can be put on a curfew

managing risk as opposed to convicting for

This is probably not relevant, but I make the point that some people
who are subject to control orders have already been convicted of very
serious offences in the past and have a track record of being an
immense threat to the public. Why should someone on a TPIM who
represents a huge risk to public safety be on a less stringent curfew
than someone

               <p class="tabbed">I
will move on to the issue of the definition of
“overnight”, and how a reasonable person might interpret
“overnight.” By that, I mean that we will put the
decision in the hands of the courts, because they will interpret what a
reasonable person would think that meant.<a class="bkMark" name="11062853000095">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The Committee
should briefly reflect on what “overnight” means. I was
brought up to believe that there were four times in the day: morning,
afternoon, evening and night time. If I reflect on my day
today—we will all have had different starting times—I
kicked off at 6.30 am, and the morning will come to an end around
midday, slightly before the end of our deliberations. If my maths is
right, that is a five and a half hour period. People will have their
own definition of afternoon. It certainly starts at 12 noon. I would
argue that it goes up to 5 o’clock, so that is another five-hour
slot.<a class="bkMark" name="11062853000096">&#160;</a>

               <div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 132<a class="bkMark" name="Column132">&#160;</a>
               </div>
               <p class="tabbed">What do we
mean by evening? Here we have a real problem. This evening might last
from 5 o’clock to 10 o’clock, because it may
still be light at 10 o’clock. That is another five-hour slot.
That leaves us with 8 and a half hours as the definition of
“overnight,” just by subtracting the other three parts of
the day from it.<a class="bkMark" name="11062853000097">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I have quoted
my constituents before, and some of them might have a different
definition of how the day runs, but that would be their definition. Who
am I to challenge whether that would be a reasonable or unreasonable
definition? The Minister will have his own definition of
“overnight,” which might have changed somewhat in the
past few weeks, as he now has new responsibilities, which he has
already demonstrated that he fulfils with great skill and dedication.
That dedication will mean that his “overnight” is rather
shorter than it used to
be.<a class="bkMark" name="11062853000098">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
definition of evening is difficult, because we can say it ends at 10
o’clock tonight, but we would not say that in December. In
December, we might say that the evening began at 4 o’clock and
ended at 8 o’clock. Clearly, we have difficulties when we try,
in an intelligent way, to define what the reasonable person would mean
by
“overnight.”<a class="bkMark" name="11062853000099">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
return to the point that any hour that is not “overnight”
is another hour in which the police and the security services must
implement surveillance to mitigate the risk that is presented by such
people. That is why I have tabled amendments 3 and 4, which suggest
leaving out “overnight” and substituting,<a class="bkMark" name="11062853000100">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“at any time but
not exceeding 16 hours in any
24.”<a class="bkMark" name="11062853000301">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>Such
a change would reduce the risk and the cost and, crucially, it would
reflect the existing case law, which has been hammered out in recent
years under the control orders regime.<a class="bkMark" name="11062853000101">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It will be
interesting to hear the Minister’s response to the concerns
about the definition—about what we mean by
“overnight.” My suggestion is intended to helpful, but if
he is not minded to accept removing that term and substituting for it
the words in the amendment, it is important that we define in the Bill
what we mean by “overnight,” taking a reasonable view
across parties.<a class="bkMark" name="11062853000102">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I have made
three further suggestions in amendments 5 to 7. Amendment 5 proposes
that “overnight” should mean from 6 pm to 10 am, which
would push the definition of “overnight” to the maximum
16 hours. I remind the Committee that the courts have said that a
16-hour period is permitted when imposing restrictions. Amendment 7
proposes a shorter period, 6 pm to 6 am, which is 12 hours. The Home
Office itself said that a 12-hour period seemed perfectly in order when
it put together its document in relation to the European convention on
human rights. In amendment 6, I offer as a compromise—I am
trying to be reasonable—the period 6 pm to 8 am, which is 14
hours, and as such is somewhere in the middle.<a class="bkMark" name="11062853000103">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It will be
interesting to hear the Minister’s views, but I suspect that
“overnight” is in the Bill to emphasise a concern that
seems to be important to some Government Members—that suspects
should be able to remain in their own homes, which we shall debate
later in our proceedings. I think that “overnight” has
been included to reinforce that rather than as a result of careful
thinking about how “overnight” would operate in
practice.<a class="bkMark" name="11062853000104">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">We should try
to carve out common ground when we can in this Committee. I simply make
a plea to the Minister to disentangle the two issues. He should strike
out “overnight,” but if he is not prepared to do so, he
should define it in the Bill. Such a definition would ensure that
suspects, the Home Secretary and the courts knew what
“overnight” meant and it would reflect case law in the
way that I have outlined.<a class="bkMark" name="11062853000105">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> With my new-found reputation as a bruiser, I
cannot restrain myself from making a short speech. A number of points
have been made by the Opposition in the debate on the amendments. My
first point has already been made in interventions from the Government
side: the distinction between the measures that the Government propose
in relation to amending curfews as part of a sentence for young
offenders in the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders
Bill, which receives its Second Reading tomorrow; and what is proposed
in this Bill, which is lesser.<a class="bkMark" name="11062853000106">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
distinction is, let us say, obvious—I will not say utterly
obvious, because I do not want to develop my reputation any further. In
one circumstance we are dealing with an individual who has been
convicted of a crime and has been subjected to a curfew order for two
reasons: first, to protect the public, but secondly, as part of the
punishment for the crime for which the conviction has taken place. That
is fundamentally different from an order made on an administrative
basis under the jurisdiction of the civil courts, which is what the
TPIM regime—or indeed, the control order regime—deals
with. There is no parity between the two; there is a significant
difference between them. There is a substantive reason for the
difference between what is in this Bill—whatever the courts
ultimately determine “overnight” to mean—and what
one sees in the context of the criminal justice
system.<a class="bkMark" name="11062853000107">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> I am sorry to interrupt the hon. and learned
Gentleman so early, but it is important to follow his points as we go
along. He makes an important point about the curfew being a punishment
following conviction rather than a requirement to control behaviour. In
that case, does he agree that when a court imposes a community
punishment with a curfew requirement, it is important that the court
specifies which element is to be the punishment and whether it is
actually about control? If it is about control, there is an inherent
contradiction that there is a need to control people guilty of offences
more than there is a need to control people about whom we have serious
information but cannot
prosecute.<a class="bkMark" name="11062853000108">&#160;</a>

invitation, although I shall not respond to it. Within the context of

given the previous Government’s interference with sentencing, it
is for the courts to set out precisely the elements of a sentence and
what they are being imposed for. She will be aware—I certainly
am—that whereas it used to take perhaps half an hour to prepare
a sentence, as a result of the tick-box exercise that judges and the
criminal justice system have to carry out, it now takes considerably
longer. As a

               <p class="tabbed">My second
point relates to the hypocrisy—if I may put it that
way—in the argument that Opposition Members are developing. The
length of a curfew was not defined in the control order legislation
that the previous Government introduced, in the same way as there is no
definition in relation to the overnight residency requirement in this
Bill. However, the Bill has the salutary feature of including the word
“overnight”, which makes it clear that, whatever that
requirement is, it cannot be the 16-hour period that was the maximum
under the JJ case to which the right hon. Member for Wythenshawe and
Sale East referred.<a class="bkMark" name="11062853000112">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The Labour
Government sought to impose curfews on controlees, at least initially,
for periods of 23 or perhaps even 24 hours in any one day. That was not
a curfew, and the courts rightly said that it was not. There is no
definition in the Bill, as the right hon. Gentleman says, of what an
overnight residency requirement is—that will be for the courts
to define in due course—but the Bill is clear that an overnight
residency requirement is something less than 16 hours. That is
obvious.<a class="bkMark" name="11062853000113">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> The hon. and learned Gentleman’s charge of
hypocrisy is a little wide of the mark, but that is his judgment. He
has just put his finger on an important issue: the control order regime
operated with no equivalent of schedule 1. It was for the Home
Secretary to decide on the conditions, and those conditions were then
tested in the courts. The Government now propose to list the measures,
which is very different, so it is important that the Committee is
satisfied there are no gaps in those measures because there will be
nothing that Parliament, the courts or anybody can do to fill that gap
if we let it go through. Does the hon. and learned Gentleman
acknowledge that that is the
difference?<a class="bkMark" name="11062853000116">&#160;</a>

Home Secretary to be empowered by Parliament to do whatsoever he or she
wished, and then subjected only to 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 135<a class="bkMark" name="Column135">&#160;</a>
                  </div>the restraining influence of the courts months or even years down the

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Insofar as
the previous legislation gave the Home Secretary carte blanche to do
whatever he or she wished, it was effectively an abdication of
responsibility by the previous Government and by Parliament. The system
proposed in the Bill is much better, in that it involves a list of
measures that are deemed necessary by the security services—as
the Minister told us, they were involved in the drafting of the
Bill—to protect the citizens of this
country.<a class="bkMark" name="11062853000118">&#160;</a>

the right hon. Gentleman has just said wholly undermines the suggestion
that the Bill is exactly the same as control orders, or that there is
no significant difference between the Bill and control orders. His
right hon. and hon. Friends frequently wish to say that the Bill is
simply about control orders-lite or mini control orders, but he has
just established that the Bill takes a fundamentally different
approach. It is therefore right that the Government have introduced the
Bill and that we are debating it in Committee. He has managed to

will see that I welcomed the fact that Ministers were putting in
legislation the measures that should be available, on the basis that we
have worked out over a number of years what the courts will accept and
what does or does not work, so we should list those measures. I will
propose later in our proceedings a mechanism to ensure that there are
no unforeseen circumstances in which the Home Secretary could not
implement conditions that she thought were necessary. I concur with the
hon. and learned Gentleman that it is wholly welcome that the measures
are in the Bill, but it is job of this Committee to ensure that there
are no holes in those measures.<a class="bkMark" name="11062853000120">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">I
have already made my third point in an intervention, so I will keep it
short. I want to underline the fact that the argument deployed by the
right hon. Gentleman about the need to create a definition of
“overnight” wholly undermines the argument of his
Front-Bench colleague, which was that there was no difference between a
curfew and an overnight residence requirement. It is now perfectly
obvious to everyone in the Committee, as it will be to anyone who reads
<em>Hansard</em>, that “overnight” means fewer than 16
hours. That is obvious as a matter 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 136<a class="bkMark" name="Column136">&#160;</a>
                  </div>of language, and it is the argument that he deployed. It therefore
follows, as night follows day—if I can be forgiven for using
that expression—that the regime that the Bill will introduce is
different and a fundamental change.<a class="bkMark" name="11062853000124">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">When
the hon. Member for Bradford South opened the debate, he said that the
Bill would lighten the grip. He quite rightly spoke of the need to
strike a balance between civil liberties on the one hand, and
controlling the behaviour of those who are presently subject to control
orders on the other. Aside from stating that there was no difference
between an overnight residency requirement and a curfew, which we now
see to be entirely wrong, he seemed to be arguing that the Opposition
are concerned that the Bill goes too far in the direction of civil
liberties, and that no measures can be put in place to mitigate
effectively the risk associated with the change from control orders to
TPIMs. I am afraid to say that he seemed be making a party political
point by suggesting that Labour Members were in some way more concerned
with the security of this country’s citizens than those who sit
on this side of the Committee. First, that is obviously wrong, but,
secondly, the logical stopping point of that argument—if the
hon. Gentleman truly believes it to be right—is that under the
previous Government’s legislation, there was nothing to stop
them from making derogating control orders that would have incarcerated
those subject to control orders. If he is arguing that the public needs
the maximum protection, I assume that the Labour party’s
position is that we should retain the control order regime and just
lock up people who have never been
convicted—<em>[</em>
                  <em>Interruption.</em>

the Bill has continued in the robust way in which it commenced last
Thursday. Anyone looking at our proceedings will say at least that
proper scrutiny has been applied today, which is important given the
nature of the issues
highlighted.<a class="bkMark" name="11062853000128">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
welcome the acceptance by Opposition Members of the range of measures
in the schedule and of the fact that the Bill defines the scope of the
restrictions that can be applied. In that context, I especially welcome
the comments of the right hon. Member for Wythenshawe and Sale East.
There has also been a recognition of the differences between the
existing control orders regime and the new TPIMs regime under the Bill.
The Opposition have at times tried, as a debating point, to
characterise the new regime as the same, but we have established that
it will be different, which is helpful to our
consideration.<a class="bkMark" name="11062853000129">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">We
have issues with some points made by Opposition Members. They need to
take care when drawing a distinction between a civil preventive regime
and a criminal regime under which someone is brought before

several themes that arose on Thursday, so I make no apology for again

               </p>
               <p>I

will resist that as a matter of principle because of the fundamental
issues that it

these issues have troubled all of us for a long period of time, whether
we are looking at antisocial behaviour orders, the burden of proof or
other issues. I am confused as to why, if the Minister believes that an
overnight residence or a curfew—curfews are referred to in the
Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Bill—is not
appropriate where there has not been a criminal conviction, because it
is an intrusion into people’s liberties, there is an overnight
residence provision in this Bill. We can argue over whether it is
16 hours or 12 hours, but we have a curfew provision in this
Bill. The Minister is arguing that in our legal system, it is
appropriate to have curfews and other restrictions where we have a
criminal conviction. If that is not appropriate where there has not
been a criminal conviction, why is there an overnight residence
provision in the
Bill?<a class="bkMark" name="11062853000133">&#160;</a>

and the legal basis for that better than most people. She will
understand some of the fundamental jurisprudence, which distinguishes
between punishment and prevention. Her right hon. Friend the Member for
Wythenshawe and Sale East elucidated some of the case law around the
concept of the deprivation of liberty in the context of a preventive
measure. The case law was developed as a result of the distinction
between a civil preventive regime, where preventive restrictions may be
applied, provided that they do not deprive someone of their liberty and
thus stray into the territory of punishment. That is fundamental to the
case law that has developed on a range of issues extending beyond
control orders.<a class="bkMark" name="11062853000134">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I want to
underline the distinction between punishment and prevention. The law is
clear that preventive orders can impose restrictions, provided that
they do not stray into issues of deprivation of liberty and punishment,
because of the case law and the underlying law. That is why the right
hon. Member for Wythenshawe and Sale East highlighted the fact that,
when the previous

a deprivation of liberty in the JJ case. The right hon. Lady
will be aware of the subsequent AP case, where 16 hours was found to be
acceptable and did not deprive someone of their liberty, provided that
the other conditions attached to it were not significantly onerous. In
other words, even that 16-hour curfew was restricted and needed to be
looked at in the round, with the other restrictions that might
apply.<a class="bkMark" name="11062853000135">&#160;</a>

which found that a curfew of 16 hours was permitted under
the control order regime. His advice to the House on compliance with
the ECHR suggests that article 5 would not be engaged by a curfew that
lasted 12 hours. We know that the Minister’s position is on a
curfew of somewhere between 12 and 16 hours, but no reasonable
person’s definition of “overnight” would be
anywhere close to
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11062853000136">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I suppose that is how we move into the meat
of this debate on the difference between an overnight residence
requirement and the curfew in the control order regime. At the heart of
that debate—this came through in the counter-terrorism
review—is the fact that the Government want individuals to lead
as normal a life as is possible, consistent with protecting the public.
In essence, we are back to our debate last Thursday on how to strike
the right balance. It should not be right to force individuals to
remain in their home during the day, when people might normally go out
to work or to study, but we must ensure that they are in their home
overnight, as most ordinary people are, to reduce the scope for
involvement in terrorism-related activity. The previous Government were
happy to take a different view on where to strike that balance. The
curfew could have applied at any time of the day. They could have said
16 hours during the course of the day, rather than at night. It could
have been applied flexibly. As we have heard, the concept was not
defined in the 2005 Act. Some interesting arguments were deployed on
the approach being taken in this
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11062853000137">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
overnight residence requirement will be just that: a requirement to
spend at least part or the whole of each night at home. We believe that
that is entirely compatible with leading as normal a life as

pointed out something important. He said “part or the whole of

go out during the

appreciate that the appropriate conditions attached to any particular
person subject to a TPIM will need to be determined in accordance with
the procedures in the Bill. He will understand that concept clearly, I
am sure, as will his right hon. Friend the Member for Salford and
Eccles and his hon. Friends on the Front Bench, even in the context of
the control order regime. I do not think that even he is suggesting 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 139<a class="bkMark" name="Column139">&#160;</a>
                  </div>that under that regime, his party would want an automatic 16-hour

               <p class="tabbed">Even in
relation to the arguments that the right hon. Gentleman has made, not
all controlees were on a curfew. That is the point that I seek to make
when I use the term “part of the night”. It might be
determined in the circumstances for part of the night to be restricted.
It might be the whole night, depending on the individual and their
circumstances. We seek to retain that flexibility by setting a context
in defining the Bill, so we can apply the measures flexibly to
individual circumstances according to necessity.<a class="bkMark" name="11062853000141">&#160;</a>

differences of opinion, and that Opposition Members might wish to take
as expansive an approach as possible. We take a balanced approach of
looking at the overarching arrangements for surveillance and what
support the police and security services will have with additional
funding. We want to strike an appropriate balance to ensure that
individuals can lead as normal a life as possible, consistent with
protecting the public. Members from all parties understand the weight
of our duty and responsibility to protect the public, but it sounds as

security and the protection of the public. It strikes me that he is
saying that his starting point in framing the legislation is allowing
the individual to go about as normal a life as possible, consistent
with public safety. Is it his premise that the legislation should be
framed around the terrorist suspect’s ability to lead as normal
a life as possible, and then around considerations of national
security? My amendments, which I did not push to a vote, sought to
establish that the starting point should be protecting the public and
drawing the balance, as far as possible, to prevent a totally intrusive
regime. That may well be a difference between
us.<a class="bkMark" name="11062853000143">&#160;</a>

Friend the Member for Salford and Eccles—what is the starting
point? We have made it clear that the starting point should be public
protection, which was the basis of control orders. The measures in
schedule 1, which are lightening the grip, ease the position for
controlling people who are subject to TPIMs. It is important to
understand the Government’s starting
point.<a class="bkMark" name="11062853000145">&#160;</a>

Thursday, the duty of any Government is to protect the public.
Draconian, intensive or invasive interventions must be balanced with
surveillance, police support and support from the security services.
How we achieve that is a matter of judgment. In essence, that was at
the core of our debate last Thursday, and of our debate this morning.
It is in that context that I have framed my

distinction without a difference? The starting point could be:
“I need to protect the public. What measures should I take that
are consistent with the liberties of everyone in this country?”
Alternatively, the starting point could be: “The liberties that
everyone enjoys in this country are worth protecting, but I have to
protect the public. What measures do I need to take to restrict the
liberties of the citizens of this country?” The end point will
be the same whichever mechanism is adopted, subject to whichever
philosophical view is held about where the balance should be
struck. This is yet another example of Opposition Members seeking to
make party political capital where there is none to be

to my concerns. I shall put a practical point to him. Of course, there
must be a balance between individual liberty and public
safety—that point drives through this debate and the whole Bill.
In schedule 1, the Minister produces a list of measures that will be
available to the Home Secretary.<a class="bkMark" name="11062853000151">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Let me put
this scenario to him: the courts, for the sake of argument, decide that
“overnight” begins at 9 pm. The Home Secretary
has information, from the Security Service and the police about a
particular subject’s pattern of behaviour between 6 pm and 8 pm.
The Home Secretary wants to ensure that the individual is in their own
home at that time. Does the Minister not agree that the provisions
relating to overnight residence would not allow her to do
so?<a class="bkMark" name="11062853000152">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> Again, the right hon. Gentleman needs to
understand the context in which the Bill sits. I do not mean that
purely in the sense of the other mechanisms and measures that would be
available through surveillance and through the work of the police and
security services—there are other restrictions in the Bill that
limit the activities of individuals, and there are additional tools
that may be available to the Secretary 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 141<a class="bkMark" name="Column141">&#160;</a>
                  </div>of State in such circumstances. It is a question of looking at the
context and the individual situations that arise to ensure that we
protect the
public.<a class="bkMark" name="11062853000153">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> It is important that we home in on this issue.
The Minister is right that any time spent outside of the residence
requirement curfew is an extra period of time that has to be supervised
by the security services and the police, but what if their advice to
the Home Secretary is that it is incredibly difficult at that time to
put the necessary surveillance in place because of circumstances,
location or whatever, so they advise that it would be far better if the
individual was in their own home? She would not be able to impose that
condition. Will the Minister deal with that very practical point? If
the security services and police think the solution is that someone
should be in their own home at a particular time, that may not be an
option because of the measures the Government are
introducing.<a class="bkMark" name="11062853000154">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> Again, I urge the right hon. Gentleman to
look at the comments that we received in relation to this matter. The
director general of the Security Service considers that the changes
provide an acceptable balance between the needs of security and of
civil liberties and that the overall package mitigates risks. We are
looking at the steps that the security services and police can take on
surveillance. Other powers could, for example, prevent someone from
going to a different area. we are seeking to balance the need to
protect the public with enabling the civil liberties of the person
subject to the intervention
measure.<a class="bkMark" name="11062853000155">&#160;</a>

relatively easy to try to prosecute them for

want to deal with the definition of “overnight” and some
of the examples that the right hon. Member for Wythenshawe and Sale
East put forward. He might disagree with these points, but an overnight
delivery service does not commit to an item being delivered at
4 am in the summer, and a person doing a night shift does
not get to work a shorter period in summer compared with winter. A
degree of common sense needs to be applied, and that is the approach
that we are taking. We are framing the restrictions in a way that is
appropriate and that will provide the flexibility that we believe is
necessary. Opposition Members understand that a preventative regime
needs to be applied
flexibly.<a class="bkMark" name="11062853000158">&#160;</a>

measure imposed on an individual will be undertaken. Clarity will be
provided in the specific order given to the individual so that they
understand what the restriction might be. We believe that by framing
the Bill in its current form and by introducing overnight residence
requirements, we will have an important disruptive tool and ensure that
we strike an appropriate balance. While I live in hope that the hon.

the Government’s point of view, even if the definition that he
proposes alarms me. The hon. and learned Member for Sleaford and North
Hykeham, whom I respect for his expertise as a judge and lawyer, argues
that I was trying to say that curfews were the same as overnight
residence requirements. I accept what he says, because when the Bill
was formulated, I saw it as a political compromise in the way that Lord
Carlile and Lord Howard indicated in the evidence sessions. With my
years of experience as a politician in the House, I know how political
compromises come together, so I saw the Bill as a way of trying to
agree two different positions and come forward with a political fix,
although I respect the fact that the hon. and learned Gentleman says
that that is not the
case.<a class="bkMark" name="11062853000161">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">We
are now seeing the differences between control orders and TPIMs. One of
the benefits of debating a Bill in Committee is that we flush out the
relevant arguments and points. However, the Government will have to
accept that they have clear political responsibility for changing a
system that, despite the fact it had faults, was accepted by the
security services as a lesser evil—a compromise—to deal
with terrorists who can cause a great deal of harm to our country if
left unfettered. We all agree that our civil liberties are hard
fought—unsurprisingly, I agree with our leader—and we
should protect them whenever we can. However, we are talking about
people whom we cannot convict or prosecute for all the reasons that we
understand, but who can cause a great deal of harm. The words used in
the debate were about as normal a life as possible and ordinary people,
but we are talking about not ordinary people, but individuals who pose

met people who have had a chaotic life during which they perhaps
started dealing drugs and ended up in prison, and then went to northern
Pakistan to be trained in terrorist activities and subsequently
returned to the UK with a view to undertaking those activities.
However, as a result of achieving more stability in their lives, some
have abandoned that path and are now, as is the case with a person I
met a couple of weeks ago, working proactively against such activity.

a normal life, we sometimes divert them from that

                  </strong> I shall explain to the Committee the purpose of
this large group of amendments, some of which relate to later
paragraphs of the schedule. Amendments 24, 16, 8, 25 and 26 would
ensure that the Secretary of State may—“may” is an
important word in the amendments—impose a requirement for an
individual to remain overnight, or at particular times overnight, at a
specified address that is not his own residence or one with which he
has a connection. Importantly, they would provide flexibility and allow
the Home Secretary to act in an appropriate and proportionate way to
minimise the risk to the
public.<a class="bkMark" name="11062853000188">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Much
of our previous debate was about how the Secretary of State can make
the right balance between individual liberty and collective security.
To do that, she needs to be able to act appropriately in each
individual case. As drafted, paragraph 1(3) states that the overnight
residence requirement “must be” imposed on either
“the individual’s own residence”—where he
lives—or<a class="bkMark" name="11062853000189">&#160;</a>

               </h4>
               <p class="tabbed">I
return to the final part of our debate with the Minister about the
starting point of the legislation. The starting point of the provisions
in the schedule appears to be to allow the terrorist suspect to go
about his normal life and, whenever possible, to live at home overnight
or in a place with which his family and friends have a
connection.<a class="bkMark" name="11062853000191">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">However, I am
worried that the provisions say that the
specified residence “must be” as set out in sub-paragraph
(3). It is totally inappropriate for the Bill to tie the Secretary of
State’s hands so that there are no circumstances in which she is
able to prescribe a different address for the overnight residence
requirement unless, as in sub-paragraph (4)(c),<a class="bkMark" name="11062853000192">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“the individual

               </p>
               <p>The
only circumstances in which the Secretary of State will be able to
provide that such a person should live somewhere other than his home
address, or a place with which his friends and neighbours associate, is
if that person does not have a local connection. I contend that if we
are serious about getting the balance right and providing the Secretary
of State with a range of options to protect the public and the rights
of the individual, debarring her from providing for an overnight
residence anywhere other than the suspect’s own home is the
wrong premise for the Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11062853000193">&#160;</a>

                  </span> I have looked at the provision
carefully, too. It seems to me that there is a balance. The
individual’s liberty to be in the area that they know is
accepted, but the provisions give the Home Secretary the right to
choose and enforce a position in a locality, whatever a locality is. I
understand that it might be a borough. The Home Secretary will be able
to say, “You have to live there.” That might be quite a
good way to pin someone down to a place where it is easier and more
convenient for the security services to keep an eye on them. That is
how I read the measure at the moment, but perhaps the right hon. Lady
has a different view.<a class="bkMark" name="11062853000194">&#160;</a>

locality to be. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will be aware of the
case of CD, in which such issues were explored in detail. Later I will
cite some quotes by Mr Justice Simon about that case, which involved a
relocation from the whole of Greater London, as it was realised that
simply confining the person to Greater London would not have given the
required degree of protection.<a class="bkMark" name="11062853000195">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">All that I am
asking for through the amendments is a “may” instead of a
“must” so that the Home Secretary has the discretion to
make such a decision, if necessary. In nine cases out of 10, it might
well not be, but I would not like to be the author of legislation that
precludes that possibility in every single case. That is badly framed
legislation that will expose us to unnecessary risk. The Home Secretary
could decide in almost every case, “I really want to
do this for a local connection,” but there will be the odd case
in which, for reasons of 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 146<a class="bkMark" name="Column146">&#160;</a>
                  </div>security, she will want to go further. We should give her the discretion

absolutely seek to reintroduce a relocation provision. Amendment 128
would do the same through the exclusion provisions. When we return to
these matters later, we may have drafted some new clauses, but this was
a convenient point for us to have our first debate about the importance
of relocation. There was no intention of using smoke and mirrors
because I am a very direct individual, as I am sure the hon. and

recognised that we are trying to achieve a balance between collective
security and individual liberty. We all recognise that we want to have
prosecutions where at all possible and that a control order or TPIM
regime is distasteful in many ways, but that is the only solution for
an irreducible minimum number of people who pose a serious threat to

The Bill has removed the power of the Home Secretary to require an
individual to be relocated from his or her own area, despite the fact
that that requirement has been imposed in nine of the 12 control orders
that are in existence. It has been described by Lord Howard, the former
Home Secretary, as the single most useful power. During his evidence to

said:<a class="bkMark" name="11062853000202">&#160;</a>

relocation issue has been very useful for us being able to monitor and
enforce at the current time. Without that relocation, and depending on
where people choose to live, that could be significantly more
difficult. Where the choice of residence will be and how many people
are within an area will affect the complexities, but there are
different environments that make policing easier or more difficult.
People could choose to live in an area that was difficult to police in
normal circumstances, and that would be even more difficult to police
in relation to monitoring control order subjects.”<a class="bkMark" name="11062853000310">&#160;</a>

starkly and graphically would be reduced. I personally would feel much
more confident that we would be able to control the activities of these
very dangerous individuals, if the Home Secretary had the discretion to

so.<a class="bkMark" name="11062853000209">&#160;</a>

                  <strong> </strong>The hon. Gentleman makes his point and it
worries me even more. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Osborne said,
“We are hopeful”. I would not want to be in a position of
simply being “hopeful” of managing this risk and if we
were to give the Home Secretary the discretion to make a relocation
order I would be slightly more reassured, and perhaps more than simply
hopeful that we were managing the risk appropriately.<a class="bkMark" name="11062853000212">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">We have
already had a debate about the resources that are being made available.
The figures were given to us by Lord Carlile, who said there would be a
cost of £11 million to £18 million per suspect who needs
24/7 surveillance. The Minister has provided extra resources. We cannot
go into the figures now, but I would be extremely concerned if there
were a large gap between the perceived requirement and the available
resources. The last thing that I would do is say to the Home Secretary,
“You cannot in any circumstances ever, no matter how dangerous
this person is, relocate them away from either his own residence or a
locality with which he has a personal connection.” I think it is
absolute folly.<a class="bkMark" name="11062853000213">&#160;</a>

that the right hon. Lady would not associate herself with that comment.

be within our criminal law. We all agree that, wherever possible,
prosecution is our preferred route. It is also the case that we are
dealing with a small number of people for whom prosecution is not a
possibility. At that stage, we have to engage a range of measures,
recognising that these people are involved in terrorism-related
activity. We then give the Home Secretary the power to make
proportionate and necessary decisions to control these people and their
activities, to disrupt them and to surveille them, and to do things
that we would never do in normal circumstances where people have
committed a criminal offence. We are therefore setting up a regime,
because there are things that are extraordinarily dangerous to the
people of this country.

are 12 people on control orders and only 48 people have ever
been the subject of control orders in the past six or seven years, and
they all pose a serious, sustained threat to the lives of many of our
citizens. In those circumstances, we need a regime that gives the Home
Secretary enough powers to reassure the public that she is taking the
right decisions to enable us to surveille these people to see what is
going on, to control and disrupt their activities and to do everything
in our power to protect the public. To say from the outset that we will
constrain the power of the Home Secretary so that there can never be
any circumstances in which she can relocate people away from the danger
that they pose is therefore wrong. I will come on to the judgment of Mr
Justice Simon, which will help to elucidate these matters perhaps
better than I can.<a class="bkMark" name="11062853000216">&#160;</a>

muddy the waters, perhaps because the point that I am making is
weighing heavily on him, as the measure is sensible and proportionate.
Yes, there were people who absconded under the orders. As he well knows
from our debates, the last person to abscond did so in 2007. Many of
the people who were originally subjects of the orders were foreign
nationals, some of whom, I recall, absconded abroad. It has not been
possible to trace them because they are no longer in this

intrusive and stringent measures that the Home Secretary can take. I
have no doubt, therefore, that any Home Secretary would weigh up the
balance very carefully, because relocation has an impact not only on
the controlled person, but on their family, too. I am certainly not
saying that there should be carte blanche—there never has
been—because all the requirements are subject to review by the
court and to judicial scrutiny, which is absolutely as it should

measures in the Bill that provide that the Home Secretary must put
someone in their own home in an agreed locality, where they will have
access to friends, associates and all the people with whom, presumably,
they associate when they are attack planning? Why is he comfortable
with saying that never ever shall the Home Secretary be able to
relocate a person? If he is comfortable with that and he has made that
provision as a principled decision, he is welcome to it, but I would
not be comfortable with having that in a Bill that I
introduced.<a class="bkMark" name="11062853000222">&#160;</a>

shall explain why that is important. It is absolutely the case that
networks of terrorists plot and associate together—there is very
often close association. In some cases, terrorists have passed
instructions, videos, and recipes for bomb making and improvised
devices to one another. A number of those people have been relocated.
They are all from London, and there is a possibility that they will
come back by December, before the Olympics next year, which will be the
most spectacular opportunity for al-Qaeda to stage an event. It is

described the circumstances of someone who was to be relocated from
north London to a midlands city. He referred to the test that the Home
Secretary had to decide on proportionality. He cited Lord Chief Justice
Phillips, who said:<a class="bkMark" name="11062853000224">&#160;</a>

               <p>The judge made the
point that he would consider the situation in the round, and that he
would look at the measures to be imposed, as well as relocation. He
would then look at another package of measures, which might include
association and exclusion. He would look at the whole package, then he
would look at resources, too, such as surveillance. The judge’s
formulation is very helpful, because we are not looking at one
requirement in isolation and we are trying to get the balance
right.<a class="bkMark" name="11062853000228">&#160;</a>

21/7 bombers in May 2004 at Baysbrown Farm in Cumbria. He is assessed
to have moved to Syria in late 2005/early 2006; and to have undertaken
extremist training while he was there. He returned to the United
Kingdom on 23 April 2009. The circumstances of his return to this
country, as well as the contents of the Port Stop interview on his
return to this country, are assessed as indicating that he holds strong
Islamist extremist views and has a very high level of security
awareness. Since his return CD has made several attempts to procure
firearms for potential attack plans, and has held covert meetings with
TM and MS in relation to the attack plans. On his return to the United

simply to reduce his argument to the fact that he will put enough
resources into the system to enable 24/7 surveillance of every person
who would otherwise have been subject to the current measures, which he
is removing from the legislation. That is a perilous path to

               <p class="hs_brev">“There
is evidence which supports the conclusion that CD has a background and
training which would lead to a justifiably held fear that he would
engage in terrorist-related activity based on his strongly held extreme
Islamist views. That by itself would not be enough to justify the
relocation obligation. However, since his return he has endeavoured to
obtain firearms on a number of occasions from a number of associates
for the purposes of putting into effect a planned terrorist attack, has
held covert meetings with associates in relation to plans to use the
firearms as part of this planned attack and has displayed a very high
level of security awareness. The latter point is relevant both to his
intentions and to his ability to evade the attentions of those who have
a duty to prevent him putting his plans into effect in so far as they
are
able.”<a class="bkMark" name="11062853000319">&#160;</a>

Her argument on CD reflects the judgment of Mr Justice Simon. The
Minister contends that with additional resources, relocation would not
be needed at all. That is his assertion. I do not think that my right
hon. Friend is arguing—perhaps she will clarify—that all
current relocation cases under the control order regime would have to
continue. Perhaps she will reflect on the matter and let the Committee
know what she thinks. She might accept the possibility that some of the
nine could be placed back in their own homes, given additional
resources. The powerful point she is making is that for the Home
Secretary to close off any possibility of ever relocating an individual
is a step too far. Is that what she is

properly, and striking the right balance is what I am concerned with.
However, simply saying that we will never have the power to relocate is
a dangerous position to be in. The Minister is exposing himself to a
risk—and not just himself, as it is not a party matter. He is
exposing the country to a risk that is not necessary in order to strike
the balance between liberty and security, because the power would not

said about being pleased that my hon. and learned Friend the Member for

limits of relocation. She mentioned the case of MS and CD. For the sake
of clarification, CD was the controlee, the one subject to the control
order. He cannot move. MS is CD’s friend. The point that my hon.
and learned Friend was trying to stress is that MS is not prevented
from moving, even though CD is. MS can travel to London, be a conduit,
move goods, communicate and so forth. That is the limit of relocation,
and it is what we are trying to challenge.<a class="bkMark" name="11062853000246">&#160;</a>

to the people at the very pinnacle, who are such a threat that it is
necessary to subject them to either a control order or a TPIM. Clearly,
MS had not been judged by the security services, the police and the
Home Secretary to be such a threat, whereas CD was. The judge held that
the provision to relocate CD outside Greater London was entirely
proportionate and necessary.<a class="bkMark" name="11062853000247">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">I will draw
my remarks to a close, because I am conscious of the time. Amendment
128 seeks, again, to introduce relocation by amending the provisions
relating to exclusion. That is simply another slightly ingenious way of
trying to move this debate forward. On that basis, I ask all Committee
members—not just the Minister—whether they are
comfortable with a provision that bars the Home Secretary from ever, in
any circumstances, providing for relocation. I ask them to think deeply

                  </strong> I shall speak briefly against relocation. The right
hon. Lady has been frank in saying that that is what she seeks to
achieve. On the Government Benches, we have looked at the issue. We
accept that, of all the measures under control orders, relocation was
probably the most draconian. I do not hesitate to use the word
draconian—that is exactly what they were. We have come down to
the balance of either allowing someone to stay in their residence, or,
if that is not appropriate, in an agreed locality in the area, but with
additional surveillance measures. The right hon. Member for Wythenshawe
and Sale East may have described our proposals to ensure that people
are properly monitored as draconian surveillance measures. That is the
decision we have taken.<a class="bkMark" name="11062853000249">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">For some
reason, the right hon. Member for Salford and Eccles objected strongly
to my using the phrase “internal exile”. I am sure she is
familiar with what happens with control orders. The police arrive,
presumably in the early hours of the morning—I am not sure
whether they arrive with the security services. They say to the person
whose house they have just entered, “We are now going to
relocate you. You do not have the option of calling a solicitor. We are
relocating you to this particular location.” They are taken
there immediately. The definition of an internal exile is to be away
from one’s home while being explicitly refused permission to
return. Internal exile is forced resettlement within a country of
residence. I do not think, therefore, that the right hon. Lady can
object to my using the phrase, “internal exile”. What I
have just described—what happens to individuals who are subject
to relocation—is indeed internal exile.<a class="bkMark" name="11062853000250">&#160;</a>
               </p>

respect for democracy to enable this to be a debate, as opposed to a

was served on CD. That was to expire a week later, so he had the
opportunity to bring the case that he did, which was to appeal against
the measure provided for in the control order. We have a British legal
system that enables people to be properly represented. There has been
no legislation more litigious than the control order legislation. There
has probably been more barristers, special advocates and people
representing different parties in these cases, no doubt with
significant legal fees—<em>[</em>

that the right hon. Lady makes is not one with which I necessarily
disagree. Given her experience, however, I am sure that she would agree
that what actually happens in practice is that the police arrive in the
middle of the night and tell the person subject to a control order,
“You are being relocated now. You don’t have the right to
call a solicitor.” It might well be, as she pointed out, that
those people subsequently have the right to challenge that, but what
happens at that point in time is exactly what I have described. If she

replaced it with the option of staying either at the same residence, or
alternatively at an agreed locality within the area, with the
additional surveillance that comes with such a measure. That is the
right decision, and I am pleased that the coalition Government are

balance towards the individual. We have said all along that under
TPIMs, and with the new resources that go alongside them, there might
be occasions when surveillance can deal with our concerns. However, we
believe that the tight way in which the Bill has been drafted could
restrict the powers of the Secretary of State in difficult situations.
We cannot escape the fact that the people in question are dangerous. Of
course we want to offer as much support as possible but, in my view,

on the ground dealing with these issues. We think that relocation is an
important tool. The requirement in the Bill that the Secretary of State
“must” do certain things will weaken her opportunity to
protect our citizens. We think that the reference to “an agreed
locality” moves the balance the wrong way. A reference to an
appropriate locality is fine, because that leaves room for manoeuvre,

               <p class="tabbed">The case of
CD is trotted out by the advocates of inserting relocation provisions
into the Bill as a classic example of when relocation was necessary.
However, it is important to read the case in context, and having read
Mr Justice Simon’s judgment in its entirety, two things occurred
to me, one of which I tried to draw to the right hon. Lady’s
attention during my intervention, although no doubt my hon. and gallant
Friend the Member for Bournemouth East did that much better than
I.<a class="bkMark" name="11062853000262">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The points
about the CD case are threefold. First, it was under the existing
control order regime. Mr Justice Simon did not say that relocation
provisions are a good thing—quite the contrary. It was accepted
by the Secretary of State that control orders interfere with the rights
and liberties of citizens. Mr Justice Simon did not say they were a
good thing, but rather that they were an acceptable thing in the
context of that case. We are now moving to a different regime, so we
cannot use the judge’s conclusion on the old regime, and the
fact that the measures taken in the case of CD were deemed
proportionate then, to say that it is essential to reintroduce
relocation into the TPIM
regime.<a class="bkMark" name="11062853000263">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Secondly,
having read the case, I am afraid that I did not come to the same
conclusion as the judge. As he makes perfectly clear in paragraphs 21
and 52 of the judgment, he decided that MS was not only a known
associate of CD, but part of the same group of Islamist 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 156<a class="bkMark" name="Column156">&#160;</a>
                  </div>extremist terrorists. That group was led by CD, but MS and others,
including one gentleman or lady—I know not which—who is
referred to as TM, could easily go to Rochdale, to where CD had been
relocated. They could take messages there or even, no doubt, procure a
firearm in London and carry it to Rochdale. In such circumstances, the
efficacy of the relocation order in the case of CD is not necessarily
as great as the right hon. Lady tries to
portray.<a class="bkMark" name="11062853000264">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I am following the hon. and learned Gentleman
carefully. He makes a point about associates who could travel freely
because they were not subject to restrictions, but does he remember DAC
Osborne’s comments about how the policing environment could be
much more challenging if people were concentrated in a locality such as
north London? If people have been relocated to somewhere such as
Rochdale, where there is not such a concentration of suspected
terrorists and the policing environment might be more manageable, as
was DAC Osborne’s view, such relocation might be useful in
disrupting the association and enabling more effective
surveillance.<a class="bkMark" name="11062853000265">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> Of course I heard the evidence of the deputy
assistant commissioner, but I am not entirely sure that I followed his
argument. If he was trying to make the point that, geographically, it
might be easier to monitor suspects more effectively through covert
surveillance in a community of less density, that would be one thing,
but if he was suggesting that it is somehow more difficult for someone
to carry a gun from London to Rochdale than from one part of London to
another, I do not accept that for a moment. The ambiguity between which
of those two constructs he was urging on the Committee in his evidence
is a problem. Irrespective of that, however, my point is that the
relocation order against CD was not necessarily nearly as efficacious
as the right hon. Lady and her colleagues try to
suggest.<a class="bkMark" name="11062853000266">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
third point on relocation concerns the temptation—even if it is
not acted on—in circumstances in which a control order is made
for the police and the security services essentially to park the
problem. That involves saying that because the control order has
effectively mitigated the risk, there is no real need or desire to
spend the resources necessary to bring the prosecution that we all
think should take place in appropriate cases. The relocation order in
CD or any other case seems to emphasise that temptation, which is why I
would rather that such provision was not in
place.<a class="bkMark" name="11062853000267">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Notwithstanding
the forceful argument made by the right hon. Member for Salford and
Eccles, I have considered very carefully—as the hon. Member for
Bradford South urged Government Members to do—whether the Bill
requires the inclusion of a relocation measure. I have come to the
conclusion that it does not. Indeed, I agree with my hon. Friend the
Member for Carshalton and Wallington that the relocation order is
offensive. It is no more than internal exile, the sort of measure that
one found in the former Soviet Union or that one finds in China today.
We can read in any number of sources quite how painful that can be for
the individuals concerned, especially if they consider themselves not
to be justifiably subject to some form of internal exile. One thinks of
Alexander Solzhenitsyn, but we could go back and consider the effect of
sending Coriolanus into exile for 
<div class="columnNumber">

                  </div>the citizens of Rome. That example provides good evidence that internal
exile is a heavy thing for a citizen to bear, and that such a penalty
holds great danger for a society that considers it
appropriate.<a class="bkMark" name="11062853000268">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">It
is important that the Committee should recognise the case that my right
hon. Friend the Member for Salford and Eccles was making. It was not
that every relocation condition that has been applied to every control
order in the past would be necessary in the future, with a TPIM regime
with additional resources. I am not even sure whether she would stand
or fall in relation to the CD case, given the additional resources,
because the Security Service and the police might want to make a
different assessment and might come to a different conclusion. The
point that my right hon. Friend was making, and the power of her
argument, was that to close off the possibility of ever imposing a
relocation condition would be to deprive the Home Secretary of an
important weapon, or tool—call it what we will—in the kit
bag for dealing with the threat posed by that small number of dangerous
people. My right hon. Friend made a strong
case.<a class="bkMark" name="11062853000271">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
want to speak about a small number of amendments, starting with
amendment 1, which would affect the definition of “appropriate
locality”. The “specified residence” must be in
the “appropriate locality” and paragraph 1(4) of schedule
1 states that that is a locality in which the suspect’s own
residence is located, or, if they have no residence, where they have a
connection. If they have neither, it can be any locality that is judged
appropriate by the Home Secretary. I want to add a fourth element to
that, so that notwithstanding the fact that an individual might have a
residence in or a connection with a locality, if the Home Secretary
were to judge that there would be so severe a threat to the public if
that individual stayed there that it could not be justified, she would
have the power to appoint another locality, where the individual would
have to
reside.<a class="bkMark" name="11062853000272">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
do not say that the Home Secretary should in every case go first to
that fourth condition. I think that there should be a hierarchy, as it
is set out in the Bill, and that that would be improved by my
amendment. The Home Secretary should start by giving consideration to
the individual’s own residence. That should be the starting
point, and if the risk can be contained while the individual is living
there, he should live there. The next consideration, if that is not
possible, would be a locality where there was a connection, and so on,
working through the hierarchy. However, to remove the opportunity for
the 
<div class="columnNumber">

have no residence or connection, on the ground of national security and
the public safety, would be a retrograde step.<a class="bkMark" name="11062853000273">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">I repeat that
every time a condition is loosened the risk is increased. The risk is
countered or mitigated with extra resources, but it is not possible to

response I shall make some remarks rather earlier in my speech than I
intended. We do not know where all the nine controlees who have been
relocated have their own residence. Members of the Committee, or the
public, may speculate about that. Let us just assume, for the sake of
argument, that most of them, if not all, would reside in the same city
if they were returned to their own residence, and let us speculate
about the three individuals who are not subject to relocation. What if
they happened to be in the city that the nine, eight or seven were
going to return to? What if all those individuals were going back not
just to the same city, but the same part of that city? My hon. Friend
made a powerful point: what if, in that locality, several dangerous
individuals, who had been convicted of serious terrorist offences, were
released from prison and came back into that community at the same
time? My hon. Friend made the point in a very telling way. There would
be a very difficult mix, with which the Security Service and the police
would have to
deal.<a class="bkMark" name="11062853000276">&#160;</a>

hon. Gentleman has just postulated. He needs to read all of schedule 1,
which contains an exclusion measure. If we are talking about the three
who should not associate with the other nine, or the nine who should
not associate with the other three, and they all reside in London, we
simply exclude London. It strikes a better balance and deals with the
issue on which the right hon. Gentleman is addressing the

interesting point, but he might like to look at the answer that DAC
Osborne gave to my question about the definition of a community that
could apply within the exclusion provisions. His answer leaves me room
to question whether excluding people from a city such as London would
be seen as a proportionate measure within the terms of the Bill. When
we come on to discussing exclusion measures, I will be very interested
to hear what the hon. and learned Gentleman and the Minister have to
say. I make no bones about it—if the Minister is confident that
the exclusion measures could cover a whole city the size of London, or
perhaps even a wider area, that would certainly allay some of my
concerns. However, the answer that I had from DAC Osborne—I
suggest the hon. and learned Gentleman reads it—leaves a lot of
room for doubt and concern.<a class="bkMark" name="11062853000278">&#160;</a>

The question and answer that was most compelling in relation to

asked:<a class="bkMark" name="11062853000281">&#160;</a>

               </p>
               <p>Clearly,
the importance of the relocation conditions in the current control
orders were very important to him. They are important in the opinion of
Lord Howard and of Lord Carlile, who has more independent experience of
the issue than anybody else. He held a very strong opinion, as did the
police. It is of great concern
indeed.<a class="bkMark" name="11062853000283">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It
is not for us to speculate too precisely about the problems that the
police and the Security Service may face when there is no power to
relocate if the individual in almost all circumstances has to live in
their own home. However, as ordinary Members of Parliament or as
ordinary members of the public, we might have one or two thoughts about
the kind of challenges that the police and Security Service may face.
First, by definition the suspect would be on home turf. They would be
in their own environment, which they could control. That environment
would include other members of the family and people who came to visit.
It would include the physical environment of that property, which is a
rather important aspect. The Minister will no doubt tell us that the
surveillance will involve a very important balance, but all those
issues concern me because they again tip the balance in favour of the
controlee—the suspect—and away from public safety. It
sets the bar—the challenge—for the Security Service and
police that bit
higher.<a class="bkMark" name="11062853000284">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_ParaIndent">I
am also reflecting on the kind of areas and communities where personal
residencies would be. It could be that there are several residencies
within a small area. The community immediately around those premises
might not be particularly appreciative of the efforts of the police and
the Security Service. That would add enormously to the challenges that
the police and the Security Service have to face. It also would not do
much for community relations.</p>
               <p class="tabbed">We have to be
honest. When the Minister says that there will be extra resources that
will mitigate the risk, we have to appreciate the circumstances in
which the police and the Security Service would have to operate. By
definition, if a suspect is not relocated, they have greater access to
the terrorist networks that exist. Again, I accept the point that the
hon. and learned Member for 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 160<a class="bkMark" name="Column160">&#160;</a>
                  </div>Sleaford and North Hykeham made: exclusion conditions could be brought
in. There could be other conditions to do with association and so on,
which would all help—I accept that. Overall, greater proximity
to the terrorist networks would produce a formidable challenge for the
police and the Security Service.<a class="bkMark" name="11062853000285">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
have been looking forward to making a positive point to the hon. Member
for Cambridge on the issue about which he worries the most: absconding.
Will someone who is in their home area, with close associates and the
people with whom they are regularly in contact nearby, be more or less
likely to abscond from a TPIM than someone who is relocated to some
other part of the country where they do not have those associations? My
assertion is that the risk of abscondence would be increased by placing
someone close to those networks that could secret them away and give
them the support they might need, away from the eye of the police and
the Security Service. I am not postulating that as inevitable in every
case; there will just be a higher risk in that case. That is another
challenge that the police and the Security Service will have to
meet.<a class="bkMark" name="11062853000286">&#160;</a>

concern about people absconding. He made an assertion that the balance
would lie one way. I will make another assertion, with as little
evidence as him—neither of us knows what would actually happen.

where their friends and family are, may have a greater reason to
abscond, to get back to try to see some of those

significant impact on an individual’s health and personal life

lengthy curfews and relocating an individual to a different part of the
country raised particularly difficult issues. The review noted that
these issues had to be set against the threat that these people posed
