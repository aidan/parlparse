                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment 1 is
necessary to provide clarity on the applicability to Government ships
of the international convention on the removal of
wrecks. The Bill as published will enable the
United Kingdom to ratify and implement the convention by providing the
basis on which the convention’s provisions may be applied in the
UK and a zone extending up to 200 miles from our shores. Clause 1 will
insert new sections 225A to 225U, forming a new part 9A, and a
schedule, 11ZA, into the Merchant Shipping Act 1995. The Government
propose to commence the provisions when the convention comes into
force.<a class="bkMark" name="1102073000010">&#160;</a>

will now proceed even more quickly.<a class="bkMark" name="1102073000013">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In other
words, if the ship is a non-registered ship we cannot intervene, not
even to protect our environment outside of our territorial waters, even
if there is a risk of pollution.<a class="bkMark" name="1102073000014">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There is also
currently no general legal requirement that a ship owner remove a wreck
or pay for its removal—an anomaly in the law I am sure we would
all want taxpayers to be protected from—including the costs
incurred by the UK authorities, such as harbour authorities, general
lighthouse authorities and the Secretary of State’s
representative. In practice, the actions of owners and insurers are
influenced by the value of what can be 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 4<a class="bkMark" name="Column4">&#160;</a>
                           </div>recovered. That should not be so and it is why we will address the
matter in the Bill, which is being promoted brilliantly by my hon.
Friend the Member for Suffolk Coastal. Those actions mean that a
significant proportion of the costs associated with
locating, marking and removing wrecks will continue to be met by UK
taxpayers and the payers of light and harbour dues. That is
inappropriate in the 21st century. In line with the “polluter
pays” principle, the owner of a ship creating a problem should
bear those costs.<a class="bkMark" name="1102073000015">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Subject to
some limited exceptions, the Bill will improve our response to wrecks
and, crucially, ensure that owners of ships are responsible for the
costs of wrecks and the hazards they cause, and that owners of larger
ships maintain insurance to deal with those costs.<a class="bkMark" name="1102073000016">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">One such
exception relates to Government ships, which is understandable.
Warships, and ships for the time being used by a state for
non-commercial purposes, will be excluded by virtue of subsection (1)
of new section 255S. As the Bill is drafted, there is a risk that that
exception might be construed as applying equally to ships moving
non-commercial cargo—for example, equipment belonging to the
armed forces—and commercial cargo, which would broaden the scope
of the exception beyond what is permissible under the international
convention. The amendment will obviate that risk by making it
absolutely clear that the exception is limited to ships being used by a
state for non-commercial purposes only.<a class="bkMark" name="1102073000017">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">With
your permission, Mr Caton, I do not wish to go into too much detail
about the clause again. Let me just say that the amendment is necessary
to ensure that the powers contained in section 315 of the Merchant
Shipping Act 1995 will apply to the changes made to that Act by this
Bill, in the same way that they apply to the Act’s existing
provisions. This will enable the Bill’s provisions to be
extended to any relevant British possession by Order in Council as and
when it is judged necessary.<a class="bkMark" name="1102073000021">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In practice,
it is usually the case that the larger overseas territories enact their
own provisions in their own legislatures when such measures are needed
to discharge the United Kingdom’s convention obligations.
However, for those territories that are either too small or where such
an approach is unsuitable, Orders in Council under section
315, which allows suitable exceptions, adaptations, and modifications,
would be appropriate, and the amendment fulfils that
requirement.<a class="bkMark" name="1102073000022">&#160;</a>
