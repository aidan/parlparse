<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security </B>(Mr. Keith Bradley): I beg to move,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> That during the proceedings on the Social Security Bill, the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock and half-past Four o'clock.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
First, I welcome all hon. Members to the Committee. I am sure that our deliberations, when they start in earnest in the autumn, will be effective and diligent. I am pleased, Mr. O'Hara, that you are chairing the Committee. From my previous knowledge of your chairmanship, I know that we will be well guided and that your expertise and Liverpool sense of humour will be valuable when we return in the autumn.
<P>
I welcome to the Committee the hon. Members for West Chelmsford (Mr. Burns) and for Northavon (Mr. Webb), who will be leading for the Opposition. I believe that they generally support the Bill, so I am sure that our considerations will be positive and ensure that the Bill reaches the statute book in the best possible form.
<P>
I welcome my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security, the hon. Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr. Denham) to the Committee; he will address much of the Bill at different stages of our deliberations. I particularly welcome his expertise on national insurance. I also welcome all my hon. Friends, those who are older Members of the House and whose expertise will be invaluable, and new Members who are perhaps serving on their first Committee. Judging by their contributions on Second Reading, their further scrutiny of the Bill will be invaluable to ensure that the modernisation of social security, which we all desire, is done effectively and in the interests of all our constituents.
<P>
It might be helpful if I now briefly outline the effect of the measures in the Bill, so that the Committee may judge whether the sittings motion allows for appropriate scrutiny.
<P>
The Bill has two main strands. It sets the foundations for transforming the delivery of welfare by tackling outdated and cumbersome procedures that prevent people from getting the service that they deserve and it underscores people's responsibilities in relation to the national insurance system, by ensuring that employers and the self-employed pay the contributions that they should.
<P>
The Bill also implements changes designed to make the most effective use of limited resources in the social security budget. The Government made a manifesto commitment to live within existing spending limits. In every sphere, that means that Ministers have faced tough choices between spending priorities. Our priorities reflect our commitment to provide an active hand up for people on benefit.
<P>
Other minor measures iron out anomalies in the current law on benefits and contributions in line with our aim to modernise and rationalise the system.
<P>
On Second Reading, we heard many hon. Members speak about their constituents' experiences of dealing with the social security system. For too many people, dealing with the system means delays, confusion and frustration at every stage in the process. They have to cope with long, complex forms, explanations that make things less clear, and letters full of legal jargon. People who appeal face a wait of six months on average, and some appeals can take several years. When they finally get to a hearing, some appellants are told that they never had any hope of succeeding.
<P>
The current problems are the result of complicated legal arrangements that have grown up piecemeal over the years. The Bill gives them a much-needed overhaul. It paves the way for the Department to develop a more streamlined, efficient and integrated service by using modern business processes and information technology.
<P>
The Bill will make deciding claims much simpler. Instead of decisions being made by six different types of decision-maker, they will all be made on behalf of the Secretary of State. The Bill enables decisions to be made automatically, where that will lead to a quicker, accurate result. Staff will be able to take an early second look at disputed decisions and to correct errors before cases enter the appeals process.
<P>
In relation to appeals, the Bill preserves people's existing rights and introduces a new right of appeal to a tribunal on national insurance contributions. When people appeal, however, they want their cases dealt with within a reasonable time. The current system simply takes too long because it is needlessly complicated.
<P>
Our aim with the Bill is to rationalise the appeals system and to make it more efficient. Measures in the Bill create a single unified independent appeals service to replace the five separate appeal jurisdictions. They also enable tribunals to correct their own errors so that cases do not have to go to the commissioners unnecessarily. Measures to remove the requirement for all cases to be heard by three-person tribunals will help to take delays out of the system, while ensuring that the right expertise is available where necessary.
<P>
The Bill contains a range of measures on national insurance avoidance and failure to pay. Some employers have increasingly been exploiting loopholes in the law to avoid paying their share of national insurance contributions. The Bill closes those loopholes. It will make sure that contributions are paid on non-cash payments that are given to employees through restrictive covenants. It also introduces tough new criminal penalties for deliberate evasion and fraud and civil penalties for non-compliance, in line with those that are already used for tax. The Contributions Agency will have the same powers as the Inland Revenue to distrain goods to pay national insurance debts.
<P>
We also want to make it easier for businesses to meet their responsibilities, so the Bill aligns the way in which pay-as-you-earn settlement agreements are dealt with by the Contributions Agency and the Inland Revenue. A number of other minor measures tidy up the national insurance rules.
<P>
I should also like to remind the Committee that we shall be introducing three further national insurance measures as Government amendments, as my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State announced on Second Reading. Those will relate to funded unapproved retirement benefit schemes, payment in vouchers and the alignment of tax and national insurance rules on unapproved company share options.
<P>
The Bill is long overdue. The legal framework for welfare delivery is outdated, fragmented and bewilderingly complicated. It stands in the way of developing a modern, integrated service. Claimants have a right to expect a service that is fair, open, accurate and quick, a procedure that can put mistakes right early, and a right of appeal to an independent tribunal that can hear their cases within a reasonable time. It is also right to expect employers to meet their obligations to their employees and to the rest of us, in relation to the national insurance system.
<P>
I know that the Opposition support the main objectives and principles of the Bill and I trust that that will be reflected in our discussions in Committee. I am aware of their reservations about certain measures--in particular clauses 68 and 70--and I hope that I shall be able to address their concerns when we start proper discussion of those clauses after the summer recess. We all look forward to a lively and, I hope, good-humoured debate as we fundamentally tackle the future framework for the welfare state.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Burns</B> (West Chelmsford): I join the Minister in saying what a pleasure it will be for us to have you chairing our proceedings in the months after the summer recess, Mr. O'Hara. I also congratulate him on what is, I assume, his first Standing Committee as a Minister. I was going to say that we had something in common in that neither of us had contributed to Standing Committees from the Front Bench, but I suspect that the Minister did so as an Opposition spokesman. I must confess that, although I was a Minister in the previous Government, this is my first experience of speaking from the Front Bench in Committee. I would have said that it was the blind leading the blind--albeit that the Minister has his able civil servants--but he has a head start on me.
<P>
As the Minister said, we will not oppose a great deal of the Bill for the simple reason that, as my hon. Friend the Member for Chingford and Woodford Green (Mr. Duncan Smith) and I pointed out on Second Reading, this is the ``Peter Lilley memorial Bill''. If we had been re-elected on 1 May, we would have introduced the heart of the Bill. It would be irresponsible and inconsistent for us to oppose root and branch measures that we support and which the Government, very kindly, have lifted lock, stock and barrel--that is the greatest form of flattery.
<P>
We are worried, however, about aspects of the Bill and welcome the opportunity to examine them in detail. Many of the key clauses leave a large amount of detail to regulations. Legislation by regulation restricts proper scrutiny of changes by Parliament, which can lead to problems. We will examine those powers and their uses.
<P>
There are worries about clause 10, which my hon. Friend the Member for Chingford and Woodford Green mentioned on Second Reading. The aim of the clause is to simplify the mechanisms for reviewing decisions and it allows the Secretary of State to revise decisions. Under the Secretary of State's new remit, however, the circumstances of the period within which a decision can be revised are to be determined by regulations. We want to examine that clause carefully.
<P>
We also want to examine other clauses that deal with the powers of those regulations. I assume that we will not have seen the regulations in draft form when we are debating the relevant parts of the Bill, but we want to know the detail of what constitutes almost a blank cheque for the Government. I accept that there will be a subsequent opportunity to discuss the regulations, but we know only too well how Governments get regulations through the House once powers have been given in primary legislation.
<P>
Clause 70 is the other major concern. We mentioned it on Second Reading, because the proposals are completely new to the Bill--they were not put forward by my right hon. Friend the Member for Hitchin and Harpenden (Mr. Lilley). During Question Time yesterday, it was difficult to get any answers to the pertinent questions my hon. Friends asked. Notwithstanding that caveat, this Government, like the previous Government, believe that the maximum number of people who are entitled to benefits should receive them. This clause, by restricting the backdating time scale for making claims from three months to one, has the potential to penalise tens of thousands of applicants. That worries Conservative Members and we will study it in detail.
<P>
In conclusion, given that the overall theme of the Bill is the same as that proposed by the previous Government, I am confident that not only will we have a positive discussion, but--especially as we shall be meeting twice a week for two sittings a day--a good-natured, friendly and constructive Committee.

<P>

<B>Mr. Steve Webb</B> (Northavon): I thank the Minister for his welcome. I also welcome you to the Chair, Mr. O`Hara, and trust that you will be tolerant of the many new Members on the Committee to whom the procedural niceties are still a dark art.
<P>
In his introductory remarks, the Minister correctly highlighted the two clauses about which the Liberal Democrats on the Committee--I hesitate to say ``we'', but by the autumn I will be joined by my hon. Friend the Member for Newbury (Mr David Rendel)--have most reservations, namely clauses 68 and 70. I feel sure that the Committee can reach agreement about the details of the appeals process.
<P>
The arguments about clause 68 are well known, but Liberal Democrats believe it important that they are heard, as they will probably be heard only from us. In our view, clause 70 penalises those who are ignorant of the benefits system. I welcome, therefore, the Minister's response, which I took to be vaguely sympathetic, to my mention of the benefits help line in his winding-up speech on Second Reading. The help line was also mentioned sympathetically by another member of the Committee and we would certainly welcome its reintroduction. That might make it easier for us to accept the rather harsh penalties proposed against those who do not understand the finer details of the benefits system.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bradley:</B> It is a bit rich for the hon. Member for West Chelmsford (Mr. Burns) to claim that there should be regulations in the primary legislation. He is right to say that I dealt with Bill after Bill in my former position as Opposition spokesman. The previous Government failed repeatedly to produce any detail of the measures that they were proposing. The Jobseekers Act 1995 is one example--there are 164 pages of regulations, which is twice as long as the measure itself. Similarly, the Pensions Act 1995 has so many pages of regulations that no one can agree on just how many there are. Opposition Members should be careful of criticising this Goverment about regulation-making powers.
<P>
I believe that the sittings motion gives us ample time to debate the critical points of the Bill, especially those that have been highlighted by hon. Members this morning. I believe that we should approve the motion, as it will ensure proper scrutiny of the Bill.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Resolved,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> That, during the proceedings on the Social Security Bill, the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock and half-past Four o'clock.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind hon. Members that there are financial resolutions in connection with the Bill and copies are available in the Room.
<P>
Adequate notice should be given of amendments, and I shall, in general, be extremely reluctant to call starred amendments. Amendments tabled during the recess will be unstarred for the first sitting in the autumn, on Tuesday 28 October. That means that amendments tabled on Monday 27 October will be starred.
<P>
Resolved,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> That the Bill be considered in the following order, namely, Clauses 1 to 3; Clauses 9 to 12; Clauses 18 and 19; Clauses 4 to 8; Schedule 1; Clause 13; Schedules 2 and 3; Clauses 14 and 15; Schedule 4; Clauses 16 and 17; Schedule 5; Clauses 20 to 23; Clause 57; Clauses 24 to 37; Clauses 39 to 47; new Clauses and new Schedules relating to Part I of the Bill; Clauses 64 to 67; Clause 38; Clause 71; Clauses 68 to 70; Clauses 48 to 56; Clauses 58 to 63; Clauses 72 to 77; Schedules 6 and 7; Clause 78; remaining new Clauses and new Schedules.--[Mr. Keith Bradley.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Further consideration adjourned.--[Mr. Kevin Hughes.]
<P>
Bill to be further considered on Tuesday 28 October at half-past Ten o'clock--[Mr. Kevin Hughes.]
<P>
<P>Adjourned accordingly at nine minutes to Eleven o'clock till Tuesday 28 October at half-past Ten o'clock.
