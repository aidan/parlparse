<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> First, it is warm, so I shall not say what a crusty old Chairman once said. When I was a young Member and jackets were removed on one occasion, he asked, ``Is this turning into a nudist colony?'' Gentlemen may remove their jackets.
<P>
Secondly, I apologise to the Committee. The hon. Member for Winchester (Mr. Oaten) was speaking when I rudely interrupted him. He would probably have finished his sentence had I not made such a total mess of things. He cannot be with us this afternoon, so I shall call the hon. Member for Newbury (Mr. Rendel) to take his place in the debate.
<P>
Thirdly, I again apologise to the Committee, because I blew it yet again. Confession is good for the soul, and members of the Committee who were quick might have noticed that I formally put amendment No. 88 before I had disposed of amendment No. 193. That was wrong and I should have known better. However, in the circumstances, it was probably fair and I do not think that anyone will object.

<P>
<B>Mr. David Rendel </B>(Newbury): Although my hon. Friend the Member for Winchester cannot be with us this afternoon, I am happy to repeat what I have said before. The Liberal Democrats on the Committee are entirely at one in our view. Therefore, I may say some things that my hon. Friend would have said had he been here, as he was hoping to be.
<P>
The amendments go to the heart of the Government's proposals for the means-testing of incapacity benefit. Amendment No. 193 specifies that the sum that triggers the tapering of benefit must be set at more than &#163;50 together with the moneys available from other benefits, such as income support, and that the figure should be uprated annually in line with inflation. Amendment No. 194 specifies that the taper should not be the Government's suggestion of no more than 50 per cent., but that it should be
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``no greater than 30 per cent.''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Amendment No. 195 is consequential on amendment No. 194.
<P>
The proposal to remove benefit from those with occupational or personal pensions has met with considerable disquiet among Labour Members. We have all seen the early-day motion signed by some of them that expresses their disquiet with this part of the Bill. That is unsurprising; the only surprising thing is that the Government have seen fit to introduce such proposals in the Bill.
<P>
I understand that 40,000 claimants are expected to lose out as a result of the introduction of means-testing to what had always been a purely contributory benefit. It is not surprising that many Labour Members have criticised the Government if so many people will lose out.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tom Levitt </B>(High Peak): Is the hon. Gentleman aware that if the taper were not introduced, the Government could guarantee a higher income to a disabled person who was out of work than to a disabled person who was in work and receiving the minimum income guarantee? Is it not right that, all other circumstances being similar, the guaranteed income should be higher for those in work than for those out of work?
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I hope that I hear the hon. Gentleman suggesting that he will table a new clause on Report. It sounds as if he wants to raise the benefit for those in work to ensure that they are no worse off than those who are out of work. If he should choose to do so, it would find much support among my hon. Friends.
<P>
<B>Mr. Levitt:</B> I was referring to the disability income guarantee measures in the Budget.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I know what the hon. Gentleman was referring to, but if I understand him correctly, there is a new clause in the offing. Perhaps I misunderstood him. It sounded as though he thought that something should be done about disabled people who are in work. I shall be delighted if he tables a new clause to make it fair for them, too.
<P>
The minimum level at which means-testing will apply is much too low. It will remove essential benefit from people with a combined income of not more than about &#163;6,000. Most hon. Members would find it difficult to exist on such an income and would feel it unfair if our income were to be means tested above that level. If the Government continue to apply what was stated in the consultation paper&#151;a taper of 50 per cent. above that income&#151;some people will lose benefit altogether when their combined income reaches the low total of &#163;10,000. As was said earlier, if people lose all their income at that level, those whose incomes are still below the poverty line will have to remain there. The Government seem determined that that is where they should stay. Will the Minister confirm that people living below the poverty line will lost all incapacity benefit?
<P>
The amendment would ensure that people will always have the benefit of at least their &#163;50 savings. No benefit should be withdrawn at a level less than the equivalent to what a person would be entitled to if he or she were claiming income support plus &#163;50 savings. The 50 per cent taper level is excessive; we propose that it should be reduced to 30 per cent. The Government's Social Security Advisory Committee agrees with us. In its response to the proposals it stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``We would question whether the proposed taper offers an adequate and realistic incentive to personal (pension) provision.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I shall be interested in the Minister's comments on the Committee's response.
<P>
The Government should support those who save. On many occasions since 1997 when they took office the Government have claimed that they wish to support savers. Perhaps this is another instance in which their actions belie their words. Their actions and the measures that they propose run entirely contrary to the aims that they claim to espouse.
<P>
A recent study by NatWest Life estimated that only one in five people of working age now can look forward to a financially secure and comfortable retirement. The remaining 27 million face financial insecurity. Almost nine out of 10 employees in the lowest earnings decile do not have an occupational or personal pension scheme, yet the Government are apparently determined to penalise those who save with measures such as the clause.
<P>
The Government are wrong to penalise those who have been thrifty and saved for their retirement; they are also refusing to extend the compulsory second-tier pension scheme. A voluntary scheme will only compound the problems involved in encouraging people to save for their retirement. People who take early retirement on ill-health grounds and are incapacitated have lower pensions and fewer savings because they have to give up work before the normal retirement age.
<P>
A further, general point, about means-tested benefits is their administrative cost. Means-testing may turn out to be an administrative nightmare. Will everyone have to be means-tested right from the start? Will all claimants face the prospect of filling in a complex form similar to the income support form? We know that that causes such dreadful problems to those of pensionable age that many of them do not fill it in even though they are eligible for that benefit. Many find it intrusive. A scheme of this sort, in which pension payments can be counted against incapacity benefit, will mean that there is an extra level of intrusion into many people's private affairs, which, perhaps, not surprisingly, they will resent, particularly if they have some form of disability or incapacity.
<P>
The Government seem once again to be breaking the link that has always held between what people pay in national insurance contributions and the payments that they receive in return towards the end of their lives. As the Trades Union Congress has pointed out, this is without any form of reduction in the national insurance contributions which they make earlier on in life. The Government do not pretend that there is a reduction in national insurance contributions to tie in with the reduction in benefits received. We urge the Committee to support the amendments. I hope that the Government can explain why they are introducing this measure because it certainly seems to us that the clause as it stands works directly against the ideals that they claim to support.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies </B>(Grantham and Stamford): I shall be extremely brief. These Liberal Democrat amendments do not quarrel with the principle of means-testing; they merely seek to attenuate its impact by extending the taper. That is not a game that the Conservative party is interested in playing. We reject the whole concept of undermining our national insurance system by further extending means-testing. It is particularly unacceptable to extend means-testing to disabled people who would otherwise have qualified for full incapacity benefit. We therefore will not support the amendment. We will stand on the principle that it is wrong to go down this route altogether.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security </B>(Mr. Hugh Bayley): First, I shall respond to the points made by the hon. Member for Newbury. I congratulate him for stepping into the breach and so ably filling the role that his hon. Friend the Member for Winchester started before the break. He referred to the Social Security Advisory Committee and asked whether we believed that our proposals contain sufficient incentive for people to save. Yes, they do. I cannot conceive of anyone in an occupational scheme, such as a local government scheme, the NHS scheme, or the parliamentary scheme giving up on the idea of a pension because of the change. We know that that will not happen and it is silly to suggest that it will. It did not happen when pensions started to be taken into account in relation to job seeker's allowance and it will not happen in this case.

 
<P>
The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford (Mr. Davies) raised once again the question of a means test. Let me make it clear: we are not applying a general means-tested incapacity benefit, although we are introducing a rule similar to that which applies within JSA to take account of pensions above a certain amount. The threshold at which they are taken into account is the same as in JSA, although the taper is different. There is a 50 per cent. taper in our proposals, although the whole of the amount is taken into account when calculating entitlement to JSA.
<P>
I will not go over ground already covered at great length. The previous Government made a huge increase&#151;more than a doubling&#151;in the proportion of the social security budget that is subject to means-testing. On each occasion, Opposition Committee Members who were in the House at the time voted in favour of those changes.
<P>
The Government are not in favour of means-testing as a point of principle, or in favour of the contributory principle as a point of principle. The social security system has always had a judicious mix of means-tested and contributory benefits and we intend that to continue.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Davies:</B> It is blindingly obvious that the Government are not in favour in principle of the contributory principle.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> The hon. Gentleman has made that point many times. If you look with an open and dispassionate mind at the changes that we introduce in the Bill, you will see that some of them reinforce the contributory principle&#151;for example, the widower's benefit is a contributory benefit for the first time&#151;and that other parts of the Bill move in the opposite direction.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I have to look at everything with an open and dispassionate mind in Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> Indeed you do, Mr. McWilliam, and you certainly demonstrate that in the Chair.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> The Minister said that many other changes were made to cut out the contributory benefits and make them more means-tested in previous Parliaments, and referred to all hon. Members on this side of the Committee supporting them. I hope that he did not include the Liberal Democrats.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> That is a very important point. No, I meant Conservative Members sitting on the Opposition Benches. There was indeed a difference in the Liberal Democrats' voting record, although I do not think that either of the Members who represented their party in Committee were Members of the House when the Social Security (Incapacity for Work) Bill 1995 went through or&#151;I may be wrong on this point&#151;when the Jobseekers Bill went through the House in 1995. I believe that the hon. Member for Newbury was a Member in 1995. [Interruption.] I acknowledge that the hon. Gentleman did not vote for that Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Eric Pickles (Brentwood and Ongar):</B> I apologise to the Minister for trying to intervene when he was replying to the hon. Member for Newbury.
<P>
The Chancellor of the Exchequer said, in opposition in 1995, that he wished that a future Labour Government would end the indignity of the means test. Can the Minister tell us what he meant by that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> The Labour party has taken the view&#151;historically it has introduced certain means-tested benefits as well as contributory benefits&#151;that both are needed in the social security system, and in the past we have had both. In future, as a result of the reforms proposed in the Bill we shall have a mixture of both, and we believe that the mixture is right.
<P>
The Government propose to disregard the first &#163;50 a week of pension income and to take 50 per cent. of any excess into account. We believe that this is fair. At April 1999 rates, a single person on the basic rate of long-term incapacity benefit&#151;&#163;66.75p a week&#151;will need an income of &#163;116.75 a week&#151;more than &#163;6,000 a year&#151;before incapacity benefit is eroded altogether.
<P>
I should stress that those are the minimum amounts. As I said to the hon. Member for Gainsborough before we adjourned for lunch, for claimants with age additions or increases for dependants the figures will be higher. It will be clear that we are dealing with people with much higher incomes than many others who receive benefits. Almost half of those on incapacity benefits who have incomes from occupational personal pensions are in the top 40 per cent. of household income distribution.
<P>
Amendment No. 193 would replace the Government's proposal for a &#163;50 disregard with a complex formula for calculating the disregard on an individual basis according to the amount of means-tested benefit that the person would receive. In making the assessment of notional means-tested benefit entitlement, savings would be disregarded. Any incapacity benefit claimant with, say, a working partner is therefore likely to have a notional income support entitlement of nil. The amendment implies that all means-tested benefits are to be taken into account. That raises the spectre that in future, before a claim for incapacity benefit can be decided, a detailed assessment of a person's notional entitlement to income support, housing benefit and council tax benefit will need to be undertaken, even though in the majority of cases there will be no entitlement to those benefits. That is because the Government's proposal will start to take pension income into account at a level well above the income support rate in most cases.
<P>
I have already said that the minimum income at which a person on the long-term rate will start to see pension income taken into account is &#163;116.75. That is &#163;40 more than the income support rate of &#163;73.30 for a single person entitled to the disability premium.
<P>
I understand that the object of the amendment is to ensure that in all cases there is a margin above the level of means-tested benefits before pension income is taken into account, but that is both unnecessary and misguided. It would mean that the disregard could be almost any amount, depending on the circumstances of the case. Particularly odd effects would result from the proposal to exclude a crucial part of the test&#151;how much capital a person has&#151;for income-related benefits. It would not be sensible or equitable to allow people with savings of say, &#163;30,000, which is well beyond the level at which a person is entitled to Income Support, to benefit from a disregard designed to give them even more of an advantage over those on income support than they already enjoy. People with savings of that amount should not expect others, including disabled people with no savings, to subsidise their standard of living. We believe that a disregard of &#163;50 a week is fair and that it is not sensible to attempt to cater for the multiplicity of circumstances of a group, the majority of whom are much better off than income support recipients.
<P>
Amendment No. 193 would impose on the Secretary of State a requirement to uprate the &#163;50 disregard annually. The disregard is based on that which applies in jobseeker's allowance and, before that, in unemployment benefit. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State said on Second Reading that we would keep the matter under review. We were asked to make a statement by the disability lobby, and we responded. The Government's sound economic policies have brought inflation under control. We want a rule that is simple and easy to understand, not one that goes up by small amounts every year.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 194 and 195 would reduce from 50p in every &#163;1 to 30p in every &#163;1 the amount of pension in excess of &#163;50 a week that will be deducted from incapacity benefit. Such a change is unwarranted. Our proposals already reward people for making their own provision. With a 30 per cent. taper, long-term incapacity benefit would still be payable to people with a pension of more than &#163;14,000 a year. Our proposal that benefit should be reduced by 50p for every &#163;1 of pension income over &#163;50 a week is significantly more generous than the similar provision in contribution&#151;based jobseeker's allowance, for which all occupational pension income above &#163;50 a week is taken into account. We believe that both the &#163;50 disregard and the 50 per cent. taper are set at the right level and should not be adjusted in the way proposed by the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> The Minister may remember that I challenged him to say whether it was correct that those at the lowest level&#151;about &#163;10,000&#151;when their incapacity benefit disappeared entirely would be left below the poverty line by his proposals.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> The hon. Gentleman will appreciate that the income support calculations are complicated, because they deal with many people in different circumstances, with additions for dependants, age and disability. As he knows, it would be impossible to design a social security system that ensured that everyone in every circumstance would not need the income support safety net. We must live in the real world. I have looked at the figures in detail with members of the lobby. In a few cases, under the proposed rules, income support of a few pence a week may become payable in addition to incapacity benefit. Such people would be likely to benefit because they would be passported on to a number of other benefits.
<P>
Of course, the Government will keep the &#163;50 a week disregard and the 50 per cent. taper under review. I believe that our approach is fair and reasonable and I urge the Committee to reject the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> That was a most disappointing reponse. One might expect me to say that, but the Government have obdurately refused to face criticism of their proposed means-tested benefit scheme. I am bitterly disappointed that they have not seen fit to give at least some form of relief&#151;which the amendments would have offered&#151;to those who are incapacitated, or who will become so during their working lives, and who are among the poorest in society. As the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford said, we were offering the Government a let-out. The amendments would not have cancelled the whole clause, but would have given the Government a means at least to ameliorate some of the disastrous effects of their proposals.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> I would ask the hon. Gentleman to reflect on his comment that the proposal will affect the poorest. Before lunch, my hon. Friend the Member for High Peak (Mr. Levitt) gave me figures obtained from the Library, which show that 79 per cent. of those in receipt of incapacity benefit and state pensions will not be affected in any way by the Government's proposal. In other words, four fifths of people who receive incapacity benefit and pensions have pensions of below &#163;50. The poorest are protected by our proposal. We are dealing with people on higher incomes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Levitt</B><I> rose&#151;</I><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman cannot intervene on an intervention.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I am happy to give way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Levitt:</B> I just wanted to say that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary meant to refer to occupational pensions, not state pensions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I accept that the poorest pensioners will not be hit by the proposal, but I do not accept that those with occupational pensions of a mere &#163;50 should qualify as rich.

<P>

<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> The hon. Gentleman will agree that there are two ways to oppose a Government who are on the wrong course: one is to conciliate them by throwing them a few bones in the hope that that will diminish their evil intentions; the other is to oppose them on principle. In the light of the Under-Secretary's responses this afternoon, does the hon. Member for Newbury agree that, on this occasion, his conciliatory approach seems not to have worked?
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> Sadly, I agree entirely with the hon. Gentleman. Despite the enormous pressure that the Government's Back Benchers exerted, I failed to persuade the Government to take a conciliatory view of the amendment. Having failed to secure that improvement, I agree with the Conservatives that it would be best to throw out the clause and I shall support them if they press it to a vote. I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Winchester would also have done so, had he been able to be here this afternoon because we are, as usual, united on the issue. I shall be delighted to vote against the clause, especially as the Government have been so obdurate over the amendments. In the meantime, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<H5>3 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 89, in page 51, leave out lines 4 to 7.
<P>
I shall again be careful to focus my comments strictly on the amendment. The clause covers some major issues, but I do not want to trespass on them now in case I compromise the opportunity for a debate on clause stand part. I am not alone in believing that that is necessary.
<P>
The purpose of the amendment is to remove subsection (3)(b) of new section 30DD, which refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a payment of any specified description, being a payment made under an insurance policy providing benefits in connection with physical or mental illness, disability, infirmity or defect''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We want to ensure that payments from an insurance policy are not used to means-test someone's entitlement to incapacity benefit. Subsection (3)(b) seems to cover all insurance payments relating to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``illness, disability, infirmity or defect''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and I detect a nuance in the explanatory notes, which state on page 94:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Government intend to use the power to prescribe that permanent health insurance payments in excess of &#163;50 a week should be deducted from future IB claims. This would apply to those permanent health insurance schemes that are arranged by employers to provide for employees, where the contract of employment has ended. It would not apply to schemes used to fund normal occupational sick pay.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The final sentence is irrelevant because normal occupational sick pay is referred to as statutory sick pay or short-term incapacity benefit for the first six months. We can leave that irrelevancy aside. I do not know whether its purpose is to distract people's attention from the essence of the clause. If so, it must not succeed.
<P>
The remainder of the explanation raises some important questions and I shall put them to the Under-Secretary. It is with some scepticism that I ask any questions following what happened when I asked some questions before lunch. That exercise was neither instructive to the Committee nor satisfactory to the Under-Secretary. Nevertheless, it is our responsibility to ask questions and we can always hope to receive some answers.
<P>
One obvious question is whether all such insurance payments would be deducted from future incapacity benefit claims. I repeat the relevant phrase in the explanatory notes:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Government intend to use the power to prescribe that permanent health insurance payments in excess of &#163;50 a week should be deducted from future IB claims.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That suggests that all such payments will be deducted, not just 50 per cent. of such payments, and implies that the taper is much steeper for insurance payments than for pension payments, which are governed by the remainder of the clause. We must establish whether that is an error in the drafting of the explanatory notes or a different regime for means-testing is being applied in the case of insurance payments. I can hardly believe that that is so; presumably it is a drafting error, in which case the position must be made absolutely clear. Secondly, the second sentence that I read out from the explanatory memorandum states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``This would apply to those permanent health insurance schemes that are arranged by employers to provide for employees, where the contract of employment has ended.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Does that apply only to permanent health insurance schemes that are arranged by employers, or to all permanent health insurance schemes, including those arranged by individuals? Again, the explanatory memorandum is extremely ambiguous. What is being targeted by the means-testing provisions? That must be made clear.
<P>
If employer-financed schemes only will be affected, a damaging perversity will be introduced into the system. Anybody who knows the first thing about insurance&#151;I am becoming slightly worried about aspects of Ministers' knowledge in that regard&#151;knows that premiums are a negative function of the range of people who are covered by a given policy. The wider the scope of the policy, the lower the premium can be. The difficulties of moral hazard and self-selection are therefore removed. It would be possible to cover the whole House of Commons at a considerably lower premium than 650 times the premium that you or I, Mr. McWilliam, would be quoted. The whole of London could be covered by a lower premium, and the whole of the United Kingdom by an even lower one. That is a fundamental principle of insurance.
<P>
Are the Government saying that health insurance schemes paying out on a permanent basis for permanent illness or disability will be targeted for means-testing, but that schemes taken out by individuals will not be so targeted? If so, they are denying to the British public the benefits of the logic of insurance&#151;that it is better to arrange such policies collectively than individually. The aggregate cost of health insurance will consequently rise, as people will not receive the benefit of such collective schemes.
<P>
Furthermore, employers will be discouraged from spending shareholders' money on employee insurance schemes. I have sat on the board of a company, and I cannot imagine being able to justify doing that. Employees who become permanently disabled or ill would find their entitlement to such a benefit entirely negated by the Government's decision to cease paying them incapacity benefit. The Government's unilateral and retrospective withdrawal of that national insurance benefit will make it impossible to justify such an insurance scheme. I see that my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs (Mr. Flight), who I suspect has sat on more private sector company boards than I have, is nodding in agreement. A director has a fiduciary responsibility, and cannot spend shareholders' money for the ostensible benefit of employees when he knows that it will not benefit employees in practice. That would be the effect of the relevant subsection, which my amendment would remove.
<P>
If there is not an anomaly whereby employer-financed or employer-promoted schemes are discriminated against&#151;the phrase that I read out from the explanatory memorandum does not make it clear, which is unsatisfactory&#151;the situation will be more horrific. The Government will be saying, ``You are a damned fool if you take out any kind of personal insurance provision against the danger of becoming long-term sick or disabled.'' Incapacity benefit&#151;to which people who work and contribute to the national insurance system might otherwise have been entitled&#151;would be withdrawn from anyone who took out such insurance. That is horrific. It shows up the hypocrisy of the Government's rhetoric that encourages people to take responsibility and make their own provision for the hazards of life. Although we share that rhetoric, our quarrel with the Government is the greater because they abuse that fine rhetoric by not implementing it. Indeed, their actions contradict it.
<P>
The subsection may not have been thought through. The explanatory memorandum is unsatisfactorily drafted to offer logical interpretations or to answer my questions. The Bill would be greatly improved in all conceivable circumstances if we removed the subsection.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howard Flight </B>(Arundel and South Downs): I recollect that about a a year ago I introduced a motion to block the Lloyds-TSB merger Bill. I did so partly because the scheme, which had more than &#163;1 billion of surplus assets, was paying thousands of pensioners pathetically small pensions of &#163;6 or &#163;7 a week even though it had powers to increase them.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Will the hon. Gentleman ease back on that point? I think that I helped him at the time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I thank you for that advice, Mr. McWilliam. 
<P>
When we discussed that matter with the management of Lloyds, it became clear that if it increased those pensions, pensioners would lose their benefit pound for pound. Lloyds argued, with good reason, that the increase would have no effect on pensioners and mean a loss for other scheme members.
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford said, we are discussing an analogous situation. If the clause is not removed, there will be no motivation for businesses to arrange insurance against disability. It is highly desirable that we encourage companies to do that, both to relieve the burden on the state and to give their staff job security. But we are putting in place legislation that will take us in the opposite direction. I gave the concrete example of Lloyds-TSB because the Government do not believe that business would behave in such a way.
<P>
The clause is widely drafted. It appears that any form of insurance will disqualify someone from claiming incapacity benefit. It is monstrous that someone who has prudently taken out such insurance is robbed of his national insurance benefit while someone who has not been prudent is able to receive it. Incapacity benefit, which helps disabled people with the increased costs of running their lives, must be a strong candidate to be a universal benefit.

<P>
This is a classic issue. As with widows benefit, the Government and Westminster do not realise how the public will react if we fiddle with such measures. People believe that their national insurance arrangements will provide cover against incapacity, but they will find one day that that it has been taken away. To run the risk of tedious repetition, I point out again that if a private sector insurance company did that, its directors would go to jail. Why do the Government feel that such arrangements are appropriate in relation to national insurance, and why do they feel that they have a mandate to take such steps?

<P>

<B>The Minister of State, Department of Social Security (Mr. Stephen Timms) :</B> I think that I can put the minds of the hon. Members for Grantham and Stamford and for Arundel and South Downs (Mr. Flight) at rest. First, however, I shall explain our decision to take into account payments from permanent health insurance policies in relation to IB. Our intention is to create a level playing field in relation to the treatment of payments from occupational and personal pensions. In both cases, payments are made after the ending of employment in order to provide a replacement income. It would be undesirable if one form of replacement income were treated differently from another.
<P>
<H5>3.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
One of the responses to our extensive consultation exercise was from the Association of British Insurers, with which Committee members will be familiar. It, and other bodies, expressed concern that the proposals will affect permanent health insurance policies that are used to fund occupational sick pay payments when a contract of employment continues.
<P>
The hon. Member of Grantham and Stamford said that he did not think that there was such a thing as a permanent health insurance version of occupational sick pay, but there is. Occupational sick pay is available from insurers and through employers' statutory sick pay arrangements. We do not intend to deduct occupational sick pay or its permanent health insurance equivalent from IB, or to take into account any other form of private or health insurance unless it is equivalent to a pension. Committee members will be pleased to hear that the ABI commented favourably on our changes&#151;or, more correctly, on our clarification of the situation.
<P>
The ABI's briefing paper states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``In the light of Association and industry representations, the Government has recognised the important role that''&#151;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
group permanent health insurance&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``plays in rehabilitation and will not seek to disadvantage this type of insurance by offsetting it against IB entitlement.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is delighted with that outcome. Committee members should feel reassured about the concerns that the insurance industry expressed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Leigh </B>(Gainsborough): One of those concerns.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> All the concerns that the ABI raised about this part of the Bill have been dealt with. There are no outstanding concerns that the ABI has drawn to my&#151;or, so far as I know, to any other Committee member's&#151;attention.
<P>
We carefully considered the responses to the consultation document. The explanatory notes make it clear that any permanent health insurance payments that take place after the end of employment will be deducted from future IB claims, but that they will not be taken into account while a contract of employment remains in place.
<P>
The ABI makes the important point that an insurer will have a strong incentive to assist with the rehabilitation of people who remain in employment and who are beneficiaries of a permanent health insurance scheme. The insurer will want to speed along an employee's return to work in order to end his insurance claim. We shall not undermine that positive aspect of health insurance.
<P>
As far as I am aware, the insurance industry has no other concerns about this matter. If the amendment were agreed, it would provide an incentive for people to abandon pension saving in favour of permanent health insurance, which I am sure no Committee member wants. There should be a level playing field for pension savings and for schemes that have the same purpose and effect. I hope that I have given the Committee the necessary reassurance.
<P>
The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford asked about the taper and about schemes arranged by employers. The taper will be 50 per cent., which is the same as that for pensions. I hope that my answer to his second question was clear. Schemes arranged by employers will be affected, but only after the employment contract has ended. On that basis, I hope that the Committee will not wish to add the amendment to the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> The Minister acknowledged two other points. First, he agreed that the explanatory notes are inadequately drafted and misleading. That was the least important of my points, but at least he gave a precise answer on the question of the clause's potential impact. Secondly, he made an important and revealing concession: he said that, if the amendment were accepted, it would create an incentive for people to save&#151;whether for themselves or their employees&#151;by means of insurance schemes rather than pensions. In saying so, he acknowledged that the clause will create a disincentive for occupational and group insurance schemes.
<P>
The Minister also acknowledged the logic of our economic case, but I must not discuss that subject unless and until you are good enough in your bounty, Mr. McWilliam, to grant a clause stand part debate. Sadly, nothing that the Minister said contradicted the view&#151;expressed by me and, convincingly, by my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs&#151;that the provision will do a lot of damage. It will create further unfairness and unhappiness, and will deprive disabled people of incomes to which they would otherwise have been entitled during the period of their disablement and retirement. Therefore, I shall press the amendment to a vote.

Clause 52 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> On a point of order, Mr. McWilliam. I know perfectly well that it is not done to argue with the referee, but I want you to be in no doubt that I draw the conclusion from your ruling on a clause stand part debate for clause 52 that no effort by me or my hon. Friends to focus precisely on the amendments will be effective in securing such a debate. Indeed, it is perfectly possible for the Government, even if they are unable or unwilling to answer key questions, to divert attention and draw us not only back to the general provisions of the clause but into quite irrelevant issues, such as the JSA, to subvert Parliament's opportunity to have a clause stand part debate. I want to tell you openly and plainly, Mr. McWilliam, that I am extremely disappointed.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. If the hon. Gentleman cares to look at the spread of the amendments, marking his copy of the Bill with the changes sought by them, and if he also reflects on how much time has been spent debating the clause&#151;11 minutes on Tuesday, all of this morning and nearly an hour this afternoon&#151;he will see why I gave that ruling. Whether the hon. Gentleman gets a clause stand part debate is entirely within his and the Committee's hands. If the Committee wanders all over a clause and tables amendments to virtually every part of it, it will not get a clause stand part debate&#151;it is not then within my power to give one.
<H4><center>Clause 53</center></H4>
<H4><center>Incapacity benefit: persons incapacitated in youth</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 115, in page 51, line 40, after `20', insert&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `or, in prescribed cases, 25'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
As I have already explained, clause 53 allows young disabled people who claim benefit before they are aged 20 to qualify for incapacity benefit without having to meet the usual contribution conditions. As a result, young disabled people who have never had the opportunity to work will be entitled to a higher rate of benefit. Currently, they do not get the help that they need. In future, they will receive up to &#163;26.40 a week extra. We shall be providing real, additional help for that group.
<P>
The rationale behind making a cut-off at the age of 20 was that it would give young people who have left mainstream schooling at least two years in which to try to work and build up a contribution record before they reached the age of 20. However, in response to consultation, a number of groups expressed concern that imposing a cut-off at the age of 20 would penalise young people who go into higher education or training before the age of 20 and who subsequently become disabled. Due to their commitment to education or training, they would not have had the opportunity to work and pay contributions before reaching that age limit.

<P>
The Government are committed to ensuring that young people are given every encouragement to continue with education or training. We agree that it would be unfair to disadvantage young people who wish to continue with their education. In recognition, we announced on Second Reading that we would table an amendment to raise the cut-off age for claiming incapacity benefit for young disabled people to 25 for those who begin training or higher education before they are 20. I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the representations made by my hon. Friend the Member for High Peak, who played a great part in changing the Government's view.
<P>
Amendment No. 115 puts our pledge into effect: it provides for the age 20 cut-off for claiming benefit to be extended to 25 in circumstances that we shall prescribe. We intend to set out in regulations that students who undertake any course of education leading to a degree or diploma of higher education, or any other course of an equivalent standard, will be able to claim incapacity benefit without having to satisfy the contribution conditions, up to the age of 25, providing that they attended the course immediately before they were 20.
<P>
To ensure that that group of young people have the same opportunity to build up a contribution record after finishing their higher education as those who leave school at 18, we intend to allow them to claim within the two tax years immediately following the date on which their course finishes, provided that they are still under the age of 25. Similar rules will apply to young people who attend occupational or vocational training courses.
<P>
<H5>3.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
We have listened to those groups that responded to the consultation exercise with concerns and which felt that the age 20 cut-off for claiming benefit would be unfair to people who continue their education. We have also listened to people within the House and to voluntary bodies outside it. The amendment will protect the position of young people who become disabled during their course of higher education or training, or in the two tax years after completing it, and who make a claim before their 25th birthday. I recommend that the Committee accepts it.

<P>

<B>Mr. Levitt:</B> It gives me great pleasure to speak to the amendment, which my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary has introduced so well. The able-bodied student who starts a university course at the age of 18, but who then becomes disabled perhaps because of an accident while a student will be able to claim benefit. The person with a learning disability who stays in further education to gain more basic skills, beyond the age of 20, will be able to claim and the disabled person who chooses to take a degree, taking full advantage of the fact that the Government have almost doubled the maximum level of the disabled student allowance from &#163;5,000 to &#163;10,000 a year, will also be able to claim benefit. Those three categories of people will be able to claim benefit as a result of the amendment, but would not have been able to do so had the clause remianed as drafted. The amendment signifies the Government's commitment not only to the well-being of those young people, but to education.
<P>
It is interesting why the age of 25 was chosen, given that any figure would have been arbitrary and a compromise. There was a consultation period and, almost without exception, that age was chosen by organisations that represent disabled people. It is referred to in the briefing notes of the National Association for Mental Health and Scope, for example, and welcomed by the Child Poverty Action Group and the citizens advice bureaux&#151;to name but four organisations. The amendment is a good example of the Government taking the consultation process seriously, listening to the views of the disability lobby and responding accordingly. They will do nothing that dissuades people from taking up educational opportunities.
<P>
I have strong connections with the disability lobby. I am a trustee of the Royal National Institute for Deaf People; I am undertaking a voluntary sector fellowship with the Leonard Cheshire Foundation, and I am an active member of the all-party disablement group. I was one of three hon. Members and a noble member in that group who, with disability organisations, brought various issues to the attention of the Secretary of State and asked him to consider seriously the Government's position on such matters. One was the two-year contribution rule and the other was the previous clause on occupational pensions. On both of those matters, we received answers and explanations that satisfied many people&#151;they certainly satisfied me.
<P>
However, on the cut-off at age 20, I said to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State that if he was going to make one change in the whole Bill&#151;all 70-odd clauses of it&#151;let it be that provision. I asked for the cut-off age to be raised from 20 to 25. On Second Reading, my right hon. Friend said that that proposal was very much welcomed by the disability lobby. It is an excellent amendment in a clause that brings real advantages to people under the age of 20. It extends that advantage to those who choose to better themselves through education and I am delighted that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and Ministers have listened not only to me but to those involved in the consultation process.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I am delighted, for the first time, to have the opportunity to congratulate the Government on something that they have done. I congratulate the hon. Member for High Peak on his part in persuading the Government. I know that many people objected to the clause when the Bill was first proposed and thought that the age limit at 20 was too low. Having thought a little more about what the Minister said and the reasons behind the amendment, perhaps the Government can do a bit better. I invite them to think a little further about what they are trying to achieve by this change, and return to the matter on Report.
<P>
Their aim is right. There are some people well beyond the age of 20 who may have had no opportunity to make national insurance contributions because they have not been in work, but have been doing other things that the Government and the country want them to do&#151;to stay in full-time education and undertake further training. However, some people decide to have a gap year&#151;they may not start their university course at 18, but may be much closer to 20 before they take up their full-time study. Many of them do lengthy courses&#151;some last five years; others may lead to second degree courses. I finished my own time at university at the age of 25 plus. Luckily, I did not become immediately incapacitated, but had that happened, the clause would not have helped me. Inevitably, some people considering my sort of course will be put off.
<P>
<B>Mr. Levitt:</B> It occurs to me that a disabled person who is capable of undertaking post-graduate studies to the level and extent that the hon. Gentleman describes would have no difficulty in finding subsequent employment in order to build up a contribution record.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I am talking about people who may become considerably incapacitated immediately after they finish their courses, rather than people who are already disabled. Therefore, I am talking about a slightly different group. I do not believe that even the group that the hon. Gentleman is talking about will necessarily find employment thereafter.
<P>
I am talking about people who go through their university training, are fully able-bodied, but who perhaps have an accident or an unexpected illness and become incapacitated for some other reason without having had the chance to build up a contributions record.
<P>
I am sure that the Government would like to take such people into account. The Minister made that plain. That is the point of raising the age from 20 to 25, so I am not suggesting anything that is not entirely in line with the Government's aims. Perhaps the Government can find better wording to enable them to include, as far as possible, everybody who has been unable to build up a contribution record because of having been in full-time education.
<P>
The Bill will change the qualification for claiming incapacity benefit, so that someone has to have had a record of contributions in the past two years. Will the Government think again about encouraging people to go to university as mature students? Some people may stop making contributions because they choose to enter full-time further education, having been unable or unwilling to enter it after school. Hon. Members of all parties would want to encourage that sensible option. We are all talking about the excellent principle of lifelong learning; to encourage it, we need provision in the clause for those who were unable to go into full-time university education at the usual age but who wish to enter it later. If the Government have the will to do so&#151;from what the Minister said earlier, I am sure that they do&#151;they could find a form of words to include those people.
<P>
I apologise for not having thought of that aspect in time to table an amendment, but I should like to hear the Minister's comments on the notion of a Government amendment on the matter tabled on Report.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> Mr. McWilliam, you may have saved the Government from the pretty harrowing experience of a clause stand part debate on the previous clause&#151;
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I saved the Government from nothing of the kind; the fact that we did not have a clause stand part debate was largely the hon. Gentleman's fault. He must be extremely careful because with his last remarks I was on the verge of reporting the Committee to the House.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I trust that I would be able to defend anything I say in Committee before any forum and I am happy to do so if necessary.
<P>
The clause represents an amelioration of the Bill and it would be perverse and foolish to vote against it. We shall not do that, but equally we shall not vote for it because we think that it is an inadequate response to the problem. The hon. Member for High Peak demonstrated how little the Government have thought the matter through when he said that someone aged over 25 who goes into full-time education to get a degree would no doubt be on course to earn good money for the rest of his or her life; the point of the clause&#151;to deal with people who have become incapacitated&#151;seems to have escaped the hon. Gentleman. I have known of people in their early 20s who were perfectly healthy, had had a brilliant academic career and looked as though they had a wonderful professional career ahead of them, whose prospects were suddenly blighted by contracting a terrible disease or having a bad accident.
<P>
The amendment changes the cut-off point from 20 to 25. Someone who has a terrible disaster a week or two after his or her 25th birthday would find that he or she had no help from the national insurance system except means-tested benefits. As members of the Committee know in their hearts, even if some pretend otherwise, the object of incapacity benefit was to ensure that those with a contributory record were protected against such major hazards through the mechanism of social insurance. The civilized purpose of severe disablement allowance was to ensure that severely disabled people&#151;I shall come to the distinction between disabled and severely disabled people in a moment&#151;who, for an acceptable reason, had not built up a contributions record, would nevertheless have some help as of right, without having to appeal for means-tested help for the rest of their lives by continually going to the Benefits Agency to demonstrate their income.
<P>
I am sorry that severe disablement allowance is to be abolished. I shall deal with that now because it is germane to the issue of age&#151;20 versus 25. The illusion seems to have been perpetuated&#151;
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman is on the next clause now.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> No, Mr. McWilliam, I am on the amendment and dealing precisely with the issue of the ages of 20 and 25. In this debate and the written material that the Government have published, they are trying to perpetuate the illusion that SDA was purely designed to help those who became disabled early in life, and that those incapacitated before the age of 20, who had not been able to build up a contributions record to justify some non-means-tested benefit, would be the only category of people to deserve such benefit. That is not the case. There has been a systematic attempt to pretend to the public, in advance of abolishing severe disablement benefit, that such people were the only category who might be disadvantaged and whose interest had to be looked to.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We are dealing with incapacity benefit. The next clause deals with severe disablement allowance. I ask that we please have the arguments on the right clause, as the hon. Gentleman is on the wrong clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> That is a strange way of looking at it.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I have to deal with the Bill as it is written. It may be difficult to go through the Bill in that way, and in future, it may be possible to rectify that when we have a change in Standing Orders that allows us to have Second Reading debates on clauses before we discuss amendments, and Second Reading debates effectively in Committee before we discuss individual clauses. However, Standing Orders do not allow me to do that, so I ask the hon. Gentleman please to stick to clause 53.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Will you quarrel with the statement, Mr. McWilliam, that clause 54 will abolish severe disablement allowance and clause 53 purports to protect certain categories of people who will be impacted on by that abolition? Is that a fair summary of the position?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Yes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> In that case, it is clear that I cannot meaningfully discuss the issue of whether the protections in clause 53 will be adequate unless I have regard to the people who will be disadvantaged by the abolition of SDA in clause 54. On that basis, it seems extremely relevant that the Government have put about the idea that the only people who will be disadvantaged, and therefore considered to see whether some special protection might be merited and for whom some special right to enjoy incapacity benefit might be created, are those below a certain age at or near 20. That is what we are discussing on the amendment, as I understand it.
<P>
I may refer&#151;perhaps even you will not think it irrelevant, Mr. McWilliam&#151;to the comment in the Government's glossy brochure, ``A new contract for welfare: Support for Disabled People''? On page 9, it says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Severe Disablement Allowance was intended as a non-means-tested benefit for people disabled from childhood''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
As a matter of fact, that is not true.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman is doing it again. I appreciate his difficulty in focusing his mind on incapacity benefit and young people, but that is what the clause is about. Severe disablement allowance will come up in a clause stand part debate on the next clause, which will take place as there are no amendments to that clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I am grateful for that assurance, Mr. McWilliam. It is amazing&#151;occasionally if one pushes hard enough, one gets something.
<P>
Clause 53 certainly creates new categories of people who will be entitled to incapacity benefit, but who are only so entitled because it is proposed to abolish SDA in clause 54&#151;that is the only reason for clause 53. An interesting situation will be created in law if the Committee decides, in its wisdom, to vote for and accept clause 53, but then votes down clause 54. I may surprise you, Mr. McWilliam, by telling you in advance that is the Opposition's intention to attempt to vote down clause 54. Then we will retain severe disablement allowance and, in addition, protections will have been created by clause 53 only to help some categories of people who would have been disadvantaged by clause 54.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I let the hon. Gentleman finish his sentence, but he clearly does not understand what I am saying. He must not discuss clause 54 when we are debating clause 53. He must be patient and wait until we reach clause 54.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> With your consent, Mr. McWilliam, I shall argue that age, which is the issue that the amendment raises, is being presented in the context of a systematic attempt by the Government to deceive the public about SDA, the consequence of abolishing it and, therefore, what is required to protect the victims of the abolition of SDA, which is the purpose of clause 53. I hope that that logic is not too complicated&#151;
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The logic, which is straightforward and simple, is that the hon. Gentleman should be patient, keep those arguments for when we reach clause 54, when they will be in order, and not use them when we are debating clause 53, when they are not.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I give the Committee notice that I intend to raise those matters as you have been good enough to undertake that I shall have the opportunity to do so Mr. McWilliam. I think that you can sympathise with me in having some doubt about whether I would be able to advance some important arguments that should be aired. However, you have now assured me on that point.
<P>
Government amendment No. 115&#151;a hybrid amendment, tabled partly by the Minister and partly by the hon. Member for High Peak&#151;is designed to extend those protections in one particular way. Where the age would have been 20, it will now be 25.
<P>
I have one question and one comment, both of which strictly relate to the amendment. First, what provisions might modify the under-25 rule? In other words, we want to know now the bad news as well as the good. It is no use saying now, ``For `20', read `25''', but subsequently saying that some provisions may claw back a part&#151;if I know the Government well, a large part, perhaps the mass of the substance&#151;of what is being given away. We had better hear exactly what sort of regulations are proposed and to what extent people under 25 who become disabled will qualify for the protections in clause 53&#151;for being, to use the popular phrase, passported into incapacity benefit.
<P>
Secondly, I reiterate my response to an earlier, Liberal Democrat amendment. Opposition Members are not interested in playing games with the Government on the extension of means-testing. We take a clear line that the extension of means-testing is wrong in principle and especially wrong, ill-conceived and unjust when applied to benefits for the disabled. Therefore, we completely reject that concept. We shall not support the extension from the age of 20 to 25, but we shall not vote against it. With our amendments, we shall try to extend the protections in clause 53. If we fail to do so, we shall vote against clause 54. In other words, we shall vote for the maintenance of the present regime and the continued existence of severe disablement allowance.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> The provision in clause 53 was widely welcomed by the disability lobby and others. When we published the consultation document, the Association of Directors of Social Services said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The increase in Severe Disability Allowance for claimants under the age of 20 is welcome.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Child Poverty Action Group said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The increased amount of Severe Disablement Allowance for those who have been in receipt of benefit for over a year is welcome and finally will redress the disparity between contributory and non-contributory Incapacity Benefit.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Disability Alliance said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``We welcome the proposal to allow disabled 16-19 year olds to move onto the long-term rate of Incapacity Benefit.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I could read out many more. The proposal was widely welcomed.
<P>
However, there were criticisms, too. People asked why the cut-off point was age 20. There was a lot of pressure from my hon. Friend the Member for High Peak, other hon. Members&#151;including my hon. Friend the Member for Chatham and Aylesford (Mr. Shaw), who wrote to the Government about the matter before I took up the job, but whose letter I have read&#151;and the lobby itself that we should consider extending the cut-off point from age 20 to age 25&#151;not to some higher, unspecified age, but to 25. The Government considered the arguments. We believed that the case was right and responded accordingly.
<P>
The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford must make up his mind. Is he in favour of our making an improvement that will mean up to an extra &#163;26 a week for young people who have never had the opportunity to work? In the past, they would have received severe disablement allowance. In future, they will be passported on to incapacity benefit. Is he in favour of extending the age cut-off from 20 to 25? It is simply not good enough for him to abstain on this matter when he has been so definite about others.
<P>
The hon. Member for Newbury asked why the age of 25 had been chosen. My hon. Friend the Member for High Peak answered that question. Many voluntary bodies asked the Government to consider that figure. We believe that it is the right figure because, by the age of 25, most young people who undertake higher education or training courses will have completed them and built up a contribution record that enables them to qualify for incapacity benefit.
<P>
In the previous debate, I told the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford that, as with any change to the social security system, if one digs and speculates hard enough one can find someone who might fall foul of the rules, but we think that few people will do so. It is our intention that there will be no such people. If there is such a person, he or she will have the safety net of means-tested benefits

<P>
Someone who was diabled before the age of 35 will receive &#163;80.80 a week, if they were entitled to the long-term rate of incapacity benefit. If they fail to quality for that benefit because of contribution conditions, they will receive income support of &#163;73.70. I acknowledged that that is &#163;7.50 a week less, but it is our intention that no one will be in that position.
<P>
The safety net will exist if anyone is in the position referred to by the hon. Member for Newbury. It is not a matter of the Government leaving people high and dry. They would be in the position of other people aged under 25 without a contribution record, who had not entered higher education and who had a horrible accident or were severely disabled for another reason. Under the clause, we shall protect those who suffer a severe disablement early in life that renders them unable to work. They will be considerably better off because of the change. We listened to the representations of a wide range of people.

<P>

<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I was trying to be helpful to the Under-Secretary, but he has not answered my question. I do not understand why an age limit is necessary. Why does he not limit then benefit to those who are in full-time education, given that that seems to be what he is aiming at?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> The hon. Gentleman seems to want a highly discretionary benefits system without clearly defined rules. He suggested earlier that some people might be disadvantaged because they took two years out between school and university, entering university after the age of 20. A few people might do that, but they will undoubtedly have had the opportunity to work and build up contributions. As we learned in an earlier debate, if they work only 12 weeks on the minimum wage during one of those two years, they will build up the necessary paid national insurance contributions. If people take two years out and claim benefit the rest of the time, they will build up the rest of the entitlement.
<P>
I firmly believe that the clause represents a substantial improvement, worth more than &#163;26 a week in some cases and up to &#163;26 a week in others, for those who are severely disabled earlier in life. It is right that we refocus the benefits system on those with the greatest needs and the most severe disabilities. That is what we shall do under the clause and the amendment, so I commend them to the Committee.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<H5>4 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 295, in page 51, line 41, at end insert&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`or he had in the last two consecutive years before becoming disabled prime responsibility for looking after a child or children at home, one or more of whom during that period was below five years of age.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 296, in page 51, line 41, at end insert&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`or he had in the last two consecutive years before becoming disabled prime responsibility for caring for a disabled person at home.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 290, in page 51, line 45, at end insert&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(ca) he had in the last two consecutive years before becoming disbaled been employed at a level of earnings below the Lower Earnings Limit'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> The basis of the amendments is to protect other deserving cases, particularly those who will lose out through the abolition of severe disablement allowance under clause 54. Amendment No. 295 would protect parents with young children who will not have had a contributions record and, thus, will not qualify under the contributions criteria for incapacity benefit. They should be passported into incapacity benefit on our amendment&#151;the debates continue, despite all my principles and inclinations to the contrary, I find myself adopting bureaucratic jargon.
<P>
Amendment No. 296 protects carers&#151;a matter that we discussed in another context. Carers who do not benefit from invalid care allowance are not protected in the Government's undertakings on incapacity benefit. The amendment would provide them with the possibility of enjoying that benefit if, having cared for someone who is probably disabled, they themselves become disabled too&#151;tragically, I know of such situations.
<H4><center>[Mrs. Joan Humble in the Chair]</center></H4>
<P>
There may be technical reasons why such people do not qualify for invalid care allowance: they might not have the same address; they might live next door, or across the street; or, perhaps, they have never claimed ICA. Some people do not claim the benefits to which they are entitled, especially benefits of that nature. It would be unfair to penalise someone who, perhaps out of a sense of social responsibility or an excess of decency or selflessness, had not claimed the benefit to which he or she is entitled. There are some fine and altruistic people in our society.
<P>
However, to say, ``Because you did not claim the benefit when you were fit and well and thought that you did not need it, we will now deprive you of the opportunity of claiming incapacity benefit, even though others in the same circumstances, who had claimed ICA, will enjoy incapacity benefit'', is to make an invidious distinction. Amendment No. 296 would restore the position.
<P>
Amendment No. 290 protects those who have been earning less than the lower earnings limit. As I argued when we discussed incapacity benefit and clause 51, some people have become progressively disabled, as a result of which their earnings have fallen. Also, some people on low earnings or in multiple jobs, may not have been able to find a full-time job for 40 hours a week and may have taken on two or three jobs for 15 hours a week, each of which pays below the lower incomes limit, and so would not have paid class 1 contributions. It may not be possible for family reasons for people to take full-time jobs.
<P>
If such people have become incapacitated and that is verified by the all-work test&#151;now the personal capability assessment&#151;they have a strong case for being entitled to something other than means-tested benefits. That is the purpose of amendment No. 290.
<P>
I hope that it will be relevant to quote from the briefing note given to the Committee&#151;I cannot believe that I am the only person to have received it&#151;by the Disability Benefits Consortium. It cites the hypothetical case of a woman called Sarah as an example of someone who would be affected by the legislation:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Sarah worked for five years as a personal assistant before giving up to start a family. Once her son is of school age she takes two part time jobs that fit in with her caring responsibilities''&#151;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
that is, to the children&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Both''&#151;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the jobs, not the children&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``pay below the Lower Earnings Limit so no NI Contributions are paid.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That point is closely linked to the points I made on clause 51.
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``After a few years, Sarah became incapable of work due to illness. As Sarah will not have paid contributions in the last two years before her claim she will not be able to claim IB.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Disability Benefits Consortium adds that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``According to the Equal Opportunities Commission over 2 million women are in this situation.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is 2 million women who are working full-time but in more than one part-time job and are therefore below the lower earnings limit.
<P>
It was not I but the Equal Opportunities Commission who made that calculation&#151;I have no reason to doubt it, but it seems a very large number of people. Such people would be protected&#151;in some cases, doubly protected&#151;by our amendments Nos. 295 and 290. I am happy for there to be belt and braces cover so that such people&#151;the most deserving people in our society, who are looking after small children or caring for the disabled&#151;should be protected if they experience the disaster of permanent or long-term illness or disability. Our amendments would not protect everyone covered by the current SDA and incapacity benefit systems, which is why I do not want the SDA to be abolished, but they would protect a large raft of disadvantaged people whose future is potentially imperilled by the Government's proposals. The amendments would protect some of the most obviously deserving cases and I shall press each of them to a vote.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> The hon. Gentleman quoted the case study put forward by one of the lobby groups and said that, according to the Equal Opportunities Commission, 2 million women work part-time but earn below the lower earnings limit because they have a combination of part-time jobs. I am as certain as I can be without seeing the text that that is not what it says. There may plausibly be 2 million women earning below the lower earnings limit but the suggestion that more than 2 million women are working 30, 35 or 40 hours a week in part-time jobs must be false.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> As I said when I quoted the example, I cannot endorse the case or the figure given by the Equal Opportunities Commission, although I have no reason to doubt it. Since the hon. Gentleman says, very reasonably, that he cannot comment without seeing the text of that note, perhaps I may just pass it across to him. The Hansard reporters also want it so I would be grateful if he could return it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. The document in question says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``According to the Equal Opportunities Commission over 2 million women are in this situation.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That refers to people who have not paid contributions during the past two years because their earnings in two jobs have been below the lower earnings limit. I would dispute that figure. Those who produced the briefing document may have confused the fact that 2 million people earn below the lower earnings limit with the situation put before the Committee by the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford.
<P>
I cannot imagine that those 2 million people, each of whom has a combination of part-time jobs that means that they all work full-time, do not pay national insurance contributions. The Treasury would have been on to them years ago if that were the case&#151;I see that all Members of the Committee are smiling&#151;we seem to agree on that. Indeed, although 1.8 million women are earning below the lower earnings limit, the vast majority of them have one part-time job. Now that the minimum wage has come in, that would be a job of less than 19 hours a week.
<P>
The amendments would abolish the age cut-off for certain people for claiming incapacity benefit under clause 53. Amendment No. 295 would mean that someone who had cared at home for a child under the age of five in the two consecutive years before becoming disabled should be entitled to incapacity benefit without having to satisfy the normal contribution conditions. Amendment No. 196 would do the same for those who had prime responsibility for caring for a disabled person in the two consecutive years before becoming disabled.

<P>
Amendment No. 290 would extend entitlement to incapacity benefit to anyone earning below the lower earnings limit during the two years before becoming disabled. That would include the 1.8 million women who are doing part-time work but not enough work to pay national insurance contributions because they are earning below the lower earnings limit.
<P>
I remind the Committee that clause 53 provides for a new category of people to be given incapacity benefit. We believe it right that our reforms for disabled people should focus on giving more resources to those in greatest need&#151;in this case, young people who are disabled early in life, who have never had the opportunity to work and build up a contribution record. They face a lifetime on benefit. It is right substantially to increase the income available to them. The provisions of clause 53 will mean that young disabled people who currently claim and receive severe disablement allowance will in future be entitled to the same level of benefit as those on incapacity benefit.
<P>
The intention of the amendments seems to be that those age cut-offs for claiming benefit should not apply when someone has not been able to work and build up a contribution record in the two years before becoming disabled&#151;perhaps because they have been caring for children or adults, or because they have been earning below the lower earnings limit.
<P>
The Committee will understand that the relevance of those two years is that clause 51 will introduce changes to the contribution rules for incapacity benefit&#151;benefit being paid only to those who have recently worked and paid national insurance contribution, with some exceptions which I shall deal with later. In future, one of the conditions will be that claimants must have paid contributions in one of the previous two tax years before the benefit year in which the claim is made rather than, as now, in any one tax year prior to the benefit claim.
<P>
Amendment No. 295 would circumvent a decision that the Committee has taken on clause 51. I hope that hon. Members will recognise that the contributory principle would be damaged if the benefit were extended so widely that many people received it without having paid the contributions. I urge the Committee to reject the amendment.

<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> These amendments are very important. As we have said in debates on clauses 51 and 52, certain categories of the population will be forced on to means-tested benefits or nothing. They do not deserve such a blow and we intend to protect them with the amendments. Therefore, with your consent, Mr. McWilliam, I should like to press each of them to a Division.

<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 90, in page 52, leave out lines 3 and 4.
<P>
This amendment would delete proposed subsection (2A)(e) of section 30A of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``he is not, on that day, a person who is receiving full-time education.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The subsection sets out the conditions under which those who do not qualify through contributions, but who do so through the all-work test or the personal capability assessment, can be admitted to invalidity benefit. We have already discussed many of those conditions, including the change in the maximum age proposal. That is a restrictive condition because a person who might qualify under all the other criteria will not do so if he is receiving full-time education. That is unfair and bizarre. What will someone in full-time education do if he feels that he is about to become disabled? What if he is aged 24?
<P>
The hon. Member for Newbury talked about someone aged 24 who is doing a higher degree, but who at the end of his course suddenly finds himself afflicted by a long-term disease or has an appalling accident. What can he do? The Government's advice&#151;or instruction&#151;is to leave the course. That is the only way of preserving entitlement to invalidity benefit for the rest of his life. If the person stays on the course, even if it lasts for a week after he is 25, he will get nothing unless he qualifies for means-tested benefit. What an extraordinary message to send. I thought that this Government were in favour of education. Did not someone once say, ``Education, education, education.'' I cannot think who that was; he must have been part of a different Government from the Under-Secretary of State for Social Security, who says that education is an excluding factor and that people will be penalised if they are in full-time education. That is the cruellest aspect of the whole proposal.
<P>
Depending on the answer that I receive from the Minister, I may seek to catch your eye again, Mr. McWilliam. The Government's excuse for such an irrational policy may be thoroughly inadequate and we may need to probe the Minister's response. I have explained the absurdity of the provisions as they stand and I have argued the case for removing proposed subsection (2A) (e).
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I wonder whether the Minister will explain what the proposed subsection means. Referring to what the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford said, there seems to be a question about the moment when someone has to leave full-time education and what that means. If someone is given a grant or a loan to study on a course, can he leave in the middle of a term if he suddenly realises that he cannot otherwise receive incapacity benefit? Does the fact that he has received, or been offered a grant or loan, mean that he is still receiving full-time education, even if he chooses to leave the place at which he is receiving that education?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> May I start by expressing thanks to you, Mr. McWilliam for helping to clarify what the clause is about? When listening to the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford, I could have gained the impression that it dealt with classes of people who should continue to receive severe disablement allowance at a time when it was otherwise being abolished. In reality, it is very much more than that. As my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary explained, the clause provides a very substantially better arrangement for some of the most disadvantaged people in our society than is currently provided through severe disablement allowance.

<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> The Minister seems to have seriously misheard me. I made it absolutely clear that the purpose of the clause is to allow certain people to benefit from incapacity benefit who might qualify for severe disablement allowance. I used the precise term ``qualify for incapacity benefit'', although they will not if they are in full-time education.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for acknowledging that. This is a substantially better arrangement than there has ever been before for people who are disabled early in life. The principle that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary and I have set out for the Committee is: work for those who can, security for those who cannot. The clause provides a much better level of security for people disabled before the age of 20 who could not realistically be expected to work and build up a contributions record.
<P>
I draw the hon. Gentleman's attention to the definition on page 95 of the explanatory notes&#151;which he normally reads assiduously but seems not to have done on this occasion&#151;of the term ``full-time education'' as we intend to define it in regulations that will be made under the clause. We intend to prescribe that the term ``full-time education''&#151;the limitation set in the Bill&#151;will apply only to people aged 16 to 18. Incapacity benefit will not be payable to such a person in full-time education. Hon. Members are no doubt already familiar with the principle that social security benefits should not normally be used to subsidise full-time education. That has been the policy of successive Governments and we intend to maintain it. Only in rare circumstances can young people aged 16 to 18 in full-time education claim social security benefits. Indeed, at present, they cannot receive severe disablement allowance, the benefit that young disabled people may currently claim. Our proposals are therefore entirely consistent with current arrangements, and will be an improvement for young disabled people.
<P>
Our proposals in no way disadvantage young disabled people who choose to stay in full-time education. Young, severely disabled people may continue to receive help with the extra costs of disability through disability living allowance. When they complete their education, they will be able to claim the new passported incapacity benefit, providing that they satisfy entitlement conditions.
<P>
We recognise that some young disabled people may have particular educational needs. We shall therefore protect young people aged 16 to 18 who are engaged in education that is specifically intended for disabled students. We shall provide that a disabled young person engaged in education for less than 21 hours a week will not be treated as receiving full-time education so that benefit may be awarded. In determining the number of hours spent in education, we shall ignore any time that is devoted to education specifically designed for students with disabilities.
<P>
We intend that different rules will apply to people aged 19 and older, who will be entitled to incapacity benefit even if they are in full-time education, provided that they are incapable of work and meet the other entitlement conditions. At age 19, it is reasonable for young disabled people to have access to an independent source of income, regardless of whether they are in full-time education. That is a genuine and important improvement. Clause 53 will take many people above the means-tested threshold and out of means-tested benefits for the first time in a way that severe disablement allowance did not.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I am grateful for the Minister's explanations and if he can satisfy me on this question, we shall not press the amendment to a vote. Will he give me an undertaking that if someone becomes disabled before the age of 18, when in full-time education and therefore does not qualify for incapacity benefit for the reasons that the Minister set down, he or she will, if still disabled or incapacitated, qualify on reaching the age of 19.
<P>
<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> Yes, I am happy to give that assurance. That is what the clause will achieve.
<P>
The Committee knows that we want to encourage more young people to go into higher education and training. ``Education, education, education,'' is our watchword. That is why we have extended the upper age limit for claiming passported incapacity benefit for those in higher education and training. For those people, the age limit will be extended from 20 to 25. The education rules do not disadvantage young disabled people who choose to stay at college or school beyond the age of 16. On the contrary, the special provisions designed for disabled students will help them obtain a guaranteed and a higher rate of benefit than ever.

</FONT>Question accordingly agreed to.
<P>
Clause 52, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 54</center></H4>
<H4><center>Abolition of severe disablement allowance</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> We voted against clause 53 in the interests of coherence. We shall argue that clause 54 should not stand part of the Bill and that severe disablement allowance should not be abolished. It would have been inconsistent to have voted for clause 53, which provides a replacement regime that is designed to preserve the position for certain restricted categories after the abolition of severe disablement allowance.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> Clause 53 gives a more generous provision for the people that the hon. Gentleman listed. It would be perfectly possible for that provision to be in place without the abolition of severe disablement allowance.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I accept that it provides a more generous regime, but it is for a much more restricted category of people, which we do not accept. Curiously, the Minister's comment shows how genuine we are in defence of the national insurance principle and how ungenuine are any of his protestations&#151;that he also believes in the national insurance system&#151;he does not bother to say so often.
<P>
It is reasonable that those who have a contribution record should have it recognised in a higher level of benefit. That is the difference between incapacity benefit and severe disablement allowance. It was always agreed that if those who had contributed to the national insurance system became disabled or permanently ill, they should be entitled, as of right, to the insurance pay out. If we believe in the insurance principle, it follows that people who have contributed should receive a bigger pay out.
<P>
There should be some non-means-tested benefit. Disabled people should not have to plead poverty in the benefit office. Some means-tested benefits should be available to those who were unable to develop a contributions record, but the benefit should be less generous than for someone with such a record. That is the basis of the insurance principle.
<P>
We are defending the existing three-tier system. Disabled people receive full recognition of their contributions record through their entitlement to incapacity benefit in addition to other earnings. That should not be means-tested. Severely disabled people or those who were disabled before the age of 20 who have had no chance to build up a contributions record, are given some non-means-tested benefit as a right. Although that is not as generous as the benefit that is awarded to people who have paid into the system, they are not forced into the means-testing queue, but that is what will happen under the new Labour Government's more restrictive regime for people who do not qualify for incapacity benefit.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman telling the Committee that the Conservative party believes that those for whom work will never be a possibility should always be disadvantaged? Is he saying that because they have not been able to pay contributions, they will not be able to reach the higher level of benefit that we advocate?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> The Minister of State is not listening. We are defending the present regime, which reflects the national insurance principle. The higher level of benefit is a recognition of people's contributions. I have been saying for weeks that the new Labour Government do not believe in the national insurance principle. Once again, they have given me the best possible arguments to confirm my view. That is sad for the country and for the disabled in particular.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> One need go no further than the Government's explanatory notes. They state that 70 per cent. of SDA recipients are claiming income support. Although it is not in their interest to claim the benefit, they should at least have the choice. If they have contributed, they should have the right to a non-means-tested benefit. Is not that our argument?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Certainly. We are arguing for dignity for disabled people. They should not be treated like anyone else in the welfare queue. When they have gone through the trauma of the all-work test&#151;the personal capability assessment&#151;and have qualified as disabled, they should have the benefit as a right. They should not have to plead poverty every week.
<P>
We think that that is fair. We are committed to the system that people who have contributed to an insurance system should get more than people who have not. You would not get as much from your insurance policy, Mr. McWilliam, if you had not contributed towards it out of your own pocket. Mind you, as we heard when we debated clause 52, the Labour Government want to ensure that you do not get the benefit of that either.
<P>
People who contribute to an insurance policy should get the benefit and it is right for society that people should be encouraged to contribute to insurance policies such as the national insurance scheme. Years of contributions should be recognised through a higher stream of payments. The logic is plain. What is worrying is that the Government do not accept it.
<P>
 I am also worried that the SDA, which should not be abolished, has been misrepresented systematically by the Government. Our discussion on clause 53 dealt with the protection that will be afforded to some categories of people who will lose out through the abolition of the SDA. It was premised on the fact that age was the great thing&#151;it mattered whether one was aged 20 or 25. However, that is only part of the story. The Government have made a systematic attempt to disguise the fact that SDA is given to people who became disabled before they were 20 and to a second category, which is described in section 30 of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992. I suspect that you know that Act backwards, Mr. McWilliam, and I am sure that you know it forwards and by heart.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I knew it by heart when it was passing through the House because I chaired the Committee that considered it. However, I have probably forgotten most of it by now.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I thought that you never forgot anything, Mr. McWilliam.
<P>
Section 30 of the 1992 Act states that there are two gateways into SDA, which the Government want to abolish. The first category&#151;I am quoting from memory, but I do not think that I am seriously misquoting the Act&#151;involves people who are disabled or incapacitated and unable to work before they are 20 years old, and the second involves people who are severely disabled, which the Act later defines as being more than 80 per cent. disabled, at any stage in their life after the age of 20. Two categories of people can currently claim SDA, and they will be disadvantaged by its abolition. To discuss properly the impact of its abolition we must discuss the needs of those who claim&#151;or, if we are successful in our attempts to remove the clause from the Bill, who will claim&#151;SDA and who are not yet 20.
<P>
The Government have made a systematic attempt to disguise that fact. The Green Paper, ``A new contract for welfare: Support for Disabled People'', states on page 9:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Severe Disablement Allowance was intended as a non-means-tested benefit''&#151;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
that much is correct&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``for people disabled from childhood''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It was not intended only for such people, and it is thoroughly disingenuous to suggest otherwise. Why do the new Labour Government put out such deceptive glossy documents? I do not suppose that we will get a response to that question. The Green Paper implies that a whole raft of people who currently qualify for SDA&#151;and, if we succeed in getting rid of the clause, who will qualify for it&#151;do not exist, which is profoundly the wrong way to proceed.
<P>
We know perfectly well what is going on. We have discussed four clauses, three of which notionally deal with incapacity benefit, and the fourth of which deals with SDA. However, we pointed out that there are many links between them. The three earlier clauses anticipate the clause that we are considering, and vice versa.
<P>
The story is briefly told: It is all about extracting &#163;800 million a year from the disabled. There should be no doubt about that. An interesting summary of the situation was given by the Disability Alliance. What does that body think of the Government's proposals? It says that the proposals in the four clauses represent
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``an attack on the living standards of thousands of disabled people and a major shift from a social insurance based social security system to a means-tested one.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That sentence sums up the whole situation. I could not have put it more succinctly or powerfully. Has the Disability Alliance correctly characterised what the Government are trying to do? If it has, that would be an appalling self-immolation of new Labour and of all that it stands for. If it is incorrect, there are only two possibilities. The Disability Alliance may be ignorant of what is going on, in which case its analysis will be utterly false. Does the Disability Alliance not know what it is talking about? Is it incompetent and idiotic? Was its serious statement rubbish and unjustified nonsense?
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Alternatively, the Disability Alliance knows that its statement is nonsense and is in the business of disinformation, lying and propaganda. There are only three logical possibilities in relation to the statement: if correct, it must be a correct characterisation of the policy on which the Government are embarked; if incorrect, it must either be an unconscious falsehood or a conscious and deliberate one. Which is it? If so, they will be destroyed by a comment that they have endorsed. If not, are they telling us that the Disability Alliance has misperceived the impact of the Bill on the people that it represents? Alternatively, are they saying that the Disability Alliance is deceiving the public and Parliament by deliberate falsehood? The Government cannot avoid that dilemma&#151;one of those three answers is correct. The Committe must be told which one.
<P>
Today's debate has been astonishing. I have asked a whole raft of questions that the Under-Secretary has been unable to answer. We have driven a coach and horses&#151;we could have driven the whole Household Cavalry&#151;through the gaps in the Government's thinking and policy planning. So great was the Government's retreat that even when the Under-Secretary gave up in the middle of a clause and was replaced by the Minister of State, the rout was evident. We were not able to pursue the matter in a stand part debate on the previous clause, Mr. McWilliam, but I am delighted that you have given us such an opportunity now. The reality must be confronted&#151;the Government are, in the words of the Disability Alliance, making:
<P>

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Before I call the hon. Member for Morecambe and Lunesdale (Miss Smith), I have noticed that the hon. Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh) appears to have an illicit substance in his cup. Steam is coming from it. I would be grateful if he would either swallow it in one or remove it from the Room.
<P>
<B>Miss Geraldine Smith </B>(Morecambe and Lunesdale): I broadly welcome the proposal to abolish severe disablement allowance. At present, it is a comparitively small benefit&#151;about &#163;50 a week&#151;and it does nothing whatever to help the vast majority of people who are entitled to claim it. As has been said, 70 per cent. of those people are already on income support, which wipes out the benefit that they receive from severe disablement allowance.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> The hon. Lady has deliberately chosen the lowest possible level of such benefit. At her constituency surgery this weekend, will she say to somebody with small savings who is disqualified from means-tested benefits, and for whom &#163;50 a week extra makes a lot of difference, that they do not deserve that amount?
<P>
<B>Miss Smith:</B> If the hon. Gentleman allows me to continue, I shall answer that point later in my speech.
<P>
It would be nonsense to allow a benefit as ineffective as SDA to continue when the Government are currently undertaking a fundamental and radical reform of the whole welfare system. I think that my constituents regard that as the right approach&#151;I receive a great deal of support in my constituency surgeries from people who say that the Government are doing the right thing. Perhaps that it why a constituency such as Morecambe and Lunesdale is now a Labour constituency.
<P>
It is laudable that the Government have taken care to ensure that none of the current recipients or SDA will be disadvantaged by its abolition. It is also to the Government's credit that they have recognised the special needs of disabled 16 to 20-year-olds. Again, that will be particularly welcomed in my constituency.
<P>
Some Committee members will be aware of the view of disability pressure groups that the entitlement of 16 to 20-year-olds to extra assistance in the form of incapacity benefit could lead to a two-tier system. There may be some merit in such arguments, but there are no easy remedies. A solution proffered by some organisations is to raise the benefit level of all recipients of SDA to that of young recipients of incapacity benefit. I asked the House of Commons Library to cost such a proposal; it estimated that it would cost &#163;150 million a year. If we were to spend that amount of extra money, cuts would have to be made elsewhere in the welfare budget. I could not support such cuts and I appreciate the difficulties that such an anomaly would create for the Government. I should be grateful for the Minister's comments on that point.
<P>
Although I welcome the abolition of SDA, which is an ineffective benefit, I have one reservation. I am worried about the adverse financial impact that the benefit's cessation will have on people who, because of their disability, are unable to work and do not meet the contributory requirements for incapacity benefit or qualify for income support. Like the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford, I am particularly worried about those whose incomes are marginally greater than the income support level. I realise that it is difficult to find an equitable solution to the disadvantage experienced by such people, but they are the ones who always seem to suffer. There are no easy solutions&#151;
<P>
<B>Mrs. Joan Humble </B>(Blackpool, North and Fleetwood): Although I understand the concerns expressed by my hon. Friend, does she acknowledge that disabled people with special care and mobility needs will continue to be able to claim disability living allowance?
<P>
<B>Miss Smith:</B> Yes, I accept that point and I accept that the Government have done everything possible to help disabled people. Nevertheless, if the Government are successfully to build a just and inclusive society, we must find a solution to the problem of the poverty trap in which those whose incomes are just above the level of income support are caught.
<P>
I reiterate that the proposed abolition of SDA is fundamentally correct and I welcome it. However, I should be grateful for a response from the Minister to my single reservation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I am more than happy to speak in this clause stand part debate. I chose not to speak to amendments Nos. 295, 296 and 290, which were tabled to clause 53. Nor did I speak about the people to whom reference might then have been made: those with a considerable disability who nevertheless do not want immediately to claim incapacity benefit, who want to try out work at a young age, but who discover later that they are unable to maintain that work. There are several such groups: those mentioned in the amendments and also the group that want to try work and who will not be properly covered by the new incapacity regulations but might have qualified for severe disablement allowance. Those groups will not be covered under the Government's new regulations, so it is doubly important not to get rid of severe disablement allowance as proposed in clause 54. It is important to throw it out as soon as possible.
<P>
The clause will abolish a benefit that caters for severely disabled people who have not made national insurance contributions, but the majority of claimants in that group are women and carers. The Government have claimed that this is a women-friendly Bill, but clause 54 is a considerable insult to women, who make up most of the group of carers. It runs counter to the Government's promise, which they repeat time and again, that they want to provide work for those who can and security for those who cannot. They seem to be making a great effort with the first part of that mantra, but they are less enthusiastic about providing security for those who cannot work.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Humble:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for giving way. Does he accept that, although many claimants for severe disablement allowance are women, that is a result of fewer women working and making the necessary contributions? The labour market is changing and a higher proportion of women are entitled to contributory benefits because of their work record. We are legislating for the future, when women will not be disadvantaged in the way outlined by the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I wish that I could agree with the hon. Lady that in future most carers will be male, or at least that they will be evenly divided between men and women. I am afraid that that may be a Utopian outlook and I suspect that most caring responsibilities will lie with the women in our society for many years to come. Carers have difficulty in obtaining enough national insurance contributions to qualify for incapacity benefit and that will be particularly so under the new regulations. They will make the position worse, particularly for women who are carers, so it is even more important for them that severe disablement allowance should remain.
<P>
Much as I would like to believe that the hon. Lady's view is correct, I cannot foresee that it will be in the near future. At present, two thirds of claimants are women. Some 10,000 women and only about 6,000 men are claimants, so the bias is clearly towards women being the claimants for the time being. Caring duties, which may not be great enough to qualify for invalid care allowance, may have prevented women&#151;and some men, but mainly women&#151;from making sufficient contributions to allow them to qualify for incapacity benefit. Those with patchy national insurance contributions who previously failed to qualify for incapacity benefit entitlement could at least fall back on severe disablement allowance, but they will not be able to do so any longer. Women will be forced more and more on to means-tested benefit with the stigma which, sadly, they often feel still attaches to such benefits. The Committee may feel that no stigma is involved, but some claimants for means-tested benefits disagree. They resent having to fill in the voluminous forms for those benefits as well as the intrusion into their private life.
<P>
On top of that is the disincentive to save. There is always the problem of savings being one of the reasons why people do not qualify for means-tested benefits. The Government have claimed that that is unimportant because 70 per cent. of those who are eligible for severe disablement allowance require an income support top-up and will be on some form of means-tested benefit. That misses the point, which is that because severe disablement allowance is not means-tested in the same way, people are happier to receive it. They feel that it is a right and not that they must claim it because they are poverty stricken. It is more welcome to them, even if it is only part of the total that they receive in benefits.
<P>
As the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford said, people with fairly low levels of savings will be ineligible for income-related benefits and people with partners who have some income may also become ineligible. That is one of the problems of pushing more people on to income-related benefits as the Government are trying to do.
<P>
I wonder whether the Government have made a real estimate of the number of people&#151;
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It has been a long afternoon, so it may be for the convenience of the Committee to suspend our proceedings for half an hour.
<P>
Sitting suspended.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
On resuming&#151;
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> Before we adjourned, I was asking the Government whether they had made an estimate of the number of people who would no longer receive severe disablement allowance if the clause stands part and we do not manage to throw it out. Not only will those people not receive severe disablement allowance, but they will not satisfy income support conditions. They will lose out completely under the clause. What guarantees will the Government offer that group of people?
<P>
I hope that the Under-Secretary agrees that many of those people will have undertaken invaluable work looking after elderly people, those with disabilities or the very young, and as a result will not qualify for incapacity benefit because of a lack of contributions. Will those who are no longer eligible for severe disablement allowance be able to get on a fast track to the disability premium, or will they have to wait for a full year if they are now only on income support?
<P>
Severe disablement allowance is often a trigger for other local authority benefits, such as housing or council tax benefit. The Government must consider whether people will lose out and become caught in the poverty trap to which the Minister referred. By abolishing the benefit, they could be denying some disabled people essential support and services from the local authority.
<P>
The hon. Member for Morecambe and Lunesdale (Miss Smith) thought that many people would not be concerned about the issue because of the number of people who are on income support. I have here a letter from my local citizens advice bureau, which sets out who will be affected by the clause. It said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``A quick scan through the case sheets of our Carers Service based in Thatcham indicates a big problem with those claiming SDA, on becoming disabled after the age of 20 but without a contributions record. I gather the `cut off' is to be raised to 25 but this would not solve the most common problem. This is for women who have either not worked at all or insufficiently to build a contributions record.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> A typical example is of a woman aged 49, whose health began to suffer in 1994 (parathyroid problems, osteoporosis, depression and then cervical cancer). She claimed SDA in 1996.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> A quick scan through a third of our Carers Service case sheets, threw up 10 such cases. Whilst it would not be statistically rigorous to extrapolate our sample to produce an estimate of 30 such cases just for our bureau, it is undoubtedly a common problem.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> Do not forget, either, that we only see problems. There must be more such cases of which we are not aware.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Those at the hard end, looking at such cases, recognise that a significant number of people, especially women and carers, will be severely harmed under the clause.
<P>
The alternative justification proffered by the Government is that those people should have had an opportunity to work and build up contributions. Sadly, that returns us to a point that we have had to make many times&#151;no doubt, we shall make it again on Report. The Government seem to think that the only real work is paid work. They do not properly recognise the value of caring work and its importance in our society. Whether it be for children, or elderly, sick or disabled people, caring is often a full-time job. If it is not, the commitment is so great that people cannot take on full-time paid work as well.
<P>
In the Bill, the Government do nothing but deny that that is a proper role for people to play in society. By forcing carers to attend work-focused interviews, which we have debated, and by removing their benefits if they become incapacitated, the Government show that they do not recognise that role. In effect, they will require carers to go out and get what the Government call real jobs&#151;in other words, paid work.
<P>
The Bill is all the more alarming because not only are the Government throwing people on to incapacity benefit, but other clauses will restrict people's rights to that benefit. Many people who have had the misfortune to become unemployed before being incapacitated&#151;perhaps because of illnesses that come and go or other fluctuating conditions&#151;will fail to qualify for incapacity benefit.
<P>
The Government are, in effect, wiping out the poorer cousin of incapacity benefit&#151;severe disablement allowance&#151;leaving many people with means-tested benefits or, in some cases, with nothing at all. In their attempt at welfare reform, the Government seek simplification. We applaud attempts to simplify the system, but not if that means removing benefit entitlement wholesale, with little thought to what will happen to those claimants for whom benefits are no longer available, or for whom means-tested benefits are all that is left&#151;with all the stigma and complexity that that involves. That is not welfare reform; it is simply welfare removal.

<P>

<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> This clause and part IV of schedule 10 will abolish severe disablement allowance. The Government believe that SDA is ill-targeted and that its retention is not justified. It does not adequately provide for people disabled early in life. We are dealing with that problem by substantially increasing the benefit available to people severely disabled before the age of 20, or 25 in certain circumstances.
<P>
Because of the rate at which SDA is paid, 70 per cent. of its recipients have to claim income support, with the perverse consequence that the poorest 70 per cent. of people who qualify for SDA do not receive a penny of benefit from it. All the SDA that they receive is deducted, penny for penny, from their income support. The people who benefit from SDA are not the poorest 70 per cent. of claimants, but the 30 per cent. who are relatively better off.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> Does the Under-Secretary agree that SDA has advantages not only in cash terms but because people do not have to suffer the stigma of applying for it&#151;it is not income dependent? Even if they have to apply for other means-tested benefits, they at least know that they will receive part of their income as of right. That is how they look at it.
<P>


<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> The Government are extremely and firmly committed to improving the support available to the poorest and most severely disabled people. To adopt the approach that the hon. Gentleman suggests would spread the benefit over a number of people; many of them are poor and need support from the Government, but many others have a perfectly adequate income without the severe disablement allowance. The benefit of targeting the resource on the poorest and most disabled is that those people who need it most will get more money. That is what underlies the Government's strategy.
<P>
The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford referred to a comment in the papers produced by the Disability Alliance that was critical of the Government. To provide a balanced range of comments, I shall tell the Committee what else the Disability Alliance said in response to the consultation document.<P>
Mr. Quentin Davies: By quoting other things that the Disability Alliance may have said, the Minister is avoiding the precise questions that I put to him.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> The hon. Gentleman interrupts so that I cannot reply. If he sat in his place, I would reply.
<P>
Let me put the matter in context. I have already told the Committee that the Disability Alliance thoroughly approved of our decision to allow disabled 16 to 19-year-olds on to the long-term rate of incapacity benefit. The alliance also states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``We welcome the proposal to give disabled people on income support who also receive DLA higher rate care component an extra &#163;5.75 per week. We welcome the proposal to extend the higher rate mobility component of DLA to children aged 3 and 4. We were delighted when the Secretary of State announced that BIP was cancelled. We welcome the idea of personal advisers and believe they could bring a much needed individual approach to providing a quality service to disabled people.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There is more, but I shall now answer the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
We do not, thank God, live in a Stalinist state, where power-crazed bodies pander to the Government and agree with everything that they say. We live in a democracy, and we can exchange views. It would be quite perverse if voluntary bodies were tamely to approve everything that the Government proposed. They have not and we acknowledge it. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State said on Second Reading that feedback from voluntary bodies is extremely useful. We can reflect on what they say, and we sometimes modify our proposals as a result; but we sometimes decide not to do what they suggest. That is what one must expect in a democracy.
<P>
The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford also passionately defended the status quo. He said that he was here to defend the contributory principle just as it is; yet, only one hour ago, he was pressing amendments to clause 53, including amendment No. 295, which would have extended the availabilty of incapacity benefit to three classes of people who would have paid no contributions.
<P>
I do not expect consistency from the hon. Gentleman across a general election. Before the election, there was a massive increase in means-testing from the Conservative Government; after the election, they massively condemn means-testing. As the hon. Member for Canterbury (Mr. Brazier) pointed out, politicians have the right to change their minds, and election defeats certainly concentrate the mind. However, in one hour, we should expect more consistency.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> The Minister was good enough to acknowledge that, in introducing those amendments, I made it absolutely clear that our preference was for the status quo, but that if he insisted on changing the status quo against the disabled&#151;he had won some votes on that change&#151;we proposed trying to win votes in the other direction to provide additional protection. I have made it clear throughout that our preference is for the status quo and that we resist any additional means-testing.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> I am pleased to hear the hon. Gentleman's justification of his position. It is right that he should put that on the record.
<P>
I am glad that my hon. Friend the Member for Morecambe and Lunesdale examined the issue of passporting all those on severe disablement allowance on to incapacity benefit and that she took the precaution&#151;which Opposition Members have not noticeably done with their amendments&#151;of looking at the costs. She was told by the Library that the proposal would cost &#163;150 million. While the Library is normally a very accurate source of information, on this occasion it has given an underestimation. After the first year, the annual cost would be around &#163;230 million. My hon. Friend was right to ask her question and to come to the conclusion that we should not passport all those people on to SDA. Would it be right for taxpayers&#151;because the people who are claiming SDA are, by definition, people who have not paid national insurance contributions&#151;to foot the bill for a quarter of a billion pounds to provide an improvement in benefits to people who are clearly not the most needy? The Government's conclusion is that it would be wrong because it would conflict with our priority to provide more resources and support for the poorest and most severely disabled people.
<P>
My hon. Friend also raised the important point of the position of people whose income is just above the income support threshold. She will appreciate that there has to be a cut-off point with an income-related benefit such as income support, but the Government will ensure that a range of income-related benefits, such as council tax benefit in appropriate circumstances, housing benefit and help with NHS charges, are always payable above that threshold. My hon. Friend the Minister of State has agreed to look in particular in his pensions proposal at the plight of pensioners whose income takes them just above the income support level.
<P>
The hon. Member for Newbury raised two important issues: those of carers and of women. His accusation that the Labour Government show a lack of interest in carers is nonsense. My hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, North (Mr. Wicks)&#151;not a Liberal Democrat Member&#151;introduced the Private Member's legislation on carers in the last Session, in which I was pleased to play a minor role as a sponsor. It is the Labour Government who have just published the carers strategy that will provide an additional &#163;140 million of support for carers. Carers who have been receiving invalid care allowance can use their credits to qualify for incapacity benefit, provided that they have at some point paid contributions. The new contribution conditions for incapacity benefit will include protection for those who, because of their caring responsibilities, were unable to pay contributions in the two tax years prior to the claim.

<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> The hon. Gentleman has forgotten that I said that many carers are not eligible for the invalid care allowance and so would not come under the provision.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> We debated that issue earlier under the appropriate clause. If we were to spread the resources available to provide invalid care allowance to a much wider pool of carers than those claiming ICA, we would be doing so to about 6 million people. By restricting the resources to those who receive ICA, the money will go to those who have the most onerous caring obligations. To receive ICA, one has to provide care for at least 35 hours a week.
<P>
If we did as the hon. Gentleman suggested, we would be breaching the contributory principle in respect of people who care for someone for a few hours a week. That priority would be wrong. The Government want to provide more support for those in the greatest need and that is what we will be doing by concentrating resources on those who claim ICA.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> Surely the Minister can see that some people will fall between two stools: those who have too great a caring responsibility to be able to pay sufficient national insurance contributions to receive incapacity benefit, but too low a caring responsibility to receive ICA. What will happen to such people?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> We debated the matter fully under the previous clause and I responded to it to the satisfaction of most members of the Committee, if not to that of the hon. Member for Newbury. If he wants to extend the benefit to a wider range of people, it would be at considerable cost, part of which would be that the resources available to target more help to those in greatest need would be smaller. The Government have faced up to that choice. If the Liberal Democrats do not want to face up to it, it is entirely a matter for them, but the Government are doing what they believe to be right.
<P>
As for the gender implications of the clause, my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood (Mrs. Humble) reached the core of the argument against the position held by the hon. Member for Newbury. Circumstances have changed in the labour market. In the past, far fewer women than men had the opportunity to work, earn money and build up national insurance contributions. More women than men make up the pool of people who claim SDA at present. They will be protected under our proposals and will continue to receive SDA.
<P>
We must consider the proportion of men and women who will be entitled to claim in the future. There are now almost as many women as men in the labour force; 48 per cent. of the labour force are women, 52 per cent. are men. The number of women is increasing all the time, which is reflected by the proportion of women claiming incapacity benefit on the strength of their national insurance contributions. Twenty years ago, there were 84,000 such women; now there are more than 500,000. The relationship of women with the labour market has changed immensely. I accept that the hon. Member for Newbury raised an important point, but the Government have taken it properly into account in their proposals.
<P>
For existing cases, we intend to transfer automatically those entitled to severe disablement allowance, who are under the age of 20 at present or at the time when the changes are introduced, to long-term incapacity benefit one year later. However, SDA is currently claimed by many older people who have become disabled later in life. Unlike young disabled people, many will have had the opportunity to have worked and to have made choices about future financial provision. The abolition of SDA does not, of course, mean that in future people who become disabled later in life will be denied access to social security benefits&#151;an important point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Morecambe and Lunesdale. Income support, housing benefit, council tax benefit and other benefits will be available to those who do not qualify for incapacity benefit and, depending on the nature of the disablement, so will non-means-tested and non-contributory disability living allowance.

<P>

<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> The Minister again justifies the abolition of severe disablement allowance on the ground that people could often move on to means-tested benefits. Does he agree that if a large proportion, if not the total, of the benefits that any person receives are not means tested, the work incentives are much greater? Such people would not lose all the benefits that they would receive if they were to get a job. If they are totally dependent on income-related benefits, the work incentives go down. The Government claim to be in favour of work incentives.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> I do not follow the hon. Gentleman's argument. He argues for the retention of a right to non-means-tested benefits for people who are deemed 80 per cent. disabled and also fail the all-work test&#151;those who are deemed so incapacitated that they are unable to work in any way. His point is therefore not appropriate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> This is exactly the point that the Minister has made time and time again. Those people should not be disregarded&#151;it should not be assumed that they are incapable of work.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> If I misunderstood the hon. Gentleman's point, perhaps he will repeat it and I shall listen again.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I was saying that people who are eligible for severe disablement allowance, and will not be in future because there will be no such thing, will often find themselves on purely means-tested benefits. Although they may be severely disabled and have great difficulty working, surely it is better to give them the maximum incentive to try to find work, which they will have only if they know that they will receive a large part of that benefit even if they find work.

<P>
If they lose most of the benefit of working because they are on totally means-tested benefits, the work incentive will disappear. Those people, who are the hardest to find work for and who find it most difficult to find work, should be given the maximum incentive to work, not the minimum.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> I certainly misunderstood the hon. Gentleman's point, and he is right to call me up on it. It is a wider point than one relating simply to severe disablement allowance. I do not regard that allowance as a help to people on the passage from benefit to work, because the second they do work of any kind, they lose the entire benefit. I remind the hon. Gentleman that the Government have introduced a range of measures to make sure that work pays and to reduce the disincentives in the benefit system to people trying out work, such as the linking rule. There are also new regimes, such as the disabled person's tax credit, that will increase the incomes of disabled people who move from benefit to low-paid work.
<P>
To give a higher rate of benefit to young people who have never had the opportunity to work is the right way forward. To maintain the status quo would keep a benefit that is badly targeted, meaning that the third of its recipients who are on highest incomes get some benefit from it and the two thirds on lowest incomes get no benefit. I believe that it is right to make the changes that the Government propose and to refocus resources.

Clause 54 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 55</center></H4>
<H4><center>Attendance allowance</center></H4>
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 142, in page 52, leave out lines 14 to 18.
<P>
I hope that we shall be able to deal with the amendment fairly quickly. Under the Bill, the Government will be able to prescribe attendance allowance by resolution of the House rather than by primary legislation&#151;the amendment would change that. It is our view that it should remain possible to prescribe attendance allowance only by primary legislation. Unfortunately, the Government have often shown themselves all too unwilling to listen to consultees about the various changes that they want to make. While they seem so unwilling to listen to the consultation responses of interested groups, it is important that they should present to the House as a whole any changes that they want to make so that the widest possible debate can be held about the changes to disability benefits that they propose.
<P>
We hope to keep the attendance allowance entitlement conditions in primary legislation. The Government may choose to say that most of the changes that they want to make will be welcome. I hope that that is true, but even if it were, it would not matter very much if the Government had to face the House as a whole, because I am sure that the House would want to enable welcome changes to become law as quickly as possibble and the Government would find no particular difficulty with that.
<P>
It is interesting in that regard to note the comments of the Law Society, which has serious anxieties about the introduction of a regulation-making power for attendance allowance, which will enable changes in entitlement to be made without proper parliamentary scrutiny. It might be said that the Law Society has an interest in ensuring that there is as much legislation as possible from which to make money for its members. Nevertheless, it is fair to assume that in this case it makes a valid and disinterested point, which we put to the Government to consider their response and to see whether they can persuade us that that anxiety is not necessary in this case.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> The Liberal Democrat amendment would delete that part of the clause that relates to the first aspect&#151;regulations on attendance allowance&#151;and would leave the parts that relate to the terminally ill, whom I trust that we shall have an opportunity to discuss in the clause stand part debate. Therefore, I shall deal merely with the first five lines of the clause, which the amendment would delete.
<P>
On this occasion too, we have much sympathy with the Liberal Democrat amendment, and thoroughly agree with the principles that inspire it. When the Liberal Democrats speak with the authentic voice of Gladstonian or Asquithian Liberalism, I often find it difficult to disagree with them. When they speak with the voice of the Lib-Lab pact, we do not have so much sympathy.
<P>
There seems to be something especially sinister about the provision for taking powers to legislate by regulation. Page 98 of the explanatory memorandum contains the horrifying admission that,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``It is intended that the regulations would be used when the conditions of entitlement to'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
attendance allowance,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``needed to be amended or clarified: for example, if a judicial decision departed significantly from the policy intention.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In other words, the Government have admitted that the purpose of the powers is to override&#151;against, I need hardly say, the interests of the disabled person&#151;a decision of the judiciary.
<P>
That seems highly unsatisfactory. Parliament enacts legislation, which is for the courts to interpret. If that interpretation is no longer satisfactory to Parliament, it is important that Parliament as a whole has the opportunity to return to the legislation. We should not simply have given away our pen and allowed the Government to override judicial decisions in this context. That is a sinister use of the power to make regulations. For once, the explanatory notes are rather frank about the Government's proposals. We support the Liberal Democrat amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I, too, support the amendment. Attendance allowance is of crucial importance to many old people in nursing homes. Many of them are financially constrained and they are upset with the present and the previous Governments because they were forced to sell their homes.
<P>
I fear that the clause is a devious route to means-tested attendance allowance. I am sure that the Administration would love to introduce such a proposal. It should be introduced only in primary legislation&#151;it should be out in the open and clearly stated. I hope that the amendment is agreed to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> I appreciate the points that have been raised. Parliament should take stock of the Government's proposals. I shall explain as briefly as I can why we believe that the power is necessary. It will allow the Government to set out in regulations the circumstances in which the night attendance and the day attendance conditions of entitlement are, or are not, met. The way in which DLA deals with those matters will also be used for attendance allowance.
<P>
For the benefit of the Hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs, I repeat what we said in the consultation paper. We clearly stated that we are not seeking to means-test attendance allowance or DLA. However, having the power to prescribe the conditions in regulations, which is done for DLA, will help us to keep the two benefits in line and will enable future changes to be made more quickly and effectively.
<P>
I assure Committee members that we have no plans to use the power to change the current conditions of entitlement, although we need to safeguard attendance allowance from unplanned changes. The clause could, of course, be used to restore the position or to clarify areas of ambiguity if entitlement were restricted in an unintended way, and it will deal with unplanned extensions.
<P>
I hope that that helps the hon. Member for Newbury to understand the importance of bringing attendance allowance completely into line, in the relevant respects, with DLA. On the basis of those reassurances, I hope that he will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> I am not entirely happy with the Minister's response, but I shall take further advice from disability groups. Perhaps we shall return to the matter at a later stage. Meanwhile, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>

<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> I have one question about the clause's proposals on the terminally ill. You will be greatly relieved to hear, Mr. McWilliam, that that will exhaust my interest in the clause.
<P>
The Government will replace the phrase,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``for the remainder of his life'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
which appears in the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992, with the phrase,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``for so much of the period for which he is terminally ill as does not fall before the date of the claim''.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
I have a technical question that may be of practical importance. My understanding is that the definition of the terminally ill, which is used in the benefits world and by the Benefits Agency, involves a person who is expected by medical opinion to die within six months.
<P>
For a number of incurable conditions, the only prognosis is death; but they evolve over a longer period than six months. Motor neurone disease was given as an example, but Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and many other conditions would fall into the same category. It makes no sense to reassess people who have been diagnosed with such conditions&#151;such people are terminally ill and therefore cannot improve. Will the Under-Secretary explain to the Committee how such conditions will be dealt with? Can he assure the Committee that no provision of the clause will worsen the situation of people suffering from such conditions, in terms of their eligibility for attendance allowance or the procedures that they must go through to qualify? If he can do so, we shall have no further objection to the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> I can provide that assurance. I am glad that the hon. Gentleman has raised the point. It might help the Committee if I were to explain our reasons for the proposed change.
<P>
Many people with a terminal illness are of course not aware of their prognosis. The Benefits Agency takes steps to ensure that they do not find out through its dealings with them. If life awards are retained only for special rules cases&#151;people who are deemed terminally ill&#151;people who fall into such a category will be singled out by the nature of the award and may understand that a life award is made only to those who are terminally ill. If that were to happen, a small number of people would be caused considerable distress. That is why we intend to change the law in that respect.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 55 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 56</center></H4>
<H4><center>Disability living allowance</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 291, in page 52, line 43, leave out ` or (c)' and insert `(c) or (d)'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments:
<P>
No. 223, in page 52, line 44, leave out `the age of 3' and insert `from birth'.
<P>
No. 292, in page 53, leave out lines 1 and 2.
<P>
No. 224, in page 53, line 2, leave out `5' and insert `3'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> We certainly welcome the Government's decision to extend eligibility for mobility allowance to disabled children aged between three and five years. It would be churlish not to welcome such a concession and improvement.
<P>
The purpose of the amendment is to remove a grudging and unattractive feature of the clause, which I suspect will save virtually no money and which is in conflict with the spirit of what the Government are doing. It would exclude those children covered by section 73(1)(d) of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 from benefiting from mobility allowance. I know that you presided over the Committee stage of that Bill, Mr. McWilliam, and I will not blame you for any of its provisions. Nevertheless, I suspect that if you had not been there it would not have come into force in the first place.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. If I had not been there, somebody else would.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> You are wrong, Mr. McWilliam, to think yourself dispensable in any way. I assure you of that.
<P>
You will recall the first three conditions in section 73&#151;paragraphs (a), (b) and (c)&#151;for the payment of mobility component for disabled children over the age of five. Those conditions are that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``he is suffering from physical disablement such that he is either unable to walk or virtually unable to do so: or he falls within subsection (2) below''&#151;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
which would be a child who is blind and deaf&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``or he falls within subsection (3) below''&#151;<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
which is a child who is severely mentally impaired&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``or he is able to walk but is so severely disabled physically or mentally that, disregarding any ability he may have to use routes which are familiar to him on his own, he cannot take advantage of the faculty out of doors without guidance or supervision from another person most of the time.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If we take that legal language and visualise a child in that situation, we are presented with a pathetic scenario. It was right for Parliament in 1992 to decide that such a child would qualify for the mobility component. As the Government are generously extending that right to the age of three, it is equally right that it should be extended to children in category (d). We are dealing with extraordinarily sad cases. It is difficult to draw the line between those who are unable, or virtually unable, to walk and those who are so physically disabled that they cannot do so in practice without guidance or supervision. Why is that invidious distinction necessary?
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Amendments Nos. 291 and 292&#151;one is consequential on the other&#151;would re-establish justice to ensure that children who are pathetically disabled and afflicted benefit from the mobility component. The mobility component is necessary to help the poor parents with the many extra costs associated with such children. A child of three may require heavy equipment and pushchairs to get about. It is impossible to take such items on buses or tubes. We can imagine a mother trying to carry a child and the equipment that he or she needs to function. The mobility component is designed to meet extra costs, such as taxi fares, which&#151;God knows&#151;are expensive.
<P>
The other two amendments were not tabled by me. I trust that I shall have a chance to talk to amendment No. 293, which is on a separate subject.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for Winchester and I tabled two amendments in the group. I do not need to spend time on amendment No. 224. It would have the same effect as the Conservative amendments, and I agree with their arguments.
<P>
Amendment No. 223 is different because it introduces the possibility of the relevant benefits being paid from birth rather than from the age of three. The arguments of the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford apply equally to children who are suffering from a form of disability from birth. Additional transport costs may be incurred from a child's birth to pay for extra hospital and doctor visits. Even a small baby may require extra medical equipment which could make it unsuitable for parents to use public transport. Public transport is not always reliable. It would be wrong to have to wait at a bus stop for hours if a small baby had a difficult condition and was in pain.
<P>
Extra transport costs may be incurred from birth. The good reasons for giving the mobility allowance to children from the age of three are equally applicable from birth. I hope that the Government reconsider their decision.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> Let me try to answer the points briefly without reading out a long description of the law and the nature of the amendments. I am grateful to the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford for his kind remarks about the Government's decision to extend the higher rate mobility component to three and four-year-old children. The higher rate mobility component is payable to people who cannot walk or who can barely walk. We took advice from a number of sources on the age at which children usually begin to walk a reasonable distance, rather than simply toddling from one end of a room to the other. Clinicians, the DLA advisory board and others suggested an age range of two-and-a-half to four. Therefore, we felt it appropriate to include three and four-year old children by extending the availability of the higher rate mobility component downwards from age five. The age of 36 months is rather closer to the lower estimate of 30 months than to the higher estimate of 48 months.
<P>
As with all such matters, one can argue about the needs of a child one month before the provision takes effect. However, I hope that Committee members will agree that the Government were right to reduce substantially the age at which the higher rate can be claimed. The change will provide children who have severe walking difficulties with an extra &#163;35.85 a week. That will benefit approximately 8,000 children a year at a cost of about &#163;15 million. We decided that it would be wrong to extend the provision beyond the age of three, not for reasons of cost but because it would be inconsistent with the advice that we received.
<P>
The lower rate mobility component is paid not to people who cannot walk, but to people who need guidance when they walk along unfamiliar routes. In the Government's view, it is inconceivable that parents would allow children aged under five to walk unsupervised in unfamiliar surroundings. Therefore, it would be inappropriate to extend the lower-rate mobility component to such children. Clearly, the matter could be discussed in greater detail.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Jacqui Lait </B>(Beckenham): I shall not detain the Committee longer than necessary, but I wish that the Under-Secretary had seen the number of three, four and five-year-old children who do wander around unsupervised. Why else do we say to them, ``Don't talk to strangers, darling''? The Under-Secretary should take that into account and not be too dogmatic.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> Clearly, if one visits bad estates in certain parts of the country, one may see children who do not get the parental care and attention that they need. However, it would be wrong for us to base our policy on the assumption that it is right and normal for three or four-year-old children to be out and about on their own on streets with which they are unfamiliar. The purpose of the lower-rate mobility component is to provide help and guidance to people who need it when out of doors in unfamiliar surroundings. However, the vast majority of parents and others who care for children under the age of five would expect to provide guidance and support in such surroundings without being paid a DLA mobility component.
<P>
In our view, it would be wrong for that component to be paid for children with disability advice and guidance needs, but not for other three and four-year-olds. In such cases, one would expect the proper parenting and child care that we have described to be provided.

<P>

<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> I am sorry, Mr. McWilliam, but the Minister has persuaded me that we must press the amendment to a vote. His response was not only grudging, but irrelevant. We are not discussing whether three-year-old children would normally be left to walk around by themselves. Of course they should not. We are discussing the additional costs incurred by parents who sadly and tragically have disabled children. The additional costs exist. They arise, for example, if additional equipment is needed, which cannot be taken on a bus or a tube with the child&#151;it would usually be possible to take a normal child of three or four on a bus or a tube. A car may have to be modified to take special push chairs and so on. I shall not labour the point because everyone knows that additional equipment is likely to be necessary if a child is, as stated in section 73(1)(d) of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``so severely disabled physically or mentally that
. . . he cannot take advantage of the faculty out of doors without guidance or supervision.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In such circumstances, the same sort of costs are incurred as by parents who face the tragedy of a child suffering from the disabilities listed in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of section 73(1) of the 1992 Act. We shall press the amendment to a vote.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rendel:</B> Surely, we should be considering needs. The needs of children under three do not include being able to walk. Most children under three cannot walk, but they have mobility needs. We are discussing benefits that may overcome some of the extra costs of mobility needs. For children over three, that refers to mobility needs if they cannot walk, but children under three also have mobility needs that may involve extra costs. As the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford said, mobility needs for very young children may be higher than normal because of the amount of travelling that is necessary to and from hospitals and the difficulty of that travelling. They should be included.

The purpose of the amendment is to remove the unpleasant aspect of retrospectivity, which is a constitutional principle relating directly to the liberty of the subject. I hope that in the best tradition of Gladstone and Asquith, the Liberal Democrats are with us on that.
<P>
An interesting insight into the way in which the Government operate is that the retrospectivity clause is a two-way bet for the Government. Subsection (4) of the clause states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Subsection (3) does not affect awards made before'', the ``day on which that subsection comes into force.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That provides that there will be no retrospectivity on the matter that we have just discussed. It also states that it will not be possible for children, in respect of whom an award has already been&#151;or may be&#151;considered or made, to gain the benefit of the more generous provisions that the Government have enacted. However, retrospectivity is removed only from those parts of the clause that might otherwise have benefited the claimant. The Government have spectacularly ensured that the rest of the clause is subject to retrospectivity, which is unacceptable.
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
A big issue is involved&#151;the Government's straightforwardness with the public. The Government want to ensure that awards of DLA are not made for life. We agree that they should not henceforth be made for life, but it is utterly wrong retrospectively to withdraw existing awards that have been made for life. Doing so will shatter the confidence of the disabled person who receives DLA and who believed that that award was genuinely for life. I cannot think of an easier way to increase the stress and undermine the happiness of, and to create unnecessary anxiety among, the disabled than to introduce such a provision.
<P>
First, we strongly disapprove of such retrospectivity. Secondly, we disapprove of the fact that the disabled have, once again, been targeted by the unpleasant side of the Government's policies. Thirdly, I am sorry to say that we disapprove of the characteristically disingenuous way in which the Government are trying to disguise their behaviour. That is simply not good enough. I refer once again to the glossy brochure, ``Support for disabled people''. Does not that title give the game away? To introduce a programme that is designed to withdraw &#163;800 million a year from disabled people and to call the supporting document ``Support for disabled people'' reveals the Government's Orwellian tactics at their worst.
<P>
Page 12 of that document contains an extraordinary phrase. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The term `life awards' is misleading''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is one of the many blatantly dishonest statements that the Government have made to the disabled and to Parliament. Presumably the same special adviser, bureaucrat or PR hack who produced the Green Paper also helped to produce the explanatory notes, which use exactly the same phrase, but it is equally unacceptable there.
<P>
The statement is not misleading. Parliament has made provision for the granting of life awards. [Interruption.] The Government clearly do not like my argument. The Act for which you were responsible, Mr. McWilliam, the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992, states in section 71(3)&#151;[Interruption.] The new Labour Back Benchers are trying to support their ministerial colleagues by heckling me. They do not like this subject, but they will have to listen to my argument and to what the law states.
<P>
Section 71(3) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``A person may be awarded either component''&#151;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
that is, either component of DLA, namely, mobility or care&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``for a fixed period or for life''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The law provides for two types of award: fixed period and life. Therefore, life is a category. Section 72(5)(b) defines life as
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``the remainder of his life beginning with''&#151;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the date of the award. There is no misunderstanding over the existence of awards for life: they do exist and the Government are going to abolish them. It is acceptable to abolish the concept of the award for life for reasons that the Government shall doubtless give in a moment. However, it is not acceptable to abolish it retrospectively and it is even less acceptable to pretend to the public that it is not being abolished because it never existed.
<P>
That is another example of the Government mocking the disabled. The Government are not prepared to tell the disabled the truth and present them with the facts, which are pretty unpleasant and unacceptable to them and anyone else who cares about their fate. It is about time that the Government gave an honest explanation. What they are about is unacceptable and the means through which they achieve their aims are, in many ways, even less acceptable.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes the charge that our consultation document on disability benefits is misleading, but it is the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 that is misleading. In a curious way, because it has misled him, he has demonstrated that point. The 1992 Act uses the phrase, ``for life'', which has given many people the misleading impression that, once they receive a life award, they will continue to benefit from it at a constant rate for the rest of their natural lives. However, the 1992 Act rightly states that any award can be changed at any time if the circumstances of the claimant change. For example, if the health of people in receipt of life awards deteriorates, they will receive different and better awards. Alternatively, if their health improves and their disability level&#151;their need for help with mobility or care costs&#151;reduces, the 1992 Act makes it clear that their awards must be reduced.
<P>
Of course, in the past, that has created confusion. All that we are trying to do is to avoid such confusion by describing an award with no fixed period not as a life award, which is misleading, but as an award for an indefinite period.
<P>
As a junior Minister, my duties often involve examining the cases of individuals that are presented to me by Members of Parliament. Many such individuals make the same point that the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford made. They are disappointed because they thought that they had been granted awards for life, but subsequently found that their awards changed because their circumstances changed. I have become all too familiar with a letter in which I explain that the phrase, ``life award'' is misleading, because the 1992 Act does not necessarily grant awards to people for the rest of their natural lives. Exactly the same phrase was used in letters by my Conservative predecessors to explain the misconception. When I was a Back Bencher I received one or two letters complaining on behalf of people who had received life awards and who had subsequently found that they had changed. The 1992 Act is confusing and it is that aspect of it that we want to remove.
<P>
Is the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford minded to withdraw his amendment, or would he like me to speak at greater length about how the power will not change people's current entitlement.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> The Minister had better continue, although it is unlikely that anything he says will dissuade me from pressing the amendment to a vote.

<P>

<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> I will continue briefly.
<P>
The provision in the clause concerning life awards is intended to achieve clarity. The term ``life award'' has proved to be misleading to people who receive such benefits, whether disability living allowance or&#151;to return to the subject of another clause&#151;attendance allowance. Many have wrongly assumed that, once it is awarded, the benefit cannot be reviewed, which is not the case. To receive benefit, the conditions for entitlement must be met and must continue to be met. One of the reasons why the previous Government introduced the benefits integrity project was to review life awards as well as other awards. The Conservatives therefore understood the problem before the last election, although they did not have the right solution. Perhaps that is why they introduced a review of life awards.
<P>
Rules exist that specify when awards can be altered&#151;for example, when a change in circumstances takes place or a mistake has been made&#151;and we do not want to change them. We do not wish to make any arbitrary changes in other ways; we want to address people's understanding of the system, not their entitlement to benefit.
<P>
We will not replace all life awards with awards for fixed periods. That would place an unnecessary burden on disabled people and officials, and would not provide the long-term financial security that severely disabled people deserve. People who have an award of benefit for life will find, following implementation of the clause, that such an award will continue in the same way as life awards currently do. The law already allows for such an award to be changed if a person is entitled to more or less benefit.
<P>
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> It is shameless arrogance for the Government to say that the law is deficient, that they do not intend to enforce it and that it is misleading. There is no doubt that the Government propose to change the law. The Under-Secretary said that the Government would not review all life awards, which is an acceptance that life awards exist.
<P>
The Government sorely need reminding of basic principles. A Government's duty in a democracy is to enforce and observe the law. Any doubts about the interpretation of the law must be submitted to the courts. If the courts decide that there is something wrong with the law, the Government have recourse to Parliament to change it. It is not acceptable, however, to say that the law is misleading and that it will not be observed. People have received life awards&#151;the Under-Secretary said so himself&#151;and any change in the law must not be retrospective. The Under-Secretary suggested that doubt or ambiguity exists and that it is Parliament's fault. If that is so, Parliament must ensure that the citizen is given the benefit of the doubt and that those who have life awards retain them. It is only through the passage of this Bill that a new regime should apply and that no life awards should be granted.
<P>
We feel strongly about this matter of principle and we shall press the amendment to a vote.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I want to make a point about style rather than of substance. The Bill has been described as being woman-friendly, and the clause refers to child benefit, from which most women benefit. However, the clause uses only the third person male pronoun. It strikes me that it would not be beyond the wit of man&#151;I choose my words carefully&#151;to draft legislation in such a way that it is at least politically correct in the Government's eyes. I recognise that references to benefits in most social security legislation use the male pronoun to refer to both sexes, but doing so causes a lot of silly nonsense in relation to child benefit. I hope that the Government will take my point on board and ask the parliamentary draftsmen to draft legislation in a way that is understandable and non-sexist.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> The use of such language is a well-accepted drafting convention, but I shall pass the hon. Lady's views on to the Parliamentary Counsel Office.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 57 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 61</center></H4>
<H4><center>Class 1 contributions</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, it will be convenient to take the following: clause 62 stand part, Government new clauses 15 and 16, Government new schedules 2 and 3 and Government amendments Nos. 311 to 322, 325, 326, 330 and 331.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I hope that I can persuade the Committee to take the same view of the Government amendments, new clauses and new schedules as that taken by the Trades Union Congress. Its parliamentary briefing, which is entitled ``Jolly Good Show'', states that the zero-rate band is a significant reform with the potential for major gains for low-paid workers. The TUC thinks that it is important that the Government are congratulated. I agree with the TUC on that matter, as I do on many others.
<P>
The amendments will introduce the national insurance changes announced by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor last month. Part of the reason for the text being long is the necessity of making provision for Northern Ireland, because national insurance has been reserved as a function of the United Kingdom Parliament. Another reason for the schedules being long is that they consolidate the relevant provisions of the Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 completely. I know the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford will welcome that.
<P>
The fundamental change is to raise the point at which employees start to pay contributions on their earnings from the current lower earnings limit to a new primary threshold. People with earnings at low levels would be vulnerable if that change were introduced with no protection for their benefit rights, so the new schedule includes a provision to ensure that any employee who earns at or above the lower earnings limit and up to the new threshold will be treated as having paid contributions. Because of that, the lowest paid people will still be able to build up their entitlement to contributory benefits. [Hon. Members: ``Jolly good show.''] Indeed.
<P>
The remaining reforms are almost entirely consequential.
<P>
My right hon. Friend the Chancellor has announced that the upper earnings limit for contributions will rise. The Government received some criticism for that and it was described as ``tax by stealth.'' The reality is that the starting point for paying contributions will become the primary threshold, so the definition for the upper limit needs to be changed. We are doing that, and the precise level of all the limits and thresholds will be set by regulations in line with the unaltered basic formula.
<P>
Another point to which I want to draw the Committee's attention is that, in the same way as we are protecting benefit rights for employees, we are protecting the national insurance rebate paid to contracted-out pension schemes. There will be cases in which employers are entitled to a larger amount of rebate than they are liable to pay in contributions, and part II contains provisions to allow the Inland Revenue to settle the balance separately.
<P>
The measures are important to our jigsaw of welfare reform, removing obstacles to work and ensuring that it is worth while for people to move into work. I urge the Committee to support them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> We were happy with the amendments until the Minister spoke, but he has raised some complicated and interesting issues on which we shall have to take advice. We may wish to return to them later.
