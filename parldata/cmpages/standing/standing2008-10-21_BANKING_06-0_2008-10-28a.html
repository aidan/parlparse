proposed [this day], </i>That the clause stand part of the
Bill.</div><a name="08102871000383"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.30

<a name="08102871000047"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08102871000414"></a><b class="B">Stewart
Hosie</b> (Dundee, East) (SNP): As I was saying before lunch,
the clause is similar in form to a clause we considered on another
Bill. That clause gave Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs
officials the right to access and seize documents. I argued that if a
document was an electronic document hosted on an overseas computer, it
would be wholly unreasonable to expect that the person being asked to
provide it could necessarily do so. Such legislation, because it could
be seen as extraterritorial, might be unenforceable. The same argument
applies in this case.</div>
<a name="08102871000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause states that the Bank of England may appoint someone to inspect
an inter-bank payment system and that the operator of that system
must</div><a name="08102871000351"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;grant
an inspector access, on request and at any reasonable time, to premises
on or from which any part of the system is
operated&#148;.</div><a name="08102871000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clearly,
if the data centre is overseas, that might be impossible and legally
unenforceable. However, although the extraterritorial argument is a
real one that needs to be addressed, the issue of the operator is more
important in terms of the Bill. The operator may be a fairly junior
member of staff in a bank, certainly not a senior figure, who may not
have access or be able to arrange it.</div>
<a name="08102871000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">If an
overseas data centre forms part of the system that is to be inspected,
it would make more sense for the legislation to suggest that failure
would be only if all reasonable efforts to gain access or to allow the
inspector access were not made, rather than the pretty blunt
description in the clause that the operator of a recognised inter-bank
payment system must grant an inspector access even when the centre may
be overseas or he or she simply cannot organise that access. I should
like to hear what the Minister has to say about that. I would not like
to see a piece of legislation that could land someone in court, or
subject them to an inspection warrant, for something that they
physically cannot do, or do not have the status to do. Would not the
phrase &#147;make all reasonable efforts&#148; be better than the
wording in the clause? I will listen to what the Minister has to say
before we look at other amendments to this part of the
Bill.</div>
<a name="08102871000051"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102871000415"></a>The
Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Ian Pearson):</b> Clause
179, as Members have outlined, gives the Bank of England the power to
appoint inspectors whose role is to inspect the operation of a
recognised inter-bank 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column164" />Column number: 164</div>system. It is relatively straightforward and is the first of a number of
clauses in the enforcement section of part 5. It places the operator of
the system under a statutory obligation to grant the inspector access
to the premises from which all or part of the system is operated or
managed and to co-operate with the inspector.</div>
<a name="08102871000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">The power
allows the Bank of England to appoint an inspector to check that codes
of practice, principles, system rules or directions are being complied
with and that the recognised inter-bank payment system is otherwise
operating in a satisfactory manner. The power is an important tool of
oversight that strengthens the Bank&#146;s ability to ensure that
payment systems identified as of systemic or system-wide importance are
being operated in a manner that does not pose a threat to business or
other interests, or to financial stability in the United Kingdom as a
whole.</div><a name="08102871000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire asked whether the power would
be routinely used. I am happy to confirm that we do not anticipate that
it will be routinely used. We expect that if the Bank of England had
any concerns about the operation of an inter-bank system it would
discuss them in the first instance with the operator concerned. In
most, if not all cases, I imagine that things would be sorted out.
However, given the importance of oversight of those critical systems, I
think it right that there are powers for inspection, so the later
powers that we shall discuss are in
reserve.</div><a name="08102871000054"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08102871000416"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Colin Breed</b> (South-East Cornwall) (LD): Would that be
similar to the non-routine use of the Anti-terrorism, Crime and
Security Act 2001 for the inspection of Landsbanki, for
instance?</div>
<a name="08102871000055"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102871000417"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I will not be tempted to speculate or to respond
to that comment; I discussed the issue at some length yesterday in the
statutory instrument Committee dealing with
Landsbanki.</div><a name="08102871000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Dundee, East made a number of interesting points
relating to the fact that some bank systems are outsourced. I recognise
that, and it will have to be taken into account by the Bank of England
as part of its supervisory role. The Bank will want to ensure that it
has confidence that the systemic and system-wide recognised
inter-banking systems are being operated in an appropriate manner. I
cannot prejudge all the circumstances in which an inter-bank system
might operate and I do not think that it would be right to put them in
the Bill; that is not the purpose of primary legislation. However, the
hon. Gentleman makes a valid point that will have to be considered as
part of how the Bank views its oversight
arrangements.</div>
<a name="08102871000057"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08102871000418"></a><b class="B">Sir
Peter Viggers</b> (Gosport) (Con): I last came across the
exercise of powers such as this last week in parallel circumstances,
when I found myself answering questions on behalf of the
Speaker&#146;s Committee on the Electoral Commission about the powers
of the Electoral Commission to investigate premises and to call for
papers. I am thus looking with some interest at clause 179 and
wondering whether the Minister can tell me what the previous powers
were in this field. No doubt there were powers for the Bank of England
to carry out investigations, and the provision may be a repetition or a
strengthening of powers that previously existed. I would be interested
to know whether there were such powers.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column165" />Column number: 165</div><a name="08102871000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, I
wonder if the operator of a recognised inter-bank payment system knows
that he is an operator of a recognised inter-bank payment system. What
process is there for ensuring that when the inspector authorised by the
Bank of England arrives to inspect the premises, the operator realises
that he must give the inspector access?</div>
<a name="08102871000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">My third
point is about the
phrase</div><a name="08102871000352"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;otherwise
co-operate with an
inspector,&#148;</div><a name="08102871000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">which
seems very broad and seems to mean that the operator must do everything
that the inspector requires him to do. However, one would like rather
more clarification of exactly what it is that the inspector can require
the operator to do. To say that they must &#147;otherwise
co-operate&#148; with the inspector is really very broad and might
leave the operator, who might not be briefed in banking law, at a loss
as to what exactly they are required to do. I would be grateful for
some clarification of what appears, on the face of it, to be a very
general clause.</div>
<a name="08102871000061"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102871000419"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> The hon. Gentleman raises three points. The first
is the question of whether the operator understands that he is
operating a recognised system. As we explained when considering some of
the earlier clauses, there is a process whereby the Treasury will
establish that a system is a recognised system because it is of either
systemic or system-wide importance. In the consultation exercise, we
gave examples of those systems and it would be readily apparent to
those who work in such areas that they are operating a systemic or
system-wide inter-bank system.</div>
<a name="08102871000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second
issue that the hon. Gentleman raised related to the fact that the Bank
of England already has a number of investigatory powers. The Bank has
not previously had statutory responsibilities for the oversight of
inter-bank systems. Under the clause, we are talking specifically about
inter-bank systems and giving the power of inspection, if it is
required, to the Bank.</div>
<a name="08102871000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">The third
point that the hon. Gentleman made was about the
words</div><a name="08102871000353"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;otherwise
co-operate with an
inspector&#148;.</div><a name="08102871000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand that the power is relatively broad. It will be used in a
reasonable way by the Bank of England, just as we expect all our public
institutions to operate in a reasonable manner. I do not think it
unreasonable to put the power in the
Bill.</div><a name="08102871000065"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question
put and agreed
to.</i></div><a name="08102871000066"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Clause

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102871000422"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b><b class="B"> </b>The clause deals with the circumstances in
which Bank of England inspectors may apply for a warrant entitling them
to enter the premises of an operator of a payment system and in which
justices of the peace may issue one. A number of conditions are set out
and if any one of them is fulfilled, an inspector will be permitted to
seek to obtain a warrant for entry. The amendment relates to condition
4, which states
that</div><a name="08102871000354"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a
person occupying or managing the premises has failed to co-operate with
an
inspector.&#148;</div><a name="08102871000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
understand the thinking behind the amendment, it is worth looking at
the other conditions. It must be remembered that it is necessary to
satisfy only one of them. Conditions 1 and 2 relate to the
information-gathering process set out in clause 190. Condition 3
relates to refusing to give an inspector access to premises, despite
reasonable notice having been given. If an operator has not failed to
provide information or access, a warrant can none the less be issued on
the basis that the person occupying or managing the premises failed to
co-operate with an
inspector.</div><a name="08102871000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
point of the amendment is that only an inspector who is acting
reasonably should be able to obtain a warrant. The other conditions are
set at the appropriate level, but condition 4 simply allows an
inspector to make requests of the occupier of premises that are part of
a payment system. If he refuses to co-operate in any way, he makes
himself vulnerable to a warrant from a justice of the peace. I would be
grateful for the Minister&#146;s views on that
point.</div><a name="08102871000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
I may talk generally on the clause, it would preclude the need, from my
point of view, for a stand part debate. I shall raise the usual points
and I am sure that the Minister will be obliging in responding to them.
Will he give an assurance that the procedure in the clause will be used
only in exceptional circumstances? Does he anticipate the Bank of
England looking to obtain warrants to enter premises as a routine
matter? Given his comments on clause 179, I am sure that he will have
no problem in giving that
assurance.</div><a name="08102871000384"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.45
pm</div>
<a name="08102871000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 40 and 41 relate to clause 181, which sets out that the Bank of
England may require the operator of an inter-bank payment system to
appoint an expert to report on the operation of the system. Amendment
No. 40 would insert the word &#147;reasonably&#148; so that the
Bank may impose a requirement only if it reasonably thinks that the
operator is not taking sufficient account of the published principles
or the code of practice. Amendment No. 41 would insert the word
&#147;substantially&#148; in subsection (2)(c) so that the Bank may
impose a requirement only if it reasonably thinks that the report is
likely for any other reason substantially to assist the Bank in the
performance of its functions under this part. Both amendments attempt
to be slightly 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column167" />Column number: 167</div>more specific, because a report might be of only marginal benefit to the
Bank yet cause substantial inconvenience and costs for the payment
system, so it should not be issued
lightly.</div>
<a name="08102871000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
42 relates to clause 185, which sets out the Bank of England&#146;s
powers to close a payment system, which is clearly a draconian
sanction. The amendment proposes that those powers may be applied only
if the Bank reasonably thinks that the compliance failure threatens the
stability of the UK financial system. It is a probing amendment, so I
would be grateful for the Minister&#146;s thoughts on
it.</div><a name="08102871000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 43 also relates to clause 185 but is less of a probing amendment.
Although it would not be fair to claim that it goes to the heart of the
Bill, I feel quite bullish about it. The current drafting
states:</div>
<a name="08102871000355"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This
section applies if the Bank of England think that a compliance failure
threatens the stability of the UK financial system.&#148;</div>
<a name="08102871000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment would
instead state that the Bank of England &#147;thinks&#148; that the
compliance failure threatens the stability of the UK financial system.
Elsewhere, the Bill states that the Bank &#147;thinks&#148;, so I
hope that the Minister will accept the
amendment.</div><a name="08102871000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 44 and 45 relate to clause 190, which provides that the Bank of
England may request information from an operator of a payment system.
Again, I propose that that should occur when the Bank
&#147;reasonably&#148; thinks that it will help the Treasury in
determining whether to make a recognition order and when it
&#147;reasonably&#148; requires the information in connection with
its functions under Part 5. I am sure that the Minister will say that
the Bank of England will act reasonably in all circumstances, but I
suggest that we should include the provision in the
Bill.</div><a name="08102871000083"></a>

Peter Viggers:</b> I am of course aware that the explanatory
notes do not form part of the Bill and have not been endorsed by
Parliament, but one nevertheless looks to them for an explanation. In
relation to clause 180 they
state:</div><a name="08102871000356"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The

fact that &#147;conditions&#148; is plural could lead one to think

<div class="Column"><a name="Column168" />Column number: 168</div>error and he spotted it. Either it will be corrected, or I will happily

inappropriate.</div>

justice of the peace must look at a range of issues to see whether any
of the conditions are met in order to issue such a warrant. I am happy
to confirm to the hon. Member for Gosport that his interpretation is
right; it is any one or more of the &#147;following
conditions&#148;. The justice of the peace will look at whether the
requirements on the operator of the payment system, including the
requirement to co-operate with an inspector, have been met. If they
have not been met, the JP will ask why, but even if the JP considers an
inspector to have acted unreasonably, or that it was reasonable in the
circumstances for the operator of the payment system not to comply, a
warrant will not be issued unless one of the other conditions has been
met. There is, therefore, no need to amend the subsection in the manner
suggested.</div>
<a name="08102871000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 40, 42 and 44 relate to different clauses in the Bill and in
essence have the same purpose. As hon. Members are aware, the Bank of
England is adept at balancing public and private interests. As a public
body, it is expected that it will act reasonably when undertaking its
functions under this part of the Bill. It would be inconsistent with
existing legislation to include the word &#147;reasonably&#148; in
relation to the conduct of a public authority. For those reasons, the
proposed amendments are inappropriate.</div>
<a name="08102871000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bank of
England&#146;s actions might be subject to judicial review, which
could provide a remedy if the Bank&#146;s conduct was found to be
unreasonable, unfair or disproportionate. That is the normal way in
which legislation is passed in this House and the other House. The word
&#147;reasonably&#148; is not used in relation to public
authorities, because it is expected that public authorities will act
reasonably.</div>
<a name="08102871000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
41 would mean that the Bank of England can require a report only if it
&#147;substantially&#148; assists the Bank in carrying out its
functions. However, it might require a report in order to acquire
further information, should it feel that an operator of a recognised
inter-bank payment system is failing to meet its requirements. It may,
therefore, be impossible to say at the outset that such a report would
&#147;substantially&#148; assist the Bank of England. The report
might be of only partial assistance, and would need to be combined with
other information to provide a full and accurate picture of the
system&#146;s operation. We feel that the amendment would
unnecessarily restrict the Bank of England&#146;s ability to require
the production of such a report. I therefore ask the hon. Gentleman to
withdraw the amendment, although if he wishes to press amendment No.
43&#151;a typographical error&#151;I shall be happy to accept
it.</div>

reasonable, and it would be unreasonable to object to that. When we

<div class="Column"><a name="Column169" />Column number: 169</div><a name="08102871000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
for the other amendments in the group, I am pleased to learn that it is
assumed that public authorities act reasonably, although we can
probably all think of circumstances in which that does not apply.
However, given that the Minister has assured the Committee that the
provisions reflect the manner in which statutes tend to be drafted, I
am prepared not to press the point today. I am slightly alarmed by his
comments about &#147;substantially&#148;, as he may be leaving open
the opportunity for the Bank of England to go on what can only be
described as fishing expeditions for further information. I am not sure
that the drafting of clause 181 really provides protection for
operators of banking systems in such circumstances, given that an
independent report could be quite expensive and other factors need to
be borne in mind, such as the management time that it could
impose.</div><a name="08102871000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the Minister can provide an assurance that independent reports will be
used only in exceptional circumstances and that he does not regard them
as a matter of routine, it could prevent the need for a stand part
debate on clause 181. I would be happier if the Bank of England does
not use independent reports under clause 181 for the purpose of fishing
expeditions but, in the circumstances, I do not intend to press
amendment No. 41.</div>

see clause 180 and clause 181 on the independent report as being

that legislation allow only for a search warrant to be issued by a

the normal wording that ensures what legislation evidence is treated

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102871000432"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> We were getting carried away, were we not, with the
speed of progress? I wish to ask the Minister a couple of
questions.</div><a name="08102871000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
again have the words, &#147;may publish&#148;. I can see an
argument for some discretion for the Bank of England as to whether it
publishes details of compliance failure, particularly in respect of
minor circumstances, but I wish to flag up a point about major
failures.</div><a name="08102871000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister may be able to provide some reassurance to the Committee as to
the steps that will be taken by the Bank of England and, indeed, the
Treasury, if a major compliance failure is identified within a payment
system but the information has not necessarily reached the public
domain. If some type of failure is identified by the Bank of England,
it may cause publication, which may cause some damage to confidence in
that payments system. I would be grateful to know whether the Minister
has given any thought as to how such issues will be dealt with, because
we do not want regulatory authorities to be unprepared when publication
of some breach of the code of practice or principles is revealed to the
public and there is a sudden decrease in confidence in a particular
payment
system.</div><a name="08102871000113"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102871000433"></a>Sir
Peter Viggers:</b> I am concerned about a lack of specificity
in clauses 181 to 183. Clause 183
states:</div><a name="08102871000361"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Bank of England may publish details of a compliance failure by the
operator of a recognised inter-bank payment
system.&#148;</div><a name="08102871000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">How
will it get those details? I assume that it would get them under clause
181, as it</div>
<a name="08102871000362"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;may require the
operator of a recognised inter-bank payment system to appoint an expert
to report on the operation of the
system.&#148;</div><a name="08102871000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
I were starting from scratch, I would prefer to say in clause 181 that
the Bank may appoint an expert at the cost of the
operator.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102871000434"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I have a suspicion that the hon.
Gentleman is speaking to clause 181, which has already been decided by
stand part. It is okay for him to refer to it but not to go into any
great detail. He is speaking to clause 183 stand
part.</div><a name="08102871000117"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102871000435"></a>Sir
Peter Viggers:</b> Indeed, Mr. Hood, but clause
183, which I have just read, gives the Bank power to publish details of
a compliance failure. How is the Bank to get the information which,
under clause 183, it will require to carry out those powers? I should
have thought that the Bank would prefer, in preparation for the
exercise of powers under clause 183, to have its own independent
inspection. We have seen that under clause 181&#151;I shall not refer
to it again, Mr. Hood&#151;the Bank does not itself have
power to authorise an inspection. Instead, it has power only
to</div>
<a name="08102871000363"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;require the
operator...to appoint an
expert&#148;.</div><a name="08102871000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
he discusses clause 183, will the Minister explain how the Bank will
pull together all the information it needs to enable it to publish
details of a compliance failure? It does not have under its thumb or
control the inspector who carries out the inspection into the bank
under inquiry. I therefore would have thought that clause 183 would be
much more powerful if preceding it there was a description of the
detailed manner in which the Bank will pull together all the
information it needs. How can the Bank produce details of a compliance
failure if it has not had someone working specifically to produce the
details for it? I hope that the Minister understands the point that I
am making. It is a matter of concern that the Bank will not readily be
able to exercise the powers in clause 183 without the all the
background information that it needs to be clear and
specific.</div><a name="08102871000119"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08102871000436"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Peter Bone</b> (Wellingborough) (Con): I assume that the word
&#147;may&#148; in clause 183 is genuine and that it gives
discretion to the Bank. That goes to the heart of one of the problems
with the Bill and the banking system. A serious compliance failure by
one of the major banks that is published could cause a run against that
bank. Not to disclose such a failure might, in the long run, be better,
but if the bank got into serious trouble, the Government would be in a
great deal of trouble because the bank did not publish details of the
failure earlier. Do the Government think that such things should be
disclosed, or should they be kept quiet to stop the damage being done
to the relevant
bank?</div><a name="08102871000120"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102871000437"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> Clause 182 establishes the meaning of the term
&#147;compliance failure&#148;, and clauses 183 to 185 set out
sanctions that may be imposed if an operator of a recognised inter-bank
payment system commits a compliance
failure.</div><a name="08102871000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
first sanction is set out in clause 183, which provides that the Bank
of England may publish details of a compliance failure. In effect, it
is a power of public censure. The disclosure of an operator&#146;s
failure to observe or abide by requirements that seek to ensure the
UK&#146;s financial stability is intended to act as a deterrent
against non-compliance. There are other sanctions, which we will move
on to discuss, in case of more serious failures, but we think it right,
in the exceptional circumstances that I am happy to confirm we are
talking about, that the Bank has a range of measures at its
disposal.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column172" />Column number: 172</div><a name="08102871000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Gosport asked how the Bank might have the powers of
information to be able to come to its conclusions. Compliance failure
is defined in clause 182 as a failure to observe a requirement under
clauses 175, 176, 177 and 181&#151;respectively, the codes of
practice, system rules, directions and the independent report. Other
sanctions, as I said, are set out in clauses 184 and 185. When it comes
to looking at compliance with the code of practice and the system
rules, the Bank will routinely gather a lot of information, given its
oversight
role.</div><a name="08102871000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
addition, clause 190(1) gives the Bank power that
it</div><a name="08102871000364"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;may
by notice in writing require a person to provide
information&#148;,</div><a name="08102871000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">so
there are a range of mechanisms to ensure that the Bank has the
information that it requires to make the judgments that it wants to
make. I should stress that the publication of a report is
simply one way in which the Bank can act following a compliance
failure, which is why, in response to the hon. Member for
Wellingborough, the word should be &#147;may&#148;. It may be
better, if there was a serious breach of systems, not to publish a
report but to go for other remedies that we will discuss later. That
would be a judgment for the bank to make when considering the
circumstances of the
case.</div><a name="08102871000125"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102871000438"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> Will the Minister confirm that there is no limit on
the level of fine that may be imposed as a penalty in accordance with
the
clause?</div><a name="08102871000129"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102871000439"></a>Stewart
Hosie:</b> May we have some comfort from the Minister about
whether the penalty that may be levied for a compliance failure can be
variable and could be zero? Failures in respect of the code of practice
and the system rules, a failure to provide a direction, or a failure to
report, can mean anything between being late in issuing a report, as
specified in clause 181, and a serious breach of the guidelines or
rules, as in previous
clauses.</div><a name="08102871000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
terms of the limit on the fine, clause 187 says that before a sanction
is imposed, a warning is to be issued, and so on. Clause 186, which
deals with management disqualification,
states:</div><a name="08102871000365"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
person guilty of an offence is liable...to a fine not exceeding
the statutory
maximum&#148;.</div><a name="08102871000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">These
things apply in specific circumstances. Clause 184 uses the words,
&#147;pay a penalty&#148;, as opposed to imposing a sanction. Can
the Minister provide some clarity on the nature of the penalties and
say whether they are the same as a sanction? Will he clarify whether
the penalty or the sanction might be small in the case of a minor
breach but larger in the case of a significant systemic failure
breach?</div><a name="08102871000132"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08102871000440"></a><b class="B">Dr.
John Pugh</b> (Southport) (LD): I have a concern, brought
about by the comments of other hon. Members, about the excessive use of
&#147;may&#148; in the context of other verbs. An initial reading
of clauses 183 and 184 might 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column173" />Column number: 173</div>lead one to assume that the Bank of England will not act, will not
publish and will not inflict a penalty for a minor offence that does
not really require and necessitate such action. The hon. Member for
Wellingborough said that there might be various reasons for that; it
might not happen owing to information being highly commercially
sensitive and because the payments agency and the Bank of England, and
its chief executives, have had a really good lunch somewhere&#151;we
simply do not know. However, it is a quasi-judicial system. Some people
whose details are published and who have penalties inflicted on them
will, presumably, be commercially
damaged.</div><a name="08102871000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am wondering&#151;this is a serious anxiety&#151;how one resolves
concerns about equity, if, for example, the Bank of England uses its
discretion in one way, in favour of one organisation, and in another
way, possibly for good reasons, against another organisation. Should
the organisation that is commercially damaged or embarrassed, or
whatever, feel itself to have any kind of grievance, what precisely may
they do about it? I cannot see an appeal mechanism here, nor can I see
a mechanism whereby the reasons that the Bank may have for acting in
one case and not in another will be made explicit to such
organisations. I am worried that rumour may spread to the effect that
decisions are made on a partial and less than equitable basis.
Obviously, if the system is to work well it has to embody
equity.</div><a name="08102871000386"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.15

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102871000441"></a>Sir
Peter Viggers:</b> I concur with colleagues who feel that we
need rather more detail in the clause. It mentions a penalty. Are we
talking about a fine or could there be a penalty other than a financial
fine? We need to know the basis of the
assessment.</div><a name="08102871000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
Members of Parliament spend a lot of time talking about penalties in
criminal and civil cases. I had to discover from a constituency case
that, for example, Customs and Excise operates way outside any
statutory scale and it is open to it to impose such a penalty for
offences as it thinks fit. There needs to be some sort of calibration
of the penalty that can be
imposed.</div><a name="08102871000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">Moving
ahead to the appeal procedure under clause 188, which we are not
discussing at the moment, I see that there can be an appeal against a
warning notice of a requirement to pay a penalty. That wording sounds a
little cumbersome to me, but at this point I simply refer to clause 184
and ask for a degree of clarity on the amount of final penalty that the
Government have in mind.</div>
<a name="08102871000137"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102871000442"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> It is right that hon. Members ask questions about
clause 184 and what we have in mind for the penalty. It might be
helpful if I explain that the power to impose a financial penalty is
intended to act as a further deterrent against the non-compliance of
operators of recognised payment systems with their obligations under
this part of Bill. It reinforces the need to comply with, for example,
the provision of codes of practice or directions, which is intended to
ensure that systems are not being operated in a manner that could
represent a threat to financial stability, and to ensure the overall
robustness of the payment systems. We have no reason to believe that
operators will not want to co-operate and operate fully, but it is
right that we legislate to have an enforcement regime in
place.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column174" />Column number: 174</div><a name="08102871000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Southport suggested that there was no appeal system, but he
clearly has not appreciated what we have proposed in clause 188, or the
warning system set out in clause 187. Clause 184(1) gives the bank the
bank the power to impose a penalty in the event of a compliance
failure, and subsection (2) makes it clear that the penalty is payable
to the Bank of England and is enforceable as a debt. The term
&#147;sanction&#148; is defined in clause 187(2) and includes
penalties or other sanctions contained in this part.</div>
<a name="08102871000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">A number of
hon. Members rightly asked how much the penalty will be. To answer the
hon. Members for South-West Hertfordshire and for the Dundee, East in
particular, it is intended that the Bank will impose financial
penalties in proportion to the seriousness of the compliance failure
and the system operator&#146;s ability to pay. There is no statutory
limit, but as the hon. Member for Dundee, East rightly pointed out,
compliance failure could occur in a wide variety of circumstances, and
it would not be sensible to try to envisage all those circumstances and
include them in the Bill. However, I am happy to confirm in Committee
that it is our intention that if the Bank was in a situation where it
wanted to impose financial penalties, it would do so in a proportionate
way, depending on the circumstances.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102871000443"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> Buoyed up by that triumph, I would like to ask the
Minister a question on a point of clarification. The sanction of
closure of a payment system is clearly a serious one. I am sure that he
will confirm that it will be used in exceptional circumstances only,
but I draw the Committee&#146;s attention to the fact that clause 185
applies
where</div><a name="08102871000366"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a
compliance failure threatens the stability of the UK financial
system.&#148;</div><a name="08102871000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">Returning
to the debate we had this morning on clause 171 and the dual
criteria for assessing whether a payment system should be recognised or
not, those criteria
are:</div><a name="08102871000367"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;(a)
to threaten the stability of, or confidence in, the UK financial
system,
or</div><a name="08102871000368"></a><div class="hs_brev">(b)
to have serious consequences for business or other interests throughout
the United
Kingdom.&#148;</div><a name="08102871000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
quoted the Bank of England in putting the argument to the Minister that
it is essentially the wholesale payment systems that can be described
as systemic. The more retail-based payment systems cannot be described
as systemic, but could none the less have serious consequences for
businesses. The Minister did not accept that distinction. Would he say,
however, that the clause is more likely to apply to big payment
systems, which deal with large amounts of money? If so, significant and
disruptive failures in payment systems that are not of such a scale
would not be systemic and therefore would not be liable to closure
under the clause. I hope that I have made my point
clear.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column175" />Column number: 175</div><a name="08102871000147"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102871000444"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> I understand the reason behind the Government
wanting to stop the operation of a payment system. However, have they
considered the reverse? Are there provisions in the Bill to keep a
payment system open when the company wants to shut it down, but the
Government want to keep it going so that there is no failure in the
system?</div><a name="08102871000148"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102871000445"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> None of the enforcement powers proposed in the
Bill should be taken lightly. I am happy to confirm that we anticipate
their being used only in unusual and exceptional circumstances. The
power to make a closure order is necessary as the ultimate sanction in
cases of a compliance failure that is considered so serious that the
Bank of England believes that the continued operation of a recognised
inter-bank payment system could destabilise the UK financial system. It
is entirely appropriate for the Bank to have such a power in such
circumstances, because it will have to act decisively to address such
threats by closing down all or part of a recognised inter-bank payment
system.</div><a name="08102871000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
say again that that could happen to a payment system on the wholesale
or retail end of spectrum, but it would have to be of systemic or
system-wide importance. The combination of this power and the others
that we have discussed on publication compliance failures and financial
penalties provides a suite of tools that may be applied, depending on
the severity of the compliance
failure.</div><a name="08102871000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Wellingborough raised an interesting point. It is not
likely that the circumstance he described could or would ever arise,
but I have in the back of my mind that there are already powers that
could deal with it. If I find that that is not the case, I will think
about whether anything needs to be done in that area. However, I am
pretty confident that the matter is
covered.</div><a name="08102871000151"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102871000446"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> The Minister is being very generous. During
pre-legislative scrutiny, the British Bankers Association said if a
bank failed, an issue in retail banking would be to keep payments
flowing. Thinking about that in relation to the present example, if the
owners of a payment system fail for another reason, it may be desirable
to keep the payment system running so that there is not a systemic
failure.</div><a name="08102871000152"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102871000447"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I understand the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point.
It is probably covered in the clauses concerning system rules and
directorates. If a problem remains, I will reflect on whether
improvements need to be made at a later
stage.</div><a name="08102871000153"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102871000448"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I shall make just two points about the clause.
First, I am sure the Minister would not want us to have a system in
place that discourages good people from being involved in the operation
of payment systems, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column176" />Column number: 176</div>so if he can provide some comfort to the Committee about how the powers
under clause 186 will operate, it will be helpful. The powers are quite
widely drawn and there is concern that that might discourage people
from operating in that area&#151;although I also note that similar
provisions exist with regard to approved persons within FSA-regulated
entities as a whole.</div>
<a name="08102871000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, I
said to the Minister this morning that clause 177 is broadly defined
and that the Bank of England will be able to give a direction to the
operator of a recognised inter-bank payment system to take specified
action and that that power could be used against particular
individuals. The Minister referred me to clause 186 and was right to do
so, but considering clause 177 in isolation, it seems to be broad
enough to take into account various elements of clause 186. Therefore,
in the context of clause 186, I ask again if the Minister can confirm
that clause 177 will not be used as a mechanism for prohibiting
individuals and that, as far as the treatment of individuals is
concerned, that will be dealt with under clause 186. If he cannot
confirm that, perhaps he will elaborate on why that is the
case.</div><a name="08102871000158"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102871000449"></a>Mr.
Breed:</b> In the past, we have talked about the operator
being an entity and said that therefore the entity can or cannot carry
on. This clause specifically refers to a person. Unless the Bank of
England has authorised or qualified that person, it is difficult to see
how it can disqualify that person. Is it intended that people who are
in some sort of management position of responsibility in these payment
systems will have to be authorised by the Bank and then that
authorisation could be withdrawn, or will the Bank of England
effectively be able to override any service agreement that an
individual bank has entered into in respect of its personnel? In other
words, can it in some way insist that the bank disqualifies the person
who is operating in that way? That would be a massive change in the way
in which any regulator operates in relation to the institutions under
its powers. At the moment, yes, a regulator can regulate a company, a
bank, a business and everything else, but unless it is going to
specifically authorise individual people and they are going to have to
maintain that sort of qualification or authorisation, it is difficult
to see how the Bank of England can do
that.</div><a name="08102871000159"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102871000450"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> The hon. Gentleman will be aware that in entities
regulated by the Financial Services Authority, there is an approved
persons regime. Before one can perform a controlled function with an
FSA-regulated entity, it is necessary to have obtained approval from
the FSA, and the FSA is entitled to withdraw that approval and so on.
In that sense, there is a parallel. Does he agree that the distinction
under clause 186 is that there is not an approval regime in the first
place? Perhaps there is a point to be made about notification and the
Bank of England being aware of who is employed. That matter does not
appear to have been specifically
addressed.</div><a name="08102871000160"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102871000451"></a>Mr.
Breed:</b> That is the specific point I am making. If we are
going to get down to the situation of people being authorised to
undertake management functions in this way and therefore carrying some
sort of approval by the Bank of England, that is fine, because that
approval can be removed. The fact that approval has 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column177" />Column number: 177</div>been removed will mean that they cannot continue to operate in the
management role and so on. What is not clear is to what extent the Bank
of England is now involving itself in the approval of management in
those
instances.</div><a name="08102871000387"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.30
pm</div><a name="08102871000161"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102871000452"></a>Sir
Peter Viggers:</b> My point is rather similar. I derive my
text from the proverb, &#147;You don&#146;t shoot the pianist, you
shoot the person who asked him to play.&#148; Clause 186
says:</div><a name="08102871000369"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Bank of England may by order prohibit a specified person from being an
operator&#148;.</div><a name="08102871000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
goes on to
say:</div><a name="08102871000370"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Bank may by order prohibit a specified person from holding an
office&#148;.</div>
<a name="08102871000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">What it does not say is
that the Bank may by order prohibit a bank from appointing a certain
person. I wonder whether there is a provision in the Bill that enables
the Bank of England to move against banks and not just individuals who
are operators or who are holding an office or
position?</div><a name="08102871000164"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102871000453"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> Again, I would like to make it clear that we are
talking about exceptional circumstances. Provisions in the Bill allow
action to be taken against the bank as an entity. It is right to ensure
that the inter-bank systems are robust, that there is no risk to those
recognised systems that are of systemic and system-wide significance,
and that they are being operated by responsible people. We have no
reason to doubt that that is the case. It is right to take powers in
legislation to disqualify a person from being an operator of a
recognised inter-bank payment system, or from holding a position of
management responsibility within such a system depending on
circumstances, to make it clear that the disqualification could
be</div>
<a name="08102871000371"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;for a specified
period, until further notice, or permanently,&#148;</div>
<a name="08102871000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">and to make it a
criminal offence to breach such a
prohibition.</div><a name="08102871000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause is necessary to prevent a person from being an operator of a
recognised inter-bank payment system if there is a potential threat to
the stability of the financial system or to business interests in the
UK. I am sure that the Committee will support that overall
intention.</div><a name="08102871000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
power is intended to capture a situation in which the Bank of England
feels strongly that a person who has been involved in the operation of
a payment system that has been ordered to close should not be in a
similar position in an alternative payment system. It also covers cases
in which the Bank of England may be aware that a particular person is
unsuitable to run a payment system because of inappropriate conduct
elsewhere. I stress that there are also checks on the Bank&#146;s
power, including a requirement to give a warning, unless the
Bank&#146;s emergency power under clause 187(3) is used. There is a
right of appeal to the independent financial services and markets
tribunal.</div><a name="08102871000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
power of direction under clause 177 will not be used by the Bank of
England to order an operator to remove or sack a person from its
operation. I am happy to give the assurances that the hon. Member for
South-West Hertfordshire seeks. This is not within the scope of the
power, but I can confirm that clause 186 deals with the
disqualification of specific persons from holding
office.  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column178" />Column number: 178</div>Obviously, the meaning of a &#147;person&#148; relates to the
Interpretation Act 1978, which refers to natural and legal persons, so
it can include banks and other corporate
bodies.</div><a name="08102871000169"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102871000454"></a>Dr.
Pugh:</b> I am not sure whether the Minister is making it
perfectly clear to all of us, but could he tell me whether there is a
presumption in the clause that anybody who holds a senior management
position in an inter-bank payment system is necessarily in danger of
being referred to as an operator, or is in the class of people who may
be operators? Are there some
exclusions?</div><a name="08102871000170"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102871000455"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> What we are trying to do in clause 186 is to be
clear that we are talking about a person who is an operator of a
recognised inter-bank payment system. If this power were ever to be
used&#151;I would expect its use to be extremely rare&#151;it would
be clearly targeted at individuals where the Bank felt very strongly
that that person was not an appropriate person to be running a payment
system, because of the reasons that I have cited
elsewhere.</div>
<a name="08102871000171"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102871000456"></a>Mr.
Breed:</b> We are edging our way there. Can the Minister
envisage a circumstance, therefore, wherein such a person would not
necessarily have already been dismissed or taken out by the
operator&#151;the company&#151;before the Bank of England became
involved?</div>
<a name="08102871000172"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102871000457"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> As I said, I imagine that this power, if it was
going to be exercised, would be exercised extremely rarely, because I
would have thought that in normal circumstances the operator would have
already taken that decision. So I think that it is a power that would
be used only very rarely, because, as I have said, we would expect the
operator to have taken action previously.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102871000458"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> The clause relates to the warning procedure that
will exist before a sanction is made under clauses 183 to
186. We welcome subsections (1) and (2). Subsection (3) provides an
exception from the warning procedure, where it
says:</div><a name="08102871000372"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;if
satisfied that it is necessary the Bank may without
notice&#151;</div><a name="08102871000373"></a><div class="hs_brev">(a)
give a closure order under section 185,
or</div><a name="08102871000374"></a><div class="hs_brev">(b)
make an order under section
186.&#148;</div><a name="08102871000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
wording is very
vague:</div><a name="08102871000375"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;if
satisfied that it is
necessary&#148;.</div><a name="08102871000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps
this is one of those circumstances where I would be tempted to insert a
&#147;reasonably&#148; somewhere along the line and the Minister
would have argued against that.</div>
<a name="08102871000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
explanatory notes provide a little more detail. They
say:</div><a name="08102871000376"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Such
situations may arise if, for instance, delaying the cessation of the
operation of the payment system...were to pose an imminent threat
to the stability of the UK financial
system.&#148;</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column179" />Column number: 179</div><a name="08102871000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clearly that is a fairly
high benchmark but it is not in the Bill, which is probably
regrettable. However, may I encourage the Minister to be as emphatic as
possible that the exception from the warning mechanism contained in
subsection (3) will only be used in the most exceptional circumstances?
I do not know whether the
wording</div><a name="08102871000377"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;imminent
threat to the stability of the UK financial
system&#148;</div><a name="08102871000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">is
merely illustrative or whether that is, in fact, the test that should
apply. However, I think that there is some argument for considering
whether subsection (3) should be amended to toughen it
up.</div>
<a name="08102871000182"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102871000459"></a>Dr.
Pugh:</b> May I ask about subsection (1)(c) and the words
&#147;consider any representations made&#148;? I assume that there
is a narrow reading and a broad reading of those words. Clearly, we are
judging people against a code of conduct and the code of conduct can
obviously be broken to a major or minor degree, and when it is broken
people can simply judge whether there are extenuating circumstances.
However, the words &#147;any representations&#148; seem to go a bit
further than that. Again, I am inspired by the hon. Member for
Wellingborough and his comment that a representation that might be
relevant is that it is an inappropriate thing to do given the state of
commercial markets, and so on. I had a very satisfying answer from the
Minister about appeals, but the other issue is discretion and how it is
used, and I want to know whether the Bank of England, in receiving
representations, has to concentrate simply on the narrow business of
whether the code of conduct has been breached and the operator is bang
to rights on a very narrow reading of it, or whether the Bank can
receive from the payments agency broader representations, such that it
may be inappropriate, given the state of the market, to act at that
particular moment.</div>
<a name="08102871000183"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102871000460"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> Two points of substance have been made about the
clause, which covers warnings in relation to the previous four clauses,
which have all been about sanctions. The hon. Member for Southport made
a specific point about considering representations, and the clause
potentially covers all four sets of circumstances that we have
discussed: publication, penalty, closure and management
disqualification. The likely representations will differ, depending on
the category to which they are applied. Representations could be made,
for instance, by an individual, if they were to do with a management
disqualification, or they could be made by a company. Representations
can be made in confidence to the Bank, and it will be the Bank&#146;s
responsibility to consider all the representations made to
it.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102871000461"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for giving way. My
point was about the circumstances in which no warning was necessary,
and the fact that the explanatory notes illustrate that
situation.</div>
<a name="08102871000186"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102871000462"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman. That was the second
key point of substance to be raised, and I am happy to confirm our
intention that a high benchmark be set. We are talking about situations
in which a compliance failure would threaten the stability of the
financial situation&#151;the threat being so immediate that closure
or disqualification should be imposed without 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column180" />Column number: 180</div>delay. In normal circumstances, subsections (1) and (2) would be the
relevant processes, and we would expect the warning process and the
21-day period to be used.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102871000463"></a>Mr.

the provision would come into practice, and a practical example of the
failure that would cause immediate action?</div>
<a name="08102871000188"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102871000464"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> No particular practical example comes to mind,
but the legal counsel who draft the measures like to consider all
potential eventualities, and as I think I explained earlier, we are
talking in all these cases about unusual or exceptional circumstances.
However, it is right that all theoretical possibilities be considered,
because it would not be appropriate for us to come back to the House to
pass emergency legislation owing to something that, at this stage, had
not been thought of and had therefore not been included. The measure is
a backstop, but it is completely exceptional, and in that spirit, I
hope that the Committee will accept that the clause should stand
part.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102871000465"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> The clause contains an appeals mechanism, which is
welcome. It makes use of the financial services and markets tribunal,
which generally applies for FSA-authorised entities seeking to make an
appeal. The provision shoehorns the payment systems legislation into
this, so will the Minister assure the Committee that he is satisfied
that the tribunal will have the necessary expertise in this specialised
area? It deals generally with FSA-regulated entities rather than Bank
of England-supervised entities, so will he assure the House on
that
point?</div><a name="08102871000193"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102871000466"></a>Ian

given when coming up with an appropriate body to consider appeals, and
we believe that the financial services and markets tribunal will have

<a name="08102871000197"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Mr.
Gauke:</b> Given that the Bank of England may require operators of
inter-bank payment systems to pay fees, is it the intention that
supervision of the payment 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column181" />Column number: 181</div>systems will be essentially self-financing? Will the fees more or less
equate with the costs incurred by the Bank, and will the Minister state
the Bank&#146;s likely costs of supervising and overseeing the
systems, notwithstanding any fees that it may
levy?</div>
<a name="08102871000198"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102871000467"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> The clause, as the hon. Gentleman rightly says,
enables the Bank to require the operators of recognised inter-bank
payment systems to charge fees. The Bank does not currently intend to
charge fees for its routine oversight of payment systems under this
part of the Bill, and instead will meet its costs from its overall
budget for financial stability policy functions, as is the case for its
non-statutory oversight. However, the clause ensures that the Bank
could continue to resource its oversight activity if the overall
funding model
changed.</div><a name="08102871000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
addition, if the Bank incurred exceptional expenses on its oversight
activities&#151;for example, due to the engagement of an expert to
carry out an inspection under clause 179&#151;it would aim to recover
those costs from the system concerned. The scale of fees would be set
by the Treasury in regulations to ensure that they are proportionate.
The provisions are sensible and
straightforward.</div><a name="08102871000200"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102871000468"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 20, in
clause 190, page 94, line 7, at
end insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(4A) Subsection
(4)&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">(a) overrides a
contractual or other requirement to keep information in confidence,
and</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">(b) is without prejudice to
any other power to disclose
information.&#146;.</div><a name="08102871000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause enables the authorities involved in the regulation of payment
systems to obtain and share information effectively. Subsection (4)
allows the Bank to disclose information obtained under the clause to
the Treasury and the FSA, and their international
counterparts&#151;the European Central Bank and the Bank for
International Settlements. It also gives the Bank the right to publish
information obtained under powers conferred by the
clause.</div><a name="08102871000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment inserts an additional provision to ensure that the Bank may
share information obtained under the clause with those authorities,
notwithstanding any contractual or other confidentiality obligations in
place, and without prejudice to other disclosure powers. The Committee
will be aware that the gathering and sharing of information between
domestic authorities and their colleagues in overseas authorities plays
an important role, and will play an increasingly important role in
informing and co-ordinating international regulatory activity, both to
pre-empt and to address problems in financial markets. Similarly, the
sharing of information plays a fundamental role in the framework
governing the formal oversight of payment
systems.</div><a name="08102871000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore,
it is vital that the Bank of England should be able to share
information obtained under this section, notwithstanding any
contractual or other confidentiality 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column182" />Column number: 182</div>requirements, in the interests of financial stability, among other
things. Accordingly, the amendment is appropriate in order to provide a
statutory gateway for the Bank of England to share
information.</div><a name="08102871000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is appropriate to note that similar gateways are available to other
public authorities&#151;for example, the FSA and the Competition
Commission&#151;which may, in some circumstances, disclose
confidential information without seeking the consent of the person from
whom the information was
obtained.</div><a name="08102871000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is important to note that the provision means that the common law of
confidentiality can be overridden. However, the power will, of course,
be exercised by the Bank of England in a way that is compatible with
the safeguards set out in the Data Protection Act 1998 and the Human
Rights Act 1998. The amendment is equivalent to the provision in clause
224(3), which relates to information that is relevant to the financial
stability of an individual financial institution, or one or more
aspects of the individual systems of the UK, which may be shared with
the FSA or the Treasury. I commend the amendment to the
Committee.</div><a name="08102871000208"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102871000469"></a>Mr.
Breed:</b> Will the Minister clarify two brief points? The use
of the word &#147;share&#148; seems to indicate that information
will be provided on a reciprocal basis. Conversely, can the Minister
confirm that should it not be reciprocal&#151;in other words, if the
other country&#146;s FSA, Treasury or similar organisation were not
willing to provide reciprocal information to us&#151;frankly, we
would not provide information to them? Sharing means genuinely sharing
things, not just our side disclosing to someone
else.</div><a name="08102871000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
can the Minister confirm whether disclosure would include the personal
details of individual organisations and persons in respect of payments
that may or may not have been made to them through the system on which
information is being
shared?</div><a name="08102871000210"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102871000470"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> As regards the Government amendment on overriding
confidentiality, I would like to reinforce the point that the hon.
Member for South-East Cornwall made. I do not think that information
that is being shared under subsection (4)(c) with an overseas authority
similar to the Bank of England, the FSA or the Treasury should be
shared unless there is a similar agreement from that organisation. I
would like the Minister to give an assurance that information will be
shared only if we have that co-operation from
overseas.</div><a name="08102871000211"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102871000471"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I am happy to explain that, in normal
circumstances, we expect there to be reciprocal arrangements with the
international partners with which we co-operate. As I mentioned when
introducing the amendment, we are talking about the European Central
Bank and the Bank for International Settlements. We think that it is
right to have such arrangements with them. If we think that it is
appropriate in the interests of financial stability to share
information, even if the arrangements are not reciprocal, we should do
so, because we all share an interest in financial stability. However, I
have absolutely no reason to believe that the European Central Bank or
the Bank for International Settlements would not want to share with us
information that they believed was important to global financial
stability.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column183" />Column number: 183</div><a name="08102871000212"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102871000472"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> We accept the point about the European Central Bank
and the Bank for International Settlements, but paragraph (c) refers to
other Governments and organisations in other countries. It is a blanket
thing. Are the Government saying that we will share this information
regardless, or will we require the other country to participate as well
and share information with
us?</div><a name="08102871000213"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102871000473"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> It is important to be clear that we are talking
about a narrow and exceptional set of circumstances. If the Bank of
England has information that it believes is of importance to the
stability of the financial system, the right and responsible thing to
do is to share that information. Likewise, if an authority from another
country was in a similar position, we would expect it to want to share
that information as a matter of
course.</div><a name="08102871000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the question of sharing personal details, I want to repeat that the
Bank of England is subject to the Data Protection Act and must abide by
data sharing principles which confer particular protections with regard
to personal information. It must also act in accordance with its
obligations under the Human Rights Act, particularly article 8, and
have regard to the right of protection of private and family life.
There are a lot of safeguards there and in the very unlikely
eventuality that information which threatens the financial stability of
the system comes to the attention of the Bank, the responsible thing to
do is to share that with our international
partners.</div><a name="08102871000215"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102871000474"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> The clause states that it is an offence to pretend
to be recognised under these provisions. If I remember correctly, the
Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 has similar provisions. I do
not know whether the Minister is in a position to tell us how
frequently prosecutions have been brought under those provisions. I
know that there have been some and in those circumstances they tend to
be very much at the retail end. Given that participants in inter-bank
payment systems will be banks and sophisticated institutions, does the
Minister think it necessary to do this and to have this
provision?</div><a name="08102871000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
will a central list of recognised inter-bank payment systems be
available on the Bank of England website, in the way that there is a
list of authorised entities on the FSA website? There is a legitimate
point about wanting to make it clear which entities are recognised and
where participants could get some sort of regulatory protection. Does
the Minister intend to have such a list? In those circumstances it
would not really be necessary to have this provision. I do not see that
it does any great harm, but I am not sure that it adds to the efficacy
of the provisions we are debating
today.</div><a name="08102871000220"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102871000475"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> This is yet another backstop. I perfectly accept
the logic of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s argument. It is not the policy
intention that any value should be attached 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column184" />Column number: 184</div>to a payment system being recognised as such. However, simply to deter
operators of payment systems from trying to exploit the new framework
in such a way it is necessary to impose a criminal offence on anyone
who wilfully misrepresents a payment system as being recognised when it
is not. It is highly unlikely that someone would want to do that, but I
am advised that it is helpful to have a deterrent there. That is what
the clause
does.</div><a name="08102871000221"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102871000476"></a>The
Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury (Angela Eagle):</b> I wish
to spend a little time setting out the broad structure and intent of
part 6 of the Bill, and then I will not make a habit of leaping up to
speak on clause stand part debates unless I have to.</div>
<a name="08102871000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 193
provides an overview of part 6, which repeals and replaces certain
provisions regarding the commercial issuance of banknotes in Scotland
and Northern Ireland. Before we discuss the details of clauses in part
6, it might help the Committee if I set out the background. The
issuance of national banknotes is usually a function undertaken by the
central bank, which in the UK is the Bank of England. With the
exception of Hong Kong, the UK is highly unusual in allowing a number
of commercial banks to issue their own banknotes. The right to issue is
set out in the Bank Notes (Scotland) Act 1845, the Bankers (Ireland)
Act 1845 and the Bankers (Northern Ireland) Act
1928&#151;for ease I shall refer to them in future discussions on
part 6 as &#147;the current legislation&#148;. Although 1845 might
not seem all that current, we are in the process of updating it in part
6 of the
Bill.</div><a name="08102871000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
provisions in part 6 update, modernise and strengthen the current
regime for note issue, which dates back, as I just said, more than 160
years. Clearly, the world today is a very different place from when the
legislation was first enacted, so I should like to take the opportunity
to discuss some of the history of banknote issuance in the UK, to
ensure that our future debates are informed of the
context.</div><a name="08102871000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Bank Charter Act 1844 prohibited any new banks in England and Wales
from issuing banknotes and barred existing note-issuing banks from
expanding their issue. The 1845 legislation in Scotland and Ireland
made similar provisions in respect of banks in those nations. At the
time, 21 banks applied to become certified to continue issuing
banknotes in Scotland and Northern Ireland. That number has decreased
over time through mergers, insolvency or by banks choosing to stop
issuing, so a total of seven issuing banks remain. Those seven banks
are currently authorised to issue banknotes and will continue to be
authorised to do so with the commencement of part 6, provided that they
abide by the requirements placed on them under the provisions of this
part.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column185" />Column number: 185</div><a name="08102871000228"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102871000477"></a>Stewart
Hosie:</b> It was my understanding that banks would continue
to be able to issue, but that there would be a higher bar should a new
bank emerge and say, &#147;I want to issue a banknote&#148;, which
is highly unlikely. However, a question emerges from that: if the
Lloyds TSB-HBOS merger goes ahead, would the Bank of Scotland part of
the new organisation continue to be an authorised bank under the new
legislation, and therefore entitled to continue to issue
notes?</div><a name="08102871000229"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102871000478"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> The answer is that the issuing rights are vested in
the underlying corporate entity. What happens to the issuing rights
depends on the individual circumstances of a takeover. I can assure the
hon. Gentleman that in the specific case of Lloyds TSB and HBOS, the
Bank of Scotland, which is a subsidiary of the latter, is the issuing
bank, and the issuing rights attach to that corporate entity alone. The
change in ownership&#151;in this instance, of Bank of
Scotland&#151;would not mean that a bank would be forced to stop
issuing banknotes, so it continues under the current proposals to be
eligible to issue banknotes. I hope that that reassures
him.</div><a name="08102871000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
was discussing the history of the matter&#151;it might seem odd to do
so, but it creates a context for subsequent debate. To reassure the
hon. Gentleman even more, the Government are committed to maintaining
the long-standing tradition of commercial banknote issuance in Scotland
and Northern Ireland and we are not seeking to discourage commercial
issuers of banknotes from continuing the practice. However, our
priority is to ensure that holders of Scottish and Northern Ireland
banknotes have a level of protection similar to the holders of Bank of
England notes, so that in the event that an issuing bank fails, they
can expect to obtain full face value for their notes. This is an
important part of the Government&#146;s commitment to protect
consumers. There is more detail in part 6 on how that is to be
achieved.</div><a name="08102871000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">With
that small history lesson and my reassurance to the hon. Gentleman, I
commend the clause to the
Committee.</div><a name="08102871000232"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102871000479"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I thank the Minister for her informative
introduction to part 6. There are various issues that we want to
address, not least the issues of backing assets and the balance between
Bank of England notes and other assets. I will address those when we
come to the appropriate
clauses.</div><a name="08102871000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
should be grateful at this stage if the Minister would list the
commercial banks that are currently entitled to issue notes. She stated
that the Government are keen to continue to allow commercial banks to
issue notes. We do not disagree with that. It is an historical
curiosity, but there is nothing wrong with historical curiosities. The
Minister will not be surprised to hear a Conservative say that. Will
she elaborate on why the Government are keen to continue to allow that
to
happen?</div><a name="08102871000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
I thank the Minister for publishing the draft regulations that relate
to this matter. They will help our debate as we proceed through the
coming
clauses.</div><a name="08102871000235"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102871000480"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> I was not expecting to speak on this matter.
However, as I understand it, the Minister said that if I had a Scottish
note issued by the Bank of Scotland and the Bank of Scotland failed, I
would not get my money back. I did not think that that was the
position.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column186" />Column number: 186</div><a name="08102871000236"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102871000482"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> The Minister says that I got that totally wrong. It
would not be the first
time.</div><a name="08102871000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">Was
this legislation brought about because of the current crisis, or was it
planned before that? If something has worked for close on 200 years, it
probably works pretty well and there is no reason to change it for the
sake of changing it. Is there any difference between legislation in
Northern Ireland and Scotland? How many banks in Northern Ireland issue
notes?</div><a name="08102871000239"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102871000483"></a>Stewart
Hosie:</b> I thank the Minister for her helpful reassurance on
the Bank of Scotland notes. The bulk of my concerns come under the
banking assets debate in clause 203. I put it on the record at this
point that after numerous consultations over the past 15 months or so,
we finally have something that almost works and that the industry by
and large is satisfied
with.</div><a name="08102871000240"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102871000484"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> The hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire asked
me to list the seven remaining banks that have rights of issuance. In
Scotland, they are the Bank of Scotland, which as has been mentioned is
a subsidiary of HBOS; the Clydesdale; and the Royal Bank of Scotland.
In Northern Ireland, they are the Bank of Ireland, First Trust Bank,
the Northern bank and the Ulster
bank.</div><a name="08102871000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Wellingborough asked whether the legislation was
brought about because of the financial crisis that we are living
through. It was not. As the hon. Member for Dundee, East hinted, this
is the end of a process that began in 2005 with consultations that have
been ongoing since then between the Bank of England, the Treasury, the
authorities and the banks that issue to try to bring more reassurance
in the backing assets
issue.</div><a name="08102871000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Wellingborough asked whether current banknotes were in
danger, or were not worth as much as they are meant to represent.
Clearly that is not the case, but some aspects of how the notes are
backed are old-fashioned&#151;they date to 1845&#151;and do not fit
in with current approaches, so they need tightening up. That is what
part 6 will do. There is nothing wrong with the current legislation
that cannot be put right by modernising and refocusing bits of it, and
part 6 seeks to do so. I hope that, with those reassurances, the
Committee will be able to agree that clause 193 should stand part of
the

relates to the definition of &#147;issue&#148;. The explanatory
notes state:</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column187" />Column number: 187</div><a name="08102871000378"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The

circulation, even if it enters circulation in error or as a result of
theft.&#148;</div><a name="08102871000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
assume that the reason is that a note issued in that way still needs to
be treated as issued to protect the position of noteholders. There
could be a mismatch for the protection of noteholders. Was equivalent
protection provided under the old

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102871000487"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I thank the Minister for listing the various banks
that supply us. It is one of those circumstances in which Wikipedia
proved correct before the Committee. I thank her for providing
clarification on what happens in mergers, which is topical and
important. I have another question to ask, partly to provoke the hon.
Member for Dundee, East. Were a bank falling within the definition of
an authorised bank to relocate from Scotland or Northern Ireland to
elsewhere in the United Kingdom, would it still be able to benefit from
the provisions, or would it be disqualified from issuing
banknotes?</div><a name="08102871000390"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.15

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102871000488"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> The hon. Gentleman is right. Clause 196 defines
&#147;authorised bank&#148; as it is used throughout part 6. Since
the current legislation was enacted, as I hinted earlier, there have
been restrictions in place governing note issuance by these banks. As I
said earlier, the Bill modernises and strengthens the framework for
note issuance, with a view to enhancing noteholder
protection.</div><a name="08102871000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman asked specifically whether a bank relocating elsewhere
in the United Kingdom would still be able to issue notes. If it moved
elsewhere and relocated in the UK, it would still be able to benefit.
It would not lose its authorisation on the grounds of relocation
elsewhere in the UK. I hope that that answers the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s question about the definition of &#147;authorised
bank&#148;.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102871000489"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> Essentially, the position created by these
provisions is that those banks that can currently issue banknotes may
continue to do so, but new ones cannot. Why
not?</div><a name="08102871000262"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102871000490"></a>Sir
Peter Viggers:</b> What is the Government&#146;s assessment
of the value to each of the issuing banks of their having the authority
to issue banknotes? Assessments have been made and have been disputed
by the Government, but what is their assessment of the global value of
all those banks that have the right to issue banknotes, broken down
into the separate constituent parts of the individual
bank?</div><a name="08102871000263"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102871000491"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> The hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire asked,
&#147;Why no new issuers?&#148; As I said in my prefacing remarks
about part 6, banknote issuance is usually a function reserved for
central banks. The UK is almost, but not quite, unique&#151;if we
count Hong Kong&#151;in allowing a number of commercial banks to
issue their own banknotes. Under the existing legislation, only the
banks that had issuing rights at the time of the enactment of the
legislation in 1845 that sought the necessary certifications to
continue issuing in accordance with those enactments may issue
banknotes&#151;and only in Scotland and Northern Ireland. As I said
earlier, only seven of the original 21 entities remain after 160 years
of commercial operation. That is the attrition
rate.</div><a name="08102871000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government support the continuation of this tradition of commercial
issuance, simply because it is
a&#151;</div><a name="08102871000265"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102871000492"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b>
Tradition.</div><a name="08102871000266"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102871000493"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> A tradition that does no particular harm and is
particularly welcome in Scotland. A different debate goes on in
Northern Ireland about the practice. The Government do not wish to see
that tradition draw to a close by enacting legislation that would ban
it; it is appreciated particularly in Scotland. We are not seeking to
discourage note-issuing commercial banks from continuing to issue their
own banknotes, but it is a privilege and is not a right that should be
open to all. It is not a commodity that should be bought and sold. It
is an historical quirk that we can support, but for obvious reasons, we
would not seek to revive or expand it. The hon. Member for Dundee, East
is getting to his feet.</div>
<a name="08102871000267"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102871000494"></a>Stewart
Hosie:</b> It is certainly historical, but I think that it is
more than a quirk. Perhaps I can help the hon. Member for Gosport with
his question. Although the value may be modest in cash terms, the
promotional value is enormous, not only for Scotland, but particularly
for the banking sector in Scotland. It is probably an incalculable
amount of money. This is rather more than an historical
quirk.</div>
<a name="08102871000268"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102871000495"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> Well, it is an historical quirk in that it has
survived through the ages and not been centralised as has happened in
every other country except Hong Kong. There are costs for banks that
issue their own 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column189" />Column number: 189</div>notes&#151;not least the costs of printing, safeguarding, designing
and ensuring that backing assets are kept to back up the cost of note
issuance. I assure the Committee that the Government do not seek to
extend the right to issue to any new institutions. The original issuing
legislation was careful to close down that eventuality&#151;it
applied only to the commercial banks that existed at the time and since
then, their number has gradually declined.</div>
<a name="08102871000269"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102871000496"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> In her earlier remarks, the Minister said that the
decline was partly due to mergers and that is why those involved
dropped out. There is a massive merger at the moment regarding one of
those banks. We must follow the consequences of what the Minister was
saying, namely that we do not want to expand the right to issue notes
to different banks. However, lawyers will get involved with the bank
that does issue them. If we follow the logic of the argument, would
that not be a reason for stopping it at that
stage?</div>
<a name="08102871000270"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102871000497"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> It depends on how the merger is done. As I said
earlier, issuing rights are vested in the underlying corporate entity.
If that corporate entity were to disappear in a merger with another
institution, its issuing rights would go. In the case of Lloyds
TSB-HBOS, the Bank of Scotland&#151;a subsidiary of HBOS&#151;is
the issuing bank. A change of ownership at Bank of Scotland, as long as
it remains an entity, will not affect its issuing rights. If Lloyds TSB
was going to take over and extinguish the Bank of Scotland, I am sure
that the hon. Member for Dundee, East would have a few words to say. If
the Bank of Scotland ceased to exist, that would extinguish its issuing
rights. However, the fact that it remains a subsidiary means that that
is not an issue in this case.</div>
<a name="08102871000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Gosport asked what the value of the authorisation to issue
was. This is a commercial matter. During three rounds of consultation
about the changes that are now in part 6, no bank responded that the
right to issue caused distortion or unfair competitive advantage. That
issue was not raised. I do not have the figures that the hon. Gentleman
requested to hand&#151;as I said, this is a commercial matter.
However, I think that &#163;3.5 billion of Scottish banknotes and
&#163;1.6 billion of Northern Irish banknotes are in circulation. To
the value of &#163;40 billion of Bank of England notes are in
circulation. That will at least give the hon. Gentleman a view about
the larger part of the circulating currency that we are talking
about.</div>
<a name="08102871000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
with those answers, the Committee will support clause 199.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102871000498"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> May I make a point that could be made in relation
to either clause 201 or clause 202? Clause 201 states that the banknote
regulations must be made 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column190" />Column number: 190</div>through the affirmative procedure, which we welcome, but clause 202
states that the Bank of England may make banknote rules. In those
circumstances, there will be no direct parliamentary scrutiny, and I
query whether the affirmative resolution procedure will prove to be as
useful as it at first appears. The Minister has provided us with an
early draft of the banknote regulations, but am I right to think that
Parliament might not have an opportunity to scrutinise those
rules?</div>
<a name="08102871000278"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102871000499"></a>Stewart
Hosie:</b> I am confident that the regulations and the rules
will cover matters such as standard size, security features and the
weight of notes. I know that the banks have been lobbying hard
regarding concerns that they had in the early stages of consultation.
Will the Minister confirm&#151;we will cheer if she does&#151;that
the Government do not intend to have a single note of each
denomination? Will they continue to allow limited edition notes, which
are valuable for many reasons, to be issued, as long as they meet all
the rules and regulations that will cover all
notes?</div><a name="08102871000279"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102871000500"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> The framework governing the issue of Scottish and
Northern Irish banknotes is set out in the primary legislation. The
detail of the provisions in part 6 are, as the hon. Member for
South-West Hertfordshire said, to be captured in regulations that will
be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure. A draft set of the
regulations has been provided to the Committee to assist our debates.
Further, there is provision for making banknote regulations that
contain details about the treatment, holding and issuing of banknotes
by authorised banks. As hon. Members will see when we debate clause
203, the regulations will require authorised banks to have backing
assets. They will also contain detailed provisions on important issues
such as how backing assets may be held, how they may be treated in an
insolvency, and how reports about them should be made by authorised
banks.</div>
<a name="08102871000280"></a><div class="hs_Para">I welcome
hon. Members&#146; comments on the draft regulations, but I ask them
to bear in mind that they are in draft form. I sent them to the
Committee merely to illuminate debate on the relevant clauses. They are
not totally baked and out of the oven, but are to some extent a work in
progress; some of them need further work before they can be consulted
on.</div>
<a name="08102871000281"></a><div class="hs_Para">The draft
regulations contain detailed provisions relating to, among other
things, the conditions attached to approved or designated locations or
agents, the proportion of backing assets to be held in a particular
form or location and the scope of the banknote rules. Those rules are
intended&#151;this brings us to a question that the hon. Member for
South-West Hertfordshire asked&#151;to be even more detailed in
relation to how the regulations work. In essence, the banknote rules
are even more detailed and rely and hang on the statutory
instruments&#151;the secondary legislation&#151;that we will pass,
which is why I do not agree with the hon. Gentleman&#146;s worry that
somehow the banknote rules will avoid parliamentary scrutiny. The
regulations will be passed by this House in affirmative form and voted
on. The banknote rules will then iterate even more detail about how the
Bank of England will fulfil its obligations in that
respect.</div><a name="08102871000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
regime needs flexibility to adapt to changes and developments in
banknote issuance that might occur in future. The authorities might
also have to act quickly by 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column191" />Column number: 191</div>making regulations or rules to ensure that the integrity of the currency
is maintained at all times. The idea of the balance between secondary
legislation and the banknote rules will again focus first and foremost
on protecting noteholders in order to ensure that confidence is not
lost in any of the currency. Banknote rules mainly make provision as
specified in the banknote regulations; they cannot do things that are
not connected to the regulations that will be debated and voted on in
this House.</div>
<a name="08102871000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
answer to the perfectly reasonable question about limited edition notes
asked by the hon. Member for Dundee, East, I can confirm that it will
still be possible to issue limited edition notes. With those
reassurances, I hope that hon. Members will agree that clause 201 stand
part of the
Bill.</div><a name="08102871000284"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

Eagle:</b> The amendments are a technical clarification of
references to insolvency in clauses 203 and 206 of part 6. The need for
the amendments was not appreciated until a comparatively late stage,
and I regret the inconvenience to the Committee in having to table
Government amendments. As I have said, the provisions of part 6 are
primarily concerned with ensuring that noteholders of commercial
issuing banks are protected in the event that the issuing bank gets
into difficulties. Clause 203(5) specifies:</div>
<a name="08102871000379"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Banknote
regulations may make provision about the treatment of backing assets in

authorised bank of ...the special resolution regime (under Parts 1

insolvency process is defined in clause 203. It is the policy intention
for the Bill to enable banknote regulations to make a provision in
relation to the law of insolvency and the law of an insolvency
process&#151;for example, in relation to the treatment of backing
assets. As hon. Members will be aware, that is necessary because not
all insolvency processes start on insolvency.</div>

affairs where a bank can no longer afford to pay its debts is defined
in section 123 of the Insolvency Act 1986. As currently drafted, the
provisions only allow banknote regulations to make provisions in

ensure that banknote regulations can make provision for insolvency or
an insolvency process. Amendments Nos. 23 and 24 mean that insolvency
can be taken to include a reference to insolvency process, which may
include liquidation, administration, receivership and so on. The
provisions are of integral importance to part 6

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102871000504"></a>Stewart
Hosie:</b> The way in which the Bill treats Scottish and,
indeed, Northern Irish banknotes constitutes a pragmatic approach. This
may be the only time during this Parliament that I say these words, but
I think that the Government have listened to the sector. I am pretty
confident that by ensuring that banknotes can be backed by both
interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing assets, we now have a
platform that will secure the long-term future of the issuing of
Scottish banknotes, while having the flexibility to ensure the
integrity of the issue of all banknotes in the UK. In particular, the
comments that the Minister made a short time ago about possibly having
to act quickly in certain circumstances were absolutely
right.</div><a name="08102871000299"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
a previous contribution, the Minister identified the fact that
significant costs are associated with the printing, distribution and
holding in security of Scottish notes. Those will need to be offset by
the ability to earn interest on a reasonable proportion of the assets
that are backing the notes in circulation. However, as drafted, the
Bill remains silent on the precise mix of assets that the issuing banks
will be allowed to hold. Striking the right balance between
interest-bearing assets and non-interest-bearing assets will be
critical to ensuring the future of banknote issuance in Scotland, and
its profitability or its being economic at all. If future regulations
are too restrictive on the level of interest-bearing assets that can be
held against the notes, it could fatally undermine the ability of the
issuing banks to continue to produce and issue the notes. Will the
Minister therefore provide the Committee with an assurance that any
future regulations on that matter will be drafted so as to ensure that
the activity of issuing Scottish notes remains
economic?</div><a name="08102871000300"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
know that there is general discussion of a 60/40 asset split. That will
be finalised at some point and I hope the Minister can confirm that
today. Will she also provide assurances that any such split will remain
broadly as it is&#151;at 60/40&#151;and that there is no intention,
certainly by her or by the Government, to use the regulations to change
the balance between interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing assets
backing the
notes?</div><a name="08102871000301"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102871000505"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> Backing assets may be the key subject that we shall
consider during the Bill&#146;s proceedings. The current arrangement,
as I understand it, is that a small level&#151;described as the
fiduciary level&#151;of notes issued by Scottish and Northern Irish
banks is not covered by backing assets. When I say &#147;a small
level&#148;, it appears to be very small; 0.125 per cent. of notes
issued, according 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column193" />Column number: 193</div>to the 2005 figures. That fiduciary level allows the banks to make a
return on issuing notes in a process called seigniorage&#151;I hope I
pronounced it
correctly.</div><a name="08102871000302"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
2005, the Government proposed removing the fiduciary level and
requiring 100 per cent. backing. They said at the time that it was to
ensure that there was protection for all noteholders and to provide a
level playing field. That produced quite a response and, as the hon.
Member for Dundee, East said, the Government have listened. In the July
2008 consultation document, the Treasury stated that some respondents
felt that insufficient account had been taken of the costs associated
with issuing banknotes and the social benefit supported by the income
derived. [<i class="I">Interruption.</i>] Yes, I should be grateful if the
Minister could explain the meaning of social benefit supported by the
income derived. Are we talking about particular charities that are
supported by seigniorage? The proposal in the consultation document is
implemented in the draft indicative regulations that the hon. Lady has
circulated and which suggest the 60/40 split, whereby 60 per cent. of
the value of banknotes is backed by Bank of England banknotes and the
remainder is in a segregated interest-bearing
account.</div><a name="08102871000303"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand how the proposal deals with the provision of support to
noteholders and ensures protection for them. Subject to the speed at
which some noteholders can obtain payment from the segregated
account&#151;an issue to which we shall return in a moment&#151;and
a level playing field, does that give those note-issuing banks an
advantage? Will there be a source of income that is not available to
their competitors? I assume that the Government&#146;s intention is
to provide sufficient incentive to make it worth while for the banks
continuing to issue the notes, and that they do not want to stop that.
Equally, however, they do not want to provide an additional source of
income that would not otherwise be available. Is that the intention
driving the
Government?</div><a name="08102871000304"></a><div class="hs_Para">Furthermore,
although the Minister may correct me, I should have thought that the
balance between interest-bearing assets and non-interest bearing assets
would depend on what interest rates were at a particular time, and that
there might be certain periods when 60/40 was adequate, but at other
times the income for the banks would be insufficient or excessive, so
we run into issues relating to a level playing field. Will the hon.
Lady say whether such a concern is legitimate or, if it is not, can she
explain
why?</div><a name="08102871000305"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102871000506"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> The provisions are intended to ensure that holders
of Scottish and Northern Irish banknotes issued by authorised banks
will be afforded a level of protection similar to that for holders of
Bank of England banknotes. That is the first and foremost aim of part 6
of the Bill. The clause
states:</div><a name="08102871000381"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Banknote
regulations must require authorised banks to have backing
assets&#148;</div><a name="08102871000306"></a><div class="hs_Para">to
make a reality of that protection. Backing assets are assets of the
sort specified in banknote regulations. Regulation 3 of the draft
indicative banknote regulations that I have circulated to the Committee
sets out three types of backing asset: Bank of England banknotes,
current coin of the UK and funds placed on deposit in sterling from the
account held by the Bank of
England.</div><a name="08102871000307"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
regulations then set out precisely what form the backing assets should
take in relation to banknotes in circulation and notes that have not
been issued, but are 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column194" />Column number: 194</div>held otherwise than in designated locations, for example, in bank tills,
in ATMs or in transit. It is not surprising that they were not
mentioned in the 1845 legislation, but we thought it was time that we
acknowledged their existence. Those notes are considered to have the
potential to enter circulation, including in error or by theft, so it
is necessary for them to be fully backed to protect holders of Scottish
and Northern Ireland
banknotes.</div><a name="08102871000308"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of
key importance is subsection (5), which provides that banknote
regulations make provision for the treatment of backing assets in
relation to insolvency processes. That is the ring fence we were
talking about earlier. It means that should one of the issuing banks
have such difficulties, there will be no ambiguity whatever about the
fact that the backing assets are there to back the notes. That again
features in part 6 of the
Bill.</div><a name="08102871000309"></a><div class="hs_Para">Part
3 of the draft indicative regulations, in particular regulations 11 and
12, makes it clear that, in the event of a banknote issuer becoming
insolvent, noteholders can obtain full value for their notes from the
backing assets. The ring fence will last for a protective period
defined in regulation 13(2) as one year from the date on which the
insolvency procedure commences. It can be extended by the Treasury in
consultation with the Bank of
England.</div><a name="08102871000392"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102871000507"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> Perhaps the Minister can allay my fears. Is it
possible that there will be one class of noteholders who will be able
to get to the relevant bank and exchange for a Bank of England note
quickly, which will cover the first 60 per cent., whereas the rest will
be left waiting for up to a year for the segregated account to sort
itself
out?</div><a name="08102871000311"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102871000508"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> I do not think that that will be the case. The
banking assets are held at the Bank of England. In the event of an
insolvency, the ring fence will keep those assets there so that they
cannot be used in the other insolvency procedures. That is in order
that any holder of an issued note from the appropriate bank can go to
the Bank of England and exchange it for a Bank of England note of the
same value. The year-long ring fence allows time for those notes to be
properly
exchanged.</div><a name="08102871000312"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under
the regulations, any backing assets that remain when the year is up can
go back into the insolvency process. The ring fence is important
because it guarantees the rights of those who would be left holding the
issued notes. The aim of the regulations is to ensure that those who
possess Scottish or Northern Irish banknotes have levels of protection
that are as good as those for holders of Bank of England
notes.</div><a name="08102871000313"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
regulations address deficiencies in the existing legislation, which
does not explicitly set out the purpose of note-covering assets. There
is currently no certainty that assets will be used in full or in part
for the benefit of noteholders, should the issuing bank become
insolvent. That worry must clearly be addressed and that is done in
part
6.</div><a name="08102871000314"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
203 and the draft regulations make specific provisions regarding the
backing assets that each authorised bank must hold to give holders of
Scottish and Northern Irish banknotes a similar level of protection to
holders of Bank of England banknotes and to ensure that in the event of
an issuing bank getting into difficulties, holders of its notes can
expect to receive the value of their notes.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column195" />Column number: 195</div><a name="08102871000315"></a><div class="hs_Para">Hon. Members
asked about the working of the regulations. The hon. Member for Dundee,
East is right to point out that there was discussion in the
consultation documents about the form in which the backing assets
should be held at the Bank of England. He talks about a 60/40 split,
which appears in regulation 5. The idea behind that is that there
should be a revenue-neutral outcome in the seigneurage earned by the
issuing banks and the Exchequer. The proposal was designed to maintain
the status quo in the economics of commercial note issuance, while
ensuring noteholder protection. That is the balance that the hon.
Member for South-West Hertfordshire spoke
about.</div><a name="08102871000316"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government have consistently stated that they are not seeking to
discourage note-issuing commercial banks from continuing to issue their
own banknotes. There are costs and benefits in issuing banknotes. The
solutions, as set out in regulations on how the backing assets are
held, are meant not to disturb those. Clearly, the hon. Member for
Dundee, East is right that there is a certain kudos to having banknotes
issued, and there may be advantages from that point of view, but there
are also costs in terms of printing, protecting and having assets held
to back them, and all the other associated issues.</div>
<a name="08102871000317"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for South-West Hertfordshire was talking about whether the
interest rate was the issue, with respect to the 60/40 split, but it is
more about the costs of printing notes and having security for them.
All of those things have to be taken into account, but 60/40
seems to be widely accepted among the issuing banks as a fair,
cost-neutral approach. As the figures are to be set out in secondary
legislation they could be revisited if there were to be a sudden shift
in costs that we cannot anticipate today.</div>
<a name="08102871000318"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08102871000509"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mark Todd</b> (South Derbyshire) (Lab): It just occurs to me
that, as the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire said, there
presumably must lie some competitive advantage in being granted the
right to issue notes, which we are sanctioning a continuance of;
otherwise, unless these brave corporations are all
charities, they would have discontinued that activity. I
wonder whether anyone has assessed that advantage and quantified
it.</div>
<a name="08102871000319"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102871000510"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> Interestingly, in responses to the
consultation&#151;here I will answer the question that the hon.
Member for South-West Hertfordshire asked about the elaboration of
social benefits&#151;the issuing banks made the point that because
these commercial banks produce banknotes, the Bank of England can
produce fewer, thereby saving money. That is the
social&#151;</div><a name="08102871000320"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102871000511"></a>Stewart
Hosie:</b> Will the Minister give
way?</div><a name="08102871000321"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102871000512"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> Let me finish dealing with this point. They also
then have to retain the security arrangements to ensure that their
notes are safe. There is an opportunity cost to the Bank of England,
and it has to do less of that work because the commercial banks are
doing a bit of it.</div>
<a name="08102871000322"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have not
seen any work suggesting what the commercial advantages to producing
banknotes are; I merely make the
observation&#151;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column196" />Column number: 196</div><a name="08102871000323"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102871000513"></a>Mr.
Todd:</b> They must
exist.</div><a name="08102871000324"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102871000514"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> I am assuming that those issuing banks that have
continued to issue notes since 1845 think that it is a good thing to
do. We do not have a problem with it, as long as we can ensure that the
notes are properly backed, so that they are not a weak link in terms of
confidence in our currency in this country. Also, if one has to have
backing assets, that means that that money cannot be used to invest in
other areas or to get interest. Having to hold large sums in backing
assets that are Bank of England notes does not exactly earn a great
deal of interest, so there is an opportunity cost in other investments
that could be made. The hon. Member for Dundee, East no doubt has some
other examples.</div>
<a name="08102871000325"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102871000515"></a>Stewart
Hosie:</b> In terms of the social benefits, I am sure that the
Minister knows and everybody in the Committee knows&#151;they have
simply forgotten&#151;that it is not just the banks that use Scottish
notes, but all the financial institutions as well. The modest
commercial advantage that they may have had helped to increase the
number of free-to-use automatic teller machines, which were filled with
notes from the Scottish banks. That kind of social benefit is included,
and that came from the modest advantage that the Scottish banks got.
</div><a name="08102871000326"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102871000516"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> I was just going to come on to that argument, which
featured in the consultation.</div>
<a name="08102871000327"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102871000517"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for giving way, and
to the hon. Member for Dundee, East for stressing the modest benefits.
If memory serves me, a few minutes ago he was talking about the
incalculable benefits, but there we go.</div>
<a name="08102871000328"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102871000518"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> I hope that with that long discussion of the costs
and benefits of the measure, and given the information before the
Committee, particularly regarding backing assets, how they will be
held, and how the ring fence in the event of insolvency will work, hon.
Members will support the clause.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102871000521"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> Clause 213 seems a strange place to state that the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08102871000522"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> The Bank of England is the UK&#146;s central
bank, so it is appropriate that it can issue banknotes throughout the
UK, which is what clause 213 sets out. The right to issue
notes in Scotland and Northern Ireland is a privilege and a
long-standing tradition for those nations, but it does not preclude the
Bank of England issuing notes. The legislation that authorises certain
banks to issue banknotes is completely separate from that which gives
the Bank of England the right to issue notes in the UK. Clearly, that
is the legislative basis upon which the Bank of England operates. I do
not have the exact title of the relevant Act in front of me, but I am
happy to whisper it to the hon. Gentleman at a later stage in our
