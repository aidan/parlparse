the hon. Lady that the amendment will transfer the power of PCTs to
make grants of section 64 money to voluntary organisations to
consortia. Under the new architecture, consortia will have that
power.<a class="bkMark" name="11030921000023">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I thank the Minister for that clarification. When
I ran a voluntary organisation, I had some experience of dealing with
grants under section 64. GPs may not be used to giving grants to
charities. I hope that the Minister will intervene to explain where GPs
will get information about how to run a section 64 grant—not
only about the power to give grants, but about what is done with them
and how they are supposed to be run.<a class="bkMark" name="11030921000024">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I suppose that I have had experience similar to
what GPs will have, as I used to dole out section 64 grants when I was
at the Department of Health in an earlier life. Some GPs will obviously
be more familiar with the procedures, but I am confident that they will
get to know them quickly and will soon be able to carry them out as
well as PCTs do now. To totally encapsulate the point, so that the hon.
Lady is fully reassured, the board will be giving guidance to consortia
on how to do that.<a class="bkMark" name="11030921000025">&#160;</a>

amendment is a proposal to remove subsection (3) of new
section 14V of the National Health Service Act 2006, which
will be inserted by clause 22. The new section concerns the
commissioning guidance that is to be produced by the board and that
consortia must have regard to when discharging their functions. The
purpose of subsection (3) is to allow the board to obtain assistance
from third parties, including NICE, in producing commissioning
guidance.<a class="bkMark" name="11030921000033">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Other
provisions elsewhere in the Bill mean that the subsection is redundant.
Clause 225 provides the necessary powers for the board to direct NICE
to exercise any of its functions in relation to the preparation of
commissioning guidance. The board’s general powers under section
2 of the 2006 Act, as amended by the Bill, will be sufficient to allow
it to obtain assistance from others in the preparation of commissioning
guidance. Subsection (3) is therefore unnecessary.<a class="bkMark" name="11030921000034">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In
other words, these two amendments seek to ensure that conflicts of
interest between those GPs responsible for commissioning services and
the responsibilities of the providers of services are very clearly set
out, and that GPs who are commissioning those services should not be
able to benefit financially from those commissioning
arrangements.<a class="bkMark" name="11030921000042">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">During
earlier discussions, we have already discussed the need to ensure that
conflicts of interest do not arise. Government Committee members
believe that there are two ways of doing that: first, through very
clear guidance from the NHS board, if it is established after the
deliberations of the Committee and the House; and
secondly—crucially—through their financial
arrangements.<a class="bkMark" name="11030921000043">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The Minister
has said that he believes that all those conflicts of interest can be
sorted out in the GP consortia constitutions, but I do not believe that
that is possible, because the constitutions would end up being far too
long. In fact, GPs who set up commissioning consortia would themselves
need, and I am sure appreciate, guidance from the board on how to
separate those conflicts of interest and ensure that they do not
occur.<a class="bkMark" name="11030921000044">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Being sure
that GPs do not financially benefit from commissioning responsibilities
is critical for the House as a whole. I know we are not on clause 23
yet, but we are discussing the amendments together. It is vital that
conflicts of interest are managed to prevent members from benefiting
financially from the commissioning arrangements.<a class="bkMark" name="11030921000045">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendments are pretty straightforward and clear. Accepting them would
provide an extra lock on the situation, alongside arrangements set out
in a constitution. Unless there are further
measures—“rules and regulations” is the wrong
term—in the Bill to ensure that conflicts of interest are
managed, I am afraid that there will be very real concern about the
effective use of taxpayers’ money and concerns from those who
provide other community primary services such as pharmacists, who we
discussed. They will fear that GPs will simply commission services from
themselves.<a class="bkMark" name="11030921000046">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
do not believe that that would be the case everywhere. Many GPs will
want to look at other services to commission, but these two amendments
would make those conflicts of interest much more clearly managed and
accountable, which is why we tabled them.<a class="bkMark" name="11030921000047">&#160;</a>

                           </span> I rise in support of
amendments 211 and 217. Amendment 211 would give an important duty to
the NHS commissioning board in relation to the guidance it gives to
commissioning consortia. New section 14V to the 2006 Act sets out the
responsibility of the board to publish guidance for consortia on how
they discharge their commissioning functions. As with much of the Bill,
there seems to be little by way of teeth when it comes to regulating
the functions of the new key statutory bodies it creates, such as
commissioning consortia, and that is without addressing the issues of
concern to the public over private providers that are looking to enter
the market and that stand to gain so much from the
changes.<a class="bkMark" name="11030921000048">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Whatever
guidance the board gives, the only obligation placed on a consortium is
to “have regard” to the guidance. Time and again on
earlier clauses, Ministers and Government Members have said that
something is implied in the Bill, but we, on this side, want it
explicitly spelt out.<a class="bkMark" name="11030921000049">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">When
addressing the amendment, I start from the premise that far too few
protections or safeguards are placed on each consortium. All hon.
Members should take a moment to reflect on the fact that the
legislation will transfer more than £80 billion of
taxpayers’ money to GP consortia across the country. If the
right safeguards are not in place before the Bill finishes its passage
through Parliament, there may well be consequences and a day of
reckoning for the coalition
parties.<a class="bkMark" name="11030921000050">&#160;</a>

217 would insert a specific direction to the NHS commissioning board to
address the obvious and blatant conflicts of interest, to which my hon.
Friend the Member for Leicester West referred, that are certain to
arise out of the legislation. I draw the attention of the Committee,
especially Government Members who have as yet refused to oppose any
aspect of the Bill, to the written question I referred to earlier. It

private sector companies. Indeed, as the Minister indicated at Health
questions earlier, it is not envisaged that GPs will spend time
managing the consortium’s function. The Minister indicated that
they would probably buy in that expertise, and that is increasingly the
expectation.<a class="bkMark" name="11030921000057">&#160;</a>

It is easy to read out statements completely out of context. We had the
discussion earlier so I am not sure how useful this is, but we clearly
said that there are clear guidelines and that each GP consortium must
have in its constitution provisions for dealing with conflicts of
interest. That is in the schedule, and we have already discussed it.

                           </strong> I am pleased to have the opportunity to
respond. Basically, that is the nub of our argument. We want some
explicit safeguards to be spelt out in the legislation, not just a
vague commitment to address the issue. We want to see that in black and
white in the Bill. I really think that the general public out there
expect us to scrutinise the Bill properly and to ensure that that is
addressed.<a class="bkMark" name="11030921000059">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I will give
an example in a moment, if I am allowed to continue, Mr Hood, but
perhaps when the Minister has the opportunity he will respond to some
of those points. It seems from the Minister’s considered written
reply that he is unable to tell me where the protection exists to
prevent private companies from being commissioners and providers. It is
clear that the Bill permits that, and if that is not a conflict of
interest, I am a monkey’s uncle. I have the
attributes.<a class="bkMark" name="11030921000060">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
is clear that there is more to be done to provide the public with the
confidence, and to ensure, that such a gross conflict of interest does
not occur, so I urge all right hon. and hon. Members to support
amendment 211, which would ensure that the guidance from the
board must, as the amendment
says,<a class="bkMark" name="11030921000061">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“include
procedures for the management of conflicts of interest in the
commissioning arrangements of commissioning consortia, and in
particular between the interests of persons engaged in commissioning
services and the interests of those engaged in their
provision.”<a class="bkMark" name="11030921000561">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Minister would do well to ask his colleagues to support amendment 211;
it does not play well with the public to resist all our reasoned
amendments. In addition, I suggest that he goes away and looks at how
to put further safeguards in the Bill so that protection from such a
clear conflict of interest is not only set out in guidance notes, but
enshrined in
legislation.<a class="bkMark" name="11030921000062">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
217 aims to address another potential conflict of interest. It would
place a financial duty on the commissioning consortium to prevent its
members from benefiting financially from any of their commissioning
arrangements.<a class="bkMark" name="11030921000063">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">There
is plenty of evidence to suggest that that safeguard is not only
required for the protection of public money and to safeguard against
any conflict of interest, but desirable, to protect GPs from
allegations of misuse of public money in future. Indeed, Dr Clare
Gerada, the chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners, to
whose evidence we have already referred, has warned that the potential
conflict of interest in the current proposals could amount to a scandal
on the scale of MPs’ expenses. In this case, however, it is
worth remembering that we are talking about £80 billion of
taxpayers’
money.<a class="bkMark" name="11030921000064">&#160;</a>

Suffolk PCT spends £500,000 on a car park while closing
front-line community hospitals, that is a good use of public money?
Would he not think that GPs are much better placed to spend money on
patients, rather than on bureaucracy and wasting money on car parks and
infrastructure?<a class="bkMark" name="11030921000065">&#160;</a>

Committee to indicate that.<a class="bkMark" name="11030921000068">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I would like
to refer to some examples. I know that the Minister is not keen on
that, but it might be instructive. The <em>Health Service Journal</em>
found that where GP-led commissioning had been trialled over the last
two years, funds had been diverted away from patient care to the
benefit of the commissioning bodies themselves, through excessive
amounts being spent on new equipment and refurbishments.<a class="bkMark" name="11030921000069">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">GPs have
always acted as private businesses contracted to the NHS. That means
that we expect them to fund their own running costs out of one budget,
which will also be available for care. There will be maximum set for
expenditure on management costs under the Bill, but that alone will not
protect against any conflict of interests. The <em>Health Service
Journal</em> found that by increasing spending on their own operating
costs, GPs were able to increase their own practice profits.<a class="bkMark" name="11030921000070">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I am sure
that all Members will have also seen the Channel 4 News investigation,
which revealed that under these reforms GPs could make arrangements
with private sector organisations that would ensure that they can make
a profit from commissioning decisions by pushing down the cost of
provision. I was aware of that conflict of interest, but I was shocked
by that
report.<a class="bkMark" name="11030921000071">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
truth is that under these reforms there is little or no protection for
patient care against the conflict of interest inherent in GPs’
controlling two-thirds of the

			Column number: 563<a class="bkMark" name="Column563">&#160;</a>
                           </div>NHS budget. The excellent Channel 4 News investigation by Victoria
Macdonald highlighted the business opportunity for private companies,
which are already lining up to offer their services, and for GPs, who
could work within the legislative framework to make a profit. During
the course of the programme, a leaked document from Integrated Health
Partners was cited as setting out a clear plan to push down the amount
spent on patient care in order to push up profits and give payments to
GPs.<a class="bkMark" name="11030921000072">&#160;</a>

how I planned to start it. Having just listened to details of the
fantasy world of the hon. Member for Easington, I come to the
conclusion that he was not at the same Health questions as I was,
because the Minister who answered the oral question from the hon.
Member for Stockton North—I shall be quite frank—was me.
I think that in his keenness to be called by Mr Speaker, the hon.
Member for Easington was not listening to what was going on; he was
concentrating on jumping up and down like a yo-yo. What I actually said
will be shown in <em>Hansard </em>tomorrow. The question from the hon.
Member for Stockton North said that patients got only eight or nine
minutes with their GP. I said that I did not accept that figure because
I believed, from my experience of going round the country, that GPs
made as much time available as they thought was appropriate to see
their patient. That is completely different from the fantasy land
revealed by the comments made by the hon. Member for
Easington.<a class="bkMark" name="11030921000099">&#160;</a>

amendments seek to address how conflicts of interest are managed within
consortia and that appropriate safeguards are in place to ensure that
decisions are taken in the interests of patients, rather than of member
practices. I think we can all agree—notwithstanding the past
five minutes of debate—that it should be patients who reap the
benefits from consortia commissioning activities in terms of improved
health
outcomes.<a class="bkMark" name="11030921000118">&#160;</a>

to the “Equity and Excellence” White Paper consultation
supported our proposals to put systems in place to ensure fairness and
transparency in decision making, particularly in relation to any
decisions to commission services from GP practices. We have therefore
laid down in the Bill measures that ensure, in an environment of
flexibility and freedom, that the actions and decisions of consortia
and their member practices are transparent and appropriate.<a class="bkMark" name="11030921000120">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Clause 63 is
important in that regard. It allows for regulations to impose
requirements on both the board and consortia so that when commissioning
services they adhere to good practice in procurement. Regulations may

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
211 would require the board to include in its commissioning guidance
for consortia guidance on arrangements to manage conflicts of interest.
The regulation power in clause 63 to impose requirements about conflict
is stronger than that. In addition, paragraph 4 of new
schedule 1A to the National Health Service Act 2006, inserted by
schedule 2 to the Bill, requires each consortium to set out its
arrangements for managing potential conflicts of interest. Consortia
will have the flexibility to specify their own arrangements, but it
will be the role of the board to review and approve those arrangements
as appropriate.<a class="bkMark" name="11030921000122">&#160;</a>

the establishment process for consortia, the NHS commissioning board
must be satisfied that the applicants have made appropriate
arrangements to ensure that the consortium will be able to discharge
its functions. The board will review consortia constitutions for
evidence that clear arrangements are in place to discharge their
functions, including promoting choice and managing potential conflicts
of interest. If the board is not satisfied that the proposed
arrangements are adequate, it will simply not establish the

are also bound by a duty under General Medical Council guidance that

about measures to safeguard against conflicts of interests apply
equally to amendment 217. It is simply not the case that member
practices will be able to pocket savings from their commissioning
budgets. With the exception of the funding for administrative costs,
which is to cover the costs of commissioning, the consortium’s
commissioning budget must be used exclusively for the commissioning of
patient care. Commissioning budgets will also be distinct from the
income that GP practices earn under their primary medical care
contract, from which GPs meet their practices expenses and derive their
personal income.<a class="bkMark" name="11030921000142">&#160;</a>

to be an element of confusion, so it might help the Committee if I give
a little background detail to the quality premium. The premium is a
financial incentive to reward effective commissioning in the same way
that quality and outcomes framework payments provide incentive for
effective health care provision. The quality premium is intended to
encourage GP-led commissioning consortia to achieve high-quality health

at this moment, because of the policies put in place by the previous

large scale by the NHS, often paying private providers a lot more than
NHS service providers, as I outlined earlier. The same consultants will
be doing the same operations at different ends of the hospital, one for
a private provider, and one for the NHS.<a class="bkMark" name="11030921000152">&#160;</a>

Members. Although I am grateful for the information, I will also
provide an answer myself, which was the intention. I thought that the
hon. Member in particular could benefit from the medical and health
background of my hon. Friend before we progress. The fact is that, yes,
a company could assist with commissioning and be involved in provision,
but—there is a but—only if all regulations and
requirements are being fulfilled; furthermore, as I said, there are
protections, including those of the GMC, by which it has to abide in
order to minimise a conflict of interest. The hon. Lady looks

have reversed a trend to which we became accustomed between 1997 and
2010. Some hon. Members have criticised the length of the Bill, but the
reason for its length is that we have sought to reverse recent
precedent and insert as much relevance as possible into the Bill and
primary legislation—unlike the health Bills of 1998-99, 2002-03,
2006 and 2009, in which the previous Government adopted the deliberate
tactic of providing Committees and the House of Commons with a
skeleton, while all the powers and detail flowed from regulations,
statutory instruments and other secondary legislation, but when the
Bills were progressing through Committee, no guidance and no draft
statutory instruments had been
published.<a class="bkMark" name="11030921000156">&#160;</a>

frank, I made the same plaintive plea on far more occasions than the
hon. Lady has; the difference was that there was virtually nothing on
the face of the primary legislation. We have decided that it is only
right and proper that to insert in the Bill as much information as we
can for the Committee’s consideration. It is inevitable,
however, that there will be a number of provisions from which statutory
instrument regulations will flow. We cannot put everything on the face

nothing much is changing. The General Medical Council already requires

they refer a pensioner, and the hon. Member for Central Suffolk and
North Ipswich has said that GPs are already able to refer someone to a
private provider where they or one of the colleagues work. The
difference, though, is that GPs do not currently have responsibility
for commissioning £80 billion-worth of the NHS budget. For all
their faults, as well as some of their benefits, primary care trusts
have a board, a chair, and executive and non-executive directors. The
new body being established has no requirement to involve a GP, let
alone any other provider, on its commissioning board. That is why we
are so
concerned.<a class="bkMark" name="11030921000162">&#160;</a>

am setting out the case for why they are. We are concerned because,
although some of the issues may be the same, the point is that the Bill
changes the structures that deal with them and the accountability in
those structures, and for the first time it gives GPs a role as
commissioners of services, not just providers. There is no GMC
requirement, as I understand it, for a GP to disclose anything
involving a conflict of interest in terms of commissioning. It is about
the provision of services, which is why we have tabled the

not commenting on whether that is good or bad. I am saying that there
must be proper accountability to avoid conflicts of interest. The Bill
does not provide that. There are indeed issues to do with a clear
process in procurement, but the question is the lack of accountability

                           </strong> Can I ask the hon. Lady to make clear what she is
saying? One point might be made, which is to claim that the Bill makes
the probability of or opportunity for conflicts of interest
greater—a separate point, regardless of what solutions there
were for it. Is that her point, or is it that, given that there will be
conflicts of interest in any system, there is no adequate provision in
the Bill to deal with them? Those are really two distinct points, are
they
not?<a class="bkMark" name="11030921000169">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Not for the first—and probably not for the
last—time, the hon. Gentleman puts the point very well, perhaps
better than I have. I am concerned about both those issues. I do not
believe that there is sufficient provision in the Bill to address those
conflicts of interest. The amendment is a good attempt to do so, which
is why I should like to press it to a

with the board giving guidance on commissioning. Essentially, they deal

attempt to broaden things so that the board will have the benefit of
listening to the public, the Care Quality Commission and HealthWatch
England. They are another attempt to insert some democracy into the

96, 97 and 98 would together ensure that new consortia were obliged to
produce a commissioning plan in respect of the remainder of the
financial year in which they were established. Subsection (1) of new
section 14Y requires every consortium to prepare a commissioning plan
before the start of each financial year. Such plans set out how the
consortium proposes to exercise its functions in that year. However,
that requirement cannot logically be met for the year in which a new
consortium is established. If the consortium did not exist before the
start of the financial year, the obligation to produce a commissioning
plan could not properly apply under the current wording.<a class="bkMark" name="11030921000211">&#160;</a>

that hon. Members will agree that such a situation is not desirable. It
is for that reason that I propose amendments 96, 97 and 98. These
amendments modify the link between plans and financial years by
introducing the concept of a “relevant period” for which
the consortium must prepare a commissioning plan. That would allow the
board to direct new consortia to prepare a plan covering the period
between establishment and the end of the financial year.<a class="bkMark" name="11030921000212">&#160;</a>

that are already in existence at the start of a financial year, these
amendments make it clear that the “relevant period”
relates to the forthcoming financial

                        <p class="tabbed">The second
issue is addressed by amendments 101, 103 and 105. It is not the most
controversial issue that the Committee will be asked to consider. These
amendments simply tidy up separate definitions of what constitutes a
“financial year” with a single definition that applies to
all the new sections of the National Health Service Act 2006
that the clause will insert. The definitions of a “financial
year” contained in new section 14Y and new section 14Z1 are
identical. For that reason, it is preferable that these definitions
should be removed in favour of inserting a single definition in new
section 14Z9. Hon. Members will note that that new section is on
“Interpretation”, which will contain the provisions set
out in clauses 21 and 22.<a class="bkMark" name="11030921000214">&#160;</a>

it is currently drafted, new section 14Z1 requires a newly established

this consultation with the health and well-being board, but the
revision could be significant and could alter the commissioning plan.
We do not argue that they have to consult unless the consortium deems
that to be the case. The amendment is woolly in that there may be some
guidance published by the board, but that is not necessarily required.

well-being boards to be consulted when producing a plan in the first
instance? There is consistency, and I think that is a safeguard with
regard to revisions. I accept that, where a health and well-being board
has been consulted, consortia must include a statement of the
board’s opinion in the revised plan, which I also believe is a
protection because it will be in the public
domain.<a class="bkMark" name="11030921000235">&#160;</a>

here—“significant” has not been defined. While a

                           </div>they must consult on. Nor is there any requirement on the board to
produce guidance—the provision says that it “may”
do so. Quite frankly, I think this is a poorly written

completely accept that the board should be able to revise its plans,
but the Minister seems unwilling to take this back and look at it. He
has also not answered my other question; perhaps I can get the answer
now. Why are there two specific applications, in terms of significant
changes to the preparation of the plan and significant changes to the
plan itself, which come in (8B) and (8C) of the amendment? The Minister
may want to write to me about that, but my main point is that I am not
satisfied with the assurances that he has given. I urge him again to
take the amendment away and have a look at it. Otherwise, we will be
forced to vote against
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11030921000237">&#160;</a>

Gentleman, but on the question of why there are separate paragraphs on
the plan and the preparation, the answer is simply for drafting
clarity. We are not trying to hide anything. If the hon. Gentleman
would prefer me to write to him in greater detail to expand on that
explanation, I will be more than happy to, but if he is satisfied, I

health and well-being boards as being “established for an
area” In fact, the reference should be to the local authority
area. As clause 178 will make clear, health and well-being boards are
to be statutory committees of local authorities. They will not have an
area in their own right distinct from that of the local authority that
establishes them.<a class="bkMark" name="11030921000270">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">It is more
accurate to refer to “a local authority area” for the
purpose of identifying a relevant health and well-being board, and that
is what the amendment makes clear. The intention is to define which
health and well-being board or boards must be consulted by a consortium
when it prepares its commissioning plan under the duty in new section
14Y. A relevant board will be one established by a local authority
whose area coincides with, or includes, the whole or any part of the

must, after consultation, define and publish the criteria by which
performance will be
measured.’.<p class="tabbed">The
amendment relates to the important issue of the responsibility of the
NHS commissioning board to conduct an annual performance assessment of
every consortium. If the Government proposals go through—we hope
they will not—the consortia will have £80 billion of
taxpayers’ money to spend, and it is vital that proper processes
should be in place to ensure that the performance of those consortia
are properly assessed.<a class="bkMark" name="11030921000276">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">However, many
GPs are concerned that there is no requirement within the legislation
for the board to publish or define the criteria by which it will assess
whether a consortium has performed well, or to consult on that or
publish it. The amendment would ensure that the board defines, consults
on and publishes the criteria by which performance will be measured.
That is important not only for the effective functioning of the
consortia but, as we shall see under clause 23, for other related
issues, which are extremely important but which I shall save for the
delight of hon. Members in a few

                           </strong> The amendment concerns the performance assessment
of consortia by the commissioning board, as the hon. Lady said. It
would require the commissioning board after consultation to define and
publish the criteria by which the performance of consortia will be
measured. New section 14Z1 of the 2006 Act specifies that the board
must conduct an assessment of how well each consortium has discharged
its functions during each financial year. The amendment is unnecessary.
New section 14Z1 also specifies that the performance assessment of a
consortium should consider, in particular, how well the consortium has
discharged its financial duties and its duties to make continuous
improvement to the quality of
services.<a class="bkMark" name="11030921000278">&#160;</a>

(4) allows the Secretary of State to publish a document about consortia

drawing up such arrangements. Drawing on the NHS outcomes frameworks,
the NHS commissioning board will develop a new commissioning outcomes
framework to help consortia account for effective commissioning. The
framework will allow the board to identify the contribution of
consortia to achieving the priorities for health

reality, at present PCTs are “not allowed” to go over
their budgets, but they do. A top-sliced fund at the strategic health
authority level manages such situations. All SHAs—as anyone who
has worked in a PCT knows—are extremely rigorous in pressing
PCTs to keep within their budgets, but sometimes that does not happen.
The reason is that in some parts of the country there are huge
structural deficits that have been there for a long time and that are
difficult to assess without undermining the financial position of
hospitals. If we were to get rid of those structural deficits, some
hospitals would have to close. That is the
reality.<a class="bkMark" name="11030921000299">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Under
the system proposed by the Government, consortia may be required not to
go over their budgets, but simply asserting something in the NHS does
not make it happen. Even if the structural debt problems relating to
hospital services and some areas’ long-term difficulties are
addressed, some GP commissioning consortia will still have deficits,
which is why the Government are proposing that the NHS board will
top-slice consortia and hold a contingency fund. So we will be going
through a huge reorganisation to end up in the same position. In fact,
as we heard in evidence to the Committee, some consortia might find it
harder to stay in budget if they cover a small population—a
point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Islington South and
Finsbury—because only four or five expensive patients could put
such a consortium into
debt.<a class="bkMark" name="11030921000300">&#160;</a>

are currently taken into account in the way in which allocations to
primary care trusts are formulated, and which we expect the

necessary to table this amendment. However, it is important to remember
that we are establishing an independent commissioning board that will
be responsible for the allocation of NHS resources to consortia free of
political interference. The process for developing the allocations
formula is complex, taking into account the age of the local
population, levels of deprivation and local, unavoidable cost
differences reflected in the market forces factor, such as staffing,
land and buildings
costs.<a class="bkMark" name="11030921000315">&#160;</a>

of our approach to public health. The Government have made it clear
that tackling health inequalities is a priority as part of the
commitment to fairness and social justice. We have said that on several

the first time in a generation, local government will be given the
responsibility for making a major impact on improving people’s
health and tackling health inequalities in every community. There will
be ring-fenced budgets for upper-tier and unitary local authorities and
a new health premium to incentivise action to reduce health
inequalities. That will apply to the part of the local public health
budget that is for health improvement. Building on a baseline
allocation weighted towards areas with the worst health outcomes and
most need, the health premium will depend on the progress made in
improving the health of the local population, based on elements of the
proposed outcomes
framework.<a class="bkMark" name="11030921000320">&#160;</a>

many members of the professional bodies, as well as Opposition Members:
the bonus payments that the Bill allows to go to consortia and GPs. I
hope that the Committee will bear with me as I go through
them.<p class="tabbed">New
sections 223L(1) and (2) of the 2006 Act state that at the end of each
financial year the NHS commissioning board may make “one or more
payments” to consortia that it considers have “performed
well” or will “perform well”. New section 223L(3)
states that is it up to the board to determine the amount of payment,
depending on the consortium’s performance. However, new section
223L(7) states:<a class="bkMark" name="11030921000326">&#160;</a>

make one, two, three or however many bonus payments it wishes. It will
then be up to the commissioning consortium to do whatever it wants with
those bonus payments. The board can also determine their size. In other
words, the Bill allows for performance-related bonus payments to be
made by the national board to GPs, and the money could go into the
GPs’ private pockets and not be reinvested in patient care. That
is what the Bill says; that is what it allows.<a class="bkMark" name="11030921000328">&#160;</a>

I thought that the hon. Lady had not read the Bill or did not
understand it. That would be one explanation. The Bill clearly allows
for it. The payment is for performance; it is not about the quality and
outcomes framework or the contracts but about commissioning
performance, and nothing in the Bill would prevent a bonus payment from
the board from going directly to GPs. The measure states that the
consortium can distribute the
payment<a class="bkMark" name="11030921000334">&#160;</a>

                        <p>I
carefully reread that letter to <em>The Guardian</em>, and the
Minister’s words seemed quite specific. She said that GPs will
not be able to<a class="bkMark" name="11030921000335">&#160;</a>

                        </p>
This is
not about money from the allocated budget, however, but a bonus payment
given to GPs by the board. The Government may or may not prevent GPs
from pocketing money from the budgets allocated at the beginning of the
year for the purposes of commissioning. The letter does not, however,
mention the end-of-year performance-related bonus payment that the
board can issue according to the Bill. There is nothing to prevent that
money from being distributed as members of the consortium see
fit.

unacceptable to allow taxpayers’ money to go directly into the

commissioning body that commissions wisely, there may be a benefit or
bonus from the Government. That seems to be the thrust of the measure.
If someone is unfortunate enough to live in an area where commissioning
is unwise, ineffectual or badly done, for whatever reason and perhaps
without fault, it seems that there will not be additional benefits. The
implication is that if someone is in an area where the commissioners
are not performing well, patients will have fewer resources for their
care. That is the logical outcome. Clearly, the thinking behind
that—there is appreciable thinking behind it—is that the
technique of maintaining the status quo for ineffectual commissioning
bodies and rewarding the good ones will improve commissioning or raise
commissioning
standards.<a class="bkMark" name="11030921000348">&#160;</a>

resources for their health in contrast with people who are fortunate in
having proficient commissioners in their area, particularly as I
suspect that the bonus money will be top-sliced generally from PCT
funds. That is what Government’s characteristically do. The
thrust of the measure is clearly to put in place a mechanism to improve

also improve commissioning. I question whether it is necessary to add a
cash reward system to improve commissioning when there are many levers
in the Bill that should do that, particularly when that system is
untried. I might speculate that the same system could be used to make
police forces better by ensuring that effective forces that do the
right thing have more policemen, and inept forces remain as they

concern is about what future Secretaries of State, perhaps of a
different political persuasion, may do. We are putting in place a tool
for a future NHS commissioning body to micro-manage the local health
service by simply defining what it thinks is good commissioning and the
rewards that are attached to that and in that way persuade it to do
things that it otherwise would not
do.<a class="bkMark" name="11030921000351">&#160;</a>

classic example would be this: if Lord Darzi were chair of the NHS
commissioning board he would undoubtedly think very good commissioning
would be to endow every area as far as possible with a Darzi clinic. He
would regard that as major progress in commissioning. Certainly in my
own area he has told the PCT that and I have two, not completely
useless, but largely empty Darzi clinics as a result. We are not just
talking about Secretaries of State who are prone to interfere in local
commissioning decisions but people running the commissioning board who
may be persuaded along the same lines. We do not know that they will
not do that and we do not know that they will not be able to use this
clause to micro-manage the local NHS.<a class="bkMark" name="11030921000352">&#160;</a>

commissioning if some of my doubts could be allayed. Will this be a
tool that will improve commissioning because that could surely be the
only justification for it? I hope the Minister will tell us in a minute
what the evidence base is for suggesting that this would be a major
step forward. I am sure that the Government would not have proposed
something like this without looking for some evidence from around the
world to show that public bodies rewarded in this way perform better.

obviously be much more
assured.<a class="bkMark" name="11030921000353">&#160;</a>

start. We need clarity from Ministers, not in terms of what they write

fundamental difference. It is intellectually unsustainable to compare
QOF with what is proposed here. As I understand QOF, it is awarded by

body deciding for itself what it will reward. That is fundamentally
different from QOF. We should not persist in comparing the two. If the
Minister can present me with clear empirical evidence from across the
world that this sort of incentivisation improves public bodies I will
be much more reassured. He should also drop the comparison between QOF
and what is happening here, because there is this fundamental

                           </strong> I have two brief points to make. First, I have sat
on the board of an NHS trust in the west midlands. I used to have
interesting conversations with the HR director. Every month she would
say that the trust was struggling to get more than 60% of its annual
mandatory appraisals done. I used to tell her that they must have a
different definition of mandatory from the one we used to use in the
Army. At one point I asked her what difference the annual appraisals
made. If someone in a ward was doing a really good job that was above
and beyond the call of duty and someone doing the same job in a
neighbouring ward was doing the absolute minimum, was there any
difference if one got a good annual appraisal and the other got a bad
one. Did it affect their pay, promotions—anything? She said that
no, these annual appraisals do not make the slightest difference. So it
is no wonder that we struggle to get more than 60% of our mandatory
appraisals done. I think it is the exact same issue that we are dealing
with
here.<a class="bkMark" name="11030921000358">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Secondly,
another example of a very similar system in place in the NHS is the
clinical excellence awards, whereby secondary care consultants are
given cash bonuses based on their performance as clinicians in the
hospital over the
year.<a class="bkMark" name="11030921000359">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The Minister said earlier that he thought the
spirit of transparency and accountability was right at the heart of the
Bill. He has an opportunity in response to this debate to illuminate
this particular clause, which I contend is one of the more opaque in
the Bill. The opening paragraph says in essence that the board may give
bonuses based on performance as it sees fit, and the closing paragraph
says that the consortium may then determine how that money is spread
out between its various members. Between the two there is a gaping
chasm—a void in terms of detail—as to how that bonus
ought to be
calculated.<a class="bkMark" name="11030921000360">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Over
the last 10 minutes or so we have heard—if I may say so—a
completely erroneous comparison between this and QOF. As several
Members have said, QOF is a very different beast, whereby individual
GPs are paid for performance against a very clear set of criteria.
There are publically published objectives, some of which might be
deemed inputs or processes, but others—for example, identifying
patients at cardiac risk and treating them with a statin—very
clearly lead to treatment outcomes. There is a world of difference
between that and saying, as we see under new section 14Z1 of the 2006
Act, that the consortium must improve continually in terms of the
quality of the health service they provide, and operate effectively
financially.<a class="bkMark" name="11030921000361">&#160;</a>

know of no walk of life—I have worked both in business and the
public sector—where anybody would be set such flimsy and opaque
objectives as improving quality and operating effectively financially.
I welcome the Minister’s suggestion earlier that there may be a
further iteration of this whereby we will see more of the detail of the
objectives. Frankly though, I have looked at them and spoken with
colleagues on the Treasury Committee, and I think that Bob
Diamond’s bonus structure is a bit more robust, transparent, and
straightforward than what we have before us in the Bill. Mentioning Bob
Diamond is not facetious or outlandish—it makes a point. This is
about introducing a bonus culture into the NHS, transplanted from the
City to the surgery. It is at odds with the ethos of the
NHS.<a class="bkMark" name="11030921000362">&#160;</a>

heard a moment ago in respect of secondary care physicians receiving
individual bonuses. The difference here is that we will have a system
whereby—as we heard earlier—commissioning consortia are
potentially commissioning care from their pals or themselves, and then
getting paid a bonus predicated on how well they or their pals perform
in delivering that care or managing their budget. That is totally at
odds with the ethos of the NHS. It is a step backwards, prior to 1948.
It has shades of the era before the NHS, when we had the buying and
selling of GP practices, and the Minister must look again at the
clause. I fully support the amendment. We should strike out the clause

                        <p class="tabbed">The amendment
would remove the basic powers needed to allow the board to make
payments to consortia dependent upon outcomes and thus would remove a
key incentive—not a bonus, but an incentive—in the system
for improving quality. Our plans place quality and efficiency at the
centre of the NHS, by cutting bureaucracy and shifting decision making
closer to patients through GP commissioning. Quality is the cornerstone
of the Bill, with a duty regarding quality improvement placed on the
Secretary of State, the NHS commissioning board and GP consortia. The
clause is a

			Column number: 591<a class="bkMark" name="Column591">&#160;</a>
                           </div>key part of that policy, as it enables the NHS commissioning board to
make payments to GP consortia for their performance. In particular, GP
consortia will be rewarded for how successfully they focus their
resources to achieve better health outcomes for

practices already make a key contribution to the overall quality of
patient care and to the effective use of NHS resources. Coming together
in consortia to commission health care on behalf of patients will
empower them to collaborate more effectively in pursuit of high-quality
outcomes for patients. Our proposal is that the board—not the
consortia, but the board—should be able to make payments to
consortia, to recognise the outcomes that their members achieve
collaboratively through commissioning and the effectiveness with which
they manage financial
resources.<a class="bkMark" name="11030921000369">&#160;</a>

propose that this quality premium should be paid in the first instance
to a consortium and that it would be free to decide how best to
apportion it between its member practices, to recognise the
contribution that they make to achieving the common goals. The quality
premium will be funded from existing resources. It will quite clearly
be separate from the payments to GP practices for providing primary
medical services. I hope that hon. Members have taken that point on

what we are proposing is that GP consortia will be rewarded for using

the use of those cash-limited

This is a concept, an idea, and something we want to work out with

the design of the quality premium and how it will be implemented. To
give chapter and verse of how it would work and exactly how much it
will cost is not feasible or viable, because we have not got that far
in our discussions. That is a perfectly reasonable position and, if we
were not in it, and I was announcing figures before the conclusion of

want to go through a few points made by Members. The hon. Member for
Southport, as ever, hit the nail on the head when he asked where the
evidence base was for providing a bonus not to individual clinicians
but to a commissioning consortium or whatever body commissions
services. Where is the evidence that that improves the quality of
health? He reminded me that much of the evidence is from the United
States and suggests that one of the most powerful drivers of change is
what is called peer-to-peer review—clinicians looking at,
scrutinising and supporting the work of one another. That goes on
within an organisation, and it is the relationships that are built and
the degree to which people have respect for each other’s
professional capacities, are working towards a common goal, and can
challenge and support each other that drive quality, rather than,
necessarily, the influences from outside an organisation. I thank him
for making that
point.<a class="bkMark" name="11030921000383">&#160;</a>

want to pick up on a point made by the hon. Member for North
Warwickshire. QOF is not perfect, but he said that this is about
processes and not outcomes. The hon. Gentleman may not remember the
debate on clause 2 when we talked about quality. Most people who have
looked at quality in health care say that a combination of the two
things is needed. There are not always all the outcome measures that
one might want, and some process measures are required. QOF could
perhaps move towards outcomes, but we do not have the data for a lot of
the information, and we must measure what we can.<a class="bkMark" name="11030921000385">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">This section
of Bill is unclear. There has not been sufficient debate on the
evidence for whether it will achieve its goals, and we are not clear
about the pot of money, which is somewhat separate to that going out to
GPs. Where is it? How much is it? Does it sit in the Department? How
will it be shared out? Crucially, nothing in the Bill prevents that

                           </div>for dealing with what the NHS calls emergency planning or emergency
preparedness. Currently, strategic health authorities are responsible
for co-ordinating the NHS’s response to major incidents, such as
the 7/7 terrorist bombings in London, swine flu and major incidents of
flooding. The strategic health authority is the main accountable body,
but it works in co-operation with the ambulance services and the Health
Protection Agency, which is being abolished and its responsibilities
moved to the new national body, Public Health England. SHAs can
delegate that responsibility if and when they see fit. For example,
during the 2007 floods, the SHA delegated responsibility for the
NHS’s response in the west midlands to the West Midlands
ambulance service, which had the gold command in its headquarters.
There is, therefore, some flexibility in the current
system.<a class="bkMark" name="11030921000477">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
the Minister has mentioned, I was an adviser in the Department of
Health when the 7/7 bombings happened and, as I have said, I am a
former director of the Ambulance Service Network and have discussed,
seen and been involved in some of the exercises run within the NHS to
make sure that the service is prepared for major incidents. I am sure I
do not need to remind Members that threats and risks remain high in
relation to terrorist activity, and that there was recently another
bout of swine flu. Members in many parts of the country, such as East
Anglia, will be concerned about flooding and other incidents. The issue
affects
us.<a class="bkMark" name="11030921000478">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">My
concern about the Bill is, when SHAs go, where will their
responsibility for emergency planning or preparedness lie? There are
real concerns that, if it lies with a national board, which is going to
be in Leeds, I think, how will they have the people on the ground who
know all the local players within the NHS—be they the GPs or the
hospitals—to bring them together and co-ordinate them
effectively through the gold command structure? The NHS also needs a
clearly defined person in that particular area to lead work with the
police, local authorities and fire services. We need someone to have
that responsibility, to know the key players, and to bring them around
the
table.<a class="bkMark" name="11030921000479">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
also need someone who does what it says on the tin—emergency
planning—who plans and runs scenarios, and who goes through the
different things that might happen when there is a serious incident.
Colleagues in the ambulance service tell me that they are not sure
about where responsibility lies as a result of the Bill. It is said,
simply, that the board will co-ordinate it with GP consortia. Many GPs
are wonderful, but to make them responsible not only for commissioning
£80 billion-worth of NHS services, but for emergency planning
over the next two years, is a serious
issue.<a class="bkMark" name="11030921000480">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">If
the Minister wanted to sort out this situation, the Bill could be
amended. An amendment has not yet been tabled, and I am interested to
see whether there is such a response. There is a regional body that
knows how to do this stuff, and that is the ambulance service. I
strongly urge the Minister to look in more detail at this matter. In
the light of a national board in Leeds and new consortia that are not
yet established, will the Minister explain who is doing the planning at
the moment? Is it being done by the PCT clusters that are coming
together? Does every PCT cluster have a lead for emergency planning?
Does every GP consortium in the pathfinder area have a lead for
emergency planning, or are consortia going to come together and have
one lead on emergency 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 596<a class="bkMark" name="Column596">&#160;</a>
                           </div>planning and preparedness? There is no detail in the Bill about that.
This is not about some ideal world in two years’ time when the
consortia and the board are up and running, but what is happening now.
Who is the lead? Who is doing the planning? I strongly urge the
Minister to accept that a regional role is required here. It is not
something that can be done either by the board or by the consortia or
with nothing in between. Will the Minister reassure me about the PCT
leads on emergency planning—they exist now—and explain
how that is all going to work? As my former colleagues have said to me,
at best, the Bill is unclear and, at worst, a
mess.<a class="bkMark" name="11030921000481">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I certainly will seek to give the hon. Lady
reassurance. Before I get into the exact detail of the clause, let me
briefly answer her pertinent question about what is happening now,
because that will be of use to her and it will be useful to have it on

                        <p class="tabbed">As the hon.
Lady will accept, it is crucial to have effective emergency
preparedness for any eventuality. The Department of Health is fully
aware of the problems and concerns, and it is determined to ensure that
there are proper, seamless and continuous plans in place during the
transition of the modernisation plan. At present, the Department of
Health is working with NHS emergency preparedness delivery partners
such as the ambulance trusts, and through the strategic health
authority emergency planning leads, to ensure that all emergency
preparedness teams and functions are maintained at a high level
throughout the transition programme. I hope that that reassures the
hon. Lady, particularly given her experience in the ambulance
service.<a class="bkMark" name="11030921000483">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> That is not a reassurance to me. Will the
Minister write to me setting out what is happening now with the PCT
clusters, whether they have an emergency planning lead and whether the
pathfinder GP consortia have an emergency planning lead? If an incident
happens across a region of London and if a board does not have a
regional body, who does the co-ordinating? I understand that the
Minister may not be able to respond now, but will he write to me on
those points, because it is not clear from the Bill who takes that
responsibility or
how?<a class="bkMark" name="11030921000484">&#160;</a>

than to write to the hon. Lady and I will do that. In my defence, I was
just dealing with the situation at the moment to reassure her that
there was not going to be any hiatus or confusion during the
transition. Although I say it myself, I thought I gave a fairly
comprehensive answer on what is happening, but I will not dwell on
that. I will certainly write to the hon. Lady as soon as possible so
that she can have that information on paper. That deals with that, so I
will quit while I am ahead and go back to clause 38. I will be brief,

responsibility and calls people together. During an emergency incident,
gold command is in its headquarters, which is where people go. My
concern is not that there are multiple responsibilities and people
involved; it is about who is accountable, who people go to and who
organises the gold command. That is not clear in the Bill. That is a

I want to probe the impact of the clause in practice. As I said
earlier, I chair the all-party group on pharmacy—I declare that
because the clause deals with pharmaceutical services expenditure. The

correct, but I am concerned about new schedule 12A to the 2006 Act,
mentioned in new section 165A(3), which the clause inserts. The
explanatory notes
state:<a class="bkMark" name="11030921000506">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="hs_brev">“Paragraph
2(3) requires the Board to notify each commissioning consortium of its
determination of the designated elements of pharmaceutical remuneration

                        </p>

are different elements, and I will not go into that, but the

expend on pharmaceuticals, and to claim money back from consortia if
the board thinks that they pay more than they should. That flies in the
face of all that we have heard about bringing decision making nearer to
patients. It flies in the face of what people have been arguing, both
before and after the election, about how we should be looking not at
the cost of new drugs, but at their effectiveness.<a class="bkMark" name="11030921000511">&#160;</a>

interpretation is correct—hopefully the Minister will get up and
tell me that it is not—although I accept that consortia have a
right to make sure that people are prescribing properly, are we really

annually on different pharmaceutical services, including the cost of
drugs? I see the Minister is shaking his head. He is

this is a device to be able to impose a cap on expenditure on drugs,

                           </strong> I had hoped that I would not need to use the

                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
clause inserts new section 165A and schedule 12A into the
2006 Act. Those provisions will govern the future
arrangements for expenditure on NHS pharmaceutical services. It may
help the Committee if I provide some background to the current system
and the new arrangements.<a class="bkMark" name="11030921000517">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Currently,
qualified prescribers, such as GPs and practice nurses or qualified
staff in hospital outpatient clinics, issue NHS prescriptions for
dispensing in the community. Those prescriptions are usually dispensed
by a community pharmacy, an appliance contractor or a dispensing
doctor. The current funding arrangements allocate primary care trusts
the whole of the budget for pharmaceutical services expenditure. That
means that PCTs pay for both the costs of the pharmaceutical services
provided, in terms of fees and allowances, and the costs of the
products supplied against those
prescriptions.<a class="bkMark" name="11030921000518">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">GP
practices are, however, charged back the costs of the products they
prescribe against a notional individual drugs budget allocation that
the PCT notifies to them, so that GPs can monitor such costs.
Currently, the relevant fees and allowances, and the amounts
contractors will be reimbursed for the products supplied, are
determined by the Secretary of State, following agreement between the
Department and the Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee. They
are published each month in the “Drug
Tariff”.<a class="bkMark" name="11030921000519">&#160;</a>

                        </h4>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
stress how important those determinations are. The price at which the
NHS reimburses for products supplied is obviously of great importance
to contractors, but the effects are much wider. The prices can impact
on the 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 601<a class="bkMark" name="Column601">&#160;</a>
                           </div>pharmaceutical supply chain, thereby affecting manufacturers and
wholesalers. The prices are therefore extremely important in helping to
maintain the stability of the supply chain as a
whole.<a class="bkMark" name="11030921000520">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
intention is that the Secretary of State will remain responsible for
determining how much is paid for product reimbursement. The Secretary
of State will also set the centrally determined fees and allowances
that relate to the services element of the pharmaceutical services
provision, but the board will meet the costs of pharmaceutical
remuneration as a whole—both the remuneration for services and
the reimbursement of the cost of the product. However, we expect that
the board will want to charge commissioning consortia for elements of
pharmaceutical service expenditure—for example, the costs of
drugs supplied against GP
prescriptions.<a class="bkMark" name="11030921000521">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
new system will help those prescribers to be aware of the financial
consequences of their prescribing decisions, just as they will take
responsibility for the financial consequences of their referral
decisions. That will provide incentives for a consortium to work with
its practices to look at how to achieve the best overall health
outcomes from the resources available, which was the point about
internal peer pressure made earlier by my hon. Friend the Member for
Southport. We expect that some product costs, such as the costs of the
drugs dispensed against dentist prescriptions, will remain with the
board and not be charged to GP
consortia.<a class="bkMark" name="11030921000522">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That
is a summary of the current and future arrangements, which I hope is
sufficient, although if the right hon. Member for Rother Valley would
find it helpful, I can give further detail and clarification. As he has
not indicated one way or the other, I will turn to the provisions in
detail.<a class="bkMark" name="11030921000523">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
clause will insert new section 165A into the 2006 Act. That will enable
the Secretary of State to request whatever information he needs from
the board about pharmaceutical remuneration, so that he can make
informed decisions about the reimbursement prices that he will have to
set, taking account of other expenditure.<a class="bkMark" name="11030921000524">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The Secretary
of State will be able to stipulate how and when that information is to
be provided and what period it will cover. The clause will also insert
new schedule 12A, which will make further provision regarding the
detail of how pharmaceutical remuneration is to be dealt with by the
board. I should make it clear that the term “drugs”
includes not only medicines but appliances such as the products used to
treat stoma care patients, and that “remuneration” covers
all providers of pharmaceutical
services.<a class="bkMark" name="11030921000525">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Paragraph
2 of the new schedule will require the board to determine which
elements of pharmaceutical remuneration are to be met by GP consortia
and which by the board. The board must notify each consortium of what
it is to be liable for in any financial year. For example, as I have
previously explained, we expect that the board will want to make GP
consortia responsible for meeting the cost of drugs prescribed by their
members. Paragraph 2 will also enable the Secretary of State to direct
the board about any specific elements of pharmaceutical remuneration
that are not to be met by GP consortia. For example, that might cover
the costs of NHS prescriptions written by other prescribers, such as
staff in NHS foundation trusts or other service providers, including
dentists.<a class="bkMark" name="11030921000526">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In that way,
we intend to ensure that the board will retain financial responsibility
for those elements of pharmaceutical remuneration for which it is
responsible, and that GP consortia are not charged for elements over
which they have no influence. Given my original commitment to the right
hon. Gentleman that that will not give the board powers to cap
expenditure on drugs—the answer is definitely not—I hope
that I have given him and other members of the Committee ample
reassurance on, and a detailed description of, the
clause.<a class="bkMark" name="11030921000527">&#160;</a>

moment ago that the board will be responsible for the cost and will
therefore, I presume, hold the budget to make payments for the cost of
pharmaceutical products. That is what I thought he said a moment ago,
and that seemed to be at odds with his final remarks, which were about
GPs being responsible for meeting the cost of products in respect of
the prescriptions that they make
locally.<a class="bkMark" name="11030921000528">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I have a simple point. I take at face value the
Minister’s statement that there is no intention to have a cap.
However, does he accept that there will be a de facto cap if we have a
centrally held and defined overall drug budget for the first time, as
opposed to the current situation, where the amount of money spent on
drugs is determined by the volume of prescriptions—and is
therefore not controlled centrally and certainly not capped? If we have
a centralised budget, we will effectively have a
cap.<a class="bkMark" name="11030921000533">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I return to what I said at the beginning. The
current funding arrangements allocate PCTs the whole budget for
pharmaceutical services expenditure. In that sense, there is already a
budget. Through the Bill, we are trying to ensure that those things are
clear in

clause has been drafted. There is no sinister intent to remove from GPs
their ability to prescribe and exercise their clinical judgment, which
we intend to protect because we see it as critical to the way in which
the NHS will operate in future. With that, I hope that the clause will
stand part of the
