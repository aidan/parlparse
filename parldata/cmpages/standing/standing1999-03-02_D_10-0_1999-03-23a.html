<P>

</P>
<P>
Question again proposed, That the amendment be made.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies </B>(Grantham and Stamford): May I welcome you back to the Committee, Mr. McWilliam, to preside over our deliberations.
<P>
On the first day of our discussion of pension splitting, I explained that the Opposition are prepared to entertain the addition of pension sharing on divorce to the statute book and the range of instruments available to matrimonial courts, provided that there are safeguards and that the power is used only as a reserve power to ensure that justice is done. I made it clear that if it is not used as a reserve power, it would contribute to even greater injustice, would have some perverse consequences on people's lives and behaviour, and would be a source of additional costs. We tabled amendments, including amendment No. 162, which would have constrained the courts' use of the power, but the amendment was rejected. We have been forced to table a series of specific amendments to achieve the same purpose in a more crude but targeted way.
<P>
One of the great problems of pension splitting or sharing is that it is irrevocable. A capital sum is paid away and a pension is permanently foregone. That may cause injustice, but that injustice may not arise for a long time, so it may not be anticipated. The younger the parties to the pension sharing, especially the beneficiary of the pension sharing, the greater the problem, because the courts will have to take a view not on the position now or in the next few years, but on what may be a just solution in 30, 40 or even more years.
<P>
That is the background against which we tabled amendment No. 76, which would limit pension sharing to cases in which the beneficiary of the pension sharing&#151;the recipient of the pension credit or the transferee&#151;is over the age of 40 and would prevent such sharing when the beneficiary is under 40.
<P>
I have acknowledged that 40 is an arbitrary cut-off age. It is not an ideal way of resolving the problem. Hon. Members may be tempted to suggest that it is the wrong cut-off age and that 35 or 37 and a half may be more appropriate, but any figure would be open to the charge that it is arbitrary, so I shall say in advance that I have an open mind to suggestions on the cut-off age. We come back to Bernard Shaw and the actress. We are trying to establish certain principles in the amendment and we are less concerned with the degree to which those principles will be implemented or the extent to which implementation may be given to them. Clearly, pension sharing is more problematic when the parties are less than 40 than when they are closer to pensionable age. For example, at 58 it is easier to predict what the circumstances are likely to be when the pension share takes effect and is translated into an income stream for the beneficiary. That makes it easier for the court to determine what effect the pension share will have on the beneficiary, the member of the scheme who, as the transferor, is the loser, and other members of the family. The courts should be sensitive to the effect of pension sharing on families, which is dealt with in the next amendment. It is more difficult to predict circumstances when people are under 40.
<P>
Most of our experience of the sad issue of divorce confirms the adage that divorce is usually a disaster for one party. Indeed, it may be a disaster&#151;or a liberation&#151;for both parties. All too often, however, at least one party loses out badly on divorce, either psychologically or materially. If the party who loses psychologically is also the main loser financially, which, under pension splitting, is the person with the largest pension asset, the damage is enhanced.
<P>
Common human experience leads us to conclude that it is difficult at the time of a divorce to predict which party will suffer most or least, or whether the person who might appear to suffer the most will be able successfully to rebuild his or her life. Those decisions are hard to make for people in their 20s and 30s. It is especially difficult for the courts to make the just distribution that is required under the law when the effect of their decision will not, in the unique case of pension sharing, come on stream and take effect for 20 or 30 years. It is also impossible for those arrangements to be altered in the light of changing circumstances and if the courts have got it wrong.
<P>
In most cases where courts decide on the allocation of assets and distribution of cash flows under section 21 of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973, the arrangements can be varied in response to an application by the parties for changes to ancillary relief. Pension earmarking arrangements exist to allow for a particular form of ancillary relief that is related to pensions.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am finding it difficult to relate the hon. Gentleman's remarks to persons ``aged less than 40''. He is speaking in general terms.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I am speaking about the considerable differences in the application of earmarking, which is the alternative to pension sharing for people under 40. Younger people can apply to have an earmarking order varied. If a court has made an arrangement that seems sensible&#151;
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Persons of any age can have a court order varied.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Yes, but no one can have a pension-sharing order varied. It follows that if a pension-sharing order is made before someone is 40, it will stand for a long time before it comes into effect. The income stream that it produces in favour of the beneficiary is a loss of a potential income stream that the pension scheme member, the transferor, would otherwise have expected. Circumstances might change substantially during that period. However, unlike other forms of ancillary relief&#151;a contrast that must be drawn especially in relation to people below the age of 40&#151;there is no scope for the courts to vary a pension-sharing order, however much they might think, if they were presented with the case, that a variation should, in justice, be made. That goes to the heart of the amendment, which intends to remove a potential source of injustice. If it is not a source of injustice to impose a rigid system of pension sharing, applied once and for all below the age of 40, and perhaps below the age of 30, when it is completely impossible to predict the life paths of the beneficiary or the donor of the pension credit over the subsequent 20 or 30 years, I do not know what is.
<P>
In section 25A of the 1973 Act, the courts are enjoined to take account of,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the income, earning capacity, property and other financial resources which each of the parties to the marriage has or is likely to have in the foreseeable future.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There are several unsatisfactory aspects to that. What is ``foreseeable''? That is not defined. At the age of 58, it is relatively easy, in normal circumstances, to foresee the financial position of the parties two years leater, at the age of 60. However, it is unreasonable to expect a court, or indeed anyone else, accurately to foresee the financial future of parties 20 or 30 years hence. It is unreasonable to require the courts to make such a judgment, but that will be their obligation as a result of the combined effect of section 25 of the 1973 Act and the Bill. When there is such a large gap between the time when the court makes its decision and the consequences of its determiniation for the parties, justice cannot properly be served and an unreasonable burden is placed on the courts.
<P>
We know that the courts already find it impossible adequately to carry out the injunctions of the law contained in section 25. That section is already a source of considerable abuse, and indeed merriment, to divorce lawyers. The issue arises of whether it is possible to predict that someone is about to inherit a large amount of money from a grandmother. Of course, the court cannot take that into account because the grandmother might change her will. That is an aspect of
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the income, earning capacity, property and other financial resources which each of the parties to the marriage has or is likely to have in the foreseeable future''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
that cannot be taken into account. Are courts supposed to determine the course of people's careers&#151;for example, that someone is about to be promoted to the position of partner at Goldman Sachs and take part in a flotation? No.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. My problem with the hon. Gentleman's speech is that amendment No. 76 is very narrow: the difference between a person aged 39, 11 months and 29 days and a person aged 40 years and one day. The hon. Gentleman must address himself to that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Yes, I am addressing myself to that.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. If I thought that the hon. Gentleman was addressing himself to that, I would not have interrupted him. He must come to Order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Let me make a small parenthesis, Mr McWilliam. I hope that you consider it legitimate to say that a distinction should be made between older and younger people. As I have already explained, the issue of whether a person is, to use your phrase, 39 years, 11 months and 29 days or 40 years and one day is not the material consideration.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I fully understand what the material consideration is. However, I am bound, as is the hon. Gentleman, by the terms of the amendment, which are incredibly narrow.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> The amendment intends to distinguish clearly between people who are 20 years and more away from their prospective retirement and people who are less than 20 years away from retirement, which relates to people who are below 40 and above 40. Given that people who are considerably older than 40 are much nearer to retirement than those who are considerably younger than 40, it follows that my argument will apply a fortiori with even greater force to those who fall into the latter category.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The law requires the courts to predict the future income, property and other financial resources of parties, but it does not require them&#151;as the Bill will&#151;to look 20 years and more ahead. That is the significance of the age threshold of 40. As I said, the courts find it extremely difficult to carry out the task already required of them in section 25. We should be conscious of that when imposing even more burdens on them in future.
<P>
Will courts also be required to take account of an individual's re-marriage prospects? Will we have the absurdity of judges evaluating the attractiveness, or marriage prospects, of individuals? That prospect, which no one welcomes, is a source of great merriment in the legal profession. As it is, courts do not take seriously their obligation to take into account all the factors that might affect the income, earning capacity, property and other financial sources that each party has, or is likely to have, in the foreseeable future. If we place a further requirement on courts to take account of an individual's financial prospects more than 20 years ahead, we will open the door to inevitable and serious injustice.
<P>
It would be grotesque to allow courts to make an irrevocable pension split favouring a particular party to the marriage. During the succeeding 20 or 30 years, when the parties are aged between 40 and 60 or 65, the party who has a large part of his or her pension taken away may get into difficulties and be unable to rebuild that pension. He or she may develop a history of redundancy and employment problems, may experience marital and other personal problems, and retire in a state of penury. Such a person could have benefited from money that, after all, he or she had earned up to the time that the pension was split. On the other hand, the beneficiary of that pension split may have a successful time during the intervening 20 or 30 years. He or she may make a successful marriage, have a successful career, or win the national lottery.
<P>
Under the pension-splitting arrangement, courts will not be able to re-examine cases. Where a pension was originally split under section 21 of the 1973 Act, which allows for periodical payments, lump sum payments, or the division of property, or where a court decided that the pension asset should properly be taken into account, earmarking orders are subject to review by the courts on application by the aggrieved party. However, under the Bill, where a party in his or her 60s and 70s does not need a pension, regards it as an embarrassing surplus, has forgotten about a marriage contracted 20 years ago and cannot account for the additional source of income, and where the second party to the marriage needs money desperately and is applying for means-tested benefit, such a case will not be subject to re-examination. That is grotesque and would offend most people's sense of natural justice. However, that will be the precise consequence of an irrevocable pension split. Unless the pension-sharing power is regarded as a reserve power, only to be used explicitly in the interests of justice to achieve a just settlement, it will produce perverse results of this kind. I have no doubt that it will discredit itself in due course, but it may be a long time before we have the opportunity to look at the matter again. Indeed, section 25A has already been discredited in the courts, but it is still impossible to do anything about it. However, this would be a much worse provision, because it would not be revisable in the light of subsequent circumstances&#151;that is the essence of the injustice.
<P>
However, if the Committee accepts our amendment&#151;and I am prepared to bargain either side of the age limit of 40&#151;that would at least limit the damage and abuse, and the extreme cases, such as those that I have described, would not occur. Of course, someone might say that a person aged 41 is still a long way from retirement, and that a settlement based on his or her circumstances at that time could be hideously inappropriate some 20 years later and could not be revised. It could therefore be said that the age limit of 40 does not give adequate protection, and that I should have said 45 or 50. We ought to have a discussion on that because the issue is of key importance.
<P>
We would have been happy to withdraw the amendment, had the Government accepted amendment No. 162. It is only because they pig-headedly refused to do so&#151;confident, no doubt, in their substantial majority&#151;that they now find themselves in this position, where the kind of cases that I have outlined could and will arise, unless something is done. This is Parliament's last chance, apart from Report stage. We have moved on past amendment No. 162, and it is only by limiting the potential damage by tabling amendments of the kind that we are now discussing that we shall ensure that pension splitting adds to the sum of justice and does not, on a net basis, detract from it.

<P>

<B>Mrs. Jacqui Lait (Beckenham):</B> I rise to support the amendment. I approach it from a slightly different angle, which will undoubtedly satisfy the Minister, who has identified two tendencies on the Conservative Front Bench. It is because the Government's proposal has so many different angles that so many problems arise from it.
<P>
The changes in society are such that women now enter the employment market as soon as they have finished their education. They achieve more, both at school and in higher education, than ever before. They therefore have access to a wide range of pension schemes. Despite our desire to ensure that people sign up to a pension scheme early on, the evidence suggests that it is not until about the age of 40 that people focus on their retirement and on how best to provide for it.
<P>
I am completely at one with my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford (Mr. Davies) on the setting of the age limit at 40, although we are quite flexible. Until the age of 40, nobody's pension fund constitutes a substantial sum, because the compound interest has not compounded sufficiently to make it a serious sum. Our proposal has to be set in the context of the society in which we now live.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> There is a sum of money&#151;the cash equivalent transfer value&#151;that will not be great before the pension holder is 40. Nevertheless, that CETV can become a considerable sum and make all the difference to someone in retirement 20 or 30 years later, when compound interest has, as my hon. Friend put it, worked.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I absolutely agree. My point is that practically everyone in the employment market has access to a pension. We believe that the sum of money associated with the Government's stakeholder pension scheme is inadequate, and that the associated interaction with benefits may not make it worthwhile.
<P>
We need to consider how society is structured. In relation to the amendment, the crucial fact is that the needs on divorce, taking children into account, for those aged 40 or younger, are probably less pressing than they were historically. The savings system should not be distorted because of the way in which a marriage may&#151;or may not&#151;work. We want everyone who is working to save for a pension, but for those who are under the age of 40 the need to split a pension is less pressing than it was.
<P>
The British population can be divided into various groups. Some people, who are not in the sort of employment that allows them to save significantly, will rely on the state pension and on its related benefits. Others will take advantage of stakeholder pensions, which are intended for those who earn between &#163;9,000 and &#163;20,000. Will someone in that income band who saves for a pension be able to save sufficiently by the age of 40, and for the subsequent 20 years, to make pension splitting worthwhile at that age? Both partners in a couple are likely to have their own pension. The mega-rich form another group but, frankly, they can sort out their own difficulties, as they always have done.
<P>
We need to consider middle England: the people who want a reasonable pension in their retirement, who seek to provide for themselves and who do not look to the state for support. The tendency in that group is for both partners in a marriage to save for their own pensions&#151;they have been doing so for the past five or 10 years. That is a result of the sheer number of married women who work. Is it fair on society and on a divorcing couple to split a pension at the age of 40, or thereabouts? Both partners are likely to have a pension, and the Pensions Act 1995 raised the retirement age for women to 65, which means that both parties will have another 25 years in which to build up substantial pensions. Pension splitting under the age of 40 is therefore largely unnecessary, it will be extremely costly and it will have very minor effects. That is why I support the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Leigh </B>(Gainsborough): This important amendment seeks to get to the heart of the Bill, which is meant to make a significant difference to the retirement prospects of divorced women in particular.
<P>
The hon. Member for Winchester (Mr. Oaten) took my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford to task. The hon. Gentleman gave an example that he said showed that the amendment was absurd. A person may have married very young, at the age of 19, and may seek a divorce at the age of 39. He would have been married for 20 years, but the schedule would exclude him from the Bill's provisions. That was an interesting intervention, which showed some of the problems under which we are labouring. The hon. Gentleman should be aware of what we are trying to achieve. We want the Government to say what acturial studies they have conducted to provide some idea of the practical effect of the Bill on people who get divorced relatively young or after a relatively short marriage. There is no problem with the legislation as it applies to people who get divorced in their 50s, who have been married for some time and for whom a substantial income fund has been built up.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I accept the hon. Gentleman's strictures. There may be problems with the amendment&#151;and with the earlier amendment No. 162&#151;but I hope that he appreciates the importance of improving the legislation and not fooling the public. The Labour manifesto made great claims for the Bill&#151;new Labour, ``because Britain deserves better''. [hon. Members: ``Hear, hear.''] I thought that that would wake Labour Members from their slumbers. It stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``We believe that all pensioners should share fairly in the increasing prosperity of the nation.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is a wide claim.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mark Oaten </B>(Winchester): I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for flagging up the concern that I raised in a previous sitting. Given that he acknowledges that many different circumstances exist, is not that an argument for avoiding the tight prescriptions of the amendment and allowing the courts to make judgments on individual circumstances? The amendment would preclude the flexibility for which he argues.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> That may be right, but it does not prevent me from using the amendments to make an argument&#151;[Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman makes a reasonable point. As long as he is in order, he can continue to make it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> The argument that I am trying to adduce is not in favour of the amendment. It is an attempt to tease out from the Government exactly what they want to achieve. I mentioned the high-sounding notes that were made by the former Secretary of State in the Labour party manifesto and subsequently, but we now know that things will be different. Those who write new Labour documents are now deeply embedded in Government and advised by civil servants. The Government's response to the Select Committee&#151;months after the heady days of the Labour party manifesto&#151;stated that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``pension sharing is unlikely in itself to transform the income prospects of divorced women in retirement.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I knew that I should not have tempted providence. What has this to do with the age of 40?
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> It has a lot to do with the age of 40. The purpose of the amendment is to try to find out what will be available to women who are divorced before their 40th birthday and whose retirement is therefore many years in the future. What will they achieve through a pension-sharing order? According to the Government's regulatory impact assessment of the Bill&#151;introduced in the House of Commons on 10 February 1999&#151;there will be 180,000 divorces, including nullities, in the UK in the first year after the implementation of the Bill. The Government assume that in 58 per cent. of cases one party to a divorce will have pension rights, which will make pension sharing a possibility. Pension sharing may therefore take place in 100,000 cases. I have not managed to establish how many of such pension-sharing orders will relate to short marriages or marriages that are dissolved before the age of 40.
<P>
This debate goes back a long way. As long ago as 1992, the Goode report attempted to work out the effect of such legislation. Way back in 1993, when the report was published, people were unable to work out what impact the legislation would have on families. The amendment is important because we are discussing not just the regulatory burdens, but what the provision will mean to families. I am sure that the Minister has notes prepared for his response to the amendment, but it is pointless for him to state the obvious and say that the amendment is technically flawed and that the courts must have flexibility. That may be so, but he must try to explain the practical effect of the Bill on ordinary families and ordinary people.
<P>
The Select Committee states on page x that the Government's
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``appraisal understandably focuses on the cost to the pensions industry and the taxpayer, but does not cover the wider economic and social consequences of the proposed legislation. For some years now, politicians and analysts have called for family impact statements to be attached to new parliamentary Bills''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There seems to be no family impact statement attached to the Bill and that is what concerns people. The hon. Member for Croydon, North (Mr. Wicks), who was a member of the Select Committee, wrote a book on the subject, entitled ``A Future for All'', which was published in 1987. In it he called for all such Bills to have family income statements attached to them.
<P>
The Select Committee continued:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``In the absence of detailed social research, using projections based on a range of soundly-based assumptions, there is no way to tell whether the legislation as presented will or will not live up to the former Secretary of State's high hopes. The permissive rather than mandatory approach of the legislation, and the uncertainties of the legal process of divorce, perhaps makes this uncertainty inevitable. Part of the effect of the public debate on the proposed pension sharing legislation will be to give higher profile to the importance of the pensions asset when married couples (and their legal representatives) are contemplating divorce.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In the monumental literature that has been made available to the public, including a very full document published by the Pensions Management Institute on ``Pensions and Divorce''&#151;I have looked through it but have not read it all&#151;there are a few actuarial studies on what will be available to people who have been married for only a short while or will divorce before their 40th birthday.
<P>
The Goode report was published many years ago and makes the point that my hon. Friend made in his opening statement: that there may be particular problems relating to divorce when retirement is many years in advance. The report states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``All that the court can do is to take the value of the pension rights into account when deciding how non-pension assets should be distributed and the amount of any lump sum payment to be awarded (if any). Valuing the pension rights may itself be a difficult task, particularly where the pension is not due to come into payment for many years. The award with an immediate lump sum payment presupposes that the husband has the means to pay it, which may not be the case, while a deferred lump sum payment may raise the valuation problem mentioned above.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The problem of which I am trying to convince the Minister is that whenever we ask questions, he tends to say, ``Well, this has been dealt with,'' and when we ask whether the legislation is necessary, he says, ``Look at the Select Committee report.'' The report may seem full to some Committee members&#151;I sat through all its sittings and I have looked at the report many times&#151;but, given the complexity of the matter, it is a superficial report. There was a limited number of sittings. During the one sitting with the actuaries, they were not asked detailed questions on the impact of the sort of families that will be covered by the amendment. There was a sitting with the National Association of Pension Funds and virtually all the questions related to the charges that professionals will impose on the public.
<P>
I can see that the Minister is now referring to the document. Perhaps he can find the sittings that I have been unable to find, where the actuarial debate was dealt with in detail. That is what worries me about the process and it is why I have previously argued that our debate on this proposal is similar to the House's debate on the Child Support Agency. The Select Committee report once again backs up my view. It states, on page xi:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``There are some parallels to be drawn between pension sharing and child support, in terms of public concern over the ability of the courts to deliver outcomes which look after the individuals concerned while protecting the interests of the taxpayer. Indeed it could be argued that pension sharing has greater long term financial consequences for the individuals stretching ahead for possibly decades of retirement, while child support comes to an end when the children are grown up.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford is seeking to make that point in the amendment. The way that Parliament sought to grapple with child support was complicated enough, but the process that is involved is, in actuarial terms&#151;if one can use that phrase&#151;very simple indeed. You know that children A, B and C are involved, that they are of a certain age and that they will grow up&#151;

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Of course I know that. I chaired the Committee that considered the relevant legislation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> Of course you did, Mr. McWilliam.
<P>
In this context, one is dealing with a matter that is far more complex. We have not discussed that matter adequately, and I am not sure whether anyone has the answer. Someone may get divorced when he is under the age of 40, and his house will continue to rise in value until his retirement in 25 years. The rate of increase in the value of the house is very different from the pension fund's rate of increase. I do not know how to describe that difference in technical terms, but it is difficult to foresee what will happen in that context. We also need to consider the complication of the increased life expectancy of women. These are complex matters, and they have been flagged up by various experts, who tried to advise the Government.
<P>
I hope that the Government will not dismiss the amendment by saying, ``It is technically flawed and makes no sense. We should leave the matter to the courts.'' High hopes have been stoked up about the legislation, but how will the Bill deal with short marriages and marriages that end before the partners reach the age of 40? How will those high hopes be fulfilled in that context?
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Department of Social Security (Mr. Stephen Timms):</B> I welcome you back, Mr. McWilliam, to our deliberations. We are pleased that the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford is back in good voice and restored to full vigour. I also welcome back the hon. Members for Canterbury (Mr. Brazier) and for Arundel and South Downs (Mr. Flight), who had other parliamentary business last week. I believe that the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs was in Hong Kong. We are pleased that they are back where they should be: in the Committee discussing this important piece of legislation.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Member for Canterbury was with me. I hope that the Minister will not criticise him for being away&#151;if he does, he would also be criticising me.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> No criticism was intended of anyone, least of all you, Mr. McWilliam.
<P>
While you were away, Mr. McWilliam, we spent an interesting day on Thursday discussing the schedule. We have already been reminded this morning that there is a great rift among Conservative Members on the question of pension sharing. The hon. Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh) said that he was against pension sharing, the hon. Member for Beckenham (Mrs. Lait) said that she was in favour of it, and the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford adopted a third way&#151;he said that he was against it, but that he would not vote against it.
<P>
The amendment is clearly a result of the Gainsborough tendancy. It would prevent a former spouse in England and Wales who was under the age of 40 from benefiting from a pension-splitting order. It would institutionalise such age discrimination. No reason worth more than a moment's consideration has been advanced in support of the amendment, which would effectively prevent pension sharing in rather more than half of all divorce cases. That is clearly a good thing from the Gainsborough standpoint, if we want to do what we can to reduce, limit and undermine pension sharing, but it completely contradicts the position taken by the hon. Member for Beckenham. The hon. Lady gave the Committee a convoluted account of why she will vote for the amendment. I did not think that it was a convincing explanation&#151;I shall return to that in a moment&#151;but the amendment is wholly contradictory to the argument that she put forward.
<P>
On Thursday, the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford proposed two arguments in favour of the amendment. First, he said that it would be undesirable to split a small pension fund accumulated by a younger person. Several responses could be made to that, but as I said to the hon. Gentleman on Thursday, the amendment says nothing at all about the age of the spouse whose pension is being split. That person could be 58, the age cited by the hon. Gentleman as the perfect pension-splitting age, but the amendment says nothing about that. It refers only to the age of the person who will be the beneficiary of the split. So that argument is irrelevant to the amendment that we are discussing.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Secondly, the hon. Gentleman suggested that pension splitting was unnecessary because someone who gets divorced under 40 would have plenty of time in which to build up his or her pension without having a share of the ex-spouse's pension. That is the argument with which the hon. Member for Beckenham had some sympathy, but it is nonsense. Someone who gets divorced when they are under 40 could easily have spent 10 years out of employment bringing up children, and might need to spend many more years out of employment for the same reason&#151;exactly the sort of person that pension sharing should help. It is possible to think of people who would be covered by the amendment but for whom pension sharing would not be appropriate. However, in exercising its powers to make a financial settlement, the court is already required to consider the ages of the parties and the duration of the marriage.
<P>
Pension sharing will not be mandatory. We have already referred this morning to the helpful example given by the hon. Member for Winchester, who said that someone who married and started a family at the age of 19 could have spent 20 years out of employment, with no chance of building up a pension, and yet be excluded from pension sharing by the amendment. What justification is there for that? None has been given to the Committee.
<P>
This morning, the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford came up with a new argument to the effect that it is difficult to foresee someone's financial circumstances 20 years ahead, when the pension will be paid. That is an interesting argument, worth a little more reflection than the arguments he put forward on Thursday. However, it is possible to put a value on a pension fund at a given time, and that is the value that should be taken into account in the divorce settlement. Indeed, it already should be taken into account.
<P>
It seems to me that the hon. Gentleman was really arguing against the whole idea of clean break divorce settlements. He was arguing that someone should keep under review the financial circumstances of the former partners. Some might do better than others&#151;one might go on to a highly successful career and another might become very hard up&#151;but there should be some mechanism for reviewing and readjusting the pension settlement in subsequent years in order to take account of the parties' changing financial circumstances.
<P>
I should be most surprised if Opposition Members wanted to pursue that argument very far. The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford is saying that we should go back to the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 and change the way in which it makes possible a clean break settlement on divorce.
<P>
The hon. Member for Beckenham told the Committee that practically everyone is covered by a pension. Would that that were true! Thankfully, as a consequence of the Bill, from 2001, stakeholder pensions will make funded pension scheme provision more widely available. Many people will continue to spend time out of employment to raise children. It is wrong for the Opposition, who want to change the tax rules to make it easier for people to stay at home to bring up children, to argue that those people do not need additional provision. Many people will not be able to contribute to their own pension.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> The Minister may have missed what I said in parenthesis about how we need to take children into account. The Chairman would have called me to order had I discussed the next group of amendments, which deals with children. My argument is that about 80 per cent. of married women work. We need to deal with society as it exists today and how it will be, according to demographic projections. We should not look to the society of yesterday.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The hon. Lady is right&#151;about 70 per cent. of married women are in work, which is nearly as high as the proportion of men in work. The amendment would ban pension sharing for anyone under 40, irrespective of whether a person has child care responsibilities. The hon. Lady is hinting that she does not agree with the nature of the amendment. Indeed, there seems to be dissent among Opposition Members. The amendment would make it impossible for a pension to be shared for the benefit of someone under 40 who was out of employment to bring up children.
<P>
Of those seven out of 10 married women who are in work, a number are in part-time work. It is likely that they are not able to contribute to a decent funded pension, which they will need to have access to when they retire. It is important that pension sharing is available to them and that there is no arbitrary age cut-off below which it will not be available.
<P>
The hon. Member for Gainsborough asked for further information on the Government's assumptions about costs and our actuarial expectations. He attacked the Select Committee's report as being superficial. That surprised me. I looked quickly through the report as he was speaking to see whether there was any indication that he dissented from it or said that it had done a poor job in carrying out its work properly. His suggestion was the first that I have heard that the report was other than thorough and useful. I can see nothing in it to indicate his dissent from the report's findings.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> This is a ridiculous point on a serious issue. I said that I sat through every sitting of the Committee. Select Committees comprise a group of Members of Parliament. We had five or six sittings and each person was in front of us for only two hours. The report was necessarily superficial because, as the Minister knows, we do not have the Government's resources. But with all the vast resources that they can bring to the problem, they have failed to give us a family impact assessment of what the provision will mean to the hundreds of thousands of people who will divorce in the next 20 or 30 years. Let us forget the partisan rubbish and get to the guts of the Bill.

<P>

<B>Mr. Timms:</B> It was not me who attacked the report; it was the hon. Gentleman. It is important to defend the Select Committee, which made a valuable contribution that has been widely welcomed. Its work helped us to make important improvements to the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chris Pond </B>(Gravesham): I want to underline my hon. Friend's point. Does he recognise that the role of the Select Committee, which of course does not have the Government's resources, is to hear detailed evidence from people working in the industry who will be directly affected? We should put on record the importance of a Select Committee considering a Bill for the first time in draft. That was ground-breaking stuff.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We should return to the terms of the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> My hon. Friend makes an important point with which I agree.
<P>
In such a process, which involves technical measures, it is worthwhile to take account of a wide range of views and evidence. The hon. Member for Gainsborough says that data have not been provided, but I am not sure what data he is seeking. I refer him to annex B of the consultation document, which contains the regulatory proposal and sets out some of the underlying figures and assumptions.
<P>
Decisions on pension shares will not be taken on the basis of a mechanical formula or a series of actuarial assumptions, but by the courts on the basis of circumstances relating to specific cases. That process will differ significantly from the system introduced in child support legislation&#151;the Standing Committee for which you chaired, Mr. McWilliam&#151;which is not court-based. The misgivings of the hon. Member for Gainsborough about the process are therefore ill founded. Under the Bill, courts will have complete discretion when deciding on the fairest method of division of assets.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> The Minister does not need to refer me to the document: I have it in front of me and I have quoted from it.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It is not in order to intervene during an intervention.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> From the photocopy that the hon. Gentleman is waving, I am having some difficulty working out which document he is referring to. I think that he is referring to the Government's written response to the Select Committee report, but if I am wrong, he will doubtless tell me. I am referring to the consultation document.
<P>
We intend that couples and courts should be able to deal with pension rights in a way that will provide for the fairest overall settlement. Removing the option of pension sharing from more than half of all divorce cases cannot advance that goal. In passing, the Committee may like to note that the Opposition proposed no such restriction in Scotland. I urge the Opposition to withdraw the amendment; if it is pressed to a vote, the Committee should firmly reject it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> I am seriously worried that the Minister has spent insufficient time mugging up on family law. His comments on the advantages of clean breaks were wildly inappropriate. We are all aware of their potential advantages, but the very essence of the clean break is that there is a trade-off between it and the reaching of a just settlement. The Minister seems not to recognise that trade-off and has therefore failed to understand the fundamental principle of family law. If you want to enjoy the advantages of a clean break&#151;
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I have enjoyed the advantages of a clean break.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> If one wants to enjoy the advantages of a clean break, through which one never again has to deal with one's former partner or his or her lawyers, one must relinquish flexibility and the ability to look again at that settlement. The clean break is often inappropriate if there are children, who may subsequently have needs that cannot be taken into account as a result of it. There is always a trade-off between getting the most just settlement over time between the parties and a clean break. It is worrying that the Minister does not seem to have understood that there are no absolutes here.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Minister also misunderstood something else. He said that there was no difficulty in putting a value on a pension, when the beneficiary of a pension split was under 40. That is a complete misunderstanding. There is no difficulty, technically, in putting a valuation on any pension, however long it has been held. That is what the cash equivalent transfer value is about, and we can consider other methodologies if necessary. Putting a value on a pension is not the issue. It is whether one can fairly decide to make an irrevocable split of a pension more than 20 years before it some into payment, when one cannot anticipate the circumstances of the parties 20 or 30 years thence. If one has to take the pension into account in the divorce settlement, would an earmarking order not be preferable to pension splitting? That is the issue that the Minister has entirely evaded.
<P>
The Minister said that our amendment would exclude more than half of all divorces from pension sharing. I almost thought, at that point, that I should revise my intention of not putting the amendment to the vote, because such a result would be a major relief to those of us who care about justice in this country. The chances of a miscarriage of justice with pension splitting are considerable, in particular because the earlier protections that we tried to introduce have not been accepted by the Committee. To get rid, at a stroke, of more than 50 per cent. of the potential impact of pension splitting might constitute a good day for justice. That is especially so when that 50 per cent. would involve beneficiaries so far removed from the time when they would begin to enjoy the income given to them by the courts, that it would be impossible to know whether they would really need the income by that time, or whether the other party might have needed it more and would have more justly retained it.
<P>
The Minister's characterisation of three views from the Conservative party is not correct. Pension splitting is a dangerous, problematic and dubious power, if used in the normal course of events and if it is to become an automatic response of the courts. It is irresponsible of the Government to introduce it before they have thought through their views on ancillary relief and before we know the results of the Lord Chancellor's review of that relief. It is also irresponsible to introduce pension splitting before we know whether the Government are going to introduce legal provisions to recognise prenuptial agreements. In all these circumstances, the Government have, once again, not thought through what they are doing. We are worried that the powers could be used extremely unjustly, in all sorts of cases.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough was right to remind the Committee of what happened with the Child Support Agency, where a completely inappropriate, formulaic approach was used to split incomes between parties. That was in the short term&#151;the income split had immediate effect&#151;and did not affect pensions. How much more injustice is likely to be done under these provisions, especially in the case of the younger people with whom my amendment is designed to deal?
<P>
We failed to persuade the Committee to accept amendment No. 162, which would have done the trick. As I started out by saying, I am not happy with the alternative approach of targeted protections, which inevitably involve crude distinctions and arbitrary limits, and with which we should not clutter the statute book. It would be better for us to express our view by voting against the schedule and not to press the amendment. Otherwise, if we win the vote, we will put on the statute book a provision that does not represent the right way of dealing with this difficult problem.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> The Minister had an opportunity to be a statesman this morning, but he decided not to take that line. He decided narrowly to reject the amendment. As my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford explained, this is a probing amendment, which we hoped would tease out of the Government exactly what they thought would be the impact of the provision on couples whose retirement was many years in advance. Incidentally, I think that we are quoting from the same source. I am quoting from the regulatory impact assessment of the Welfare Reform and Pensions Bill. It is true that it extends over more than two pages, but only two pages at the end deal with the impact on families. That research does not seem to be adequate.
<P>
I want to cut through the debate by putting the Minister in the place of a judge, dealing with a couple aged 39 whose retirement is 25 years away. At the moment, the law is clear and it was summed up well many years ago in the Goode report, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``All that the court can do is to take the value of the pension rights into account when deciding how non-pension assets should be distributed and the amount of any lump sum payment to be awarded.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>I am sure that the Minister will agree that that is easy for the court to work out because it can consider the value of the assets of the people who are divorcing at age 39. It can consider the house, the children and the value of the pension rights that have already accrued and distribute the assets fairly. I might be entirely wrong about this, but, as a lawyer&#151;admittedly, not a family lawyer&#151;I am trying to put myself in the situation of a judge in the court room, who is trying to deal with a difficult situation. If the judge is dealing with a situation that is clear from the papers before him, he can work out the settlement exactly. He knows how many children are involved, how long the marriage lasted, and the value of the house. He also takes into account&#151;the value of any other assets accrued, including the pension. What slightly worries me about the task that will face the judge&#151;perhaps the Minister will help me with this&#151;is that he will have to consider something that will continue for many years into the future.
<P>
I expect that the Minister will jump up and say that that is not difficult because the judge will know how much has accrued so far in the pension. However, if I were a judge, I am not sure that I would think that that was a fair approach. The judge is trying to offset different assets that will increase differently over the years. The house will go up by a certain amount; the pension could increase by more or by less, and the judge is trying to be fair. I would have thought that that was a difficult task, but that is the task that the Bill will impose on judges. It is relatively easy to work things out when the couple have been married for a long time, but when retirement is 25 years in the future, it is a difficult task.
<P>
The Minister keeps referring&#151;because it is a jolly point that makes us all laugh&#151;to the Gainsborough position, the Beckenham position and the Grantham position, which is a bit of party-political fun, but this is a serious matter. As became clear from the evidence presented to the Select Committee, lawyers have no expertise in such matters. Judges have not received any adequate training&#151;Lord Justice Thorpe admitted that to the Select Committee. As a result of the Bill, a small solicitor in a country town will have to deal not only with the difficult emotional aspects of divorce, but highly complex actuarial matters, which not a single Committee member understands in any depth. I did not claim that the Select Committee wanted to be superficial. My point is that if 11 politicians are given only five sittings to investigate such a matter, and to interview five sets of people, they will only scratch the surface.
<P>
It was clear from the word go that the amendments were probing&#151;the hon. Member for Winchester made that clear with his intervention. Instead of using the Committee to explain to the public how such provisions will work in practice, the Minister merely stated that the amendment was impractical. That is a pity.

<P>

<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I shall respond briefly to the hon. Gentleman's points. I have never been a lawyer of any description, so I shall not attempt to imagine myself in the role of a judge. The hon. Gentleman is right to say that in making decisions the court will have to make fine and difficult judgements, but that is already the case. A decision on which member of a divorcing couple takes the house is not purely financial&#151;it depends on where the children will be, for instance. Difficult judgements already have to be made. The Bill provides a further degree of flexibility to enable a fairer settlement to be made. In paragraph 7 of the memorandum submitted to the Select Committee by Mr. Martin Pointer QC, he states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``If the proposed changes are made, it is likely that the division of all the resources will become more even.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is what we aim to achieve. Difficult judgements must still be made&#151;that will always be the case. The question is who should make them. We believe that the courts should make those decisions on the basis of being able to achieve a fair and even division of the resources. That is the purpose of the clause.
<P>
I hope that the Committee will agree that that is a sensible and fair way forward.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I shall put the question, That the amendment be made&#151;
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> Aye.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford did not seem to press the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> Another complexion seems to have been put on the matter. The Minister voted for my amendment. I assume that he made a slip of the tongue when he did so. If that is the case, I should like to revert to my original stated intention of not moving the amendment.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The hon. Gentleman has already moved the amendment. He can only withdraw it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Davies:</B> This is an enormously important group of amendments because they all deal with children. The outstanding deformity of this extraordinary Bill is that, although it includes clause after clause on pension splitting&#151;following the documents that were produced last summer&#151;children are not mentioned. The Secretary of State's foreword, which I quoted at the beginning of the Committee, does not mention children. The pensioner-sharing clauses do not mention children.
<P>
When I made that point earlier, the Minister said, less than scrupulously, that there was such a reference elsewhere in the Bill in a different context. That shows how guilty the Government feel about that astonishing omission. The Conservative party believes that children are the most important aspect of the provision. It is one thing to provide a framework of civil law under which those who wish to contract marriages, and then perhaps divorces, can obtain justice, but we are creating a framework within which adults can litigate against each other. The vital task of any legislature is to protect those who cannot be protected and those for whom all of us in this place have a fiduciary responsibility&#151;children. The Government's outstanding failure is their omission even to address that important aspect of divorce and the consequences of pension splitting. It is disgraceful and I shall listen with interest to hear how they apologise for such an omission.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Let me take the Committee through the amendments which, in your wisdom, Mr. McWilliam, you have rightly decided to group together. We are amending two schedules in one group of amendments, including one schedule that we have not yet come to. That should not cause too much difficulty, although we may have to leaf backwards and forwards among our papers.
<P>
Amendment No. 77 would make an addition to schedule 3, which contains the meat of the pension splitting and pension sharing concept and sets out the essential policy enshrined in this part of the Bill. It is important that one of the main principles, which is so visibly absent, should be re-inserted in its proper place in the schedule. Amendment No. 77 would add, at the bottom of page 70 of the Bill, a new subsection (2D):
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``No pension sharing order shall be made which is materially contrary to the interests of any child of the family, or any other child of either of the parties.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is a clear statement of principle. If the Committee accepts it, as I trust it will, it will have to guide the courts so that whenever they decide whether there should be pension sharing or a pension split, they will consider whether that will disadvantage any child.
<P>
For the purpose of this amendment, it is important to emphasise that any child of either of the parties, or a child of the family, would have his or her interests taken into account under the clause. It would not refer only to a child of the family; it would include children who may be born to previous or subsequent relationships in or out of wedlock. It is important to make that clear because the Conservative party believes that people should have responsibility to their children and that that responsibility is sacred and applies irrespective of the relationship from which the child sprang and whether or not the relationship was formalised by a ceremony of marriage.
<P>
I turn to schedule 4, to which amendments Nos. 182, 183 and 184 refer. Amendment No. 182 would insert into subsection (5):
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``(c) after the words `for the benefit of the other party' there is added `or a child of the family'''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Amendments Nos. 183 and 184 are consequential amendments to schedule 4. Amendment No. 183 would delete and replace paragraph 2(2) on page 73. Amendment No. 184 would replace paragraph 2(3). The material change is contained in new paragraph 2(3)(iii), which reads:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``after the words `to the other party' there is added `or to a child of the family'''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We are providing for an earmarking order to be made in favour not merely of a party to the marriage or the former marriage, but of a child of the marriage. We have not extended that to a child from a different marriage or relationship, because it would be inappropriate to use a divorce to establish an order in favour of a child who is not related to the marriage and therefore not directly affected by the court's involvement in its break-up. That is the distinction.
<P>
Amendment No. 77 may be technically inadequate because I have, as usual, drafted it myself. No doubt the Minister's civil servants and parliamentary draftsmen will find something wrong with it. However, I accepted the kind offer of Mr. Nicholas Mostyn QC, who is a leading barrister at the matrimonial Bar, to draft amendments Nos. 182, 183 and 184 on a pro bono basis. I want to make that clear, first, because I do not want to frighten my bank manager, in case he is listening, and, secondly, because if people work pro bono for the House and its Standing Committees, it deserves to be acknowledged. I pay tribute to Mr. Nicholas Mostyn but of course, I take full responsibility for the theme and policy behind the amendments. I think that my hon. Friends would support me on that.
<P>
Why are the amendments important? Pension splitting and pension sharing can involve a substantial change in the allocation of capital and revenues within a family. There is a potential for a substantial share of limited resources in a family to be moved from one party to the other. It is vital, as a matter of principle, that the interests of children, which are at risk, be fully protected and taken into account. That is the prime purpose of our amendments, particularly amendment No. 77, which sets a general principle. I hope that the Government, who have shamefully not addressed the issue of children, will accept it.
<P>
The amendments are also important because, without them, I can envisage many circumstances in which children would be the losers. If a man who has divorced his first wife, by whom he has children&#151;or if she has died&#151;remarries fairly near to retirement, the family may find itself with young children as retirement approaches.
<P>
The second relationship might end in divorce, and the divorcing partner&#151;the ex-spouse&#151;might demand, and receive, a substantial pension share. The party with custody of the children might largely depend on his or her pension in retirement, and if that pension, or a large part of it&#151;perhaps one half&#151;were no longer available, there would be a massive reduction in the children's prospects, including their living standards and their opportunities in life.
<P>
I want to quantify my example. A first marriage, in which there were children of two or three years old, might end with the death of a wife, when the husband was 50. He might enter into a second marriage, which ended in divorce when he was 58 or 59. That second divorce might be the occasion of a pension split, and the children, who would be aged 10, 11 or 12, would still require the help and support of their parents. The continuation of their education might depend on such support. The party who benefits from the pension split may not be the party who has custody of the children, and the party who has custody of the children might find himself or herself in retirement with a standard of living that was perhaps half of what it would otherwise have been, which would have a devastating effect on the children.
<P>
People might say, ``Surely the courts could not run away from the children in such circumstances,'' but the Government have not thought about that possibility. Lawyers could&#151;and no doubt will&#151;argue in relation to pension splitting that the Bill contains no provisions relating to the children, and that there is therefore no reason why they should be taken into account. I refer to the Bill, of course, as it would be if my amendment were not added to it&#151;I have not abandoned the hope that the Committee will be persuaded of the need for the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Oaten:</B> I am sympathetic to the hon. Gentleman's point. In the scenario that he described, what impact would the Child Support Agency have? Would it assess the support that was needed for the children, and could it take account of the matters that he mentioned?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> That is an inadequate solution. The CSA does not normally take up cases unless the party who would benefit from a CSA order is receiving benefit. The Conservative party does not think that the children's interests should be protected only if one of the parents is receiving benefit&#151;that would be absurd. In the great majority of cases, people do not receive benefit, and&#151;quite rightly&#151;the CSA would not be involved. Moreover, the CSA's main function is to retrieve, on behalf of taxpayers, money that was paid in benefit for children from a parent who was able to support the children but who did not do so voluntarily.
<P>
The anomaly that the Bill will create&#151;unless the amendment is accepted&#151;is almost the exact reverse of that situation. A parent might want to support a child, but money might be taken away from him or her and given to someone else, irrespective of the fact that he or she had custody of the child. The CSA is meant to reassign cash or incomes in favour of the parent with custody&#151;or with care, as the CSA calls it&#151;and against the so-called ``absent parent'', to borrow the rather unpleasant phrase that the CSA uses. However, the Bill will have precisely the reverse effect. It will run the risk that cash will be transferred away from the parent with care. Such cash flows are important and take into account the interests of children. I have given one example and one could think of others involving children born out of wedlock. Amendment No. 77 would cover such cases.
<P>
Whether through the imposition of a court order or through other, less formal means, courts should not create difficulties for people who cannot make payments from pensions. We do not want people to regard their parental obligations as beginning and ending with court orders and orders from executive agencies such as the CSA. They should provide for their children as best they can automatically, willingly and from a sense of affection. We do not want pension splits to prevent parents from providing for natural children born out of wedlock. Our amendments would deal with that concern.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Government also show little sign of having thought through cases where custody changes between parents. As I argued in respect of the previous amendment, the irreversibility of pension splitting is central to its potential for injustice and is germane to pension splitting as a whole. There is a clear conflict between the irreversibility of pension splitting and the reversibility of custody orders. Courts will sometimes grant custody of the children of a divorced or divorcing spouse to one party, only to discover later that it is necessary to grant custody to the other parent, perhaps at the behest of the children. Often it is in the children's interests that such a change is made. The parent who was initially granted custody may behave in a dubious fashion or embark on a relationship with a partner with whom the children do not get along. Alternatively, violence, abuse and so forth may occur. Such things are horrible to contemplate, but we must accept that they happen.
<P>
Therefore, it is vital that no custody order should be irrevocable and no one has ever suggested that such an order should be. However, where a custody order does indeed need to be altered or revoked and the main cash available to the family is the pension, the making irrevocable of a pension-splitting order might, for no just reason, result in the immiseration of the children. That is the appalling and perverse consequence that you face as a result of this unthinking legislation.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. All of my children are grown up.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Because of the Government's failure to think through the consequences of their legislation, one faces the prospect of that appallingly perverse impact. It is the role of this Committee to think through such potential conflicts and that is precisely what we are doing.
<P>
On the ``Today'' programme this morning, reference was made to Families Need Fathers, an organisation that gave evidence to the Select Committee during its examination of the legislative proposals. The case was cited of child, for whom I felt enormously sorry, who spent 100 hours at a series of hearings to have the custody arrangements altered. Goodness knows what the legal costs were&#151;perhaps Families Need Fathers paid them. If it did, that was a noble gesture. The child was originally assigned to the mother and for good reasons desperately wanted to live with the father. Let us suppose that the father had just retired, was unable to find another job&#151;it is difficult for many people to find another job at the age of 60&#151;and was dependent on his pension. Let us suppose that his pension would have been a perfectly reasonable source of income on which to look after the child who is devoted to his father, but the father was unable to accept custody. In that case, the father was able to take custody, but a father might find such a situation difficult. Then the child would be completely broken hearted and betwixt and between because it could not live with the parent with whom it wanted to live and it was unsatisfactory to live with the other parent, but the pension split in favour of the mother could not be unwound. However, it could have been unwound if it was an earmarking order&#151;a point that I made in another context.
<P>
If one is to introduce irrevocable pension splits&#151;it must be clear to the Committee by now that the Opposition have grave doubts and anxieties at the prospect&#151;it is at least vital that the interests of the child are protected. It is unnecessary to think through too many individual examples to decide whether to accept or reject the amendment. We can all draw examples from our personal experience or from the experience of friends or constituents, or we can invent abstract examples. The important question is are we going to ensure that there is an unambiguous principle in law that the interests of children must be taken account of, or are we not?
<P>
However, the Government do not want to hear about children. They might be embarrassed about what I said this morning and now say, ``Oh, but children are covered somewhere else'', or ``We would have thought about children, but . . .'', or ``We will do it in regulations''. They always offer such post facto justifications, but that is simply not good enough. I do not mind if the amendment is tautologous; it is important to remove any ambiguity about the need for the court to recognise the interests of children and carefully to think through the consequences for children before proceeding on the irrevocable course of splitting pension assets.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howard Flight </B>(Arundel and South Downs): I urge the Government to accept the amendment without going into a more detailed discussion of the principles. As my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford said, the proposals are essentially the brainchild of Nicholas Mostyn QC. I should like to read a paragraph that sets out his experience and illustrates why the amendment is necessary. He says,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``When representing a wife I negotiated a settlement whereby the wife and the children of the family secured a proportion of the husband's death in service benefit. My opponent and I were then surprised to discover that there is no power in ss 25C and D Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 to make ear-marking orders in favour of children! This is absurd.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Bill provides a useful opportunity to insert that which is currently omitted, and which lawyers are astounded to discover has been missed out of preceding law. From a practical point of view, there is a growing tendency towards serial marriages and, therefore, an increase in the number of children who are likely to be directly affected by the fact that one parent's source of income&#151;more generally the father's&#151;is a pension. Therefore, when serial marriages end, children's rights to the pension income must be looked after.
<P>
As has already been said, amendment No. 77 is an amendment of principle. Amendments Nos. 182 to 184 contain the enabling proposals which would ensure that earmarking could relate to children. I have no doubt that it is common sense to leave it to the courts to decide how such powers should be used and to establish precedents, but we all know that it is the children who invariably suffer most on divorce. It is extraordinary that the law should so far have omitted to take account of their interests. Where we are&#151;with mixed views across the House&#151;moving towards earmarking between husband and wife on divorce, there seems to be every reason to include the children. On a point that is of slightly less direct relevance, in a wider context on divorce, the case for some form of first call on the assets of the parents to look after the interests of the children has much wider applicability. It is meaningless for the Bill to deal only with the children of married parents whose relationship falls apart. For pension sharing to be effective in today's world, subsequent legislation would need to include the breakdown of partnerships other than legal marriages, where the interests of children needed to be looked after.
<P>
Whatever the theories, I urge the Government to accept the amendments, which are advised as necessary by leading lawyers in family and matrimonial law, as there is at present no enabling statutory power to deal with the interests of the children, when one or both parents wish their interests to be so addressed.
<P>
[Mrs. Joan Humble in the Chair.]
<P>
<B>Mr. Julian Brazier </B>(Canterbury): I welcome you to the Chair Mrs. Humble.
<P>
I was grateful to Mr. McWilliam for giving the Government the opportunity, which they embraced, to withdraw any aspersions against himself and me for our duties on the Select Committee on Defence last week. I was sorry to miss this Committee as a result of my attendance there.
<P>
I cannot support my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford strongly enough in stressing the extraordinary lacuna in the Bill, which has led to so little interest in children when considering pension splitting. The amendments before us are critical. The Minister might argue that amendment No. 77&#151;the most important of them&#151;is too sweeping and all-embracing. In that case, there is nothing to stop him from taking it away and at least empowering the courts to take account of the interests of children, even if he is not happy with the exact wording. The interests of children are very important in this matter.
<P>
[Mr. McWilliam, in the Chair.]
<P>
I am delighted that you are back in the Chair, Mr. McWilliam, because I was about to observe that it is unlikely&#151;for reasons that I understand&#151;that you will allow a debate on schedule stand part.
<P>
I hope that it is in order for me to say that I should have liked to have been able to table an amendment saying that the Bill should take account of conduct in pension splitting, including conduct towards children, along the lines of the amendments that my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford and I moved successfully during consideration of the Family Law Bill&#151;amendments that received considerable support from the Labour Benches. I would like to have seen such an amendment. There is a conduct aspect to these amendments, to which I shall return in a moment.
<P>
There is no doubt that pensions are extremely relevant to children. The first boss for whom I worked, more than 20 years ago, retired in his early 50s with no less than five children. It might be argued that in his case the pension was not important because he was snapped up by the European Commission just after retiring and acquired an enormous salary, hugely in excess of the generous pension on which he had retired.
<P>
None the less, there are many cases of people who retire with large pensions in their early 50s&#151;I received a telephone call about one this morning, I do not know what the gentleman's family arrangements were, but in many such cases there are children who are still of an age at which they need support. My former boss is still married, as is the gentleman to whom I was talking this morning. However, if a couple divorce some years ahead of their early 50s, the father&#151;and, perhaps, but less commonly, the mother&#151;will have a substantial part of his capital assets at the point of divorce, and his income not long afterwards, is his pension fund. Typically in this country, pension rights are a couple's second largest asset. In some countries where house prices are lower, it is common for the pension asset to be the largest asset in a family. That is particularly important when children are involved, yet they have been omitted from the provision.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
	I said earlier that conduct is indirectly important in the amendments. I am disappointed that I cannot speak directly to an amendment on conduct, but we must be clear why conduct is relevant. In the vast majority of marriages the pension assets of the husband are greater than those of the wife. I do not want to return to our debates on the Family Law Bill&#151;you would rightly stop me immediately if I did, Mr. McWilliam&#151;but, sadly, the courts are strongly biased in favour of the mother. The pension arrangements are most likely to be relevant to the interests of the children when custody is awarded to the father&#151;that is, when the courts have decided against the normal practice of awarding custody to the mother&#151;or, even more importantly, as my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford said, when custody is initially given to the mother but the court decides some years later to award it to the father.
<P>
I shall give two brief examples. One was a case in my constituency in which a farm worker's three children kept running away from the wife and the court eventually had to reconsider the custody arrangements. The other concerned a journalist and custody was awarded to the wife because the children had been been beaten up. Four years later, the court recognised that the mother, not the father, was beating the children. Under the Bill&#151;if the Minister rejects the amendments&#151;the pension arrangements would have been split with no account being taken of the children's interests. The husband would suddenly have found himself supporting his children, having written off half of his pension fund to his wife at the point of the split. In at least one of those cases, it is likely that the pension assets would have become a substantial part of the husband's income while the children were still being cared for by the father.
<P>
I do not believe that the Minister wants to exclude children from the courts' consideration, but that is what the Bill does. I understand the technical objections that they will raise to amendment No. 77, as it is all embracing. The Government's draftsmen could produce a watered-down version of the amendment and the various amendments grouped with it. That would allow the courts a serious opportunity to exercise discretion where the interests of children are concerned. The most common case would be that where the children stayed with the father or where custody has to be remade to the father after a number of years, as in those constituency cases that I mentioned.
<P>
I want to make another&#151;possibly redundant&#151;economic point. We live in a country in which working patterns are changing. This group of amendments would have been relevant at any time in the past few years, but they will become even more relevant. Working patterns are becoming much more fragmented. People such as the gentleman to whom I spoke on the phone&#151;I do not cast any aspersions on his marital circumstances&#151;who have opted for one reason or another to leave a career that they have followed for 30 years, take their pension and do another job for a much lower income, on the basis that a pension is available from their 50th birthday, are becoming more and more common. From a capital and income angle, pension factors are becoming more and more important to people further and further down the age scale. As such, they are becoming more and more important to a larger and larger number of people who are likely to be supporting children.
<P>
For that reason, I must congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford on moving the amendment. I am disappointed that no mention is made of conduct, to which further attention should be given. Whatever objections Ministers may have to the detail of the amendments, the Committee must be told what the Government will do about children in pension-splitting arrangements.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I do not wish to repeat the general and excellent points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury. To save the Committee's time, I shall adopt them en bloc.
<P>
I want to deal with one detail of the legislation that has not been dealt with so far, at least not in depth&#151;Mesher orders. They are in interesting part of the debate about children. For those who do not know about such orders, they apply to divorces where children are involved and where the sale of the matrimonial home is postponed until the children are grown up. In such cases, the court takes account of the fact that children are involved and decides to leave the children in the home with the ex-wife. The final division of resources is left until later.
<P>
As a result of the Bill, those orders&#151;which have declined in popularity in recent years&#151;might become more popular. Instead of the current sterotype of the husband getting the pension and the wife getting the home; it could become far more common for husband and wife to share in the proceeds of the sale of the home, but not until the children are grown up.
<P>
The Select Committee made a detailed inquiry into Mesher orders. The point was stretched by the Economic Secretary to the Treasury, who was then only a Member of Parliament and a member of the Committee. As she now occupies such an important position, the Minister must bow down before her superior power in such matters. In point 12, she told the Minister of State, Department of Health, the hon. Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr. Denham):
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``I would simply want to observe that I think there is a very real problem with the clean break principle where there are children, where there is not and should not be a clean break between parents and children and that will have financial implications that of course we totally accepted as a Government in the Child Support Act.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The hon. Lady is an Australian, or she may be a former Australian, and she displayed her knowledge of Australia to the Select Committee. In point 97, she said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``I think that is correct in the case of Australia but on this issue of the priority of providing a family home for the children, now that we are introducing additional powers for the courts on pension sharing, several of us are concerned about the situation where the wife gets the family home in order that she can provide a home for the children and following the clean break principle she gets that outright, that will now be balanced against the capital value of the pension, so you can imagine the situation where the wife gets the home, the husband gets the pension. At the point 15 years later on, 20 years later on when the children have all grown up and left home, the home may be quite a liability to the wife.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I hope that the Minister will respond to that interesting point.
<P>
That matter was also discussed by Mr. Martin Pointer. The Minister has mentioned two or three times paragraph 7 of Mr. Pointer's evidence to the Select Committee, which appears on page 51 of the Select Committee report. He said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``If a wife is to share in the pension fund, it may be that her retention of the matrimonial home until the children are adult will be directed, but subject then to sale and payment of a portion to the husband at that time (a Mesher order), rather than an outright transfer.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He dealt with that matter in more detail later, when he said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Many husbands will say, `I quite accept the children should be properly housed or that they should remain living in this particular house during their minority, but that should not lead to the complete loss by me in the share of that property which I have built up over many years of hard work.'''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The matter was the subject of two contrasting points of view, from Fairshares and from Families Need Fathers. In point 503 on page 104 of the Select Committee report, I asked the representative from Fairshares:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Are you in favour of Mesher orders which can be used to postpone the sale of the house until the children are grown up?''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Mrs. Quin replied:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Very much so, yes. In fact, I would like to take that further''&#151;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and she raised an interesting new point that we have not so far discussed. She said that she wanted to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``suggest that if the wife was going to be allowed to stay in the house until the youngest child has completed full-time education, then there will be a valuation put on the house. Now it seemed to me that this would be a very sensible time also to value the pension, so you are getting a contemporary evaluation of the two main assets.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I shall pause there for a moment. I hope that the Minister paid attention to that interesting point, which was made by the representative from Fairshares. Her suggestion returns me to my earlier remarks, when I suggested that the Minister should put himself in the place of a judge. How would he work out the value of a house in 20 years' time and what would be the value of the pension at that date? Mrs. Quin suggested that one should delay the pension-splitting order until the Mesher order has come into effect&#151;that is, until the children have grown up. One could split the pension and the house when all the children are over 18. That is an interesting idea. Mrs. Quin continued:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Yes, at the same time as you are going to get the valuation of the house. So what you are getting is a deferred clean break, in effect.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I do not know the technical relationship between the amendment and my proposal. Could such a deferred clean-break settlement, which is based on a traditional Mesher order, be included in the Bill? Would that be permitted by the amendment? Presumably, it would be, because the amendment clearly states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``No pension sharing order shall be made which is materially contrary to the interests of any child of the family''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We know that the Minister will object to the amendment for technical reasons, but to be fair, my hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury was trying to help. He said that an amendment should be accepted to give the courts general powers to take into account the needs of children and to have wide-ranging powers to introduce measures such as a deferred clean-break order.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
In response to point 573 on page 119 of the Select Committee report, Families Need Fathers also referred to the Mesher order. It said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``To have the Mesher order, the limited experience we have got of those tends to be of setting them up and it was interesting that Fairshares talked about monitoring outcomes as well, and we have had remarkably no feedback on what the results are, but talking to one or two mothers, as I have, they feel very stressed about what the hell is going to happen when the kids do get to 18 and may or may not leave and so I think we would like to see that pressure off the spouses so that they may be free to make their own way in life and to the advantage of themselves as individuals and of the children.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I hope that the Minister accepts that I have tried to deal with the issues. I am confident that he will be able to respond to my points.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security </B>(Mr. Hugh Bayley): Let me begin by reassuring Opposition Members that I want to debate the issues and not hide behind drafting difficulties.
<P>
Amendment No. 77 would restrict the powers of the courts in England and Wales to make pension-sharing orders. It may help Opposition Members to know that I have a good deal of sympathy with the principle that they espouse that children who are affected by divorce will not suffer materially if pension sharing is an aspect of the parties' future financial arrangements. However, the courts already recognise the importance of protecting the interests of children who are caught up in matrimonial proceedings.
<P>
The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford stressed the importance of protecting the welfare of children. However, he overstated the case when he said that the Bill does not address the issue. I remind him that pension Bills, including those introduced by the Conservative Government, do not address the issue because it is not their job to protect the interests of children in divorce. That job falls to divorce legislation. The Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 provides the protection that hon. Members on both sides of the Committee want.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Could I repeat our argument? We are not making a point of principle. The legal instrument does not exist in pension sharing to put in place arrangements to cover children, as the Mostyn case made clear.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> I hear what the hon. Gentleman says. The law does not permit earmarking of pension assets on divorce to include an earmark for children. That underlines our point. The Government's pensions legislation is, in that regard, consistent with Conservative pensions legislation. The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford made an extraordinary overstatement of the case when he said that it is shameful that the Bill does not protect the interests of children. It does not do so for the same reason that Conservative pensions legislation did not refer specifically to children&#151;because that issue is dealt with by the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973. I hope that I can convince Committee members that that Act provides the necessary protection to ensure that the interests and welfare of children are fully protected.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brazier:</B> Having sweated through the previous Parliament's consideration of the Family Law Bill, would not the Minister accept that a large part of those deliberations&#151;and of the previous Government's measures&#151;related to the interests of children? The pension-splitting aspect was put to one side and left until later because it was deemed complicated and the Government wanted to enact the rest of the Bill before the general election. To say that Conservatives ignored that aspect is therefore unfair&#151;the Bill took account of children's interests from beginning to end. The pensions aspect, which the Government are now picking up, was the only one to be deferred.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> I am not trying to make a partisan point on the issue. The hon. Gentleman is right&#151;pension splitting was not dealt with before the general election, which is why it is a matter for consideration in this Bill. Pension earmarking was permitted under previous legislation, but there was no provision to allow pensions to be earmarked for children. The protection of children's interests in divorce is not provided by pensions legislation; it is provided by divorce legislation.
<P>
The Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 states that the first consideration will be given to the welfare of a child of the family who is under the age of 18. The court will also take into account a member spouse's obligation to other children. Amendments Nos. 182 to 184, which would introduce pension earmarking to benefit a child of the family, stray far from the purpose of the provisions under consideration today.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> I am trying to identify the two references that the Minister has just made to the 1973 Act. Will he repeat the references to a child of the family and to other children of the parties to a divorce?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> For further reference, I shall have to take advice. I hope that I will be able to return to the point before I sit down and certainly before we conclude this debate, so that the hon. Gentleman will be satisfied that the provisions are in place.
<P>
As with pension sharing, schedule 4 of the Bill intends to provide greater flexibility for couples to reach a financial settlement if the marriage is ended. It is not designed to change the way in which financial provision is made for children. Nothing in the Bill undermines the fundamental principle that parents have a duty to maintain their children. The amendments would be of minimum utility and maximum complexity. They would establish a lawyers's job creation scheme and a litigant's nightmare. They would create a new wave of Jarndyce and Jarndyce cases. That is simply not necessary to protect the interests of a child. Earmarking pension rights would rarely be the best route of securing financial provision for children.
<P>
If Opposition Members are suggesting periodical payments&#151;a stream of income&#151;they must realise that in most cases the child would have to wait a long time before seeing any money. Not many children who are minors have parents who are already collecting their pensions. The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford argued that the child should be enabled to benefit from the earmarking of a death in service benefit. But the child already has a claim on the parent's estate. Children of the age that the hon. Gentleman mentioned continue to be dependent, even after divorce. Nothing new is gained from the amendments in terms of protecting children's welfare.
<P>
I want to refer to the particular example given by the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford. It is an unusual example, but nevertheless one that would in some circumstances transpire. It was of a man who started a family in late middle age&#151;in his late 40s&#151;and subsequently divorced when the children were very young. He made no provision for pension splitting as a result of the first divorce, then he remarried and, although he had no children from the second marriage, he did agree to pension splitting and subsequently died.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> The Minister has completely missed the main points of my example. First, the first marriage could have terminated in death rather than divorce. Secondly, it is no use saying that the parties to the marriage did not agree to a pension split. It is not a question of agreeing; the courts impose a pension split. I did not suggest that the parent with, custody of the children died, but that he found it impossible to offer his children a reasonable standard of living in his retirement because the pension has already gone to the wife who was not the mother of the children.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> That is a differnt example.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> That is the example I quoted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> If the hon. Gentleman is suggesting, as I believe he is, that the man is still alive and paying pension contributions&#151;
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> If you will give me two minutes, Mr. McWilliam, I shall set out the example again.
<P>
The man has an initial marriage and children, who are very young when the first wife dies, at which time the man is 48 or 50. He then remarries. There are no children by the second marriage, which lasts several years and ends in divorce just before the man enters retirement. Under the terms of the Bill, the second wife is granted a pensions split and takes away 50 per cent. of the pension, although she has no children. The father is then left to look after the young children with only half the retirement income that he might otherwise have expected to have, or indeed his first wife would have looked forward to him receiving.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> I now understand the hon. Gentleman's example. I apologise if I misunderstood it before. It shows clearly where protection currently resides, which is where it should be. When agreeing the terms of the divorce, the first responsibility of the court should be to look after the welfare of the children. That is what the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 provides.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> The whole purpose of the amendment is to ensure that regard for the children is the first responsibility of the court. However, the Minister seems to be resisting the amendment and keeps quoting the 1973 Act as if it was a substitute, although he has not given me a reference to where the Act provides an alternative protection. I hope that he will give us that reference, otherwise the debate becomes pointless.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> First, I shall give the hon. Gentleman the reference. If he looks at page 131 of the explanatory notes, paragraph 25 at the foot of the page gives the references to the 1973 Act&#151;section 25(1) and (4). The Government cannot accept the amendments because that protection already exists. To duplicate it in the Bill would grossly complicate the law with no benefit.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> The law is full of protections which are duplicated. There is nothing wrong with that and it is a tradition of English law. I am trying to find in section 25 of 1973 Act a reference to children, but I can find no such reference in subsection (1) where the criteria to which the courts must have regard are set out. Section 25 refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Matters to which court is to have regard in deciding how to exercise its powers''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There is no reference to children in section 25(1). Subsections (2) and (3) cover orders made in favour of children, but that is a different issue. I want to see where the effect of my amendment is already incorporated in matrimonial law. I have not seen that yet.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> I sympathise with the hon. Gentleman's difficulty when a reference is simply passed to him across the Floor of the Committee. According to the explanatory notes, section 25(1) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``It shall be the duty of the court in deciding whether to exercise its powers under any of sections 22A and 24D above and, if so, in what manner, to have regard to all the circumstances of the case, first consideration being given to the welfare while a minor of any child of the family who has not attained the age of eighteen.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> But the hon. Gentleman misses the point. He referred to a child of the family&#151;that means a child of the parties being divorced. I gave several examples of children who, under the definition in the 1973 Act, are not children of the family. I argued at length that they deserve equivalent consideration.
<P>
Amendment No. 77 was drafted specifically to cover children of the family, which carries the same meaning as in the 1973 Act, which schedule 3 is amending, and
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``any other child of either of the parties.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I want to know where the protection is for another child of one of the parties.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> If the hon. Gentleman reads section 25, he will see that subsection (4) refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the exercise of the powers of the court under any of sections 22A to 24A . . . against a party to a marriage in favour of a child of the family who is not the child of that party''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The first part relates to the children of the marriage that is being dissolved and the second reference relates to the children of a former marriage or partnership of either of the parties to divorce. The hon. Gentleman will find that the interests of both groups of children are protected. I must remind him that the first consideration will be given to the children of the family that is being dissolved, but the court will also take into account the member spouse's obligation to other children.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The fact that family law provides for the interests of children to be given such priority is not being disputed. If the court or the two parties getting divorced deem it best to look after the children's interests by earmarking pension entitlements, that cannot be done as the law stands. That is the practical point that we are trying to make. [Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I realise that it is almost lunchtime, but the current murmur of conversation is not helping our proceedings.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> I can tell the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs that, in the case of a second divorce, courts will take into account the needs of children from both the first marriage and subsequent marriages before ordering a share of the pension. That is also true in respect of the example cited in which the first marriage ended because one of the parties died.
<P>
In addition, children will have a call on the estate of their parents. Depending on the rules of the pension scheme, there may be a residual dependant's benefit that could be payable to the child. The Government believe that the interests of children will not merely be protected but given first consideration in the divorce proceedings. All Committee members want that and the law already makes that provision.
<P>
The hon. Member for Canterbury said that conduct should be a factor in deciding on pension sharing. The Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 requires courts to take into account all the circumstances of a case, including the conduct of both parties. That requirement will also apply to pension sharing.
<P>
The hon. Member for Gainsborough referred to Mesher orders. The provision will not make pension splitting a requirement&#151;it will simply permit it. He also drew attention to a number of examples cited in the transcripts of evidence printed in the Select Committee report. I regret to say that I did not follow all of them, but they appear to reinforce the point made by others who gave evidence. For example, the spokesperson for Fairshares agrued that, in some cases, it would be best to split the capital value of a house and a pension some time after the divorce. The hon. Gentleman referred to that as a deferred clean break, which sounds like a contradiction in terms, although I take his point. Of course, cases could arise where a deferred clean break would be in the interests of both parties, and if both parties sought such a break, the court could so decide.
<P>
I understand and applaud Opposition Members' enthusiasm&#151;which the Government share&#151;for protecting the interests of children. However, the amendments would not constitute the right way forward, and I invite the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford to withdraw them.

<P>

<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I do not think that the argument advanced by the Under-Secretary of State for Social Security is satisfactory. He began by saying that he would deal with the issues rather than hide behind technicalities, or enter into footling arguments about minor imperfections in the Bill's drafting. In fact, in saying that the matter had not been dealt with by a previous Conservative Government, he advanced what is, from the point of view of the new Labour Government, the most absurd, footling argument of all. Parliament could carry on for centuries saying that a particular thing should not be done because a previous Parliament had not done it. I thought that the Labour party thought that it had some positive contribution to make to the nation's well-being by standing for office and seeking to form a Government. All we are told is that they cannot do things because they were not done by a previous Conservative Administration. The argument is irrelevant because, of course, no previous Conservative Administration introduced pension sharing. As it has been my aim to make clear to the Committee during our debates on schedule 3, pension splitting carries certain unprecedentedly dangerous consequences, which are likely to lead to gratuitous injustice unless they are properly dealt with in the legislation. The Government have shown an evasive approach to the whole issue.
<P>
Next, the Minister switched to what might have been a perfectly legitimate ground and said that the amendment was unnecessary because its purpose was already provided in the text of existing legislation. If there is any doubt about it, my amendment should stand, but if there is no doubt that the amendment's provisions have already been taken into account by legislation elsewhere, then I am prepared to withdraw the amendment. However, I am still not persuaded that that is the case. I can deal only with the text in front of me.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brazier:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs gave us a clear and specific example from case law, quoted by a Queen's Counsel, of where it seems that the powers available to the court do not cover this matter. A dispute on a point of fact regarding the state of the existing law seems to have arisen. I suggest that my hon. Friend challenges Ministers to allow him to withdraw the amendment on the basis that we can submit written evidence on the matter, and if we can demonstrate that those powers do not exist, the Government will agree to return to the matter on Report.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> I am afraid that we must make this clear right now because there are too many uncertainties about the parliamentary timetable and the time available for discussion on Report.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bayley:</B> I may be able to help the Committee because I have received further advice. The law that I have already quoted relates to the welfare of the children of the family&#151;that is the children of the two parties to the divorce. Subsection (2)(b) of section 25 of the 1973 Act relates to the children from previous relationships. That subsection states that the court will take into account,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the financial needs, obligations and responsibilities which each of the parties to the marriage has or is likely to have in the foreseeable future.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Historically, the courts have consistently used that provision to take account of the needs of other children.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> That is totally inadequate. The Minister started out by saying that the measure for which I was arguing was already provided for in the text of the legislation and yet we are now asked to take it on trust that the obscure phrase,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the financial needs, obligations and responsibilities which each of the parties to the marriage has or is likely to have in the foreseeable future''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
somehow gives preferential treatment to the interests of children. That phrase could relate to anything, including an obligation to a building society or an obligation to pay off a loan for a second-hand motor car. We aare concerned about the need to protect children and to enshrine that protection unambiguously and explicitly in legislation. Clearly the provision that I want to include in the legislation does not exist and we have had half an hour of footling arguments designed to persuade me that a provision already exists in legislation when it does not. So, it is clear that we cannot withdraw the amendment.
<P>
What has happened in the past 10 minutes has reinforced the need for us to press the amendment. It has also reinforced the need for us to be extremely vigilant about the new Labour Government. If they can argue that the phrase that I have just quoted represents explicit protection for the interests of children, they can argue that a hind leg is worth three donkeys. It simply will not wash.
<P>
So that there is no misunderstanding, I repeat that the new version of section 25 of the Act does not cover my example. In fact, it does not cover any of the three examples that I set out&#151;
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Before I adjourn the Committee, it may be convenient if I tell hon. Members what my intentions are for this afternoon. I intend to adjourn for dinner at 7 pm and reconvene at 8.30 pm.
<P>
It being One o'clock, The Chairman adjourned the Committee without Question put, pursuant to the Standing Order.
