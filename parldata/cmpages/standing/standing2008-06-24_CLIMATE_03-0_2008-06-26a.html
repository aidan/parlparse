Nick Hurd</b> (Ruislip-Northwood) (Con): On behalf of the
Committee, may I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Atkinson? You
join a lively debate on what we might call the 80/60 issue. Personally,
I regret the way in which this issue has been allowed to become totemic
in relation to the Bill, because in my view the most important target,
and the political prize at the moment, is the 2020 target&#151;the
interim target.</div>
<a name="08062681000011"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we are
serious about meeting the 2° C threshold, my understanding of
the science tells me that it is critical that we stabilise
concentrations of greenhouse gases at around 450 parts per million.
Given that we are at 380 ppm and rising at 2 ppm every year, it seems
to me that we face an enormous challenge. The only way in which we can
achieve that target is through some form of peak and decline framework.
On the science that I have seen, we need global emissions to peak in a
framework of around 15 to 20 years. Given that we are on a trajectory
to fail in that task, the political energy of this Committee should be
focused on the 2020 target and the credibility of the policy framework
that underpins it. The 2050 target is, of course, important, because it
sets a direction of travel and trajectory for carbon budgets, which are
the key innovation in this Bill.</div>
<a name="08062681000012"></a><div class="hs_Para">The dividing
lines of that debate, the importance of which I do not want to
understate, are now clear, and amendment No. 2 is supported by two
esteemed members of the Environmental Audit Committee, who are clearly
extremely sincere in their view. The Liberal Democrats, who carry
conviction on this subject, also support the amendment, and I believe
that they also see some political advantage in their position. The
Conservative party position is that a great deal of sympathy has been
expressed for the principles behind the amendment, but, for reasons
that have been very adequately expressed by my hon. Friends, we would
prefer to see leadership on this issue from the independent Climate
Change Committee, and we have placed on record our commitment to uphold
the recommendation of any such committee. The Government&#146;s
position is broadly in line with that, with one very big caveat: the
Minister has placed on 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column90" />Column number: 90</div>record that a Labour Government will not feel under any obligation to
follow the recommendation of the independent Climate Change
Committee&#151;that was when the Minister&#146;s said no on Second
Reading. Those are the key dividing lines in the
debate.</div><a name="08062681000013"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
the record, I am an &#147;at least 80 per cent.&#148; man. I placed
that view on the record in December 2006 in a paper that I co-authored
for the quality of life policy group, which was so ably chaired by my
right hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, Coastal. That report was
called &#147;Don&#146;t give up on 2° C&#148;, and it made
it clear that we should be thinking about at least 80 per cent. That
was the view that guided the work of the quality of life policy group.
All the evidence that I have heard in the Environmental Audit Committee
and in the Joint Committee that scrutinised this draft Bill has served
to reinforce that
view.</div><a name="08062681000014"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08062681000225"></a><b class="B">Steve
Webb</b> (Northavon) (LD): Good morning to you, Mr.
Atkinson. I agree with the hon. Gentleman&#146;s analysis of the
debate so far, but as an 80 per cent. man&#151;I have no doubt about
his sincerity on that point&#151;does he accept the inherent risk in
the Conservative position? Given what he has said about the
Government&#146;s position and an election not happening for another
two years, there is the risk that a 60 per cent. target will be used.
Why should we risk a 60 per cent. target, given that we are going to
ask the Climate Change Committee for its opinion anyway? Why not have
80 per cent. in the Bill as an insurance
policy?</div><a name="08062681000015"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062681000226"></a>Mr.
Hurd:</b> The hon. Gentleman and other supporters of 80 per
cent. continue to ignore two very important words in the Bill, which
are &#147;at least.&#148; I touch on the importance of those two
words, because they mean something to me. I would be amazed if the
independent Climate Change Committee were to reach any conclusion after
examining the evidence other than that 60 per cent. is inadequate.
Therefore I have a great deal of confidence that an independent
committee will come forward with that view, which, as has been pointed
out, goes with the grain of the international movement in California
and Germany.</div>
<a name="08062681000016"></a><div class="hs_Para">In my view
and that of my party, there is a great deal of value in having that
position validated and challenged by an independent Climate Change
Committee of experts, because the background to the Bill is the damaged
credibility of the political process in setting and meeting targets,
and we must respect that point. For me, the whole value of the Bill
lies in the word &#147;accountability&#148;, which means a much
better process for setting and revising targets and for holding the
Government of the day accountable for those targets. The lack of
accountability has undermined the current process. For me, that is the
whole value of the
Bill.</div><a name="08062681000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
that context, the independent Climate Change Committee is a key
innovation. It will be extremely helpful for that committee to be seen
to take the lead in proposing a target or a shift in a target, which
would&#151;we must be honest about this&#151;have significant
economic implications. Because our political process has been devalued,
there will be tremendous value in the committee, if it is independent.
I spent many months scrutinising the Bill in the Environmental Audit
Committee and the Joint Committee, and I could ally myself with the
Government&#146;s position, if I felt confident that they 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column91" />Column number: 91</div>genuinely believe in the independence of the committee and that they
genuinely believe that the committee should have
teeth.</div><a name="08062681000018"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08062681000227"></a><b class="B">Mr.
John Gummer</b> (Suffolk, Coastal) (Con): Does my hon. Friend
agree that we share two views? First, the figure will have to be
80-plus per cent.; secondly, that figure is best decided by the
committee, not least because that will guarantee the way in which we
are going to proceed. The problem is that it looks as though the
Government cannot give us the assurance that they will treat the
committee properly. It is a question of not only that decision, but all
decisions. If that decision cannot be left to the committee, then what
other decisions could be? I am afraid the Government are pushing me
towards the position of saying that in these circumstances it is better
to have the 80 per cent. target in the Bill than not at all. I do not
want to do that, because the alternative is better. The Government seem
to be snatching defeat from the jaws of victory in the most remarkable
manner.</div><a name="08062681000019"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062681000228"></a>Mr.
Hurd:</b> I have a great deal of sympathy with my right hon.
Friend&#146;s point. We were both reasonably comfortable with the
Government&#146;s position when we came to the Committee, if there
was a genuine sense that the committee was to have bite. Early signs
were encouraging in terms of the appointment of the chairman of the
committee. Adair Turner was an extremely good choice, and it is a
source of great concern that he has decided to move on so
quickly.</div><a name="08062681000020"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08062681000229"></a><b class="B">Linda
Gilroy</b> (Plymouth, Sutton) (Lab/Co-op): Has the hon.
Gentleman had the opportunity to look at the oral evidence on the
independent Committee on Climate Change given to the Environment, Food
and Rural Affairs Committee on 26 March? At that time, Adair Turner
himself said
that</div><a name="08062681000166"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;you
cannot have a body for climate change which is given complete
independence in pursuing a
target&#148;.</div><a name="08062681000021"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062681000230"></a>Mr.
Hurd:</b> I have not seen that evidence, but that is a
perfectly sensible remark. There is no dispute that the final decision
must rest with Parliament, which is accountable to the people. There
are degrees of independence: we need an independent Climate Change
Committee that can make life tough for the Government, but that is not
to say that it should be ultimately responsible for setting targets. It
is a question of the degree to which the committee can make life tough,
and the degree to which the Government of the day feel obliged to
accept its recommendation. That is where there are gaps between
us.</div><a name="08062681000022"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062681000231"></a>Mr.
Gummer:</b> Does my hon. Friend agree that the situation is
different, because the Government said to those who want 80 per cent.
that it would be better if the committee decided the target? The
Government indicated that that was not in to water down the target, but
to get the decision made in a more sensible way.</div>
<a name="08062681000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the hon.
Member for Plymouth, Sutton remembers the words that she has just
quoted, why on earth did she vote yesterday for Parliament to lose all
control over the planning system? It is really two-faced to say what
she has said.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column92" />Column number: 92</div><a name="08062681000024"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062681000232"></a>Mr.
Hurd:</b> I will leave my right hon. Friend and the hon. Lady
to sort that out between themselves.</div>
<a name="08062681000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
has picked up the Opposition&#146;s genuine concerns about his reply
to a question from my hon. Friend the Member for Banbury on Second
Reading. The Opposition have already said that we will accept the
recommendation of the independent Climate Change Committee in relation
to the key target. We do not think that we should be overly
prescriptive about the level at this stage, because, as my right hon.
Friend the Member for Suffolk, Coastal has argued, that would undermine
the authority and credibility of the Committee at a crucial stage. The
words &#147;at least&#148; are very important. I will listen very
carefully to what the Minister says in relation to the
Government&#146;s attitude to any recommendation from the committee.
If the Minister continues to pursue the no, no, no line, which has not
served previous political leaders too well, I suspect that he will have
a problem with Opposition
Members.</div><a name="08062681000026"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08062681000233"></a><b class="B">Dr.
Alan Whitehead</b> (Southampton, Test) (Lab): I have been
listening very carefully, and I must confess that I am puzzled. On the
one hand, it has been suggested that the Committee on Climate Change
should not be a wholly freestanding body, with no relation to anybody
else, while on the other my hon. Friend the Minister is being berated
for suggesting that the committee should have that particular
arrangement attached to it. My puzzlement is increased by the fact that
in both the draft Bill and the Bill as it came out of the House of
Lords, there is a clause&#151;it is clause 20 in the draft
Bill&#151;with the
heading:</div><a name="08062681000167"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Advice
in connection with carbon
budgets&#148;.</div><a name="08062681000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause
states:</div><a name="08062681000168"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It
is the duty of the Committee to advise the Secretary of
State&#148;.</div><a name="08062681000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
draft clause is clause 34 in the Bill that is before us today. The
heading
states:</div><a name="08062681000169"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Advice
in connection with carbon
budgets&#148;,</div><a name="08062681000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">and
the clause states
that</div><a name="08062681000170"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It
is the duty of the Committee to advise the Secretary of
State&#148;.</div><a name="08062681000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
other words, the wording is identical. No one sought to amend the
clause during the pre-legislative scrutiny or the Bill&#146;s passage
through the House of Lords. I also note that the right hon. Member for
Suffolk, Coastal has not tabled amendments to clause 34 suggesting that
that committee should be other than it was always intended to be, which
is an advisory
committee.</div><a name="08062681000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have a straightforward, common-sense understanding of the word
&#147;advisory&#148;, namely that the committee advises. To enable
a committee to command, the wording would have to be different. For the
committee to be required metaphorically to make an offer that cannot be
refused would not be an appropriate way to legislate as far as
Parliament is concerned. It is clear that the committee has an advisory
role.</div>
<a name="08062681000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">A moment ago,
the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood clearly indicated that that is
his view of the committee, which is at odds with the view expressed by
the right hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal, who appeared to insist on
the idea that the committee should not have that function. When the
Minister was asked the question on Second Reading, he gave the only
answer he could given where the Bill stood. The Bill was not unformed 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column93" />Column number: 93</div>on Second Reading, because it had already been discussed and scrutinised
in the House of Lords before coming to this House on Second
Reading.</div>
<a name="08062681000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">When the
Minister was asked whether there were any circumstances in which he
could envisage the considerations of the Committee on Climate Change
not being implemented, the only possible answer without doing injustice
to this Bill was no. One may say that that was a blunt answer. Although
my hon. Friend the Minister is known for his straightforwardness and
bluntness, his answer was not only the correct answer but the only one
that could have been given. The question could have been phrased
differently. For example, if he had been asked about circumstances in
which, given the terms of the relationship between the committee and
the Government and the committee&#146;s responsibilities, the
Government could not easily take the committee&#146;s advice,
particularly with regard to whether the target should be at least
60 per cent. or 80 per cent., I suspect that he would have
provided an extended
response.</div><a name="08062681000196"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.15
am</div><a name="08062681000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is specious to make a great point about the Minister&#146;s reply on
Second Reading when the record states that it was the only thing that
could have been said under the circumstances. I hope, therefore, that
that avenue will not be followed, as it is not a serious point about a
process which I think everybody here agrees will almost certainly
result in an increase from at least 60 per cent. to 80 per
cent.</div><a name="08062681000035"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08062681000234"></a><b class="B">Tony
Baldry</b> (Banbury) (Con): I find the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
point incomprehensible. I do not want to delay the Committee, but could
he please take us through it again? With all due respect, the first
point was totally nonsensical. I want to concentrate on what he is
saying. Could he take us through the logic of his argument again? It
sounded like complete
nonsense.</div><a name="08062681000036"></a>

anticipated the second part of my 10-peso version of the explanation,
which is that if it were considered that any function other than an

someone at some stage should have tabled an amendment to illustrate
that. That has not happened and no such amendment is before the

implement the advice in full. What we have heard from the Government
Front Bench to date&#151;I hope the Minister will clarify
this&#151;is equivocation as to whether his Government would
implement the advice in full. We are looking for a clear promise from
those on the Government Front Bench that they will implement the advice
in full. We are not trying to change the terms of the
Bill.</div><a name="08062681000042"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062681000239"></a>Dr.
Whitehead:</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for that point,
which is consistent with what I am about to say. If the committee is,
indeed, advisory, it would be an abuse of the English language to say
that its advice must be taken under all circumstances. Therefore, on
the question whether the Government must under all circumstances take
the advice of the committee, the answer logically&#151;not to abuse
the English language&#151;must be no.</div>
<a name="08062681000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the
question were whether the Minister can easily envisage circumstances in
which the committee&#146;s advice relating to a change from a 60 per
cent. minimum to 80 per cent. would not be taken, I am
certain that a different answer would be given. However, a debating
point cannot be made of the fact that, as the hon. Member for Bexhill
and Battle said, the committee is advisory. Unless Opposition Members
wish to change that status, the answer to the general question about
the committee&#146;s advice always has to be no. There is no logical
escape from that
position.</div><a name="08062681000044"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062681000240"></a>Mr.
Gummer:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman accept that the Minister
is a very intelligent member of the Government&#151;some of us would
say one of the most intelligent? When asked such an important question,
he is perfectly capable of saying, &#147;This is an advisory
committee. I can assure the Committee that on this point, which lies at
the heart of the committee&#146;s remit, we cannot think of
circumstances in which we would not accept its advice.&#148; However,
he did not say that. He said no. It is insulting to him to suggest that
he cannot understand the point made so laboriously by the hon. Member
for Southampton, Test. If the Minister is now willing to say, &#147;I
can conceive of no circumstances in which I would not accept the
advice&#148;, I would take that to be as near to a yes as is
possible. Unless he can say that, however, his no is a serious no,
because he is a serious
man.</div><a name="08062681000045"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062681000241"></a>Dr.
Whitehead:</b> The right hon. Gentleman cannot have it both
ways<i class="I">&#151;[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> I accept the
conditional validity of that statement about the right hon. Gentleman.
If the Minister is asked a straight question, he will give 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column95" />Column number: 95</div>a straight answer, but he was not asked such a question. That is my
point. Why does the right hon. Gentleman not try asking him a straight
question? He might find the outcome
interesting.</div><a name="08062681000046"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062681000242"></a>Tony
Baldry:</b> Perhaps the hon. Gentleman can help me. Is this a
Whip&#146;s brief, or is he an 80 per cent. man? If the former is the
case, I know that I can ignore it, but if the latter, he is working
hard to persuade me not to support the amendment tabled by the hon.
Member for Bury, North, which I was previously minded to support. Will
he explain where he is hoping to take us at the end of the
argument?</div><a name="08062681000047"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062681000243"></a>Dr.
Whitehead:</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for that interesting
intervention. I assure him that this is all my own work, based on my
understanding of the present Bill, the original Bill, amendments to it
and how statements should be interpreted in that context. I trust that
he will take that at face value. I invite the Committee to reflect on
what the Bill says, as opposed to what people might like it to say
about how its provisions will
work.</div><a name="08062681000048"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08062681000244"></a><b class="B">Miss
Anne McIntosh</b> (Vale of York) (Con): I welcome you to the
Chair, Mr. Atkinson. It is a pleasure to serve under your
chairmanship. We have had an interesting debate, and it is getting more
interesting.</div>
<a name="08062681000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">On clause 2,
my hon. Friend the Member for Bexhill and Battle clearly stated our
position, which is that we look to a strong and independent Committee
on Climate Change. It is empowered to make recommendations on the basis
of science, not politics, which is why we argued in another place for
the committee to be empowered to review the 2050 target and to report
to the Secretary of State before the first five-year carbon budget is
set. My hon. Friend said that we would be wedded to the advice handed
down by the committee. Of course, nothing in the Bill prevents deeper
cuts or more ambitious targets in
future.</div><a name="08062681000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will
the Minister consider a question that has not been raised so far?
Clause 2(2)
reads:</div><a name="08062681000173"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;&#145;The
1990 baseline&#146; means the amount of net UK emissions of targeted
greenhouse gases for the year
1990.&#148;</div><a name="08062681000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">Would
he be minded to seek advice from the Committee on Climate Change on
extending the list of recognised greenhouse gases? Will that be one of
the first things that the Government ask it to do?</div>
<a name="08062681000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">During the
debate, there was much discussion about public scepticism. It is
important that we carry the public with us. The Minister has been kind
enough to correspond with me on a number of constituency cases, to
which I shall refer later. This is a good opportunity to thank him for
being so assiduous in his work, as it is an enormous help when he
responds fully.</div>
<a name="08062681000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">Constituents
and the public generally want to tackle climate change, but they do not
want to do so personally. They believe that someone else will tackle
it. With regard to the debate today on wind farms and where they should
be placed, our problem in north Yorkshire is that most of the pylons
connecting wind farms to the national grid come through our territory,
and we would much rather they went through someone else&#146;s. It is
often the case that we want to battle climate change in principle, but
we would rather someone else took the pain.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column96" />Column number: 96</div><a name="08062681000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would like
to raise with the Minister some of the points that he was good enough
to set out in his letter of unspecified date in June, which I received
this week, in response to the concerns of my constituent Mr.
Colin Inglis about the Bill and in particular early-day motion
736.</div>
<a name="08062681000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am trying
to help the Minister because, as my hon. Friend the Member for Bexhill
and Battle said, we believe that he may be prevaricating. Obviously,
the Minister might like some wriggle room, but it is important,
particularly in the context of the debate on the amendment and clause
2&#151;the 60 or 80 per cent. debate&#151;to pin him down. He
helpfully
writes:</div><a name="08062681000174"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Prime Minister has already stated that evidence now suggests that
developed countries may have to reduce their emissions by up to 80 per
cent. if we are to have an effective international agreement to tackle
climate
change.&#148;</div><a name="08062681000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is no argument there. The Minister continues, equally
helpfully:</div><a name="08062681000175"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Government is therefore asking the new independent, expert Committee on
Climate Change to carry out a review of the 2050 target and, as we
announced on 18 February, the Government has proposed making this
review a statutory duty under the
Bill.&#148;</div><a name="08062681000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">He
goes
on:</div><a name="08062681000176"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Before
taking any decision, we need to properly understand the implications,
costs and benefits of different options. For example what would be the
economic costs and benefits of different levels of the 2050
target?&#148;</div><a name="08062681000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall focus on the costs and benefits and try to get some information
from the Minister about the cost implications.</div>
<a name="08062681000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
continues:</div><a name="08062681000177"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;How
would this be affected if the rest of the world was also taking
meaningful action to tackle climate change, or if the UK was going it
alone?&#148;</div><a name="08062681000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
me, this is the key passage and the Government&#146;s
commitment:</div>
<a name="08062681000178"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This
is why we have asked the Committee on Climate Change to review the 2050
target, and advise on whether it should be tightened up to 80 per
cent.&#148;</div><a name="08062681000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister
states:</div><a name="08062681000179"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I
agree on the need for an urgent decision, which is why the review will
be one of the Committee's first tasks, alongside its work on advising
on the first three carbon
budgets.&#148;</div><a name="08062681000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister is keen for a decision. Is he saying that the Secretary of
State will take a decision on the basis of the advice from the
Committee on Climate Change, and that, assuming the advice is in favour
of 80 per cent., the Minister will accept it? He has committed himself
to taking a decision. I am trying to clarify, on behalf of
Mr. Inglis and the Committee, the basis on which the
Minister or the Government would not take that advice. Would it be on
the basis of alternative scientific evidence? Presumably, if the
Government are committing the Committee on Climate Change to undertake
the review&#151;the Minister said that that is why they are setting
up the Committee&#151;they will have access to the greatest
expertise.</div><a name="08062681000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister goes on to
say:</div><a name="08062681000180"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
are keen to get the first three budgets in place as quickly as possible
in order to ensure that there are binding constraints on UK emissions
which inform investment decisions
now.&#148;</div><a name="08062681000064"></a><div class="hs_Para"></div><a name="08062681000197"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.30
am</div><a name="08062681000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">Going
forward, we must recognise those who are going to take the hit,
especially in the business community. A York brick company in my
constituency has been badly affected by the climate change levy, and I
am sure 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column97" />Column number: 97</div>that it will take a big hit, whether there is a 60 per cent. or 80 per
cent. reduction. We owe it to businesses in this country to say what we
think the target will be and to give them enough time to prepare for
alternatives.</div>
<a name="08062681000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">Turning to
the final impact assessment of April 2008, will the Minister clarify on
what basis the Government are proceeding with their thinking about the
advice that they will receive from the committee? The impact assessment
states:</div><a name="08062681000181"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Stern Review concluded that, based on an extensive review of the
current literature, the long run costs of global
action&#148;,</div>
<a name="08062681000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">assuming that there
were concentrations of 550 ppm carbon dioxide, would
be</div><a name="08062681000182"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;around
1 per cent. of GDP by 2050, within a range of +/-3 per
cent.&#148;</div><a name="08062681000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is obviously quite a big leverage. Paragraph 2.1.7 of the impact
assessment
says:</div><a name="08062681000183"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It
is possible to calculate the present value of the cumulative cost of
reducing emissions by 60 per cent. by
2050.&#148;</div><a name="08062681000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
states that the reduction in GDP would be between 0.3 per cent. and 1.5
per cent. in 2050, which would
be</div><a name="08062681000184"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in
the order of &#163;30 to &#163;205
billion.&#148;</div><a name="08062681000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">Does
the Minister still stand by that
assessment?</div><a name="08062681000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">Turning
to the costs of the higher target, page 16 of that assessment
states:</div><a name="08062681000072"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Under
an 80 per cent. reduction scenario, costs have been estimated to be
between 1.1 per cent. to 2.6 per cent. of GDP in 2050, depending on the
assumed level of future technological change, fossil fuel prices and
availability of particular technologies.&#148;</div>
<a name="08062681000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">My understanding is
that the actual range of the costs to businesses within the context of
the impact assessment, whether we have a 60 per cent. or an 80 per
cent. target, is very small. Does not the Minister think that it would
be fair to give businesses the longest possible lead-in time that they
could
have?</div><a name="08062681000074"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08062681000245"></a><b class="B">Martin
Horwood</b> (Cheltenham) (LD): I am struggling to understand
the logic of the hon. Lady&#146;s position. She seems to be saying
that the committee&#146;s advice should be binding on the Government
and that they must always take its advice. She seems to be not only
contradicting an amendment that she has tabled to clause 4, which is
about the mechanism by which the Government can disagree on occasion
with the committee, but, by asking the Minister to take a view on the
impact assessment, she is asking him to take a view on the
circumstances in which different issues might be measured regarding
whether to take the committee&#146;s advice. In a sense, is that not
irrelevant if the committee&#146;s advice is always to be treated to
as binding?</div>
<a name="08062681000075"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062681000246"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> I am trying to understand the Minister&#146;s
thought process. It would be helpful if he would refer to the basis on
which the Government have reached the decision on 60 per cent., and how
they will make their mind up. Will the Minister confirm that they might
decide not to accept the recommendation of the Committee on Climate
Change? If that is the case, in what circumstances would he be prepared
to reject its advice? He should be mindful of implications for the
business community. The Opposition have made our position extremely
clear, and we seek guidance from the Minister  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column98" />Column number: 98</div>on how, in precise circumstances, the Government will react to the
advice of the Committee on Climate Change on whether to set a target of
60 per cent. or 80 per
cent.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062681000247"></a>Linda
Gilroy:</b> It is a great pleasure to serve under your
chairmanship, Mr. Atkinson. I want to make it clear that I
am an &#147;at least 80 per cent.&#148; woman. Given the advice
that I am receiving from marine scientists, I might even advocate a
higher figure. That is because the complexity of what we are facing is
significantly greater than some people might have realised. There might
be time at a later point to say more about
that.</div><a name="08062681000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">Incidentally,
I am greatly reassured by what Adair Turner said on 26 March. He said
that he would be very surprised if he and his committee simply came
back and
said</div><a name="08062681000185"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;60
per cent. is absolutely fine, end of
story.&#148;</div><a name="08062681000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">He
also said: &#147;I do think&#148; a
figure</div><a name="08062681000186"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;is
a perfectly sensible thing to hand to the Committee to express a point
of view on, rather than simply leap into let us not do 60, let us do
80, because...there is a value (even if we do end up simply saying
yes, 80 per cent. is the right figure) in setting out the reasoning of
why it is and also perhaps exploring a set of alternatives because we
do not have to say 60 or 80, we could say 70. We could say 70 per cent.
in 2050 but 90 per cent. by 2070; we could say 70 per cent. as a UK
unilateral commitment but 85 as part of an international
agreement&#148;</div>

no bearing on whether we should ask the Climate Change
Committee&#151;because we still will&#151;what sort of answer it
might come back with, and what we should then do with that answer?
Surely, however, we do not enhance the credibility of the whole process
if we hand the committee a Bill that everyone thinks has got the
self-evidently wrong number in it?</div>
<a name="08062681000080"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062681000249"></a>Linda
Gilroy:</b> I want to follow on from what my hon. Friend the
Member for Southampton, Test said earlier and to try to follow the
logic of where this argument is coming from. I had a lot of sympathy
with what some Opposition Members were saying, particularly because of
the discussions that I have had with the climate change panel that I
have been working with throughout the pre-legislative
process.</div>
<a name="08062681000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">A lot of
debate stems from the question of whether or not there is an analogy
with the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of England. Again, I
think that the debate that took place in the Environment, Food and
Rural Affairs Committee, under the chairmanship of the right hon.
Member for Fylde (Mr. Jack), when he pressed the chair of
the Climate Change Committee very hard, casts very interesting light on
the argument that the hon. Members for Bexhill and Battle and for Vale
of York are trying to put.</div>
<a name="08062681000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have a lot
of sympathy with the idea that this committee should be independent, in
the sense of the MPC. Another analogy that I discussed with my
committee change panel was the Low Pay Commission. In a way, the Low
Pay Commission might be a better analogy, given the complexities with
which it must deal.</div>
<a name="08062681000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">Adair Turner
pointed out the differences. First he
said:</div><a name="08062681000187"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
Bank of England itself does not even recommend on what the target
should be; it simply has to take the target as actually defined by the
Chancellor...The 2 per cent. plus or minus 1 per
cent.&#148;</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column99" />Column number: 99</div><a name="08062681000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">On one level, therefore,
the MPC is less independent than the Climate Change Committee. However,
he also pointed
out:</div><a name="08062681000188"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in
relation to inflation policy you can define one specific lever, the
interest rate, and you can give that to an independent body to call up
or down.&#148;</div>
<a name="08062681000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">He also said, and I
really plead with Opposition Members not to get into too much of an
&#147;angels dancing on the head of a pin&#148; debate about
this:</div><a name="08062681000189"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;You
cannot really do that for the Committee on Climate Change, because
otherwise you would have to give them pretty much the whole of
government policy because the levers that we could pull cover building
regulations, they cover speed limits, they cover appliance regulation,
they cover the design of the EU
ETS&#148;&#151;</div><a name="08062681000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">the
emissions trading
scheme&#151;</div><a name="08062681000190"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;they
cover taxation, et
cetera.&#148;</div><a name="08062681000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">He
cast a very interesting light on the issue and went on to debate what
would happen if the Government disagreed with the
committee.</div><a name="08062681000088"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"></b><b class="B"><a name="08062681000250"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> I do not wish to destroy the hon. Lady&#146;s
argument, because it has been eloquently put, but I was present at that
sitting. I was hugely impressed by Lord Turner&#146;s
evidence&#151;amazingly, he gave it without a note or an official by
his side&#151;and it will be a great loss when he is no longer
permanent chairman of the Committee on Climate Change. However, does
not the hon. Lady accept that the MPC&#146;s recommendation to the
Bank of England is very different for the reasons that the hon. Member
for Southampton, Test eloquently outlined? Clause 20 clearly states
that after the carbon budget for the period has been set, it cannot be
revoked, so the Committee on Climate Change&#146;s advice and the
period that it covers will be completely different from the
MPC&#146;s
advice.</div><a name="08062681000089"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062681000251"></a>Linda
Gilroy:</b> As I understand it, we are talking about the
target and the budget, and as I just set out by citing Adair
Turner&#146;s evidence, the complexity is significantly greater. I
thought that there was an inherent logic to what my hon. Friend the
Member for Southampton, Test tried to explain. The Committee on Climate
Change is advisory, so the Government could of course
disagree.</div>
<a name="08062681000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall
finish on this point&#151;my brief is very much not a Whips&#146;
brief, so the Whip is probably thinking, &#147;Why don&#146;t you
sit down, Linda?&#148; Lord Turner pointed out that when the
Government respond to the committee&#146;s
recommendation,</div><a name="08062681000191"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;it
would be odd if we did not respond back and, therefore, if there were a
very major divergence I think we would expect to see and, indeed,
Parliament would expect to see and, indeed, I think the legislation
requires that there is an explanation to Parliament of why the
recommendations of the Government have
diverged&#148;.</div><a name="08062681000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
advice issue has many more nuances and dimensions than as under the

It is a pleasure to serve under you on this important Committee,

receive and Labour Members about the Government&#146;s ambition being
sufficient in  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column100" />Column number: 100</div>respect of the important international effort. Given our wide-ranging
debate, I am taking the liberty of assuming that you will not allow a
stand part debate, Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062681000253"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. Perhaps I can clarify the situation. The
Committee has had an extensive debate about clause 2(1), but not about
subsection (2), so if there were to be a clause stand part debate, it
would, in my view, have to concentrate on the second half of the
clause, not the first. I hope that that is helpful to the
Minister.</div>

Woolas:</b> As ever, you are extremely helpful, Mr.
Atkinson. If I mention subsection (2) straight away, I shall have
achieved my objective. We want a debate in the round.</div>
<a name="08062681000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">The important
point is that with all the debates about the targets and the percentage
by a certain time in the clause, one can shift the goalposts by moving
the baseline year. Right hon. and hon. Members will know that one trick
of international negotiations is not to include a base year; we often
manage to reach agreement by avoiding that question. Importantly, page
7 of the explanatory notes makes it clear that the target for 2050 is
set by reference to a 1990
baseline</div><a name="08062681000192"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;rather
than a particular quantum of emissions because the baseline itself is
subject to revision as understanding of historic emissions
improves.&#148;</div>
<a name="08062681000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">That adds a further
complication to the situation, and that point answers the second
question asked by the hon. Member for Vale of
York.</div><a name="08062681000198"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.45
am</div><a name="08062681000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
sounds strange to say that one could revise the emissions from 18 years
ago, but we all know that all these matters must be subject to
international compatibility and agreement if they are to be meaningful,
because this is, as all hon. Members have said, a global effort. We are
dealing with the ultimate embodiment of the concept of mutually assured
destruction. As science and its methodologies improve our knowledge
about our historical emissions going back to the base year of 1990,
that may move the goalposts. Why is that important? It is of central
importance to the United Nations framework convention on climate change
process because of the point, which we accept, that the targets must
take account of the historical burden of the developed, industrialised
countries. Similarly, countries can use a change in the baseline and in
the methodology of calculation to move the goalposts in their favour. I
hope I have covered subsection (2) to the Committee&#146;s
satisfaction.</div><a name="08062681000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause is the centrepiece of the Bill. It underpins the
emissions-reduction framework that the Bill establishes and puts into
law our commitment to reduce CO<span class="Sub">2</span> emissions by at least 60
per cent.&#151;not 60 per cent., but at least 60 per
cent&#151;through domestic and international action by 2050. Let me
remind the Committee where this figure comes from. The science tells us
clearly that in the context of the global effort, developed countries
will need to cut their CO<span class="Sub">2</span> emissions by more than
50 per cent. if we are to avoid dangerous climate change.
Action in the UK is, of course, a crucial part of that.</div>
<a name="08062681000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">The science
in itself does not dictate that the developed countries&#151;the
annexe 1 countries; the industrialised countries&#151;must make a
greater contribution because  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column101" />Column number: 101</div>of our historical obligation. In our judgment, it will be impossible to
reach international agreement unless developed countries accept that
point.</div><a name="08062681000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the advice to the committee and the remit of the committee were purely
to look at an arithmetic contribution to equal burden sharing based on
the best assessment of science, the point that hon. Members make could
be accepted. However, as we are talking about a contribution that will
take into account other factors, including economic factors, as was
made clear by the hon. Member for Vale of York in a well informed
intervention on the impact assessment, and as we must take into account
other factors, including the social and the international dimensions,
we are asking the committee for very important advice that is based on
science, but over and above science. That is my first
argument.</div><a name="08062681000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
second argument is based on parliamentary accountability. My answer on
Second Reading was premised on the belief that Parliament would want to
be able to assess the recommendations of the Committee and the
Government&#146;s response. That is why the scrutiny of the advice
and the Government&#146;s reaction is not at all comparable with what
we normally debate in Public Bill Committees. This is not a one-off
piece of advice and a statutory instrument put out on a Thursday
evening. Not only is the Government&#146;s response subject to the
affirmative procedure&#151;that is, of course, the case on a matter
of such importance&#151;but, more importantly, it is part of the
process of the nation&#146;s budget-setting decisions. I urge the
Committee to consider that
point.</div><a name="08062681000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Chancellor announced that the carbon budgets would be announced in
parallel with the financial Budget in March. I have no prior knowledge
of the date of the Budget, in case there is a journalist in the room,
but I expect it to be in March. When that announcement is made, the
scrutiny of the carbon budgets and the policy that follows from that
will be of huge importance to this nation. Therefore, I want to
convince the Opposition and reassure my hon. Friends that by not
necessarily accepting the advice of the committee in advance, I am not
trying to wriggle off the advice. We are trying to create a process
that is of huge importance to this country. I will deal with the
conditions after I have given
way.</div><a name="08062681000103"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062681000255"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> The Minister is genuinely trying to be helpful,
but he must accept that we would not expect the Government to sit on
their hands, waiting for the figure to emerge in due course. There must
be preparatory work by officials in his Department and right across
Government in anticipation of a figure in the region of 80 per cent.
that is likely to be accepted. Can he reassure us that there is a
working assumption in Whitehall that that figure will be in the region
of 80 per
cent.?</div><a name="08062681000104"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062681000256"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> The hon. Gentleman has cut to the quick. Yes, I
can give that reassurance. The Bill&#146;s Second Reading in the
other place gave statutory authorisation to the Government&#151;my
Department is the lead&#151;to expend public money on the preparation
of the Bill. We have the office of climate change, which is a section
within the Department with the job of working in such areas, as well as
what we call the shadow Committee on Climate Change, which is already
working.</div>
<a name="08062681000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">As my hon.
Friend the Member for Plymouth, Sutton pointed out, Lord
Turner&#146;s evidence confirmed the point 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column102" />Column number: 102</div>to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s satisfaction. It is interesting and
important to hear Lord Turner. He said to the Committee on 26
March:</div><a name="08062681000193"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I
do think it is a perfectly sensible thing to hand to the Committee to
express a point of view
on&#148;&#151;</div><a name="08062681000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">he
was referring to the stretching of the 60 per
cent.&#151;</div><a name="08062681000194"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;rather
than simply leap into let us not do 60, let us do 80, because I think
there is a value (even if we do end up simply saying yes, 80% is the
right figure) in setting out the reasoning of why it is and also
perhaps exploring a set of
alternatives&#148;.</div><a name="08062681000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
was Lord Turner&#146;s view. My own view&#151;this is a third
argument with which to try and convince the
Committee&#151;</div><a name="08062681000108"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062681000257"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> The Minister is giving a constructive response,
but&#151;I am not being facetious&#151;if there is a value in the
committee going from 60 to 80 per cent. and explaining why, what is the
standing of 60 per cent? Joking apart, why not 3 per cent? Why 60 per
cent?</div><a name="08062681000109"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062681000258"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> That is an important question. First, as the hon.
Gentleman would accept, the figure is &#147;at least 60 per
cent.&#148; Secondly, as we all agree, we must base the figure
primarily on science. The carbon markets will not invest the trillions
of pounds that we want them to if they believe that carbon targets are
not based on science. If they believe it is a political fix, it will
not
work.</div><a name="08062681000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
the figure is not just based on the science. The point that is not
understood in the debate in the United Kingdom, which is not the case
in other countries, is that whether the target is 60 or 80 per cent.
does not really matter. What matters is how we get there.
Personally&#151;I hope journalists do not quote me out of context,
but now that I have said that, I suppose they will&#151;I am a 100
per cent. man. The debate that we will have on the trajectory is much
more important than the debate on the end target. Indeed, unless we
specify that the trajectory must be downwards, it would be possible to
reach an 80 per cent. reduction by 2050 even after 30 years
of increases, by which time we would have dangerous climate change.
Although I understand that the 60/80 debate symbolises something
important, it is not so
important.</div><a name="08062681000111"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062681000259"></a>Mr.
Gummer</b> <i class="I">rose&#151;</i></div>
<a name="08062681000112"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062681000260"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> Let me continue my argument, before the right hon.
Gentleman tempts me or presses me
further.</div><a name="08062681000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
mentioned that what we do has to be done though co-ordinated global
action. We have to give a clear signal to the international community
that we are prepared to do our share, plus more. That has to be done
within the trajectories that the European Union budgets and targets set
out, because our offer as the European Union is to go as far as 30 per
cent. by 2020, or 20 per cent. if we do not get the international
agreement. That will be the primary pressure upon the level of our
mid-term
targets.</div><a name="08062681000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
that context, I need to see what the committee advises. The committee
is more aware of these matters than I am, which is why I say seriously
that I cannot envisage circumstances, other than the absurd, in which
the Government could not accept the recommendation. Others may
disagree, but I do not see circumstances in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column103" />Column number: 103</div>which Parliament would reject that advice. My hon. Friend the Member for
Southampton, Test argued that we should say in advance that we would
automatically accept the advice. The committee is an advisory
committee, the chairman of which does not want us to tie him down in
that
way.</div><a name="08062681000115"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062681000261"></a>Mr.
Hurd:</b> The Minister is making a thoughtful speech, which I
am following with great attention. May I press him a little on the
terms of reference for the committee? First, can he make it clear that
an explicit term of reference for the committee is the 2º C
threshold, and that there will be a requirement on the committee to
form a judgment about the compatibility of the target with the
2º C threshold? Secondly, given what he said about the need for
the committee to take a view on what we might call equity&#151;the
appropriate contribution towards the global effort, based on
equity&#151;what terms of reference are the Government considering
giving the committee on that extremely important
matter?</div><a name="08062681000116"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062681000262"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> I am grateful. I should have made clear the point
about the 2º C, especially in light of our previous debate. As I
said, I personally think the 60/80 debate is rather puerile. The irony
is that in international forums, many countries argue that 2º C
is not ambitious enough. A Pacific island state would agree with that.
Our policy and the remit are based on 2º C because of acceptance
of what is realistic.</div>
<a name="08062681000117"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062681000263"></a>Linda
Gilroy:</b> My hon. Friend is right about the 2º C.
World Wide Fund for Nature scientists are giving evidence to the OSPAR
commission on the convention for the protection of the marine
environment of the north-east Atlantic. That will confirm that it is
highly likely that, given the feedback in action and the tipping
points, 2º C could be too
much.</div><a name="08062681000118"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062681000264"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> I am grateful to my hon. Friend, and to the WWF,
whose advice on these matters, both domestically and internationally,
is
exceptional.</div><a name="08062681000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood asked about the remit. It is a broad
remit that takes into account a number of factors. To back up my
argument, let me refer to the explanatory notes. As well as the
baseline that I mentioned, there is the issue raised by the hon. Member
for Vale of York about which greenhouse gases are relevant. That is an
extremely important debate.</div>
<a name="08062681000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">We talk about
carbon dioxide as shorthand for CO<span class="Sub">2 </span>equivalent, but methane,
for example, is 35 times more&#151;<i class="I">[Interruption.]</i>&#151;or
25 times, or something of that order&#151;23, I think. I am confusing
it with nitrous oxide. My point is that part of the remit is to look at
that and advise. That changes the circumstances. A rigid
target&#151;81 per cent., for the sake of
argument&#151;to include all greenhouse gases would affect industries
that emit methane. They would have something to say about it.</div>
<a name="08062681000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">We heard
about one industry this morning. My hon. Friend the Member for
Stoke-on-Trent, North often reminds the House about the ceramics
industry, so these decisions are important. Opposition Members are keen
to ensure stability for businesses, but those businesses must have
confidence in the
targets.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062681000265"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> Will the Minister give
way?</div><a name="08062681000123"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062681000266"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> Let me make my third point, so that the Committee
has the whole
picture.</div><a name="08062681000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
third point is about accounting. The net UK carbon account, which is
defined in clause 27, is important. For 2050, it is the level of net UK
emissions of targeted greenhouse gases, after the number of carbon
units have been added and subtracted in accordance with carbon
accounting regulations. What does that mean? It means the amount that
is accounted for overseas and domestically. The debate is about the
balance of domestic effort and international offsetting. The whole
debate about the target is premised on an assumption about carbon
accounting, so it is
important.</div><a name="08062681000125"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062681000267"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for referring to
the broader greenhouse gases. My concern, which I am sure is general to
the Committee, and to Stoke-on-Trent and the ceramics industry, is that
the Government could introduce measures to increase energy efficiency
and other changes of behaviour. Perhaps he will confirm that now or
later. I shall be interested in his response. How does he propose not
to penalise heavy energy users such as the manufacturing sector, which
is subject to international
competition?</div><a name="08062681000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
areas such as the Vale of York, methane gas is created by the
agricultural industry both in its agricultural processes and as an
end-user. I hope that certain sectors of the industry will not be
penalised if they
expand.</div><a name="08062681000127"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062681000268"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> I agree with the hon.
Gentleman&#151;[<span class="SmallCaps">Hon. Members:</span> &#147;Hon.
Lady!&#148;] I am sorry. I was carried away with the passion of my
argument.</div>
<a name="08062681000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">I agree with
the hon. Lady. Concerns that hon. Members have for the businesses in
their constituencies&#151;in this case agriculture&#151;are highly
subjective political judgments. The House should not put a burden on
Lord Turner and his Committee, as the right hon. Member for Suffolk,
Coastal and his hon. Friends are asking me to
do.</div><a name="08062681000129"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062681000269"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> The Minister is making some important points. He
is right to say that the Climate Change Committee is advisory and not
directive, and that the baseline target will be based largely but not
exclusively on scientific criteria. It is critical that we and the
Committee understand why the Bill refers to 60 per cent. I hope the
Minister accepts that it is based on, at the latest, early 1990s
science, so it could give the message that we are prepared to accept a
less equitable percentage. If that is not the case, the question asked
by the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood must be answered: what is the
view of equity of contraction and convergence on which we are basing
any brief to the Committee subsequently to amend that
number?</div><a name="08062681000130"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062681000270"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> I will come straight to the point. The Government
chose 60 per cent., not &#147;at least&#148; 60 per cent., based on
the 2000 report of the Royal Commission on Environmental
Pollution.</div>
<a name="08062681000131"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062681000271"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> It is 15 years out of
date.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column105" />Column number: 105</div><a name="08062681000132"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062681000272"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> Absolutely right. The science shows&#151;I am no
scientist&#151;that that is out of date and that the problem has got
worse, with the accumulation of gases, the growth in emissions from
developing economies, and the increasing rate of deforestation as the
biggest net contribution to that increase. The Government asked
Parliament for its view, and the parliamentary Committee that
considered the draft Bill came to the similar conclusion that the UK
would need a reduction of at least 60 per cent. in the light of the new
scientific evidence, and &#147;at least&#148; became the policy,
rather than just 60 per cent. That is what Parliament advised, and it
agreed that the Climate Change Committee should be the body to consider
it.</div>
<a name="08062681000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">Peers in the
other place came to the same conclusion. The House of Lords voted
against changing the 2050 target at this stage, favouring detailed
expert consideration of the issue over a hasty decision by Government
or Parliament, which is what I am being pressed to take. The figure of
at least 60 per cent. recognises the point that the hon. Gentleman
made, and the Prime Minister&#146;s speech confirmed that. Any
cursory reading of the science will tell the Committee that a figure of
around 80 per cent. is comparable with the previous figure of
60 per cent, recognising our contribution.</div>
<a name="08062681000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Ruislip-Northwood asked about the remit of the committee and
the scenarios that it must consider. The range of international
scenarios is important. In the major economies process, when the
developing countries asked for a commitment of 50 per cent. by 2050,
that was based upon an understanding that the developed countries would
have medium-term targets of 25 per cent. to 40 per cent. The United
States of America would not accept the latter condition, and the
developing countries would therefore not accept the long-term goal. Our
figure of at least 60 per cent. is the ambitious target that satisfies
both of those international
blocs.</div><a name="08062681000135"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062681000273"></a>Martin
Horwood</b> <i class="I">indicated
dissent.</i></div>
<a name="08062681000136"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062681000274"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> The hon. Gentleman is shaking his head. I have
given four credible, comprehensive
answers.</div><a name="08062681000137"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062681000275"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> The Minister has given a perfectly valid
explanation of why 60 per cent. is no longer the scientific basis, but
the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood made the original point that if
we are to accept a lower number, and if the Minister is to explain why
we are not putting &#147;at least 80 per cent.&#148; in the Bill
instead of &#147;at least 60 per cent.&#148;, he must explain what
the context of those other issues of equity of contraction and
convergence would be, and what the brief to the committee must be. He
must give some basis for that, and he has not done
so.</div><a name="08062681000138"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062681000276"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> I thought I had done so, by setting out the
criteria of the base year, the accounting of carbon units, the
international scenarios and the economics in the impact assessment. The
other place came to the conclusion that Parliament should not take a
hasty decision, but should wait. I reinforce that point, and ask the
hon. Gentleman to take it seriously. This is not a one-off. It is part
of a huge process. We have already been going down this road for two
years.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column106" />Column number: 106</div><a name="08062681000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">My final
answer is the chairman&#146;s own compelling argument, which I have
already quoted. It is perfectly sensible to ask the committee to look
at the range of scenarios, even though it may well come up with 80 per
cent. It is a matter of process, not a matter of principle. I know that
the amendment tries to pin down our intention, and I hope that I have
satisfied the hon. Gentleman and the Committee that our intention is
honourable.</div><a name="08062681000140"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062681000277"></a>Mr.
Hurd:</b> The Minister has made a valiant effort, but I will
press him on one point. It is important, because he argues that the
Government require space to disagree with the committee, which will
make some very big judgments on the aspects that are not science, such
as the issue of equity, which he has rightly cited. The committee will
have to make judgments on what constitutes a fair contribution by the
UK to the global effort. The royal commission made some judgments on
that, and reached the figure of 60 per cent. The trouble is that it was
never transparent.<b class="B"> </b>We need transparency. Will the committee have
a blank sheet of paper in relation to the judgment on equity, which is
enormously subjective, with big variables, or will the Government
narrow the terms of reference for the committee? Will the Minister be
more explicit about the instructions and parameters that the Government
will give the committee on that key issue of
equity?</div><a name="08062681000141"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062681000278"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> I clearly have not satisfied the hon. Gentleman.
The answer is yes. The Bill and the guidance, which we will debate
later, time allowing, show a range of scenarios within the different
criteria that we will be asking the committee to look at. We will not
say, &#147;Come up with all the hypothetical international scenarios
that you can think of&#148;, but will advise it on where the Bali
road map has got with the impact assessment and the
economics.</div>
<a name="08062681000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">The ranges
are not strict and are available on the DEFRA website and in public
documents. I was disappointed to hear the hon. Gentleman say that I was
trying to give the Government space. That is not the case. I am trying
to give the committee space so that it can be genuinely independent,
like the Low Pay Commission, where again we were pressed on whether we
would accept the recommendation for the minimum wage, whatever the
commission said, to which we said no. We were criticised for that, but
history shows that we accepted its advice. I see a parallel between
that commission and the
committee.</div><a name="08062681000143"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062681000279"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> But the committee will be in a different position
from the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution, which was making
an academic judgment on equity and global convergence. For the
committee to make such a judgment seems extraordinary without a
framework set by the Government. Will the Minister be completely clear
about the direction of contraction and convergence that will set that
framework?</div><a name="08062681000144"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062681000280"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> I accept the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point.
Perhaps he misunderstood my point about the commission. I referred to
the Low Pay Commission to demonstrate that we had a similar debate on
that, although he was right about the royal commission. Having said
that, the commission&#146;s judgment&#151;this is not a popular
thing to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column107" />Column number: 107</div>say&#151;on the international contribution was to stick a finger in
the air. We do not have an international agreement, so logically one
cannot say what the contribution to it should be. It was simply an
aspiration.</div><a name="08062681000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
answer to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s question, the framework that the
committee will use to come to a judgment is clearly and sufficiently
laid out to avoid the danger to which he referred. We are talking about
clause 2&#151;this is not Second Reading&#151;and many of his
points will be covered later in the Committee&#146;s deliberations.
However, I think that I can give him the assurance that he
seeks.</div>
<a name="08062681000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have had a
debate not on the virtues of 80 per cent. or 60 per cent., but on
whether we should accept up front the committee&#146;s recommendation
which, as my hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Test said, will
come in our debate on clause 33. I admire the Conservative
party&#146;s position in not jumping on the 80 per cent.
bandwagon. When we announced the policy change, I said, &#147;If we
go for 60 per cent., everyone else will go for 80 per cent.&#148; I
am as sure as eggs is eggs that if I announced 80 per cent. today,
postcards galore would be flying into the office by Monday morning
demanding 90 per cent.</div>
<a name="08062681000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">Logically, we
should go for 100 per cent, and without an international agreement, we
had better go for 200 per cent. to avoid dangerous climate
change&#151;seriously. As a net contributor to emissions reductions,
we could forest over the Vale of York. That would be a start It would
probably avoid flooding as well. The debate has been about whether we
should accept the recommendation up front. That would deny Parliament,
never mind the Government, the right to say no. I admire the
Conservative party&#146;s position. It is actually trying to satisfy
one lobby arguing for 80 per cent., and another arguing for
consideration. I accept that. The right hon. Member for Suffolk,
Coastal admitted from a sedentary position that having one&#146;s
cake and eating it is often
satisfactory.</div><a name="08062681000148"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08062681000281"></a><b class="B">Joan
Walley</b> (Stoke-on-Trent, North) (Lab): Does my hon. Friend
agree that the most important thing is the starting point in the Bill?
Given that we should be at 100 per cent. come the low-carbon
economy, will he try to align the timing of the Bill with the
scientific evidence, before Parliament resumes at the end of the
summer, so that &#147;at least 80 per cent.&#148; can be put in the
Bill?</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062681000282"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> I can give the reassurance, based on the previous
debate, that 2° C is our policy, and I am looking for a way to
satisfy the Committee on that
point.</div><a name="08062681000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
can also give the assurance that what matters is the mid-term goal and
the trajectory. The most important consideration for the United Kingdom
in respect of that mid-term trajectory is our signing up and adhering
to the European Union policy. Clause 6, which we will come to, deals
with our targets for 2020 and the EU offer. It means that the carbon
budgets that the Climate Change Committee will be advising on in
mid-term will be much more important than the end target. I hope that
that satisfies my hon.
Friend.</div><a name="08062681000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have exhausted my arguments. I hope that I have convinced the Committee
of the virtues of giving the independent committee a bit of space to
look at the matter.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062681000283"></a>Mr.
Gummer:</b> I have listened carefully to the Minister, and I
respect his argument. However, he has pushed me into a position that is
slightly different from the one that I thought I would be in. The
difficulty now is that he has admitted&#151;I mean
&#147;admitted&#148; not in the newspaper sense, but in the sense
that he has stated something&#151;that the work in his Department is
based on the assumption that we are, whether we like it or not, in the
area of 80 per cent., if one takes a reasonable view of the
responsibilities of the rich
countries.</div><a name="08062681000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister also said that the figure in the Bill is based on a mechanism
that is similar to the one used in his Department. I am loth to have a
Bill in which all the other figures are based on the up-to-date
situation, but that figure is based on a much earlier
scenario.</div><a name="08062681000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister has explained his difficulties, but nobody is asking him to
say that he will accept everything that the Climate Change Committee
recommends. This situation is different from the Low Pay Commission,
for example, because the Government did not have a minimum wage to
start with. They did not say, &#147;We will have a minimum wage of
&#163;4.02.&#148; They said, &#147;Give us a
recommendation.&#148; I know that the parallel is not exact, but we
have a minimum wage in this case. Will the Minister be kind enough to
explain whether it is really sensible to leave in a figure from 15
years
ago?</div><a name="08062681000155"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062681000284"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> I point the right hon. Gentleman to the phrase
&#147;at least 60 per cent.&#148;, which includes everything above
60 per cent.&#151;the process does not stop at 100 per cent. I
disagree with him in one respect. If he thinks that no one had a
minimum wage in mind, he is wrong. I seem to remember the Transport and
General Workers Union lobby, which was for &#163;7.50, was it not? I
jest.</div><a name="08062681000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
parallel with the Low Pay Commission does work in that parliamentarians
pressed us to commit up front to accepting whatever was recommended.
The argument at the time was that it would give the country greater
confidence if it could see that the figure had been arrived at by an
independent process that was  then subject to the due process
of Government  decision making, including, incidentally, the
devolved Administrations, which have not been mentioned in this case.
Such a process would give
stability.</div><a name="08062681000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I have said, I have exhausted my arguments. I hope that I have
persuaded my hon. Friend the Member for Bury, North, who moved the
amendment, of the virtue of my case. I repeat, I find it very difficult
to conceive of circumstances in which both the Government and
Parliament would not accept the
advice.</div><a name="08062681000158"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08062681000285"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Chaytor</b> (Bury, North) (Lab): I am extremely grateful
to my hon. Friend for responding to the debate so carefully and
painstakingly. I want to reply as briefly as possible to the key
arguments. Essentially, this single digit amendment has triggered the
best part of three and a half hours of debate. The only benefit is that
that may reduce the time needed to debate part 2 of the Bill, because
the majority of the debate related to clause 32, which is in part
2.</div><a name="08062681000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to reiterate the three arguments in favour of the Bill containing
the &#147;at least 80 per cent.&#148; formula. I entirely
understand the case presented by my hon. Friend the Minister, but it
seems to me that if we accept&#151;I think that the whole Committee
does&#151;that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column109" />Column number: 109</div>the Climate Change Committee will have an advisory responsibility later
this year, we cannot simultaneously argue that there should be a figure
in the Bill, because it is for the Committee to advise us on what that
figure should be. To follow the logic of arguing that the matter is for
the Climate Change Committee, there should be no figure at all and the
reference to &#147;at least 60 per cent.&#148; should be deleted.
However, if that is not the case&#151;it is not&#151;and the
Government&#146;s position is that &#147;at least 60 per
cent.&#148; should be included, it logically follows that if
&#147;at least 60 per cent.&#148; is obsolete, we should go for
something
higher.</div><a name="08062681000160"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062681000286"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> The hon. Gentleman&#146;s point about taking out
the figure is valid. The Conservatives considered that proposal very
seriously. The problem is that while it is intellectually coherent, it
is a very difficult message to convey and is capable of being
misconstrued in the outside world. One has to be practical and accept
that people who take an interest in such matters are looking for a
lead. It is much easier to communicate and carry with us support from
outside with the 60 per cent. figure, with the understanding that we
are looking for a higher figure from the Climate Change
Committee.</div><a name="08062681000161"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08062681000287"></a>Mr.
Chaytor:</b> I appreciate that point, and I do not propose to
table a further amendment to delete &#147;at least 60 per
cent.&#148; All hon. Members, including the Minister, accept that the
science has moved on and that the matter involves not only science, but
economics, political 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column110" />Column number: 110</div>judgment and our negotiating position in the post-Kyoto negotiations to
reach a settlement for beyond 2012. Taking into account all those
factors, &#147;at least 80 per cent.&#148; is the more realistic
figure at this
stage.</div><a name="08062681000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to reiterate a point that I made in my opening remarks, because I
may not have made myself clear&#151;following the advice of the hon.
Member for Banbury to my hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Test
earlier, I am tempted to repeat the whole argument. Essentially, the
issue is here regardless of climate change. Because of the finite
nature of fossil fuels, it makes absolute sense to set a higher target
to send the right signals now to business, industry and the population
of all western industrialised countries as a whole that our way of
life, technologies and expectations must change. The sooner that we
prepare for that, the better and less painful it will
be.</div><a name="08062681000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
respect of the target date, the Minister made the important point that
the interim target of 2020 is more important than the target of 2050,
because of the trajectory. However, we need two dates in order to have
a trajectory, and we cannot have a trajectory on the basis of a
starting point. I want to challenge the notion that 2050 is less
relevant or not relevant. We need a starting point, a mid-point and an
end point. Having said that, I do not accept that there is overwhelming
significance in the choice of a target or a
date.</div><a name="08062681000164"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">It
