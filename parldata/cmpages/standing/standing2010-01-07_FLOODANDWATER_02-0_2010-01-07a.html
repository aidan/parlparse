<a name="10010767000024"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10010767000390"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Thank you. As you realise, the evidence session
cannot go on beyond 2 o&#146;clock. To ensure that we get the maximum
benefit, I hope that you will keep your responses succinct. I am sure
that I do not need to urge hon. Members to keep their questions
similarly succinct.</div>
<a name="10010767000027"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
1616</b><a name="10010767000391"></a><b class="B">Miss
Anne McIntosh</b> (Vale of York) (Con): First, I thank the
witnesses for braving the elements and being with us today. I would
like to address my question specifically to David Rooke, but the others
may want to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column24" />Column number: 24</div>participate. The responsibilities that the Environment Agency is being
given under the flood and coastal erosion risk management provisions
are far-reaching, prescriptive and require a lot of what is probably an
already very stretched resource. Will there be a right of appeal or a
possibility of reviewing any decision? What comeback will the
interested parties have? Can you give us an honest overview? In one
Government response to the Pitt review there was a table that showed
that most of the resources you will require to implement Pitt and the
provisions of the Bill have to come from your existing resources. Will
you be in the position of having to stop doing things to fund the
provisions? Do you believe that you will have sufficient resources at
your
disposal?</div><a name="10010767000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">Linking
that, if I may, to how the new responsibilities under the Bill pan out,
are you satisfied that the measure will lead to the end of the
automatic right to connect? I am talking about major new developments.
We saw a lot of flooding in 2007, particularly sewerage flooding, where
the foul water overflow of new developments overspilt from the
connection pipe. One way around that is to end properly the automatic
right to connect. I do not know if the Environment Agency has a view on
private sewers and their funding, and whether local authorities are
going to make savings. The local authority representatives may want to
chip in on that. My understanding is, and it may be an erroneous
understanding, that private sewers are precisely that&#151;private.
It falls to the householder to pay the costs of maintaining and
repairing those sewers, so I am hard pressed to see where the savings
will come from.</div>
<a name="10010767000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
would the Environment Agency be minded to support greater clarification
on sustainable drainage systems&#151;SUDS&#151;in the Bill? It is
leading to a great deal of confusion because they have hitherto been
known as sustainable urban drainage systems and most of them, apart
from highways ones, apply to urban areas. Would it be useful to have
one definition for the whole country?</div>
<a name="10010767000030"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Rooke:</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B"> </b></i>If I take the Bill overall, we
welcome it and are very pleased with the provisions that the Government
have published. While there are some new responsibilities in the Bill,
they apply mostly to local authorities, as well as to ourselves and
other drainage bodies, such as internal drainage boards. While they are
far-reaching in some respects, we believe that they are necessary to
implement in full the recommendations in the Pitt report. There will,
of course, need to be some national direction, which is why we are
pleased that the Bill includes a provision for a national strategy so
that the Secretary of State can approve it to give that overall
direction. There is also provision for local strategies, which lead
local authorities can develop, publish and implement, for dealing with
local flood risk in their
areas.</div><a name="10010767000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
whether there should be an appeal against any of the powers that any of
the operating authorities have, including the Environment Agency, we do
not believe that it is necessary. We are not aware of appeal provisions
for other public bodies exercising their powers and it would make it
extremely difficult for us if, on every decision we take and every
activity we undertake, we have someone with a right of appeal. In
existing legislation, although not in the Bill, there are already
significant safeguards for rights of appeal.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column25" />Column number: 25</div><a name="10010767000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">When we are
carrying out new works generally, we need planning permission and the
permission of the local planning authority to go ahead, and there are
appeals provisions and public consultations within that. There are
statutory instruments in relation to land drainage works that require
environmental impact assessments. Where there are not, there is a
safeguard in the Secretary of State if there are unresolved objections.
We believe that there is enough opportunity in existing statutory
instruments and legislation to render further appeal provisions
unnecessary.</div>
<a name="10010767000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">On resources,
the table was published by the Government and it contained the
comprehensive spending review settlement for flood and coastal risk
management. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has
allocated some money to us to help implement the Pitt recommendations,
and our current funding is based on that CSR settlement. Within that,
we believe that we can start to implement not only Pitt, with the extra
support from DEFRA, but the provisions in the
Bill.</div><a name="10010767000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
explanatory notes published alongside the Bill comment on whether the
Environment Agency should have additional resources. There will be a
transfer of some of our powers to local authorities, so there will be a
saving to the Environment Agency from that. We would divert that
resource to dealing with the new strategic overview that is given to us
under the measure. We believe that within the current CSR there will be
sufficient funds, and of course future CSRs are a matter for future
Governments, but we did publish last year a long-term investment
strategy that set out a number of policy options for different
responses to managing floods, what those would cost, what the benefits
are and what the residual risks are. We would hope that future
Governments would take that into account in determining our funding
levels in the
future.</div>
<a name="10010767000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
automatic right to connect, it is our understanding that the drafting
in the Bill would lead to stopping that. That is certainly the
Government&#146;s policy position and certainly ours, but if the
drafting doesn&#146;t achieve it, we&#146;re very willing to look
at that with the
Government.</div><a name="10010767000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
transfer of private sewers is a matter for the Government, not the
Environment Agency. We support the provisions for SUDS. We believe that
the current drafting will deliver the policy aim, which is about
sustainable urban drainage, but again, if there is an issue, we will
have to look at
that.</div><a name="10010767000038"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10010767000392"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> Do any of the others wish to
comment?</div><a name="10010767000039"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Councillor
Gary Porter:</b></i> The LGA doesn&#146;t have any problem
with the national strategy being developed through the Environment
Agency, provided that there is no mission creep. The tendency in the
past has been for a national strategy to start looking
further&#151;beyond its own reach. We&#146;ve seen it recently with
the Tenant Services Authority&#151;another piece of work we were
working on. We also share Anne&#146;s views about the financial
savings in relation to transferring private sewers. Clearly,
we&#146;ve made the case. It was seven-year-old information, based on
a very small sample at the time. I think everybody, apart from the
Minister, has accepted that that was actually out of date and that it
was probably wrong to use it as a
baseline.</div><a name="10010767000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">David
has just made a point about transferring some of those powers to local
authorities. He&#146;s made the case again for us. He&#146;s going
to be making those savings, but 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column26" />Column number: 26</div>if he&#146;s making savings, we must be picking up costs we&#146;re
not currently picking up. Again, I hope that you could bear that in
mind.</div><a name="10010767000041"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
17</b><b class="B"><a name="10010767000393"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> Does Councillor Dare wish to comment on the
resource
issue?</div><a name="10010767000042"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Councillor
Barry Dare:</b></i> Yes, I think it&#146;s the centre of
the whole problem. My colleague has just been talking about the
transfer of responsibilities. Consistently, we in local government have
been required to undertake additional responsibilities without central
Government financial support. This seems to me to be yet one more spend
where we are likely to be put under severe pressure. The reality is
that the only place we can go to plug any gap is the council tax payer,
and we all know what view they take about rising council tax, and we
also know central Government&#146;s view of capping, so we really are
between a very hard rock and a hard
place.</div><a name="10010767000043"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
18</b><a name="10010767000394"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Drew</b> (Stroud) (Lab/Co-op): May I ask a straight
question of David Rooke? Clearly, the Environment Agency&#146;s prime
responsibility is coastal and riverine flooding, yet we know
we&#146;re looking increasingly at ground and surface water flooding.
To what extent do you have the skills and the resources, certainly
working in local government, to be able to reorient yourself, if that
is what you think you should be
doing?</div><a name="10010767000044"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Rooke:</b></i> No, we will concentrate on main rivers and
coastal flooding. The Bill also provides for our powers to be extended
to cover coastal erosion. Where local authorities may not want to do
that, we will now have the powers in the Bill to do it. We see local
flood risk, which involves surface water, ground water and ordinary
watercourses, being managed by lead local authorities or in partnership
with internal drainage boards and district councils where there is a
two-tier system. We believe we currently have the skills and the
resources to deliver on main rivers and the sea. The extra resource
that we would need is for the strategic overview role, which is about
giving direction and guidance, and we would use the savings from the
transfer of some responsibilities to local authorities to fund
that.</div><a name="10010767000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
accept that there is a skills issue for the industry as a whole, which
is why we&#146;ve been promoting our foundation degree course at the
university of the West of England. We are pleased that the Department
for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has now provided some funding
to help local authorities put students through that foundation degree
course, which is already under way. We have had some engineers graduate
from that course already. We accept that we are going to have to work
more closely with local authorities to help them, and I think this
joint initiative on the foundation degree course is a good example of
how that is going forward, to get the skills that the industry needs to
tackle all the
problems.</div><a name="10010767000046"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
19</b><a name="10010767000395"></a><b class="B">Martin
Horwood</b> (Cheltenham) (LD): May I bring in Barry and
Councillor Porter on this question, which is linked to the one David
has just asked? There are two dimensions to it. One is, do you think
the Bill as it stands is sufficiently clear about who is responsible
for what now? I think that when many of us imagined this national
oversight role for the Environment Agency, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column27" />Column number: 27</div>we had not envisaged that it was only for main rivers and specific types
of national flooding, and that there were other types of flooding that
were not going to be the responsibility of the Environment Agency but
would principally be for local authorities. We imagined, I guess, a
kind of horizontal split, where you had a national oversight for all
flooding, and local authorities had lead local responsibility for all
types of
flooding.</div><a name="10010767000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
we seem to have ended up with in this Bill is a vertical split, which
is slightly strange, seems to run the risk again of having this
confusion about who is responsible exactly for what, and is, I would
suggest, pretty illogical, because, as we discussed in the evidence
session this morning, when the water is flowing down the streets you
cannot determine what kind of flooding it is, and you need somebody at
local level to take the lead and somebody with national oversight to be
advising on all types of flooding. That clarity was what we were aiming
for, and what I thought Sir Michael Pitt was aiming for. Are you clear
that that is what we have in the
Bill?</div><a name="10010767000048"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Rooke:</b></i> Yes, we are clear. We will have the oversight
for all types of flooding. We will be able to draft the strategy for
the Secretary of State to approve, and the national strategy will then
be implemented by the Environment Agency and the other operating
bodies. So there is clarity of responsibility for that strategic
overview role in the
Bill.</div><a name="10010767000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
work on a catchment basis and look after what are called main rivers,
which have been approved by the Secretary of State and marked on a map
to show that we can then exercise our powers. If you think of it in
terms of transport, those main rivers are the motorways&#151;the
trunk roads&#151;and we are the equivalent of the Highways Agency. We
are looking after the national network of rivers. Water does not
respect political boundaries, so we can take water from the catchments
to the sea very effectively and efficiently. Local flood risk can be
dealt with locally, and the clear recommendation from Pitt was that
local authorities should have the lead on local flood risk. We believe
that the Bill provides that clarity and that in practice we will all
make it work because we will liaise and work closely together. In fact,
the Bill puts a duty on us to force us to work together, but we would
want to do that anyway. We believe it will provide the clarity that we
all
seek.</div><a name="10010767000050"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Councillor
Barry Dare:</b></i> May I comment on that? Clearly, the forum
and local authorities generally welcome the initiative as set out in
this Bill, but despite the reassurances that we have just had, I think
there are ownership difficulties. I think there are grey areas that
need to be fairly carefully solidified, so that we all know who is
responsible for what. Going back to my earlier point, the main problem
is that the proposals as they stand appear to be uncosted. We are
actually being asked to sign a blank cheque. We local authorities are
going to take responsibility under the new regime, yet we do not know
what the largest, best, broad-brush estimate is likely to be of the
cost implications, or how those costs are going to be
met.</div><a name="10010767000051"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Councillor
Gary Porter:</b></i> There is a case for saying that the Bill
is far too prescriptive already, so I think we would probably disagree
with the suggestion that it is not prescriptive enough in terms of
putting the Environment Agency at the top of the
hierarchy.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column28" />Column number: 28</div><a name="10010767000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">The difficulty
that we face in reality, as has already been said, is that flooding
does not respect boundaries and it does not necessarily stick to the
right political groups, even with their best endeavours to keep flood
water away from their own authorities. As we have mentioned several
times, we are happy to take on the responsibility that we are given,
but we must have the resources to deal with it. Nobody wants to be the
person who has to take the blame for it going wrong. We need the tools
to fix the
problem.</div><a name="10010767000053"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
20</b><b class="B"><a name="10010767000396"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> What I was trying to get at was whether the
division of responsibility in the Bill is correct and
logical.</div><a name="10010767000054"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Councillor
Gary Porter:</b></i> I think we all accepted that the Bill
would be pretty much decimated before it got to you guys anyway because
of the length of time it has taken to get this far. From what we can
see, this is the best cobbling together of what is likely to get
through in a reasonable time. If you started to create a full turf war
between the Environment Agency and every other flood agency and local
flood board, you would never get this through in the parliamentary time
available.</div><a name="10010767000055"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10010767000397"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I think Dr. Johnston wants to say something on
this.</div><a name="10010767000056"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr.
Andy Johnston:</b></i> Thank you. We have talked about
responsibility a great deal in the flood forum. At the highest level,
there is clarity about responsibilities, as has been described. That is
one side. The difficulty is how you square off those responsibilities
in implementing any solutions when actual work needs to happen and
money needs to be spent. That is where the difficulty comes through.
That is why a lot of our discussions have been about the ability to
self-organise at the local level so that the different bodies who have
the different responsibilities are locked into meaningful, formal
decision-making structures. The EA and local authorities can then share
resources and be in some kind of joint decision-making structure so
that we do not have to worry about what type of water is coming down
the high street because a body is in place that manages flooding in its
entirety at the local
level.</div><a name="10010767000057"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
21</b><a name="10010767000398"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Laurence Robertson</b> (Tewkesbury) (Con): Councillor Dare
touched on an issue I was about to raise. The county council will be
the lead local flood authority with the responsibility for developing,
maintaining, applying and monitoring the strategy. As you rightly say,
how on earth do you know what that is going to cost until you have
developed it? Given that uncertainty, is there not a danger that up and
down the country, lead local flood authorities might water down their
strategy in the fear that they would not get the funding for
it?</div><a name="10010767000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">Since
two and a half years ago, the problem has been identifying who is
responsible for what. This is not meant to be a criticism of the
county; I am also referring to other agencies. When you finally get to
the level of who is responsible, you have to persuade them to carry out
the work that is needed. The reply has always come back,
&#147;We&#146;ve not got the money to do that.&#148; There is no
point in having the strategy if you are not going to be able to
implement it. You obviously have a fear about that. Could you expand on
it a little?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column29" />Column number: 29</div><a name="10010767000059"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Councillor
Barry Dare:</b></i> As you rightly pointed out, two and a
half years ago, your constituency and my county were badly affected. I
was badly affected personally and was flooded for several weeks. I
think there are severe misgivings. The reality is that in July 2007, it
was the county council in Gloucestershire that took the lead and
addressed the pressing problems. However, those were tactical problems
such as how to get people into caravans and evacuate people from island
sites. The Bill is concerned with the strategic way forward. I go back
to what I said at the beginning: the principle is taken on board
totally by all of us, but the pound sign worries me and my colleagues
enormously because we do not see any clear indication that there will
be financial support from anywhere except our council tax payers.
Frankly, that will be unacceptable in the current
climate.</div><a name="10010767000060"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
22</b><b class="B"><a name="10010767000399"></a>Mr.
Robertson:</b> From your experience in other areas, how would
this work? Would you prepare your strategy and go to the Government to
say that it will cost x, and receive a reply such as, &#147;We will
give you  x minus 20 per cent.&#148;?</div>
<a name="10010767000061"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Councillor
Barry Dare:</b></i> In other areas, it works in a very
simplistic way. A prescription is passed down from Whitehall and
Westminster and we are expected to pay for it&#151;it is a
non-negotiable set of requirements. I read in this Bill yet another
shopping list of prescriptive requirements, without any clear
indication of from where the funds will flow in order to meet them.
Some elements look a bit bureaucratic, if I may say so. A requirement
to &#147;write everything down&#148; is acceptable in theory, but
in practice somebody has to pay for that. I am sure you all read with
interest the survey that we undertook of members of the Local
Government Flood Forum. The indications are that there are severe
misgivings: we have not, as a whole, persuaded &#147;them out
there&#148; that this  is the way in which their problems
will be solved; it is often seen as the way in which some of our
problems will be solved, and that is not the way
forward.</div><a name="10010767000062"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
23</b><a name="10010767000400"></a><b class="B">Dr.
Roberta Blackman-Woods</b> (City of Durham) (Lab): I want to
follow up some of Mr. Horwood&#146;s comments. I think it
would be an enormous help to the Committee if we could move on beyond
the issue of resources. We know the points that you are making and the
political context in which you are making them, but what I and my
constituents really want to know is whether the Bill has got it
right&#151;are we setting up the right local and national structures
for dealing with flood risk management? It would be enormously helpful
if you tried to answer that question directly, so that we are clear
about whether the Bill is right in that
regard.</div><a name="10010767000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would also appreciate it if the LGIU made a specific comment. I know
that you made comments about the draft Bill being too centralising, so
it would be helpful if we heard from you about whether the Bill now has
sufficient checks and balances to stop that over-centralising tendency.
I make that plea to the panel. Could you please give us a straight
answer to Mr. Horwood&#146;s
question?</div><a name="10010767000064"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Councillor
Barry Dare:</b></i> I shall go first, as is usual on these
sorts of things. The answer to your first question is: maybe. I think
we are into uncharted waters&#151;frankly, we just do not know what
the solution will be. I go back to what I have said before: this is
better than not having it.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column30" />Column number: 30</div><a name="10010767000065"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr.
Andy Johnston:</b></i> On structures, we are encouraged by
clauses 9 and 29. Clause 9 is about co-operation and agreements between
bodies and the ability to share tasks and so on, and clause 29 is about
the Secretary of State&#146;s ability to restructure things. What we
would like to see is a bit more recognition that, rather than the
restructuring being some sort of top-down process, local government
bodies and other key stakeholders in a particular geographical area
might decide that the best way to manage flooding is some sort of
either extremely formal or informal type of structure in which
responsibilities are shared between certain organisations. They are
then able to point out to the Secretary of State, &#147;We have a
much better way of running things here, so would you please allow us to
restructure ourselves at the local level in order to do that?&#148;
In terms of clause 29 and the restructuring measure, we
would like an element within those provisions that allows local
government and local stakeholders to be the catalyst for that
reorganisation.</div><a name="10010767000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
all know that the same decision-making structures and the same
geographical boundaries will not work for the whole of England and
Wales. Local solutions will be required, depending upon certain
circumstances. So the best way is definitely bottom-up, from that point
of view. The Bill&#146;s current wording does not stop that
happening, but it does not encourage it as much as I would like. That,
I think, is the bottom line on
that.</div><a name="10010767000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
for the centralising tendency within the Bill, the Bill has changed
since the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee expressed its
concern about that. Most of our concerns have been addressed, but a lot
of the concerns are booted off into further guidance about how certain
structures will work. A question  was asked this morning about
local authority representation on regional flood and coastal
committees. The Government&#146;s response was that they have no
intention to centralise, which is good to hear, but the Bill does not
say what the mechanism will be to ensure that it does not happen. There
is a lot of secondary guidance and legislation that will sort out the
details  on
that.</div><a name="10010767000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is encouraging stuff on the use of scrutiny and the consultation
arrangements. We have made the point that encouraging the Environment
Agency, other bodies and local government to consult is a good thing,
but in fact, under existing local government legislation, such bodies
have a duty to involve the public and to co-operate with each other,
which is a step beyond mere consultation on certain documents. It would
be good if the Bill recognised that in reality such bodies will have to
work together much more closely that it currently
suggests.</div><a name="10010767000069"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Councillor
Gary Porter:</b></i> Broadly, it is a better Bill now than it
was in its first draft, when people started to play with
it.</div>
<a name="10010767000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">Financing is
not a party political point. You can have the best Bill in the world,
but if you are not prepared to put in the resources that are needed, it
will not work. It does not matter what you write. If you do not pay the
cheque, it will not work. Do not take the funding issue as the
Conservatives taking a pop at the Labour Government. It is not. If our
guys had come up with a Bill without the resources, we would be saying
the same thing. We must have the resources to deliver on it. We think
it is a great Bill. We think the public really want it. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column31" />Column number: 31</div>They want somebody to be accountable. We are ready to be accountable,
but we need the tools to be able to be
accountable.</div><a name="10010767000071"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
24</b><a name="10010767000401"></a><b class="B">Angela
Watkinson</b> (Upminster) (Con): We have heard several
speakers refer to overall responsibility and to who is responsible for
what. Could I ask David Rooke initially how he sees the fire and rescue
service fitting in, in practical terms, on the ground and in the chain
of command in emergency flood situations, rather than in the initial
planning?</div><a name="10010767000072"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Rooke:</b></i> We see it fitting in under the current
arrangements, which are largely governed by the Civil Contingencies Act
2004. Local resilience forums have been set up across England and
Wales, involving local authorities, all the emergency services,
ourselves, the voluntary sector and others, and they manage an
emergency. They manage emergency planning on a day-to-day basis through
the county council emergency planning officers. In an emergency,
so-called gold, silver and bronze commands are set up and the police,
the fire service and others have specific responsibilities set out in
that legislation. The Cabinet Office co-ordinates all that and we are
pleased and confident that the system works. It has been tested time
and again, most recently during the Cumbria floods just a few weeks ago
and it was not found
wanting.</div><a name="10010767000073"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
25</b><b class="B"><a name="10010767000402"></a>Angela

various statutory bodies who assist in the

Griffith</b> (Llanelli) (Lab): May pick up on the point about
responsibilities in the context of water catchment areas not respecting
county council boundaries, nor the boundary between England and Wales?
The Bill contains clauses that require councils in England to do
certain things, councils in Wales to do certain things and Ministers in
the Assembly Government to do certain things. Are you confident that it
is clear what will happen in what could be called the interim phase,
when something has been passed in this Bill, but the Assembly part is
not done? How will you work with colleagues on both sides of the border
to deal with complex areas, such as the Severn? Have you got that
worked
out?</div><a name="10010767000076"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Rooke:</b></i> We currently make it work. One advantage is
that the Environment Agency covers England and Wales. We manage
catchments across the England and Wales boundary on an operational
basis. We will make it work if the legislation in England is
implemented at a different time to legislation in Wales. Obviously, we
would like to see the legislation implemented in Wales and England at
the same time because the Bill will bring improvements to people, their
lives and their property. Any delay in implementation or any confusion
caused by the law applying differently in England and Wales would not
be good for people who rely on the service that we and others
provide.</div><a name="10010767000077"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
27</b><a name="10010767000404"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Andrew Turner</b> (Isle of Wight) (Con): On the Isle of Wight,
which is my constituency, it is simple: we do not affect what happens
on the mainland and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column32" />Column number: 32</div>what happens there does not affect us. That means we can get money
direct from the Government. Will we get money from the
Government?</div><a name="10010767000078"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Rooke:</b></i> I can speak only for the Environment Agency.
We fund works on the Isle of Wight through our grants system and the
block grant that we get from DEFRA. There will be funding that is
allocated through our southern regional flood defence committee. It
will be allocated in consultation with the proposed regional flood and
coastal committees under the Bill. There will be funding. That is
allocated on a national, prioritised basis and so it will depend on the
needs of the Isle of Wight compared with the needs elsewhere across
England. That will come from the overall funding the Government
provides for us, as it currently
does.</div><a name="10010767000079"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
28</b><b class="B"><a name="10010767000405"></a>Mr.

the Isle of
Wight?</div><a name="10010767000080"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Rooke:</b></i> For local authority capital schemes on
ordinary watercourses, we administer the grant. They are considered on
an equal basis with internal drainage board capital schemes and
Environment Agency capital schemes. If they meet the criteria we have
agreed with the Government for funding, funding is provided on a
capital basis through 100 per cent. capital grants for local
authorities. Colleagues from the LGA will have to respond about the
revenue
side.</div><a name="10010767000081"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
29</b><b class="B"><a name="10010767000406"></a>Mr.
Drew:</b> Thank you for leading into that, Andrew. I am
interested in the Bill&#146;s impact on the cost-benefit analyses
that different organisations will undertake with regard to particular
capital funds. We know from the Gloucestershire case that we have heard
from Barry that we have had quite a lot of mapping and a number of
potential schemes have been worked through. The real crunch is who
decides, between the EA and local authorities, whether those capital
schemes go ahead and whether we also look wider afield at the impact on
other areas if those schemes go
ahead.</div><a name="10010767000082"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Rooke:</b></i> The Bill makes no change at all to policy in
relation to cost-benefit analysis. It makes no difference in terms of
funding, apart from broadening the local levy that is collected by our
committees and spent locally for local benefit into coastal erosion.
The cost-benefit analysis and the prioritisation of capital schemes
stay the same. The Government set the outcome they would like to see
for the investment they are providing and there are targets associated
with the outcomes. We undertake a process to assess each scheme against
the other schemes to see what would be their contribution to the
overall targets we need to deliver for the Government with the money
provided. That will not change and schemes from local authorities,
internal drainage boards and us will be dealt with on an equitable
basis. For the capital side, there is no change as a consequence of the
Bill.</div><a name="10010767000083"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Councillor
Barry Dare:</b></i> I have nothing to add to that. We are
expecting no
change.</div>
<a name="10010767000085"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr.
Andy Johnston:</b></i> Obviously, what happens as a result of
this Bill is that we have a whole new type of flooding that becomes
somebody&#146;s responsibility to manage. Until this point, it has
been a poorly understood new type of flooding. In Gloucestershire they
have pulled together what they call a surface water management plan,
which is the first attempt to find out what needs to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column33" />Column number: 33</div>happen to prevent flooding in an area as a result of surface water. One
of the unexpected outcomes, I think, of this is that once you do that
detailed work you end up with a multi-million pound bill. I think that
people started this process thinking that it would just be a case of
some gully cleaning and a bit of maintenance here and there, but
actually, doing surface water management properly costs an enormous
amount of money. That money currently does not exist within financial
calculations, nor within the existing funding mechanism. The
implication, therefore, is that local authorities themselves have to
try to find a way of paying for all
this.</div><a name="10010767000086"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
30</b><a name="10010767000407"></a><b class="B">Chloe
Smith</b> (Norwich, North) (Con): I shall address my question
first to David Rooke. I am afraid to burden you more&#151;you are the
popular one of this panel perhaps&#151;but I am sure the others will
have reflections. I shall start with a quick scare story from Norfolk,
not from my constituency but the county more broadly. A couple of years
ago, Mr. Rooke&#146;s colleagues in Natural England rather
sadly managed to leak a report that suggested that you let six villages
go into the sea in north Norfolk. Of course, that created enormous
anxiety and threw house prices into turmoil in the immediate term. I
understand that the report was later not
published.</div><a name="10010767000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
of the things we would like to be assured of in this process is the
aspect of public consultation, and I would be interested to hear your
vision in particular, under clause 7(3), of what you think that
consultation might look like, whereby you would undertake a duty to
consult the lead local authorities in England and the public. We heard
from the Minister this morning that it would be the standard 12-week
job. We would be interested to hear your vision of that, and then
perhaps the other three, if you have a view, could say if you think
that is correct or if there is anything that should be added or taken
away.</div><a name="10010767000088"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Rooke:</b></i> Consultation is a key part of all the work
that we do, and building trust with local communities and sharing a
problem with them and involving them in the solutions is a way that we
are now advocating right across the Environment Agency. We have learned
some of our lessons from the past, when we perhaps announced a solution
and then consulted on it. We now announce a problem and involve the
community in that solution. While the Bill does put this duty on us, it
is something that we have done in the past, and it is something that we
are doing at the moment and will continue to do. We will also look to
improve the way that we do it. There will be full and proper
consultation, with a real dialogue over what solutions we can or cannot
provide to
communities.</div><a name="10010767000089"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
31</b><b class="B"><a name="10010767000408"></a>Chloe
Smith:</b> Would that come on a regular basis? Perhaps others
could enlighten me as to whether we are looking at a yearly strategy
that then has a yearly consultation attached to it. Are we at that
level of
detail?</div><a name="10010767000090"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Rooke:</b></i> It would depend on what activities we were
carrying out and the particular needs of a local community, but
certainly where there was any capital investment envisaged there would
be full and ongoing dialogue over that capital investment
proposal.</div><a name="10010767000091"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10010767000409"></a>The

question&#151;fire away.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
32</b><a name="10010767000410"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Roger Williams</b> (Brecon and Radnorshire) (LD): On that
particular part of the Bill and the need to consult, it seems a bit
strange that you do not have a duty to consult with Natural England in
terms of England, and the Countryside Council for Wales in terms of
Wales, because the duties that are given to Natural England and the
Countryside Council for Wales have an immediate impact on the purpose
of drawing up the
strategy.</div><a name="10010767000093"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Rooke:</b></i> We would consult with CCW and Natural England
as a matter of course, and we do so on a daily basis, both at the local
level and at a national level. So that is already
happening.</div><a name="10010767000094"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
33</b><b class="B"><a name="10010767000411"></a>Mr.

Bill.</div><a name="10010767000095"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Rooke:</b></i> We do not believe
so.</div><a name="10010767000096"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr.
Andy Johnston:</b></i> I support that comment. As I mentioned
earlier, the requirements in the Local Democracy, Economic Development
and Construction Act around the duty to involve and the duty to
co-operate already go, in my view, a step further than the relatively
basic consultation that is envisaged here. Having said that, moving to
that involvement from consultation does bring up something we have been
talking about quite a lot this afternoon&#151;resource issues for the
parties involved. I do not think it is reasonable to expect the
Environment Agency to do huge involvement exercises with the whole of
the UK, on particular flood schemes for example. It simply does not
have the resources to do that. However, when the involvement and
co-operation processes are taken forward, it has to be the Environment
Agency, Natural England and local government, with central Government
support, working together on that one, rather than individual bodies
doing their own
thing.</div><a name="10010767000097"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
34</b><b class="B"><a name="10010767000412"></a>Mr.
Williams:</b> You have already indicated the public in
general, although I am not sure how you would define that. As a member
of the public, I could get up and say that you never consulted me on a
particular strategy. Do you think that including the public, rather
than people with a specific interest in the issue, is a hostage to
fortune?</div><a name="10010767000098"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr.
Andy Johnston:</b></i> I think it matches the general trend
of where we are going with local democracy in the UK. You
couldn&#146;t not put it in, in my
view.</div><a name="10010767000099"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
35</b><b class="B"><a name="10010767000413"></a>Angela
Watkinson:</b> May I press David Rooke further on my earlier
question? In an emergency flood situation there might be in attendance
the fire and rescue service, the local authority, the police, possibly
St. John Ambulance and groups of volunteers, all trying to help in what
are unavoidably chaotic circumstances. How is it established who is in
overall charge of the situation in practical terms on the
ground?</div><a name="10010767000100"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Rooke:</b></i> My understanding is that at the site level a
bronze command is set up and that the fire and rescue service has
control of what is called the cordon, so it controls what goes in and
out of that controlled area, be it a flooding situation, a train or
aeroplane crash or whatever. The police chair the silver command, which
is the tactical response. The police also chair the gold command, which
is the strategic response, generally at a county level. The police are
chairing the gold command, with all the organisations involved at a
strategic 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column35" />Column number: 35</div>level, and the silver command for tactical response, and the fire
brigade controls the cordon around the site for the site
response.</div>

Yes.</div><a name="10010767000103"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Councillor
Barry Dare:</b></i> Could I chip in to say that it works very
well on the ground? I know that because I was part of the operation in
July and August 2007, and the gold command in Gloucestershire was under
the specific command of the chief constable. We in the local authority
and other agencies, and other operations, such as the water companies
and the electricity suppliers, all worked in co-ordination under the
command of a single person. It worked extremely effectively. As
Mr. Robertson will be able to confirm, in a seriously
threatened area of Gloucestershire the emergency services and the
support services, including social services, cut in instantaneously and
saved lives, as we effectively had no
fatalities.</div>

Horwood:</b> I would like to echo what Barry has just said
about the effectiveness of gold command working with the other

because my wife was on

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10010767000417"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> That is an example of it going well. Clearly,
there will be times when flood risk management is not done so well. I
will shift the discussion briefly in the time we have left to the teeth
behind the Bill and this strategy. Clauses 19 and 20 set out the power
for local authorities, but interestingly not the Environment Agency, to
launch investigations. It includes ministerial direction powers, but no
real powers for local authorities to ask other local flood risk
management authorities, such as water companies, to do what they think
is necessary, and there are no particular powers anywhere, it seems to
me, for the Environment Agency, despite the fact that it is given a
national oversight role. Is there something not very coherent or
missing in those teeth in the Bill? Is it a bit
gap-toothed?</div><a name="10010767000108"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Rooke:</b></i> No, because there is the provision for
Ministers to direct either us or others to do works that are not being
carried out by
others.</div><a name="10010767000109"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
38</b><b class="B"><a name="10010767000418"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> Would you expect to be advising him or her to do
that?</div><a name="10010767000110"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Rooke:</b></i> Certainly we would be giving advice if we felt
that responsibilities were not being undertaken. There is also
provision in the Bill for authorities to work together and for each
other. Again, we are very supportive of that provision, particularly in
relation to internal drainage boards, because under the Bill, they will
be able to do work for each other and work in consortiums and provide a
very effective and efficient service as they do so to the people who
benefit from the work that they do. We believe that those two
provisions provide sufficient safeguard if authorities are not carrying
out their responsibilities.</div>

39</b><b class="B"><a name="10010767000419"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> You do not have responsibility for investigation,
so how would you be able to advise the Minister to direct a flood risk
management authority to do something? How would you
know?</div><a name="10010767000112"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Rooke:</b></i> We have powers to enable us to investigate,
but we would only carry out our investigations in relation to main
rivers and the sea. The thrust of the Bill, following Sir Michael
Pitt&#146;s recommendation, is that local authorities accept
responsibility for local flood risk, so they would initially undertake
investigations in their area. Our strategic overview role, if they were
failing, would enable us to advise Ministers whether they should be
exercising the powers that are provided in the Bill on
direction.</div><a name="10010767000113"></a>

automatic right to connect. How would the councillors and the
Environment Agency feel about allowing water companies to have the
right to refuse planning permission and to become genuinely statutory
consultees on the same basis as the Environment Agency on major new
developments? Also, how would they feel about allowing the Association
of Drainage Authorities to be consulted on the same basis on what might
be inappropriate developments in their area? Would that, in effect, end
the automatic right to connect if we achieve that in the Bill? I ask

with local authorities and the flood risk regulations. The requirements
of the EU floods directive have been made law by the European

clearly what risk assessments need to be done and who needs to do them.

proud.</div><a name="10010767000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would like to open by asking Dr. Venables a number of questions, which
she might want to respond to all together. How do the IDBs currently
raise their funds and how do you believe the Bill will affect their
ability to raise them in the future? What is the current status of the
regional flood and coastal committees in relation to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column38" />Column number: 38</div>IDBs? What is the interrelationship between IDBs and the present
regional flood and coastal committees, and how will that change under
the Bill? You currently have very specific levying powers for IDBs. How
do you feel they might be compromised or changed by the Bill,
particularly in relation to your current ability to find local
solutions to local problems? Also, how does your composition reflect
democratic accountability? Do you believe it will be just as easy to
secure the role of councillors under the
Bill?</div><a name="10010767000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
memorandum with which we were provided notes that the IDBs are
concerned about the definition of drainage systems and in particular
that a watercourse is one thing, but an engineered watercourse is
another. Do you believe that there is scope to clarify that within the
Bill?</div><a name="10010767000136"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr.
Jean Venables:</b></i> I will condense my answer. The IDBs
are statutory bodies. They levy on those people who benefit from the
drainage in their area, so they can exercise a levy on the
beneficiaries who then pay for the service. The Bill does not affect
them in that case, but it is extremely important that they continue to
have that levy-raising power. The democratic basis is that there is a
voting majority on the board on each IDB of local authorities who
contribute to the
funding.</div><a name="10010767000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the memorandum that we put in, it is extremely important when you look
at the SUDS. The Bill defines a drainage system as a structure designed
to receive rain water, except a public sewer or a natural watercourse.
We think that we need to add on to that those watercourses that are not
natural but are constructed as part of drainage systems within the
country. It is therefore extremely important that that is added on as a
difference. We would suggest that we use the terms that the water
framework directive uses, which are the heavily modified or the
artificial water bodies, because a lot of the fens drainage and a lot
of the Somerset levels were constructed watercourses and we
don&#146;t think that they should be kept within the system of
drainage systems. We do not think that is the intention of the Bill and
we would like to see that added on to the
exceptions.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
47</b><b class="B"><a name="10010767000430"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> You raise an interesting point in your
memorandum about resilience&#151;I should like to question the ABI
about this. We are all very vexed that the Vale of York is probably 65
per cent. flood plain and at any one time any household could be at
potential risk of flooding. A number of houses are still at risk of
flooding. Would it not make sense, to take up one of the points that
ADA has raised, that when someone re-enters their home after being
severely flooded, the home is made as resilient to future floods as
possible? I know that there is resistance to that. I have seen it
locally in north Yorkshire, particularly in Pickering&#151;an area
adjacent to me&#151;where people feel they won&#146;t be able to
sell their houses if it looks as though the carpets have been pulled up
and the electricity plugs have been put up the wall. If you are going
to be able to reinsure that house at a rate that is affordable both in
terms of premium and excess, you are in a very powerful position to
insist on that when someone reoccupies their home after a major
flood.</div><a name="10010767000139"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Nick
Starling:</b></i> All our members will offer resistant,
resilient repair after a flood. In fact, we are about  to issue
a new leaflet that will be sent specifically to  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column39" />Column number: 39</div>householders in Cumbria about their options for resilient
repair&#151;we will let the Committee have a copy when it is
done.</div><a name="10010767000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">Two
things are important here. It is a matter of choice. Some aspects of
resilient repair are more expensive than normal repair, and they would
have to be met by the policyholder. Some have no additional cost, such
as putting plugs halfway up the wall, but some, such as resilient
materials in kitchens, are more expensive and they have to be paid for.
The second is the point that you mentioned. We know that there is
customer resistance to this. Basically, people are shocked when they
are flooded. They want the house to be back like it was before. There
is sometimes concern that if it is obvious that there has been flood
resilient repair, the house will be more difficult to sell. We are keen
to encourage that and, as I said, we are about to issue a new leaflet
on it that will be given to policyholders so that they know what the
options
are.</div><a name="10010767000141"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
48</b><b class="B"><a name="10010767000431"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> I should like to ask the NFU a question. The NFU
obviously has a position on reservoir safety, and if you could share
that with us, it would be really helpful.</div>
<a name="10010767000142"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jenny
Bashford:</b></i> I&#146;d be delighted. Our main fear, if
you mull over this, is the counterbalancing of arguments. One the one
hand, farmers are being incentivised to put in planning permissions for
reservoirs in an attempt to militate against climate change. One the
other hand, under the measures in the Bill, there is the potential for
that to inhibit people from going ahead and making planning
applications, once they realise the implications&#151;or the
potential implications&#151;for those measures with regard to the
risk assessment, panel engineers&#146; requirements, annual
assessments and so on. The potential for  onerous liabilities
in going ahead and taking action in the farming community by<b class="B">
</b>building reservoirs could potentially put people off building
reservoirs under this legislation. On the other hand, through the rural
development programme for England, we are trying to encourage them to
do that.</div>
<a name="10010767000143"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
49</b><b class="B"><a name="10010767000432"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> I have one last question. You also mentioned
food security, which is something that we have tried to explore both in
the context of the Select Committee report and through other
mechanisms. If main rivers were recognised as suitable for being
maintained, and if it was stated that that should be a priority for the
Environment Agency, that would move us some way. Do you believe that
there should be scope in the Bill to amend the outcomes and ensure that
food security and the protection of farmland could proceed in that
way?</div>
<a name="10010767000144"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jenny
Bashford:</b></i>
Yes.</div><a name="10010767000145"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
50</b><b class="B"><a name="10010767000433"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> Would you be keen to do that?</div>
<a name="10010767000146"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jenny
Bashford:</b></i> Very much so. It is something that seems to
be very much missing, and I understand why some of that would happen.
It is not, as yet, a target-driven society where we have a food
security target, but that should be embedded in the Bill as one of the
things to be considered when looking at the area of flood
defence.</div>
<a name="10010767000147"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
51</b><b class="B"><a name="10010767000434"></a>Mr.
Williams:</b> I understand the aspect of burdens put on
farmers, particularly in building new reservoirs, but I presume that at
least a new reservoir would be up to standard. I am also concerned
about existing facilities. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column40" />Column number: 40</div>Are there burdens on people with existing facilities that might not be
up to standard and would be required to take more work? Could that lead
to some facilities being taken out of use?</div>
<a name="10010767000148"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jenny
Bashford:</b></i> There is the potential for that. Earlier, I
referred quite a lot to the potential implications of the measures in
the Bill. Our understanding of the Bill is that it is enabling, and it
is about what those powers enable other people to do without coming
back and consulting on it, and what that means. We should not lose
sight of the fact that there are other mechanisms and systems where
people do not do something just because they have got those panel
engineers. They have to go through planning permissions; there are
other systems that they will have had to have gone through before
building those reservoirs in the first place. We should not lose sight
of that fact.</div>
<a name="10010767000149"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
52</b><b class="B"><a name="10010767000435"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I have a question for Nick of the ABI. Insurance
is clearly a big issue relating to floods. It was raised by
Mr. Robertson and many of us on Second Reading. The ABI has
been quite positive in getting some of its slightly less co-operative
members to do the right thing by local residents, but there is clearly
still a problem with punitively high premiums and excess charges that
go up so high that people might as well not bother, as it will not
really count as insurance. There are people who are being rather
unfairly excluded from having flooding insured as a risk at all,
especially when they are transferring, which is outside the current
voluntary agreement that you have with the Government. Would you
support addressing that issue in the Bill? That would at least provide
a level playing field for your members and prevent you from having to
play referee among them.</div>
<a name="10010767000150"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Nick
Starling:</b></i> The first thing to say is that the United
Kingdom is pretty unique in the world in having flood insurance wrapped
up in home insurance. That is a position that we all want to maintain
and is something that we are proud of. This Bill is a very important
part of maintaining that position, because we think that the deal is
that members continue to provide the insurance while the other side of
that bargain is to take a grip on water, as this Bill is doing, with
leadership planning, accountability and so forth, and wider issues such
as
funding.</div><a name="10010767000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is important to remember that flooding is an extremely expensive
business. The average cost of a domestic flood is &#163;25,000. The
2007 floods cost something like &#163;3 billion to the insurance
industry. The current cost of the floods in Cumbria is around
&#163;185 million, although we expect that figure to go up, and that
must be balanced by the premiums that come in.</div>
<a name="10010767000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">What we want
is to have a situation where as many people as possible can get
affordable insurance. There will always be some cases where the risks
are so high that it will be difficult to cover people, or if you do
cover them they must have a high excess or relatively high
premium.</div>
<a name="10010767000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that
the answer to your question is that I don&#146;t think that you can
put anything into a Bill that forces insurers to write business that
would not come under what is commercially acceptable in their business
model. The importance of the Bill is providing a framework for risk
management that will enable insurers to understand and price the risk
for as many people as
possible.</div>

53</b><b class="B"><a name="10010767000436"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> But there is a bit more of an issue than that, is
there not? I say that because the natural tendency for any business
will be, broadly speaking, to try to sell as much insurance as possible
to those who are at as little risk as possible, and to try to exclude
the people who are at more and more risk. Any logical business will try
to go down that path, but obviously that is not really a very socially
responsible outcome.</div>
<a name="10010767000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have an
example of somebody who, even in the great flood of 2007, was not
flooded in Cheltenham. However, he is now being told that, because of
his postcode, he cannot get flood insurance, and he is in a house that
has never flooded, as far as he is aware, even in the great
floods.</div>
<a name="10010767000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">So, there are
clearly problems with insurance companies. Would it not be simpler for
you if we had a level playing field set out in legislation, so that at
least your members knew where they were? That is accepting that there
will be some extreme examples of places that flood every year, which we
know about in Gloucestershire very well. Obviously, they could not be
endlessly underwritten by everybody else.</div>
<a name="10010767000157"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Nick

people at a level that is probably below the cost of what the insurance
should really be and in circumstances where it is difficult to see how
the risk is being managed. The statement of principles, which we have
with the Government, means that our members take on a risk where there
is a promise of mitigating that risk in the future. I think that that
is a big business debt that our members are prepared to take and I
think that it is to their great credit that they do that. It would be
much easier to withdraw. Given that we have something like 500,000
households at very high risk of flooding, the fact that the number of
people who actually cannot get insurance is extremely low is a credit
to insurers&#146; social responsibilities.</div>
<a name="10010767000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not
entirely clear what you mean by the Bill creating a &#147;level
playing field&#148;, because if the Bill says that insurers must
cover everyone&#151;I am sorry, perhaps I do not fully understand the
question.</div>
<a name="10010767000159"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
54</b><b class="B"><a name="10010767000437"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I said explicitly that that would not be the
case. However, the Bill could, for example, instruct the Secretary of
State to draw up a scheme for a more equitable insurance regime. There
are precedents for that. We used to have a situation where insurers
would not underwrite anyone who had taken an HIV test against
developing AIDS. That was stopped because it was seen as being not
socially responsible.</div>
<a name="10010767000160"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Nick
Starling:</b></i> From our members&#146; point of view, an
equitable insurance regime is one where you can price according to the
risk. The principle of insurance is that there is a risk pool, but you
pay the price for the risk you bring to it. Now, at the moment you
might argue that flood insurance is not equitable, because a lot of
people are almost certainly paying substantially below the risk that
they present and insurers choose to smooth the risk across the
piece.</div>
<a name="10010767000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that
what we all want to achieve, via this Bill and other measures, is a
situation where there is a much better understanding of the risk and a
much better understanding of the management of that risk. That is in
terms of the leadership of the Environment Agency, a requirement for
local authorities to have plans, a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column42" />Column number: 42</div>long-term funding arrangement, proper control of planning and data so
that insurers can understand the data and the risk that is
there.</div>
<a name="10010767000162"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
55</b><b class="B"><a name="10010767000438"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> So would you be in favour of publishing the
surface water inundation maps?</div>
<a name="10010767000163"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Nick
Starling:</b></i> Oh, yes&#151;there should be as much data
in the public domain as there possibly can be. I think that that is
extremely important.</div>
<a name="10010767000164"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
56</b><b class="B"><a name="10010767000439"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> Even if that had the effect of destroying
people&#146;s house prices?</div>
<a name="10010767000165"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Nick
Starling:</b></i> Well, I think that if there is data there
that can be used to assess risk, it should be made available so that
people can use it. If you get a better understanding that there are
parts of the country where flood insurance is going to be extremely
expensive, that is the time to sit down and say, &#147;What can we do
about that? How do we manage that residual
risk?&#148;</div><a name="10010767000166"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
57</b><b class="B"><a name="10010767000440"></a>Mr.
Robertson:</b> The ABI was extremely helpful during the
floods, and indeed has been since, but there are one or two questions
that I would like to put to Mr. Starling if I may. Even now,
and I consider it will go on for quite a while, people come to me to
complain about their insurance premiums and their excesses, to which
Mr. Horwood referred. They cannot understand why both have
gone up. If the excess goes up to as much as &#163;20,000, which I
have known, that effectively takes them out of insurance. If they
flood, they will effectively pay for it themselves, so why has the
premium gone up? They cannot understand why both have gone up. They can
probably understand why one or the other goes up. Or is the increased
premium paying off the &#163;3 billion? What are your thoughts on
that?</div><a name="10010767000167"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Nick
Starling:</b></i> In a situation where there is high risk,
insurers have a choice. They can increase the premium or they can
increase the excess. Technically speaking, the excess is the amount
that someone pays towards their claim. I have a couple of things to say
about that. We have done some analysis with our members. The great
majority of the excesses are &#163;5,000 or less. There are some
exceptional ones, which might be more. They tend to be high-value
properties. Even if you have an excess of &#163;5,000, flood claim
average is &#163;25,000. It pays the great majority that claim. It is
not necessarily the case that if you are flooded you have to fork out
that &#163;5,000. You can discuss it with your insurer. It may be
that you can do some of the repair or decoration yourself, so it does
not actually mean that people are not effectively insured. It means
that they are taking a little bit more of the risk. What insurance
companies try to do is balance the premium. People have the choice of a
huge premium and a small excess, or the other way round. Sometimes, as
you pointed out, it can be a little bit of
both.</div><a name="10010767000168"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
58</b><b class="B"><a name="10010767000441"></a>Mr.
Robertson:</b> Are the increased premiums paying for the past,
though?</div><a name="10010767000169"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Nick
Starling:</b></i> Insurance is quite a simple game. The
amount of premiums that come in has got to cover the amount that is
paid out in claims. You have to balance those premiums across the
piece. As I said earlier, your premium depends on the risk that you are
bringing to the pool. It tries to balance what an insurer thinks is
your risk in terms of coming to the pool.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column43" />Column number: 43</div><a name="10010767000170"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
59</b><b class="B"><a name="10010767000442"></a>Mr.
Robertson:</b> How would you assess risk? There is a concern,
to which Mr. Horwood referred, particularly if you have a
GL20 postcode, which means more or less around the town of Tewkesbury.
Is the postcode put in a computer that flashes something back? Is it
more scientific than that? In some ways more worryingly, if work is
carried out in an area, theoretically it will reduce the flood risk in
that area, but does it draw the attention of your members to that area
and do they say, &#147;Well, it&#146;s flooded once; they need to
spend this amount of money on it. It is bound to flood again.&#148;
How would they assess the risk to each
householder?</div><a name="10010767000171"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Nick
Starling:</b></i> Insurers use a whole range of measures.
They use the Environment Agency data, postcodes, their own data, their
own mapping. They all have different models. That is what happens in a
competitive market. They will have different means of doing so. I am
not aware that they find out that some flood defences have been put up
and they say, &#147;Wait a minute. Must be a flood risk.&#148; I do
not think that it works in that way. It comes back to my point about
data. They like to have the data and they like to know when risk has
been ameliorated, either by a local authority or by the Environment
Agency or indeed by a home owner who has put their own measures in
place.</div>
<a name="10010767000172"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
60</b><b class="B"><a name="10010767000443"></a>Mr.
Robertson:</b> It can be difficult for individuals to assess
that and to provide that information. It is not easy for them to do
that.</div><a name="10010767000173"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Nick
Starling:</b></i> It can be. I would urge them in those
circumstances to talk to the insurance company before they embark on
doing a lot of work. They should talk and see what might be acceptable
and what might
work.</div><a name="10010767000174"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
61</b><b class="B"><a name="10010767000444"></a>Mr.
Williams:</b> It is important that data are accurate, for your
purposes and also for planning in terms of inundation. Some of your
members come forward with maps that differ from those of other members
and the Environment Agency. It causes huge amounts of confusion in the
insurance industry and in planning. Is there a role set out in this
legislation to get a set of data and maps that are universally agreed
on, so that this confusion does not
arise?</div><a name="10010767000175"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Nick
Starling:</b></i> This comes back to how insurers look at
risk. The key data here has got to be Environment Agency data, and
making that as good, resilient and accurate as possible. One of the
things that we have been talking to the Environment Agency about is
having some feedback of insurer data into its data, so that it can use
some of our own insurers&#146; experience, because they do their own
mapping, and so forth. All of them are going to have different
assessments of risk and different appetites for risk, if I can put it
that way, that they will want to take on. I think it comes down to the
fact that the key data has got to be national data&#151;in this case
Environment Agency data&#151;or, in the case of surface water
flooding, some of the issues around what local authorities
keep.</div><a name="10010767000176"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
62</b><a name="10010767000445"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Jamie Reed</b> (Copeland) (Lab): Mr. Starling, may
I thank you for all the work you and your members have done in
Cumbria&#151;west Cumbria in particular&#151;which has been
noticeable and welcome? I have just a few questions.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column44" />Column number: 44</div><a name="10010767000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">Based on
something else that you have given already to colleagues, do you
envisage that it is credible that, in the not-too-distant future,
entire regions will effectively be uninsurable for flood
damage?</div><a name="10010767000178"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Nick
Starling:</b></i> Well, it hasn&#146;t happened so far. But
that all depends on what happens over the next few years. We have this
arrangement with Government, as I said, which says that we all carry on
with this insurance, but there has to be delivery on the other side.
That delivery is in terms of a long-term plan for flood defence
spending, good data, which we&#146;ve talked about, and getting
control of
water.</div><a name="10010767000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
is encouraging about the Bill is that it gives the Environment Agency
leadership, so that people understand the risk and what&#146;s going
on there. It is about getting a grip on planning, and we all know about
the silly planning decisions that have happened in recent years, so
that a Government of whatever stripe&#151;I&#146;m pleased that
there seems to be a lot of unity on this&#151;can commit to those
things and you&#146;ll have a situation where insurers can understand
risk and you aren&#146;t going to get whole areas that cannot be
insured. If that&#146;s not delivered, the flood risk with climate
change is going to grow and the problems will
grow.</div><a name="10010767000180"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
63</b><b class="B"><a name="10010767000446"></a>Mr.
Reed:</b> Do you think the Bill helps provide those measures
that you and your members have called
for?</div><a name="10010767000181"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Nick
Starling:</b></i> It&#146;s a big step. There are things we
would like to have more of. We would like it to have some targets. It
would be great if it had physical targets for reducing risk, for
example. It&#146;s silent about funding. Funding is a sensitive issue
at the moment, but it is obviously important for future flood defence
spending, and so
forth.</div><a name="10010767000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have been calling for this Bill and we think it&#146;s a great first
step, and we&#146;re supportive of
it.</div><a name="10010767000183"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
64</b><b class="B"><a name="10010767000447"></a>Mr.
Reed:</b> Finally, what level of risk are your members
carrying at the moment, with regard to flood insurance? Do you think
that the burden of risk is being carried by your members?</div>
<a name="10010767000184"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Nick
Starling:</b></i> They&#146;re carrying a huge burden of
risk. Flood risk is the key environmental risk in this country. We know
it&#146;s going to increase, because the biggest impact with climate
change on the UK is flood risk. On our calculations, you&#146;re
talking about something like at least a 40 per cent. and 25 per cent.
increase in flood risk. Floods are expensive in terms of insurance and
in terms of much wider
disruption.</div><a name="10010767000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">So
they are carrying a big risk, but they want to do that. They&#146;ve
always covered flood risk and they want to continue to do it.
It&#146;s a deal, as I said, between the private sector providing
that flood risk cover, which in most other countries in Europe would be
covered by the state, and the state&#151;local authorities and so
forth&#151;doing its bit in terms of controlling that
risk.</div><a name="10010767000186"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
65</b><b class="B"><a name="10010767000448"></a>Mr.
Reed:</b> I did say &#147;finally&#148;, Mr.
Chope; but Mr. Starling, you&#146;ve really put your
finger on a point I wanted to ask about. You mentioned other countries
and the role of the state with regard to this matter. Do you think the
Government should underwrite flood insurance in this country, for
either domestic or industrial purposes?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column45" />Column number: 45</div><a name="10010767000187"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Nick
Starling:</b></i> No, I don&#146;t think they should and I
don&#146;t think they would want to. I think you&#146;ve got to
consider what you do about extreme circumstances where it&#146;s
impossible to underwrite flood risk, but I think it would be a
retrograde step if that were to happen. I imagine that if Government
did it, they would want to control the risk and have some
control  of liability in exactly the same way as our member
companies
do.</div><a name="10010767000188"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10010767000450"></a>Nia

couple of issues on insurance. Are you happy with what you have

sufficient to help you insure future

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10010767000453"></a>Nia
Griffith:</b> Yes. They can say, &#147;Look, this drainage
has got to be done like this; otherwise, it&#146;s going to cause
flooding.&#148; Do you think that there is enough in the planning to
help for future insurance
requests?</div><a name="10010767000194"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Nick
Starling:</b></i> Huge steps have been made in terms of
planning. I am not entirely sure what the Bill adds to that, but we
have seen a dramatic reduction in the number of planning permission
consents given in high-risk areas, so we want to see that continue. I
do not have a specific answer to your question about whether your Bill
goes far enough; I can comment specifically on that, if it would be
helpful.</div>

Griffith:</b> If we move now to considering areas such as the
Severn estuary between England and Wales and the border areas, perhaps
colleagues could comment on whether they think that the Bill&#146;s
wording&#151;it requires the Welsh Assembly Government and the county
councils on both sides of the border to do certain things&#151;will
work out well in practice, or whether they see ways that things need
tightening up so that it works smoothly across all
areas.</div><a name="10010767000196"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr.
Jean Venables:</b></i> I will start on the answering, if I
may. We have a concern. Clearly, water must be managed on a catchment
basis, and what is being proposed is that county councils and local
authorities should take on that lead role. They will have to work very
effectively with each other. I think that it comes into sharp focus
when you come across the England-Wales and England-Scotland
boundaries.</div>
<a name="10010767000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">I believe
that we must be careful, because we tend to talk about having national
policies when in fact we really ought to be talking about having an
English policy. Perhaps we ought to tighten up some of the wording in
that respect. In the earlier session, you talked about having a
national policy when in fact it was an English policy. The Welsh
Assembly Government do their own policy. You have two different
policies, yet you are operating the same river system.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column46" />Column number: 46</div><a name="10010767000364"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent">As David
Rooke said, we make it happen&#151;the Environment Agency and the
internal drainage boards make it happen&#151;but we get dilemmas of
how to operate the two different policies. I think that an even bigger
problem will come when the solution to one side of the boundary lies on
the other side. That will throw into sharp focus funding, planning and
how we solve it. There is a great need for good co-operation, and I
think that it is important to put a duty on county councils and
Governments to
co-operate.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
68</b><b class="B"><a name="10010767000455"></a>Chloe
Smith:</b> This question is for Jenny Bashford from the NFU
and relates to your comments that the Environment Agency is power-heavy
and perhaps duty-light. In your view, how far does the Bill address
those concerns, and what more would you like to be
done?</div><a name="10010767000199"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jenny
Bashford:</b></i> In a word, no. We do not think that it goes
far enough in giving accountability to the Environment Agency. As I
have said, this is very much an enabling Bill: &#147;We&#146;ve got
to move forward on this stuff; there are a lot of things happening at
the moment.&#148; We represent the largest land area of the country,
bearing in mind that we are a countryside organisation, yet very few
duties are placed on the Environment Agency as to how it goes about
forming its strategy. It says a little bit about what should be
included in the strategy and what is not said.</div>
<a name="10010767000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
instance&#151;although I probably could not give a comprehensive
answer on exactly what we do; we need to come back on that&#151;it
does not say where they should be consulting within the process. Given
a blank sheet of paper, if I am the Environment Agency I can just say,
&#147;I&#146;ll come out to you and I&#146;m consulting, what do
you think about this national strategy we want to do?&#148; as
opposed to me producing a draft, sharing it with you and asking you for
your comments. I think it is quite important. There is a huge
difference there about stipulating where the Environment Agency needs
to make its consultation.</div>
<a name="10010767000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
various elements like that in the Bill that need to be pinned down. We
agree that the Environment Agency is in the right position; they are
the right people to take the national strategy forward, but they also
need to be made accountable for some of the decisions that they may
make without any requirement to come back to Parliament. That was the
reasoning behind some of the comments we made. For instance, where
there is an enabling piece of legislation, we would like to see, in the
Bill, the accountability for them to come back and have a consultation
and consult with people about how they will implement that particular
part.</div>

<a name="10010767000203"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jenny
Bashford:</b></i> Yes, and stipulating where in the process,
because that makes a lot of difference to the quality. Consulting is
not just ticking a box; it is about quality consultation to ensure that
local needs are taken into consideration, as well as national needs. If
you stipulate where in the process they are to consult, that will bring
a much greater degree of quality to the consultation, rather than the
experiences that perhaps you have had in the
past.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
70</b><b class="B"><a name="10010767000457"></a>Mr.
Drew:</b> I want to ask a very simple question. I think it is
probably for Jean Venables to answer, but others may want to chip in. I
have always been a great 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column47" />Column number: 47</div>fan of IDBs. I am interested in how the Bill will work on the ground,
particularly how we can get local actions to deal with local problems,
often to do with maintenance and simple repair work. Is this Bill right
for purpose and will it
help?</div><a name="10010767000205"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr.
Jean Venables:</b></i> We would like to make some changes. As
regards working effectively on the ground, it is important that we have
some exemptions about permissions to do work for things such as
culverts. There is the detail on that in the submission that I made to
you. But then that needs to be a de minimis exemption, otherwise we are
going to get very bureaucratic, and work on the ground will be held up,
so there is an amendment we would like to see there.</div>
<a name="10010767000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">We would like
to see the definition of flooding in the Bill looked at, because at the
moment the definition of flooding is when water appears on the surface
where it would not otherwise be. However, flood damage starts when you
get water to within a certain depth of the surface. That is
acknowledged at the moment; there is a damage benefit when water is
removed from that distance from the surface. I have concern that it
will not be helpful in the future to define flooding as starting
actually on the surface.</div>
<a name="10010767000207"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Robert
Cunningham:</b></i> Without going into detail about the local
action, one of the things the Bill does is this: when the DEFRA flood
risk management strategy, &#147;Making Space for Water&#148;, came
out, it talked about enabling a wider portfolio of responses. By
recasting from flood defence to flood risk management and giving a much
broader definition of what flood risk management entails, it
legitimises a much broader range of actions, which might be those
actions that are identified locally as being how we are going to
mitigate flood risk for a community. So I think it is very positive in
that sense. That is certainly one of the things we support in
the Bill.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
71</b><b class="B"><a name="10010767000458"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> My question is directed mainly at Robert and
Fran, although others may want to comment. There is an argument for
shifting the approach to water management much more on to a landscape
scale&#151;not having things that are, for instance, particularly
restricted to one local authority, but addressing a whole catchment
area, a whole landscape&#151;for using the landscape as part of water
management, looking at upland land use, natural woodland and things
like that, and having an altogether more ecologically sustainable
approach to water management. Do you think that that is a good thing? I
can sort of guess your answer, but do you think that the Bill does it
and do you think that the Bill takes us in that direction at all, or
sufficiently?</div><a name="10010767000209"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Robert
Cunningham:</b></i> That harks back to the comment I just
made. One of the things that the Bill definitely does is to talk about
natural processes in the definition of flood risk management. It clears
up the ambiguity whereby those who want to do more imaginative things
to manage flood risk work their way around existing flood legislation,
and those who are not interested in doing those more imaginative things
hide behind the language of the existing flood defence and drainage
legislation. So it gives a much clearer steer that those things are to
be considered. Again, when we are looking at the national flood risk
management strategy and the local flood risk management strategy, there
is a steer to consider a much broader range of actions within
that.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column48" />Column number: 48</div><a name="10010767000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">The answer
does not lie entirely in the Bill; it also lies within the regulations
that enact the floods directive. While I do not want to get too far
into the detail of that, within that directive, there is a requirement
to look at actions at a catchment scale. The plans that subsequently
come out of the regulations should, if they are done properly, give us
a much better idea about how things work at a catchment scale and the
kind of actions or measures you might wish to
take.</div><a name="10010767000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
key here is that the Bill helps us not to be limited by definitions. We
should be considering all options and looking at the most sustainable.
In some circumstances, the most sustainable thing might be to put a
wall in the centre of a town, but what has happened in the past is that
that is what people have immediately jumped to. The Bill helps us think
much more widely than that and encourages people to do
that.</div><a name="10010767000212"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Fran
Hitchinson:</b></i> I very much echo Rob&#146;s comments.
We are very supportive of the addition of natural processes within the
Bill&#151;it gives us that extra option. As Rob was saying, in the
past, it has been very much focused on hard engineering solutions,
whereas we know now from the Pitt review and all the other evidence
that has been accumulating over the past 10, 15 or 20 years, that
natural processes and working with habitats and land management
solutions can have a huge impact on flood mitigation&#151;slowing
down flood water and letting it infiltrate back into the land, rather
than flowing over the land. We know that that can have a massive
impact.</div>
<a name="10010767000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">Obviously,
from our own perspective at the Woodland Trust and from the modelling
research that has been done, we know that trees and woods can have a
huge impact on slowing down floods, either on a small scale or on a
large scale when they are targeted on flood plains. As Rob says, using
those kinds of solutions in tandem with perhaps engineering solutions
downstream&#151;using those solutions together&#151;would have a
huge impact. We really think it is great that the Bill is recognising
that. It is giving us the opportunity to look into those solutions and
work with those in the
future.</div><a name="10010767000214"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
72</b><b class="B"><a name="10010767000459"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I could cite local examples of where that simply
is not happening at the moment, and I am not sure that I can see
anything in the Bill that particularly shifts that. This morning,
Mr. Robertson mentioned the issue of spatial planning and
development. I have seen flood risk maps with large blue areas up hill
of housing estates, and we are about to build flood defences on the
housing estate and build on the green space above it. There is nothing
in the Bill that seems to stop that process. That is the very reverse
of the kind of approach you are describing, isn&#146;t
it?</div><a name="10010767000215"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Fran
Hitchinson:</b></i> We are hoping that, through the Bill,
people will be able to consider much more of those natural processes. I
understand that it is not happening at the moment, but we are hoping
that, through the Bill, people will be able to consider it more. Does
that answer your
question?</div><a name="10010767000216"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10010767000460"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> It shows that you&#146;re
hopeful.</div><a name="10010767000217"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Fran
Hitchinson:</b></i> We&#146;re hopeful and there is more
evidence being accumulated. Through that and the enabling powers within
this, that should give us a much stronger platform to work
from.</div><a name="10010767000218"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Robert
Cunningham:</b></i> There are two issues&#151;this has been
a source of debate in discussions around the Bill. How much is a Bill
about just removing legislative 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column49" />Column number: 49</div>barriers and how much is it about steering the cultural barriers? There
are cultural barriers around how you manage flood risk, and that is
what I was trying to get at. Some people&#146;s imagination is
restricted to the very immediate&#151;there are people who are
working within the existing flood risk management legislative framework
to do very imaginative things and to examine upland restoration,
woodland planting and all of those things. They are really pushing hard
to do that. There were some DEFRA pilot projects that looked at
those.</div><a name="10010767000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are other people who leap immediately to the legislation and say,
&#147;Oh no, this is what flood defence means; this is what land
drainage means. We can&#146;t possibly consider any of those
things,&#148; and they hide behind it. The legislation as it stands
opens the door for people to do more, but it does not force them to.
That poses a legitimate question: how much should we say, &#147;You
must consider these things and set out why you are not adopting
them.&#148;? One would hope that PPS25 does that job for development
on flood
plains.</div><a name="10010767000220"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jenny
Bashford:</b></i> The NFU&#146;s position on this is that
we tend to suffer from pendulumitis. We have had hard defences in place
for years. It now seems to us that in a way, the Bill goes too far the
other way. There is a difference between what is written down and what
culture there is. I think Rob is right that there is a time lag between
the two. Nevertheless, our concern is over what is written. The culture
of many agencies and the Government at the moment is to move much more
towards soft defences at the expense of hard defences. It is either/or,
whereas we feel that there should be a balance between the two. The
issue is getting that balance right and how you can encourage people,
including those on the engineering front, to make sensible, qualified
decisions about what is the best form of flood management and what
flood management you are managing with that particular
aspect.</div><a name="10010767000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">From
the scientific side of things, I honestly believe that the jury is out.
Not enough is known about this. Not enough is known about the impact on
agricultural land, which is the land that will be most affected. We
referred earlier to our food security. Sitting at the back of that, of
course, are the habitat and recreation targets, which will be somewhat
of a concern if we are not
careful.</div><a name="10010767000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">All
the NFU wants is for hard and soft defences to be used in balance and
to complement each other, rather than this
pendulumitis.</div><a name="10010767000223"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10010767000461"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I think Dr. Venables and Mr. Starling
want to make short contributions on
that.</div><a name="10010767000224"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr.
Jean Venables:</b></i> I just want to emphasise the need to
look at and manage the whole catchment for all our water needs. One
person&#146;s flood water is somebody else&#146;s water resource.
In future, we have to look harder at managing the water in the whole
catchment to meet the sustainable needs of everybody in
it.</div><a name="10010767000225"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Nick
Starling:</b></i> Our members are interested in outcomes, but
they have no difficulty in defining what flooding is: it is when
something comes into someone&#146;s house or business. There are two
key things. First, we do not want a situation in which someone&#146;s
flood risk management just dumps the problem on someone else. The Bill
goes some way towards ensuring that that does not happen. We must not
forget that flood defences do work. You 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column50" />Column number: 50</div>have only to speak to people in Carlisle who did not suffer again as
they did in 2005 to know that, whatever else you do in flood risk
management, hard defences
work.</div><a name="10010767000226"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
73</b><b class="B"><a name="10010767000462"></a>Mr.
Williams:</b> I will move on to the part of the Bill on the
designation of features. When listening to Robert and Fran talk about
conserving important aspects of the landscape to promote flood
mitigation, I was having difficulty wondering what a feature was. The
Bill says it
is</div><a name="10010767000365"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a
natural or man-made feature of the
environment.&#148;</div><a name="10010767000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
neither of your organisations could in any way designate it, presumably
it would be up to any organisation to put forward a particular feature
that they believed could have some effect. I leave that with you for a
second.</div><a name="10010767000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to move on to the NFU. I should have declared an interest at the
beginning by saying that I am a member of the NFU, so I hope we do not
have to start again. The part on designation is in some ways probably
overburdensome because it seems to be easy to designate something, but
difficult to appeal against that or have it cancelled. Perhaps I can
put that to the conservation organisations first and have a word from
the NFU
afterwards.</div><a name="10010767000229"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Robert
Cunningham:</b></i> We own and manage quite a lot of land.
When I looked at this, I thought it probably would be a burden for the
RSPB because our land is defended by flood defences and we have flood
banks. Our Otmoor reserve is a good example of that. It could well be a
burden for
us.</div><a name="10010767000230"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10010767000463"></a>Mr.
Williams:</b> I thought it could be an
opportunity.</div><a name="10010767000231"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Robert
Cunningham:</b></i> When I looked at this, it was not just
about what we can do to other people, it was also about what this means
to the bottom line of our business, because we have to raise money and
pay for things. So, if this becomes an unwieldy burden, it will become
a problem for us. I hadn&#146;t really thought of it in the context
of &#147;can you designate a flood plain?&#148;, but that sounds
quite interesting. If it was a feature with a demonstrable effect on
downstream flooding, one would imagine that that might be
possible.</div><a name="10010767000232"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Fran
Hitchinson:</b></i> When I read the Bill, I had similar
thoughts and thought it could be an opportunity in those respects. It
does talk about a natural feature and we thought, if the plains have an
effect on downstream flooding or you can demonstrate that a woodland
has an impact on downstream flooding, it would make sense to protect
that feature as you would a hard feature. That seems an opportunity. If
that feature is also going to have other wider landscape benefits for
habitat, recreation and biodiversity in other ways, then by protecting
that feature for flooding, you are also protecting all those other
public benefits. That seems to me to be a win-win
scenario.</div><a name="10010767000233"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jenny
Bashford:</b></i> First, I am glad we have a member on the
Committee, which is
excellent.</div><a name="10010767000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is absolutely right and we have made a note in the representations we
have made on this that they do seem quite onerous and quite difficult
to see what the register of features actually means. This goes back to
the earlier question that was raised about the duties and
responsibilities. Throughout the Bill there seems to be a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column51" />Column number: 51</div>lack of challenge. We have got this emergency now with the flooding. We
need to get some flood-risk management in place, to have an overall
strategic role and to see how that is going to hit the ground as it
were and what that actually means. It is very important that, going
forward, this has a number of appeals mechanisms built within it, so
that people are allowed to challenge on the basis of stopping the law
of unintended consequences. A fundamental weakness of the Bill seems to
be that there is very little challenge. I do not know whether you put
that in through a mechanism that is called an appeals process on
individual parts, but there needs to be a mechanism throughout the Bill
on the various aspects so that people have the right to challenge what
is being proposed by the Environment Agency. We have looked into this
in some detail and said, yes, there is an appeals process that allows
you to appeal against the notice, but there is no ability for appeal
against what is in the notice. That is actually what people want to do.
You might have all sorts of things being designated as features that
you can do nothing
about.</div><a name="10010767000235"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
74</b><b class="B"><a name="10010767000464"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> I was very taken by what Jean Venables said
about the definition of flooding. If she could elaborate a bit more,
how would she like to see that further
defined?</div><a name="10010767000236"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr.
Jean Venables:</b></i> I have a concern about the fact that
flooding is defined as when water appears on the surface, yet we know
that damage occurs when water reaches within a certain
distance&#151;say, 0.3 metres&#151;below the surface. That damages
roads, railways, properties and foundations. That is recognised in the
benefits of flood systems, so I would want to see that term amended or
have reassurance that it does not affect existing practice. I have a
real concern about
it.</div><a name="10010767000237"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
75</b><b class="B"><a name="10010767000465"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> Am I correct in understanding that there used to
be regional engineers attached to DEFRA to do some of the maintenance
work? Where have they gone and what was their relationship to the
Environment
Agency?</div><a name="10010767000238"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr.
Jean Venables:</b></i> DEFRA had a team of engineers who, as
you said, were regionally based and extremely knowledgeable about local
circumstances. They assessed the schemes that came forward. They were
disbanded and the duties were taken over by the Environment Agency, so
there is very little engineering expertise within DEFRA at the moment,
as a result of that group
going.</div><a name="10010767000239"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
76</b><b class="B"><a name="10010767000466"></a>Mr.
Drew:</b> My question is for Jenny from the NFU. It continues
from Roger&#146;s points about flood alleviation. Although I know we
have a problem with security of food supplies, I have long believed
that farmland in some cases is sensibly usable for holding water. On
the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee, we battled for a
long time to formalise that single farm payment. It does happen, but it
is not widespread. I wonder what your views are and whether you think
that this Bill should be a vehicle for forcing that funding issue to
the surface, so that we can legitimise what I think is an appropriate
way in which we use land at least to stop property from flooding
inexorably?</div><a name="10010767000240"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jenny
Bashford:</b></i> To some extent, you are right. The NFU
position is that it is up to individuals to make decisions on the best
way to take their businesses forward. I also think that you are right
that that kind of valuation 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column52" />Column number: 52</div>work needs to be done in order for people to make informed decisions and
to take their businesses forward. It is another weakness of an enabling
Bill that there is very little on the funding and financing side of
this. Yes, at least in principle, we agree with what you are
saying.</div><a name="10010767000241"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Robert
Cunningham:</b></i> I just want to say that there has to be a
clear distinction between funding for the active use of land for flood
alleviation and the unintended or natural flooding of land. There are a
number of schemes, some of which have nature reserves in them and some
of which are continuously farmed, where the Environment Agency manages
a reservoir that fills periodically, lopping off the flood peak. Those
schemes exist, and they will either own the land or have some agreement
with the farmer.</div>
<a name="10010767000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other
issue is when land that is either currently defended or undefended
becomes covered in water under natural circumstances, which in itself
acts as a storage capacity for water in an extreme event. It is more
difficult to say how you would compensate for those natural flooding
events. We can enter into agreements for re-routing land,
agri-environment schemes and what have you, but one of the difficulties
arises when you have fragmented land ownership. How do you get
neighbouring landowners to manage things in one ideological unit? What
if one landowner in that ideological unit does not want to enter into
an agreement to accept floodwater and that creates
problems?</div><a name="10010767000243"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr.
Jean Venables:</b></i> I would like to add that there is an
awful lot of infrastructure that is absolutely vital to our daily
civilised life that is underneath and alongside farmers&#146; lands,
which means that flooding the land would be very detrimental to the
infrastructure.</div>
<a name="10010767000244"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
77</b><b class="B"><a name="10010767000467"></a>Mr.
Robertson:</b> My question is for Miss Bashford. As I
understand it, there is already legislation that requires riparian
owners to maintain waterways. It quite often does not happen. Is there
a need for this Bill to revisit that legislation, or do you think that
the legislation is strong enough but is just not applied? How would you
assess
it?</div><a name="10010767000245"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jenny
Bashford:</b></i> River maintenance is another big issue that
we have brought up in our representations on this Bill. There are
certain obligations on the Environment Agency to do a certain amount of
riparian maintenance, which simply is not happening. It is one of those
cases where if the organisation that is representing the Government is
not seen to be doing their job it does nothing to encourage anybody
else to do theirs, so there is a bit of a circular problem going on
here. It would be very helpful if there was something in the Bill that
put an obligation on the agency&#151;going back to that question
about the obligations and responsibilities of the agency&#151;to do
some riparian maintenance.</div>
<a name="10010767000246"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
78</b><b class="B"><a name="10010767000468"></a>Mr.
Robertson:</b> It is quite often individuals who are riparian
owners. That includes farmers&#151;it is not entirely farmers but it
does include them. Again, I have seen evidence where that has not
happened, where they have not done what they are supposed to have done
in terms of maintenance and repair. Sometimes councils have an
obligation to ensure that they do it, but in some cases, it is simply
not working. Do you think we should revisit
it?</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column53" />Column number: 53</div><a name="10010767000247"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Jenny
Bashford:</b></i> Again, there has to be a balance. It would
be very unfair to put an onus on individual members&#151;whether that
be farmers, smallholders or whoever is on the small rivers
system&#151;and not give an obligation to the Environment Agency to
maintain the main rivers. When we look at the scale of impact, it is
pointless to have someone doing something on a small stream in the
uplands somewhere, when downstream, it is causing an enormous blockage
because of lack of maintenance by the Environment Agency. If it is
going to be revisited, I think we would be happy for it all to be
revisited, not just one part without the
other.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
79</b><b class="B"><a name="10010767000471"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> I thank the experts for being with us and
braving the elements this afternoon. I would like to start with
Mr. Mills, but Tony Smith may want to comment on this
matter. In the way that some of the roles and resources are allocated
under the Bill, do you consider, especially in terms of sustainable
drainage systems, that it is more appropriate for water companies
ultimately to become responsible, particularly new ones? If the systems
flood and cause a spillage from the sewerage system, water companies
are more likely to have the expertise to prevent and deal with
flooding.</div>
<a name="10010767000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">Related to
that point, with regard to the public sewerage system and linking
infrastructure from major new developments, when such developments
apply for planning permission, would it be beneficial for water
companies to be statutory consultees, on a similar basis as the
Environment Agency, so that they could either reject outright or
withhold permission for such developments to go ahead, particularly if
the existing infrastructure was considered incapable of taking the
waste water from such developments to connect to the sewerage system?
We are ultimately trying to find a way in the Bill to end once and for
all the automatic right to connect, and I do not think that we are
quite there yet on the systems. Obviously, Ofwat will have a view on
this. Would the water companies, if they were agreeable to our
suggestions, look to Ofwat to review the regulatory mechanism to allow
them to raise funds for these
responsibilities?</div><a name="10010767000255"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Phillip
Mills:</b></i> May I take the questions in reverse order? You
mentioned the automatic right to connect. Certainly one of the Pitt
recommendations is that there should be an end to the automatic right
to connect to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column54" />Column number: 54</div>the public sewerage system and we fully support that, but the Bill as it
stands does not deliver it. Certainly for SUDS, if the SUDS are
constructed in accordance with standards that we have not seen, the
developer can connect them to the sewerage system, and the
SUDS-approving body just has to consult the water and sewerage company.
We do not know what &#147;consult&#148; means in that case, but we
are concerned that a third-party body&#151;the SUDS-approving
body&#151;has authority to allow connection to the public sewers, but
does not have the accountability or the responsibility to deal with the
implications of that
decision.</div><a name="10010767000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are similar clauses later in the Bill, which allow developers to
connect directly to the public sewerage system if there is an agreement
in place, but there is nothing in that agreement that allows water
companies to specify the location or even object to the connection, so
they are far from happy with the Bill as far as it goes on ending the
automatic right of connection, because it basically does
not.</div><a name="10010767000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
for SUDS ownership, that could address some of those issues, but local
authorities also have responsibilities for grounds maintenance and
public open space maintenance, which is where most of these SUDS would
sit. At the moment, there is a variation of views among water companies
about whether local authorities or water and sewerage companies are
more appropriate as owners. There is major concern though about
funding, maintenance and resources, which I think was discussed this
morning. There is concern that local authorities may not be
sufficiently funded or may not have the resources to maintain SUDS
features, and if the features are not maintained they may not continue
to serve the function for which they are designed. As I think you
implied, that could have significant implications for the sewerage
system, with the water coming into the SUDS being discharged at the
same rate, which could lead to downstream foul flooding of properties;
SUDS should be designed to minimise
that.</div><a name="10010767000258"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
80</b><b class="B"><a name="10010767000472"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> In that regard, would you consider water
companies to be better placed than local authorities to become the
approving body? To me, the role of the local authorities should be to
grant planning permission, and I do not see that they will have
anything like the expertise needed, just in terms of engineering
capability. They do not currently undertake on a massive scale these
types of projects, and I know that at the moment we do not seem to know
where many of these SUDS are. The exception to that, I believe, are the
SUDS in relation to main roads, in that the county councils probably
have the expertise. Would the water companies that form your membership
be willing to step into the breach, and would you look to raise the
funds to enable you to do
so?</div><a name="10010767000259"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Phillip
Mills:</b></i> On the SUDS that are associated with highways,
the highways authority manages those, but I do not think we are talking
about those. What are really concerning are SUDS that are part of new
housing or commercial developments. You are right that water and
sewerage companies&#151;rather than local authorities&#151;which
employ sewerage engineers have those skills and resources, so you could
make that argument. As I said, some water and sewerage companies see
themselves better placed to manage SUDS features, but other water and
sewerage companies at the moment do not share that view, so there is a
split view.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column55" />Column number: 55</div><a name="10010767000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">You are
right&#151;local authorities don&#146;t have the skills or the
expertise to decide what can be discharged and where a discharge can be
made to the public sewerage system. They must get that information from
the water and sewerage company. The Bill says that they must consult.
We don&#146;t think that is sufficient. There is nothing in the Bill
about their having to take note of what the sewerage company or the
water and sewerage company says. If the SUDS feature discharges to a
watercourse, which it could do, rather than to the public sewer, then
the SUDS-approving body or the developer would, I believe, require a
discharge consent from the Environment Agency. We feel there should be
something similar for a SUDS discharge to provisions for a public
sewer. There should be a discharge consent which sets out the
conditions of that discharge, and that would include the requirement to
maintain the SUDS
feature.</div><a name="10010767000261"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
81</b><b class="B"><a name="10010767000473"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> Mr. Mason, would Ofwat be agreeable
to considering a review of the regulatory mechanism to allow water
companies to take on these additional responsibilities? We clearly
heard from the local authorities earlier this afternoon that they are
going to be hard pressed to fulfil the new responsibilities. My concern
is that, if we proceed with the powers in the Bill as they currently
stand, we are not going to resolve the flooding that could arise from
SUDS or from the fact that there will be no end to the automatic
connection. Would you look favourably on
that?</div><a name="10010767000262"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Keith
Mason:</b></i> I think we would have to consider the
proposals. The Bill as it stands has some difficulties, as Phillip
outlined. If the water companies were to have control and they could
decide whether something could be connected, it would be important. It
may well help with another of their difficulties with the Bill about
the long-term maintenance of SUDS. We would need to consider the
quality of the things that were adopted. Similar points come up with
the adoption of private sewers about whether the SUDS were fit for
purpose when they were adopted. There is a quite a lot to think about,
but the suggestion might have some advantages and would certainly deal
with some of the difficulties in the current
proposals.</div><a name="10010767000263"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
82</b><b class="B"><a name="10010767000474"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> I have one last point on water companies. I
understand that the Bill as currently drafted would exclude water
companies from tendering for major infrastructure projects. I am not
quite clear how these projects are currently defined. Would it not be
more acceptable if you were at least allowed to tender, as you in the
water companies probably have more expertise on how deliverable these
major infrastructure projects will
be?</div><a name="10010767000264"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Phillip
Mills:</b></i> The short answer is yes. Water companies have
delivered &#163;85 billion-worth of investment in infrastructure
since 1980. They have delivered it very successfully, generally on time
and to budget. That is part of the current regulatory framework. The
new proposals seem to exclude water companies from bidding for certain
types of infrastructure, which have not been specified. Our concern is
twofold. First, the type of infrastructure to which the Bill refers
needs to be identified. That should be specified by the Government or
the Minister and should be subject to consultation.</div>
<a name="10010767000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
water companies, because of their successful track record, and/or any
group or joint venture companies that they may form, should be allowed
to bid for such 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column56" />Column number: 56</div>work. There should be a level playing field. Otherwise we are denying
potential benefits to customers and to the environment by excluding
them.</div><a name="10010767000266"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Tony
Smith:</b></i> May I comment on the sustainable drainage
question? We are very much in favour of sustainable drainage solutions,
but it is important that the ownership is clear. We would be concerned
about water companies stepping into the breach if that were seen in any
sense as a substitute for other bodies not having either the resources
or the skills to do what is rightly their responsibility. We would be
very concerned if we thought that water customers in some way were
paying beyond what they should rightfully be paying as a result of
that.</div><a name="10010767000267"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
83</b><b class="B"><a name="10010767000475"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> May I just clarify that the role of the SUDS is
to retain water to prevent future flooding? With the greatest of
respect, what does a council understand about that, as opposed to a
water company with its engineering
expertise?</div><a name="10010767000268"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Tony
Smith:</b></i> Well, they do have responsibility for quite a
lot of the causes of water problems. I think that one of the problems
with SUDS in the past is that they have not made enough progress
because a lot of players have got to play their part. So it is not
obvious who should own sustainable solutions&#151;I agree with that.
We certainly would not be totally against the idea, but if there was
any sense in which water companies, which have resources and skills,
were substituting for others, I think that water customers would be
concerned about that.</div>
<a name="10010767000269"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Keith
Mason:</b></i> I just wanted to comment on the large
infrastructure projects, if I may. I think that the intention, and it
was probably only for a very small number of very large projects, is to
get the lowest possible and most advantageous price. One of the
difficulties that could arise if the water companies were allowed to
tender is that they might skew the market, because an infrastructure
project will be providing services to the incumbents. If you then allow
the incumbents to be part of the tendering process, people may well
think, &#147;What is the point in us tendering for this?&#148;,
because you have not got a level playing field.</div>
<a name="10010767000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think the
regulations were looking to assume that associate companies were
participating, so we were not ruling out entirely participation by the
owners of water companies, but it may look a bit strange that the water
companies themselves were allowed to tender for something that would
then be providing services back to them.</div>
<a name="10010767000271"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
84</b><b class="B"><a name="10010767000476"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> But are they not best placed? I will put the
counter-argument to you&#151;presumably, if you take a major project
like anything to do with the sewerage system and the ancient sewers in
London, if the incumbent does not improve that system, they could be
sued for not providing a system that was fit for purpose and you, as
Ofwat, would be the first to say that they had failed in their duty to
provide a proper sewerage service.</div>
<a name="10010767000272"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Keith
Mason:</b></i> I think that it would depend on the type of
project. Again, quite a lot of the capital works are already outsourced
to other people who provide the work. The importance of the Bill is to
give clarity about what the responsibilities are in respect of that
piece of infrastructure or non-infrastructure that we are talking
about. If you are talking about a reservoir, or perhaps 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column57" />Column number: 57</div>the Thames tideway, the responsibilities of the infrastructure service
provider and of the incumbents would need to be clear, certainly in
terms of the consultation to which Phillip referred.</div>
<a name="10010767000273"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Tony
Smith:</b></i> I just want to make a quick comment on large
infrastructure projects. We can see the potential value of introducing
an element of competition into the process and I agree that the wider
the range of potential competitors the better, in that sense. However,
we have some concerns, in the sense that if it meant that you might
have a higher cost of capital and therefore a higher price for
customers, you might not necessarily get best value out of such a
deal.</div>
<a name="10010767000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, we
would look very closely at such deals, because it may be that there are
risks left with water customers that would not arise if you acted
through the conventional routes that water companies normally use. So
we have slightly different concerns, but I think that the scope of the
range of competitive input is
important.</div>
<a name="10010767000275"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
85</b><b class="B"><a name="10010767000477"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> May I move us on to the potentially thorny
subject of social tariffs? I have a slightly different question for
each of you.</div>
<a name="10010767000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">To Phillip
from Water UK, I know that several of your companies have tried to
introduce social tariffs, or at least expressed a desire to do so,
especially Thames Water in London, where that is a very big issue. How
many of your member companies would like to introduce social tariffs,
if they were given the opportunity, beyond the current WaterSure
tariff?</div>
<a name="10010767000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">May I ask all
three of my questions? You could then perhaps answer me in turn. This
one is to Ofwat: Keith, we have always had the reply back from Ofwat
that it was not within your remit to allow what I think Regina
described as the transfer of money from one group of customers to
another. As I said, this sounds rather like the high-water mark of
Thatcherism hanging over us, but other regulators have managed to do
it. I accept that you believe that you need something to change before
you can do that. To change that remit, would primary legislation be
needed, as in the Bill&#151;or, rather, as is not in the
Bill&#151;or is there another way of changing your remit to allow you
to permit social tariffs? Finally, to Tony at the Consumer Council for
Water, would you support that?</div>
<a name="10010767000278"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Phillip
Mills:</b></i> To my knowledge, there are five companies that
have some form of social tariff&#151;Wessex Water, South West Water,
Anglian Water, Welsh Water and United Utilities&#151;although those
may be on a trial or pilot basis. I cannot confirm how many other
companies have put forward proposals to Ofwat in their charger
scheme.</div><a name="10010767000279"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
86</b><b class="B"><a name="10010767000478"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> Let us get this clear, because I understood that
beyond the limited WaterSure scheme you were not allowed to have a
social tariff that effectively subsidised one group of customers but
not
another.</div><a name="10010767000280"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Phillip
Mills:</b></i> The WaterSure scheme is a separate scheme that
is linked to the vulnerable groups regulations, and all companies have
to provide that. There are some pilot social tariffs, effectively, that
those companies  have in place at the moment, but I think that
they  are probably for a fixed term, and presumably they are
linked to the current charging scheme and will have a finite period. I
think that there probably needs to be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column58" />Column number: 58</div>more work on the costs and benefits derived from those schemes. It could
be argued that introducing social tariffs at this moment may be
premature, because it could pre-empt the recommendations, or any
legislation that would enact the recommendations, from the recent
Walker review, which has a number of recommendations on affordability
and debt, and those are not covered.</div>
<a name="10010767000281"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
87</b><b class="B"><a name="10010767000479"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> It would not exactly be pre-empting, as Walker
supported that.</div>
<a name="10010767000282"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Phillip
Mills:</b></i> Yes, but you would potentially need
legislation to bring in some of those
recommendations.</div><a name="10010767000283"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
88</b><b class="B"><a name="10010767000480"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> This is legislation; that is the point. This is
probably the only bit of legislation on the subject that we will get
for several years.</div>
<a name="10010767000284"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Phillip
Mills:</b></i> Well, we think that it is very important that
some legislation should be brought in now, through the Bill, to address
the major problem of debt that results from people not paying their
water bills. The debt currently stands at &#163;1.2 billion, and half
of that is due to tenants in rented properties. We have been working
with the Walker team and the three landlord associations&#151;the
Residential Landlords Association, the British Property Federation and
the National Landlords Association&#151;to develop a set of
principles that would see landlords responsible for water charges for
rented properties, but they could discharge that responsibility by
providing information. That has been picked up by Anna Walker, whose
team we have worked with on that. Her recommendations state that
legislation should be changed as a matter of priority, so we would
really like to see that change introduced by the Bill. I believe that
we have support on that from our colleagues at Ofwat and the Consumer
Council for Water.</div>
<a name="10010767000285"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
89</b><b class="B"><a name="10010767000481"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> The debt issue is a slightly different
thing.</div><a name="10010767000286"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Keith
Mason:</b></i> You are right, in that we would not want to
see any extension of cross-subsidy between groups. As Phillip
mentioned, we have allowed pilot schemes on social tariffs, which
companies are working through. That is in addition to the WaterSure
scheme. One of the key aspects of that&#151;it is linked to the debt
issue&#151;is that companies, as part of the pilots, are able to show
that the collection rates from those different types of tariffs are
better, hence the reduction or lack of increase in bad debts. That
means that those sorts of tariffs do not increase the amount of
cross-subsidy, so groups of customers are not paying to support other
groups. We would therefore look to legislation, and to the Government
in particular, to be quite clear about which groups would be the
recipients of such cross-subsidy, so that it was clear that the
Government had decided that that is what they wanted to see. That could
then be implemented through tariffs. We are encouraging companies to
come forward with social tariffs that pay for themselves, and to try
them out through
pilots.</div><a name="10010767000287"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
90</b><b class="B"><a name="10010767000482"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> So let us be clear: if we take the dangerous
position that we actually want to help poor people and that that is a
good thing to do, even if it increases some other people&#146;s water
bills slightly, you think that at the moment you cannot do that without
primary legislation.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column59" />Column number: 59</div><a name="10010767000288"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Keith
Mason:</b></i> I think it would be clearer if that was the
will of the Government. We could then implement that and be very clear
that the tariffs that we approved had the backing of
Parliament.</div>
<a name="10010767000289"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
91</b><b class="B"><a name="10010767000483"></a>Nia
Griffith:</b> May I push you further on that before we move
on? Are you saying that, at present, you can allow some pilot schemes,
and can allow something if it does not involve cross-subsidy? I am not
sure how you allow a social tariff without incurring some sort of
cross-subsidy; the subsidy must come from somewhere. Are you saying
that, at the moment, you can only do that, and that you cannot do
anything that has a more overt form of
cross-subsidy?</div><a name="10010767000290"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Keith
Mason:</b></i> At the moment, we would not like to increase
the amount of cross-subsidy from one set of groups to
another.</div><a name="10010767000291"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10010767000484"></a>Nia
Griffith:</b> Are you saying that you actually cannot do
it?</div><a name="10010767000292"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Keith
Mason:</b></i> We may feel that it is discriminatory against
some of the powers and duties that we have to increase the amount of
cross-subsidy. Again, to be perfectly clear, there is already an
existing cross-subsidy with some of the other tariffs, particularly the
rateable value tariff, when compared with metered tariffs. What we
would not want to do is extend it. We do not think that it is our job
or remit to say which social groups should benefit at the expense of
others.</div><a name="10010767000293"></a><div class="hs_Para">Coming
back to the pilots, companies have said that there will be no increase
in cross-subsidy, because&#151;Phillip alluded to this&#151;the
generality of customers pay for the bad debts of others. The extent to
which the bad debts record is improved for certain social groups if
these tariffs are introduced means that the net new cross-subsidy is
zero. At the moment, bad debts are a form of cross-subsidy, because
people who do pay are paying for the bills of people who either cannot
or will not
pay.</div><a name="10010767000294"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
92</b><b class="B"><a name="10010767000485"></a>Nia
Griffith:</b> Are you saying that the fact that there is no
existing legislation would cause you to have to make decisions that you
feel are not yours to make? Therefore, are you actually saying that you
need some form of detailed, prescriptive legislation to be able to
progress on social
tariffs?</div><a name="10010767000295"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Keith
Mason:</b></i> Yes. I think it would be much clearer for all
concerned if Parliament made it clear that there were particular social
groups that we wished to increase the cross-subsidy for. If the
Government did that, we could implement
it.</div><a name="10010767000296"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
93</b><b class="B"><a name="10010767000486"></a>Nia
Griffith:</b> And you see legislation as the best way
forward?</div><a name="10010767000297"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Keith
Mason:</b></i> Yes.</div>
<a name="10010767000298"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Tony
Smith:</b></i> I agree entirely that there is an urgent need
to address the issue of water affordability. There is a problem with
water affordability now, particularly in some areas of the country, and
it will only get worse as the switch to metering causes some customers,
particularly larger families, big increases in their
bills.</div><a name="10010767000299"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have pressed companies and Ofwat quite hard to carry out a number of
these pilots. Will the pilots address the issue of affordability? I do
not think so. They might help with debt, and they may help customers
save water and therefore save money, but I do not think that they will
address the issue of affordability.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column60" />Column number: 60</div><a name="10010767000300"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the Anna
Walker review pointed out, there is a range of possibilities to address
the problem. The crucial issues are what the right set of
recommendations are and who should pay, because customers are concerned
about potentially cross-subsidising other customers through social
tariffs. We certainly are very much in favour of Government, through
legislation, introducing a set of proposals that require them either to
act themselves or at least to specify what should happen, and what
Ofwat and water companies should do about
it.</div><a name="10010767000301"></a><div class="hs_Para">Should
this legislation do that? Our concern is that we know from our research
of customers who have been affected by flooding that there is an urgent
need to address the issue. We would certainly not want to see this Bill
held up at the expense of customers, in terms of flooding, to address
the issue of affordability, but that issue definitely needs to be
addressed very
urgently.</div><a name="10010767000302"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
94</b><b class="B"><a name="10010767000487"></a>Mr.
Reed:</b> I have a question for all of you. It is a plea for
advice as much as anything else and I hope that you can help me put
something to bed one way or the other. I recently walked around my
constituency during and immediately after the floods in west Cumbria
and the neighbouring constituency in south Keswick, Cockermouth,
Workington and so on, and there was an overriding public chuntering,
which may or may not be founded&#151;that is why I am seeking
help&#151;on the water drainage network in this country and the
perception that it has got significantly worse since privatisation. I
make no ideological point&#151;private ownership can be very good in
some circumstances, public in others. However, is there any evidence
either way&#151;for or against&#151;to suggest that the water and
drainage infrastructure in this country has got significantly worse
since privatisation? That&#146;s the first
question.</div><a name="10010767000303"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
Mr. Mason, Ofwat has said, I think, that it sees this Bill
as the first step in a wider review of legislation in the water and
sewerage sectors. What might the other steps be? I would be very
interested in
that.</div><a name="10010767000304"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
final question is to Mr. Mills. From a layperson&#146;s
perspective, an awful lot of the flooding that we see in this country
and I&#146;ve seen over the past 10 or so years has occurred in
semi-rural or rural areas. That gives rise to another suspicion. Again,
it&#146;s not an allegation on my part; it&#146;s a suspicion that
I&#146;m hoping to be able to get to the bottom of. Do your member
companies&#151;I would have thought that this would be standard
business practice&#151;invest more heavily in the high-yield, urban
areas where there are more customers, at the expense of the more rural,
lower-yield areas such as Gloucester, west Cumbria and so on? We can
name a lot of
places.</div><a name="10010767000305"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Tony
Smith:</b></i> I would be interested in Ofwat&#146;s and
water companies&#146; views on the hard data to either agree with you
or not agree with you. As far as customers are concerned, what we see
is that actually things have improved quite significantly for
customers, in the sense that crucial things for them like the
performance of the sewerage system to avoid sewer flooding has
significantly improved over the last few years. We&#146;ve been
encouraging water companies and Ofwat to address these problems each
five years when the prices are reset. Certainly in the price review
that has just finished, there&#146;s a programme of well over
&#163;1 billion on sewer flooding alone. That has happened in the
past, too. So as far as the consumers are concerned on the issue of
sewer flooding, the effect on them has significantly reduced.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column61" />Column number: 61</div><a name="10010767000306"></a><div class="hs_Para">In relation to
other aspects of the service, consumers recognise the performance is
actually very high. We do customer research to find out their views on
the performance of companies and their satisfaction with the service,
and it is extremely high. It&#146;s actually much higher than for
energy companies, telecoms companies and local authorities. So in the
customer sense, the news is pretty good. It&#146;s not perfect. The
companies still make mistakes. There are still issues, as you&#146;ve
just been pointing out, but in the round, it has improved dramatically
over the last few
years.</div><a name="10010767000307"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10010767000488"></a>Mr.
Reed:</b> I am really pleased to hear that. You&#146;re the
first person to give me a detailed answer of some kind to that question
after months of asking. Mr.
Mills?</div><a name="10010767000308"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Phillip
Mills:</b></i> I could say I rest my case, but there are
hard, detailed data. Keith can probably explain better than I can that
companies return data annually to Ofwat&#151;the June return. I guess
we&#146;re talking about drainage infrastructure here. It will
include details on that. Ofwat will seek to ensure the serviceability
of that infrastructure&#151;that it&#146;s working effectively,
it&#146;s not deteriorating and it is maintained. It will allow for
that in the price limits. If there&#146;s deterioration there,
that&#146;s reflected in the incentives to the particular
company.</div><a name="10010767000309"></a><div class="hs_Para">You
talked about high-yield areas&#151;about urban and rural areas.
Companies have statutory obligations, and that&#146;s irrespective of
urban and rural differentiation. Obviously, it can cost more to service
customers in rural areas because of the physical lengths involved and
getting people out there, but if we&#146;re talking about, for
example, sewer flooding, which Tony just mentioned, yes, there&#146;s
over &#163;1 billion being identified of the spend in the next
period, starting in April. Almost &#163;1 billion was spent over the
last five years. Ofwat quite rightly insists on this: there has to be a
cost-benefit analysis and prioritisation of the sewer flooding schemes.
Certain schemes in urban areas may be more cost-effective because more
customers will benefit for &#163;0.5 million there than would in a
rural area. So there could be some favouring of more densely populated
areas, because more customers will benefit from the pounds
spent.</div><a name="10010767000310"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
95</b><b class="B"><a name="10010767000489"></a>Mr.
Reed:</b> I have a question for all of you. It is a plea for
advice as much as anything else and I hope that you can help me put the
matter to bed. I walked around my constituency during and immediately
after the floods in west Cumbria and the neighbouring constituency in
south Keswick, Cockermouth, Workington and so on. There was an
overriding public chuntering, which may or may not be well
founded&#151;that is why I am seeking help&#151;about the water
drainage network in this country and the perception that it has got
significantly worse since privatisation. I make no ideological
point&#151;private ownership can be very good in some circumstances,
public in others. However, is there any evidence either way&#151;for
or against&#151;to suggest that the water infrastructure, the
drainage infrastructure, in this country has become significantly worse
since privatisation? That is the first
question.</div><a name="10010767000311"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
Mr. Mason, Ofwat has said that it sees this Bill as the
first step in a wider review of legislation in the water and sewerage
sectors. What might the other steps be? I would be very interested in
that.</div><a name="10010767000312"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
final question is to Mr. Mills. From a layperson&#146;s
perspective, an awful lot of the flooding that we have seen in this
country over the past 10 or so years has 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column62" />Column number: 62</div>occurred in semi-rural or rural areas. That gives rise to another
suspicion. Again, it is not an allegation on my part, but a suspicion
that I hope to be able to get to the bottom of. Do your member
companies&#151;I would have thought that this would be standard
business practice&#151;invest more heavily in the high-yield, urban
areas where there are more customers, at the expense of the more rural,
lower-yield areas such as Gloucester, west Cumbria and so on? I could
name a lot of
places.</div><a name="10010767000313"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Tony
Smith:</b></i> I would be interested in Ofwat&#146;s and
water companies&#146; views on the hard data either agreeing or not
agreeing with you. As far as customers are concerned, what we see is
quite significant improvements, in the sense that crucial things for
customers, such as the performance of the sewerage system to avoid
sewer flooding, have significantly improved over the past few years. We
encourage water companies and Ofwat to address those problems every
five years when the prices are reset. In the price review that has just
finished, there is a programme of well over &#163;1 billion for sewer
flooding alone. That has happened in the past, too. For consumers, the
effect of sewer flooding has been significantly
reduced.</div><a name="10010767000314"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
other aspects of the service, consumers recognise that performance is
very good. We do customer research to find out their views on the
performance of companies and their satisfaction with the service, and
it is extremely high&#151;much higher than for energy companies,
telecoms companies and local authorities. In the customer sense, the
news is pretty good. It is not perfect&#151;the companies still make
mistakes and there are still problems, as you have been pointing
out&#151;but in the round, the service has improved dramatically over
the past few
years.</div><a name="10010767000315"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
96</b><b class="B"><a name="10010767000490"></a>Mr.

almost &#163;1 billion has been spent over the past five years. Ofwat
quite rightly insists on a cost-benefit analysis and prioritisation of
sewer flooding schemes. Certain schemes in urban areas may be more
cost-effective because more customers will benefit from &#163;500,000
spent there than would from that sum being spent in a rural area. There
could be some favouring of more densely populated areas, because more
customers will benefit from the pounds
spent.</div><a name="10010767000318"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Keith
Mason:</b></i><b class="B"> </b>I think there have been improvements
since privatisation. In terms of the amount of money spent by the water
companies: there is a figure of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column63" />Column number: 63</div>&#163;80 billion with which a number of people will be
familiar as the investment that companies will have made by 2010, and
we have just set price limits that allow a further &#163;22
billion.</div><a name="10010767000319"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
significant proportion of that was to do with improving water and
effluent quality, but a rising proportion&#151;over 50 per
cent.&#151; particularly in the years 2010 to 2015, will be to do
with capital maintenance, which is about maintaining asset networks
such as water mains, sewerage and the above-ground kit that the
companies have, and that is increasingly important. Tony spoke about
reductions in sewer flooding, and you could quantitatively measure the
reductions in pressure problems since privatisation, so I think that
there has been significant
improvement.</div><a name="10010767000320"></a><div class="hs_Para">Overlaying
that&#151;to talk a little about why we think that further change is
needed&#151;is the impact of climate change. It is coming along
incrementally, but it will come along and it will have a significant
impact. Some of the flooding incidents and the more frequent, heavy
storms that we have seen could well be due to climate change. Equally,
population growth is a factor. There will be more people in the
country&#151;we have seen demographic increases coming along quite a
lot.</div>
<a name="10010767000321"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is those
things that we see as the next steps after this Bill, in particular the
things that we have talked a little bit about: the implications of the
Walker review and the Cave review that are not part of the Bill. We
would like to see them included in legislation as soon as possible.
That is where we see the next steps, particularly the newish challenges
of climate change and population
growth.</div><a name="10010767000322"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
97</b><b class="B"><a name="10010767000491"></a>Mr.
Reed:</b> Those sums are generally impressive&#151;there
should be no doubt about that. Is Ofwat absolutely clear that water
users and customers in rural areas are receiving the same service from
water companies as those in urban
areas?</div><a name="10010767000323"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Keith
Mason:</b></i> The duties that the water companies have apply
to rural customers as they do to urban customers. Some companies will
say that they have more problems in urban areas than they do in rural
areas, and other companies will say the reverse. We want all customers
to be protected equally, whether they be urban or
rural.</div><a name="10010767000324"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given
the size of companies, the measures that we look at are, to some
extent, averages across the areas used by the water companies, so it
would be much more difficult for us to say, yes, that area is
particularly difficult. However, as companies improve their knowledge
of their systems and their water zones, they can pinpoint more of the
difficulties in particular areas. Again, there is variation across
companies in the size of the zones, but the knowledge that companies
are gaining is improving greatly day by day, and certainly year by
year.</div><a name="10010767000325"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
98</b><b class="B"><a name="10010767000492"></a>Mr.
Reed:</b> I would like to press you on that one more time. It
may not be Ofwat&#146;s problem&#151;it may be that the regulatory
framework is insufficient&#151;but surely, given engineering efficacy
and the economies of scale in the investments required in urban areas,
urban customers get a better service from water companies when it comes
to water drainage than rural customers
get.</div><a name="10010767000326"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Keith
Mason:</b></i> I do not have any quantitative evidence to say
that. I cannot say that there is anything to substantiate that, or that
that is the case.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column64" />Column number: 64</div><a name="10010767000327"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Tony
Smith:</b></i> I should like to put some flesh on the bones.
One of the things that we do is look for the areas where there are
problems&#151;hot spots, as we call them. Part of our job is to bring
pressure to bear on water companies, the regulator and anybody else who
needs that pressure. It is true to say that there are hot spots in the
country. For example, there might be areas where the water quality, or
at least the taste of the water, is not up to the standard elsewhere,
and it is our job to bring pressure on the water company concerned and
on Ofwat at the time of regulatory reviews. So there are hot spots
around the country and areas where provision is far from perfect, but
it is not necessarily to do with rural environments. Some problems with
the sewerage system actually happen more in urban areas than in rural
areas. I would not classify it as a rural-urban problem, but there are
hot spots to
fix.</div><a name="10010767000328"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
99</b><b class="B"><a name="10010767000493"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> Have you examined the places with 100 per cent.
charging rather than the alternative? What is your verdict on
considering those compared with the ones that have rates for the cost
of
water?</div><a name="10010767000329"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Tony
Smith:</b></i> Sorry, could you repeat the
question?</div><a name="10010767000330"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10010767000494"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> In my constituency, everyone has a meter. I do not
know if there is anywhere else where that applies. Have you compared
the two types of
area?</div><a name="10010767000331"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Tony
Smith:</b></i> Yes, we have. Companies vary quite a lot in
how many meters they have, as you rightly said. The Isle of Wight is
unique. There are big differences in how customers are charged and in
the resulting effects on different customers. It is true that, in the
long term, charging for water on a meter is probably a good thing for
customers; the problem is that the transition causes some customers
problems.</div>
<a name="10010767000332"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the
transition is made compulsory&#151;in other words, if customers are
forced to have a meter&#151;the people who lose out tend to be people
with large families who cannot easily reduce the amount of water they
use and may be in a low rateable value home. They are likely to get a
big hit. In an area where people can opt for meters, the people who
will benefit most opt for a meter, leaving other people with
increasingly high bills. That is a problem in some areas of the
country&#151;particularly in the south-west and, to an extent, in the
Anglian areas&#151;where companies have fairly large percentages of
metering but not everybody has yet switched to a
meter.</div><a name="10010767000333"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
100</b><b class="B"><a name="10010767000495"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> So are you saying that mandatory introduction
would be fair, but non-mandatory would
not?</div><a name="10010767000334"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Tony
Smith:</b></i> No, I am not really saying that. I am saying
that whatever way you choose to make the transition from non-metered to
metered, some customers will benefit a lot and some customers will not
benefit at all; it will have a big impact on them. That goes back to
the point about affordability. That is one crucial reason why water
affordability is so important. Various areas of the
country&#151;particularly the south, obviously&#151;are moving
towards metering, either compulsorily or optionally, and it is having a
big impact on some
customers.</div><a name="10010767000335"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
101</b><b class="B"><a name="10010767000496"></a>Mr.

Smith:</b></i> No, it would not. If you implement metering
over a period of time, you can take customers with you. They become
aware of water meters through word of mouth, which encourages them.
There is a way to implement metering while taking customers with you,
but a lot of it is about the speed of implementation, how it is
communicated and protection for customers who really cannot do anything
to reduce the amount of water that they use. That is the challenge for
the water industry in future: to implement metering effectively without
alienating
customers.</div><a name="10010767000337"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
102</b><b class="B"><a name="10010767000497"></a>Mr.

I do not know when that
was.</div><a name="10010767000338"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Tony
Smith:</b></i> It was long before my time. I do not know
whether any of my colleagues can
comment.</div><a name="10010767000339"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Phillip
Mills:</b></i> I was working in the industry, but not with
Southern Water. I was with a water company, and we had smaller trials.
There were one or two issues with people, as Tony mentioned, who had to
use large volumes of water for health problems. That is taken care of
currently through the WaterSure vulnerable groups regulations. Again,
it is something identified by Anna Walker in her
report.</div><a name="10010767000340"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
103</b><b class="B"><a name="10010767000498"></a>Mr.
Drew:</b> Can we clarify the situation on critical
infrastructure? I include reservoirs within that, although technically
they are different. First, does the Bill clarify that there is now a
clear steer away from new provision in flood risk areas? I know that
that will link with planning, but how does the Bill interact with
planning? Secondly, what additional encouragement does the Bill give
water companies to re-site some of those facilities in due course? I
know there is no immediate imposition upon them, but do you see the
Bill as encouraging that?</div>
<a name="10010767000341"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Phillip
Mills:</b></i> The civil contingency secretariat is doing
some work on that. Its national hazards team is creating a national
resilience plan, so there will be nine sector plans. That is separate
from the Bill. They are being drawn up by the different
Departments&#151;DEFRA is drawing one up for the water sector. The
water companies have quite a number of the critical and national
infrastructure identified sites. I understand, reading from my notes,
that they have completed the first draft of that resilience plan, and
they now have to stitch the nine plans together. There has been a delay
because of the interdependency of the different sectors.</div>
<a name="10010767000342"></a><div class="hs_Para">As you
realise, the water sector is very much dependent on energy, both for
pumping treated water, sewage treatment works and sewage pumping. To
some extent, the energy sector is dependent on the water supplies, but
getting to the nub of that is taking time. We can look at
Mythe&#151;obviously, we are all familiar with the floods of
2007&#151;which was ultimately lost, but even if it had been
protected and saved but the local substations had gone down, it would
have been difficult to maintain supplies. There needs to be a
co-ordinated plan between energy and water sectors and, of course,
between transport sectors as well, because companies would need to get
to those sites. That is a little further down the line at the moment,
but we understand that it is being addressed.</div>
<a name="10010767000343"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is also
a consultation out at the moment on the strategic framework around the
critical infrastructure. I do not think that in the Bill there are
medium drivers 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column66" />Column number: 66</div>for companies looking at moving sites. Keith mentioned the PR09 process,
and we are just setting the final determinations for the next five
years. Companies have put in schemes and they have worked with Ofwat as
part of the price review, to look at criteria or the framework of
developing resilience schemes. Quite a bit of funding has been agreed
over the next five years for improving the resilience of
assets.</div>
<a name="10010767000344"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
104</b><b class="B"><a name="10010767000499"></a>Mr.
Drew:</b> Keith, do you want to give Ofwat&#146;s
perspective on this?</div>
<a name="10010767000345"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Keith
Mason:</b></i><i class="I"><b class="B"> </b></i>In the review of pricing, the
industry has just said that there is a lot of money for resilience. In
the Bill, there are no particular clauses that go directly to that.
Some are tangential in terms of the co-ordination of dealing with
flooding and the responsibilities for that. There is a clause on
reservoirs, but it is certainly not going to re-site reservoirs. There
will be a risk assessment of reservoirs, and SUDS might defer the
construction of more infrastructure. Apart from that, it could be
tangential.</div>
<a name="10010767000346"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
105</b><b class="B"><a name="10010767000500"></a>Mr.

greater clarity in the legal framework?</div>
<a name="10010767000347"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Keith
Mason:</b></i> I think it is a question of waiting to see
what these national resilience plans look like when they come out and
the extent to which things have been identified by the security
services. They have all been funded in the pricings.</div>
<a name="10010767000348"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Tony
Smith:</b></i> My perspective is a customer&#146;s
perspective. We did some research at the time of the floods in
Gloucestershire and again in Hull. The issue of water companies and
electricity companies and other crucial service providers protecting or
moving the infrastructure was a high priority for customers. Certainly,
we are encouraged by the work on the critical infrastructure, but the
question is whether it goes far enough. In areas where it would not be
classified as critical infrastructure, there might be vulnerability,
and we need to look at that.</div>
<a name="10010767000349"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
106</b><b class="B"><a name="10010767000501"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> This is another price review-related question,
first to Mr. Mills, although others may wish to comment. A
lot of your member companies spend a great deal of money on what could
broadly be termed environmental measures, but include things such as
reducing leakage, which we all agree is a good thing, even though we
might grumble when our bills go up slightly as a result. With the
experience of PR09 just behind you, do you think that the current
regulatory regime is too tight? Has it unduly restricted environmental
measures by your member companies? By implication, do we need to look
Ofwat&#146;s remit in the environmental respect as well?</div>
<a name="10010767000350"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Phillip
Mills:</b></i> Companies have, as I said earlier, statutory
duties that can cover environmental remits and they will be funded
through the regulatory process. You mentioned leakage, and Ofwat has
decided on a certain level for addressing leakage. You are probably
aware that, certainly for London, the leakage level was less than the
incumbent water company wanted to spend, but that is part and parcel of
the periodic review process. I do not necessarily think that there need
to be changes to the regulatory framework to address environmental
spend.</div>
<a name="10010767000351"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Keith
Mason:</b></i> We have allowed in price limits the bulk of
the things that companies want to do in respect of the environment. I
cite in particular catchment management 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column67" />Column number: 67</div>schemes: there are more than 100 catchment management schemes at this
price review compared with the last price review in
2004.</div><a name="10010767000352"></a><div class="hs_Para">Something
else from the price review that is perhaps overlooked is that we have
taken away the incentive for companies to increase the amount of water
that they sell to customers, particularly their metered customers, by
saying that, based on the assumption that we make about revenues, if
customers use less water, water companies will not miss out because we
will allow them to recoup the revenue they have lost. There is a
stronger incentive now in the water efficiency measures for companies
to encourage their customers to use less water, whereas in past reviews
there was not. If a drought encouraged companies to use more water,
that would be billed and they would get greater revenue. There is now
no incentive in this review for companies to do that because that money
would just get clawed back.</div>
<a name="10010767000353"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
107</b><b class="B"><a name="10010767000502"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> One point that I do not think has been discussed
is Water UK&#146;s concern about the hosepipe provisions in the draft
Bill. Could you give us some guidance on how those could be
clarified?</div><a name="10010767000354"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Phillip
Mills:</b></i> Obviously, during the last drought there was a
lot of confusion about how customers could and could not use water. We
are slightly disappointed that the Bill does not take that forward. It
still only specifies or prohibits the watering of private gardens using
a hosepipe and the washing of motorcars using a hosepipe. That is the
same as the current legislation. We think that other uses should be
specified. People&#146;s habits and practices have moved on since
that legislation came out. We think there should be a range of other
activities such as cleaning patios and drives, cleaning the external
surfaces of buildings and operating ornamental fountains. Those are all
domestic activities. We think they should be specified in the Bill so
that there is absolute clarity about what is covered and what is not.
If there is a real impact on people&#146;s livelihoods or the
economy, such as in horticulture, carwashes and window cleaning, we
accept that there would need to be a drought order or non-essential use
ban. We think that there should be more clarity in the
Bill.</div><a name="10010767000355"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is concern about the time scales and the requirement to advertise in
two local papers. It could take up to two weeks before companies could
introduce 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column68" />Column number: 68</div>restrictions. There is also an issue about representation. If it was
just for hosepipe bans and such domestic activities, we think it could
be overly bureaucratic and further delay the process for the
restrictions, which would be necessary to maintain critical supplies to
customers. Yes, there are areas of particular water uses and temporary
bans where we feel the Bill falls short of what it should be
saying.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
108</b><b class="B"><a name="10010767000503"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> That is helpful. Reverting to something that we
discussed earlier, I have some sympathy with the Minister&#146;s
comment that we should wait, but we are committed to publishing a White
Paper and a major Bill if there are any changes after the general
election. As for social tariffs, it would probably be for the wider
Bill to absorb the conclusions of Walker and Cave. I found some of the
comments that have been made interesting, but I do not believe that it
is necessarily the right time or place for that&#151;similarly for
metering.</div>
<a name="10010767000357"></a><div class="hs_Para">As regards
bad debt, I think that there was some urgency because of fuel poverty.
However, I am taken by the fact that you, as water companies, are
disadvantaged compared with other utility companies. If there was scope
to include that in the Bill, where would it be best placed? I realise
that it is not your Bill, but where do you believe it would be
best?</div><a name="10010767000358"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Phillip
Mills:</b></i> Obviously, it will have to go in the water
management section of the Bill. There is a clause that covers
concessionary charges for community groups, which obviously has been
included for a reason. I think that a clause covering bad debt and a
requirement to provide information to water companies by landlords to
discharge their responsibility for the charge could follow the
concessionary charges clause. It is not directly linked, but it is
about
charges.</div><a name="10010767000359"></a>
