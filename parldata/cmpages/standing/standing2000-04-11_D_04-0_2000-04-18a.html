<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Mr. Mike O'Brien):</B> I beg to move amendment No. 28, in page 3, leave out lines 11 to 14 and insert-

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`Exceptions from section 19B for decisions not to prosecute etc.19D. Section 19B does not apply to-

<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Welcome to a day in Committee, Mr. O'Hara.

<P>
The Government's primary objective is to ensure that we preserve the role of the criminal court as the sole forum for determining guilt, while keeping the exemption from section 19B as narrow as possible. That is in accord with the findings of the Phillips royal commission in 1981, which stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>publicly calling into question a decision not to prosecute could amount to a trial of the suspect without the safeguards which criminal proceedings are designed to provide.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I shall address the Government amendment first and then turn to amendment No. 21 and new clause 5 tabled by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey (Mr. Hughes).

<P>
The Government amendment is necessary to ensure that our policy objective is fully met. As it stands, section 19D exempts a decision not to institute criminal proceedings. It also exempts an act taken for the prupose of making a decision not to institute criminal proceedings. However, it does not exempt a decision to terminate or not to continue proceedings once a decision to institute proceedings has been made. It needs to do so if the policy objective is to be fully met.

<P>
The Crown Prosecution Service, for example, rarely institutes proceedings. Instead, it decides whether to continue proceedings that have been instituted by the police. I understand that the Crown Prosecution Service decides not to continue about 12 per cent. of all criminal cases that have been instituted by the police and passed to them for prosecution. We want to treat those similarly to decisions not to prosecute that have been taken by the police. The amendment therefore ensures that a decision by the CPS or other public prosecutor to discontinue proceedings will be exempt from section 19B. Also, in line with the current exemption, it provides that, where a decision to discontinue proceedings has been made, an act done for the purpose of enabling that decision to be taken is exempt. It further provides that acts done for the purpose of securing that proceedings are not continued are exempt. That is necessary to deal with the fact that in many cases the court, not prosecutors, discontinues proceedings. I commend the amendment to the Committee.

<P>
I understand the intention behind the amendment and new clause tabled by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey, which were suggested by the Commission for Racial Equality. They seek to find a way to square a circle, to reconcile two conflicting and laudable public interests. On one hand is the public interest to ensure that individuals have a right to a remedy for discrimination-that is what the Bill is about. On the other is the public interest to ensure that those accused of committing crimes are tried not in the civil courts or by the media, but in the criminal courts, with the safeguards that criminal proceedings are designed to provide.

<P>
The Government resist the amendments, not because we do not wish to reconcile those competing interests, but because we do not think that the amendments achieve that reconciliation. I am also unconvinced that putting the CRE in a position to second-guess the criminal courts is a wise move for the CRE or for justice.

<P>
The amendment and the new clause would make racially biased decisions not to prosecute unlawful. Individuals would be given no remedy against such unlawful acts, but the CRE would be able to mount a formal investigation on the basis of, for example, patterns in section 95 data. The Government's concern is that, in exercising the power, the CRE would find itself conducting objective assessments of individual cases, which could have cast doubt on an individual's innocence, while leaving them without recourse to a criminal process.

<P>
There are additional concerns in relation to Scotland. To allow the CRE to conduct formal investigations would detract from the independence of the Lord Advocate as head of the systems of criminal prosecution and investigation of deaths in Scotland. To give the CRE the power to investigate decisions not to prosecute would give it stronger powers than those of the Scottish Parliament or the civil courts.

<P>
I do not oppose the intention behind the amendment and the new clause, which is to search for a way to narrow the exemption from section 19D, but I believe that we are all agreed that the preservation of the role of the criminal court as the sole forum for determining guilt is a proper and necessary objective. The Government believe that the amendment and the new clause would undermine that, and we must, on that basis, oppose them.

<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes </B>(Southwark, North and Bermondsey): Welcome back to the Committee, Mr. O'Hara. like the Minister, I will speak to both the Government amendment and to the amendment and new clause tabled by myself and my hon. Friend the Member for West Aberdeen and Kincardine (Sir R Smith). As the Minister said they all seek to deal with the same issues. I am grateful that the Government have responded to the debate in the Lords on Opposition amendments. Ministers said then that they would come back with a proposal, and it is reasonable to assume that the Government amendment is the result.

<P>
Although on the face of it this set of issues looks small, behind it is one of the key issues that prompted the Bill. The Minister will be aware that, because the Bill was a proper, rightful and applauded response to the Macpherson inquiry, and if it is to do the job properly, it must address, among other things, the whole process of criminal investigation and prosecution, including the way I which the courts act. I am concious that, as the Minister said, we must try when addressing the problem to act according to the public policy objectives that we hope to achieve.

<P>
It must be right that the decision not to prosecute is taken on the grounds of the evidence before the prosecuting authority, whether in England and Wales, Northern Ireland or Scotland-my hon. Friend is much more qualified to talk about the position in Scotland than I am. That process must be independent. I agree entirely with the Minister that decisions cannot be second-guessed or subject to review that might open them either to civil proceedings or media campaigns, which may suggest that decisions can be overturned. The criminal law would be nobody's friend or defender if that were to happen.

<P>
In that context, we are aware that the Government and other are rightly thinking about whether cases that have resulted in a decision not to proceed on a technicality might be brought back if new evidence arises, as is happening in the Lawrence case and other. I have always taken the view that the old legal principle that one makes a decision only once has to be able to reconsider as a matter of public policy if new evidence and circumstances come into the domain of the public prosecutor subsequent to the original prosecution. We would all want that in the proper process in response to colour-blind, race-blind, gender-blind or religion blind decisions about guilt or innocence. The two public policy thresholds that are rightfully always followed by the Crown Prosecution Service when it does the job properly are whether there is a better than average chance of securing a conviction and whether it is in the public interest to institute criminal proceedings. The CPS is right to retain those two criteria.

<P>
If there is prejudice and discrimination in the collection and investigation of evidence, cross-examination of suspects and all the procedures that precede a decision whether to prosecute-rightful cause complaint, as there was in the Lawrence case-we must ensure that remedies are available. The Minister is right that amendment No. 21 and new clause 5, which are meant to be read together, were originally suggested by the CRE and have been tabled by my hon. Friend and I to probe the combination of language to deal with the issue.

<P>
New Clause 5 would disapply the enforcement part of the Race Relations Act 1976 to a later act of discrimination that consists soley of a decision not to institute, so removing from the challenge decisions not to institute proceedings. Amenndment No. 21 would omit the original exception, which Ministers now accept was drawn too widely. We would be left with a provision that although narrower does not preclude debate.

<P>
Although I do not pretend to have thought through all the implications of the Governemnt's amendment, it certainly seeks to make the decision and any decision on going ahead with prosecution inviolate for the purposes of challenge. I am cautious about saying that the Government amendment is perfect, but I am not saying that it does not go in the right direction. In such legal territory, we need to get the terminology right. Amendment No. 28 proposes that
(b) where criminal proceedings are not continued as a result of a decision not to continue them, the decision and, where such a decision has been made-<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(i) any act done for the purpose of enabling the decision whether to continue the proceedings to be made<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
should be exempted. That is potentially still quite wide. I seek nothing more than the right wording. We need to ensure not only that the evaluation of evidence leading to the decision is inviolate and that evidence can be considered entirely on its merits, but that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>any act done for the purpose of enabling the decision whether to continue the proceedings to be made<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
cannot be interpreted too widely?

<P>
On first examination, the wording seems okay; it seems to suggest that consideration of whether proceedings should continue is to do only with the CPS-the prosecuting authority, to which the police hand over their evidence. If that is so, that is much better than at earlier stages of an investigation. The one thing that we on the Liberal Democrat Bench are keen to ensure is that we can get at the sort of complaint that was rightfully upheld by the Lawrence inquiry.

<P>
As the inquiry found, from the first reporting of the attack on Stephen Lawrence and his death, through several stages of that investigation, things that should have been done were not done and others that should not have been done were done. Those two general complaints, sometimes about the response of individual police officers and sometimes about the failure to pursue lines of inquiry, were clearly upheld by the Macpherson inquiry. Some of the conclusions-in that case, as in others-were wrongly drawn.

<P>
One of the bigger mischiefs that emerged from the Lawrence case was the completely justified complaint that judgments were sometimes formed on who was the victim and who was the assailant. The real horror of the case was that, at times, the assumption was made that Stephen Lawrence or the friend who he was with must have been the party to the attack-the aggressor and the assailant. That was the unacceptable attitude displayed by some of those involved in the case. Subject to a definition being limited to the protection of the prosecutorial assessment process and a review of earlier processes, we are going in the right direction.

<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
Having talked to colleagues in the other place and elsewhere, I should be grateful if, between now and Report-possibly about the time we finish in Committee-I could talk to the Minister or his advisers to ensure that we cover the mischief of the Lawrence case, as the Lawrence inquiry recommended, so that we do not include the earlier stages of proceedings, where prejudicial behaviour must be covered.

<P>
On its own, new clause 5 may be too narrow. Therefore, having only that in the legislation may not go far enough. However, I want to ensure that we do not preclude people examining activities of the police or other agencies that could be prejudicial in the collection, assessment and passing on of evidence.

<P>
In conclude with an example that extends beyond issues to do with race relations. Over the years, there have been enough cases in which evidence has not been followed up by the police and certain corrupt police officers have decided not to pursue lines of inquiry or concealed or got rid of evidence. We have to ensure that persons who, in their professional capacity, use evidence in a discriminatory way are not exempt from disciplinary or other proceedings that the law would expect Parliament to allow.

<P>
The lessons that we all need to learn is drawn from one of the sad truths of the Lawrence inquiry: Stephen's parents, with whom, like others, I have met and talked, felt that they had nowhere to go to put the case that they were unfairly discriminated against. There was no proper forum for them to do so. The intention of the Bill is to ensure that that does not happen when people feel that they have a justified complaint. We need to make sure that this part of the Bill addresses that concern as fully as any other part.

<P>
I am grateful for the response, as far as it goes. As I have said, my hon. Friend and I want to ensure that we cover everything intended. We shall not, however, press the amendments, but are happy to subscribe to the Government's amendment for the time being.

<P>

<B>Mr. David Lidington </B>(Aylesbury): As the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey implied in his introductory comments, this matter was debated at some length and in considerable detail in the House of Lords. The Government have redrafted the Bill following those debates.

<P>
I want briefly to pursue two lines of questioning, to which I hope the Minister will respond. The first concerns the distinction made in Government amendment No. 28 between a decision not to institute criminal proceedings and a decision that criminal proceedings should be instituted. Under amendment No. 28, once a decision has been made not to commence criminal proceedings, exemption from the other provisions of the Act appies retrospectively to acts
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>done for the purpose of enabling the decision  to be made.<P>
</UL></FONT>
 <P>
However, if in a parallel criminal case, a decision is made that proceedings should go ahead, no such exemption appears to apply to decisions taken by the CPS and other agencies. I am concerned to explore whether my interpretation is correct, and the Government's reasons for making that distinction.

<P>
Secondly, I invite the Minister to say a little more about the scope of the amendment applying to acts
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>done for the purpose of enabling the decision whether to institute criminal proceedings to be made.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey also commented on the point. To what extent do the Government think that amendment No. 28 would apply to actions taken by the police? Will police actions fall within the category of decisions in paragraph (a)? The police will have to decide whether to arrest someone.

<P>
Having served recently on the Committee considering the Terrorism Bill, I know that the police have to decide whether to apply to a judicial authority for the extended detention of a terrorist suspect in order to give them time to extract further information that might provide sufficient evidence for prosecution to be mounted. As the hon. Member of Southwark, North and Bermondsey said, the police are also responsible for investigating alleged crime and for gathering evidence to pass to the CPS. To what extent are decisions taken by police officers covered by the amendment? If the police are covered, presumably investigative work of agencies such as Customs and Excise will be covered in a comparable manner?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> The hon. Gentleman prompts me to remember a small point that I failed to make. The Government amendment will change the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>for the purpose of making a decision<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>for the purpose of enabling the decision.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It could be argued that that could widen, not marrow, the definition as the hon. Gentleman and I fear.

<P>
<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman.

<P>
My other point is how the amendment applies to the job of the Crown Prosecution Service. As every member of the Committee knows, the CPS has to assess the evidence given to it by the police in respect of two tests: whether it is sufficient to justify prosecution and whether it is in the public interest that the prosecution should go ahead. I am interested to know the Government's thinking on how the arrangements proposed in the amendment would apply to each of those tests. The questions may appear to be purely theoretical, because we all trust that the CPS would always act impartially and dispassionately, but in theory it would seem to be open to the CPS to impose a higher evidential threshold in respect of defendants from one ethnic group as opposed to another in determining whether prosecutions should go ahead.

<P>
Similarly, does the amendment make it lawful and in the public interest for the CPS, in determining its policy on prosecuting certain offences, to pursue prosecutions agains one ethnic group but not another? I would not expect CPS prosecutors to pursue any such policy, but the amendment leave open the possibility that such a course of action could be lawful.

<P>
I agreed with the Minister's declared intention to make as certain as we can that the BIll is framed in such a way that it remains the court only that determines whether someone is innocent or guilty. However, I am still uncertain, having studied the Lords debate and listened to the speeches made earlier this morning, as to what the consequences of the amendment would be. Will the Minister provide clarification?

<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The effect of the amendment is that the collection of evidence by the police would not be covered by an exemption if it were improperly done. However, if the information was an
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>act done for the purpose of<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
making a decision to prosecute, not collecting information, that would be the subject of the exemption. For example, a decision not to prosecute by the police will be covered and any act done in the making of it will be covered by the exemption; but if they have interviewed a suspect at any earlier stage and behaved wrongly, that will not be covered by an exemption. I take the hon. Gentleman's point that clarity is needed and I will make sure that we provide it to cover that situation, so that those who subsequently read the legislation will be clear about our aims.

<P>
I have listened carefully to the hon. Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Lidington) and for Southwark, North and Bermondsey. I want to be satisfied that I have answered the points that they raised about getting the distinction right in this regard.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> The Minister recognises that we are all trying to get this provision right, and I should like to help that process. The amendment includes the phrase:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>for the purpose of enabling the decision  to be made;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
An example that worries me is the normal procedure whereby the police collect evidence and hand it over to the CPS, and there is then a meeting between them. The CPS could say, ``On the basis of this evidence, we will not prosecute, but if there were any other evidence, such as somebody seeing the attack first hand, that would tilt the balance if the witness were a good one, because that would take it over the likelihood of conviction threshold.'' That could be interpreted as being
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>any act done for the purpose of enabling the decision  to be made,<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
because the CPS could say ``We now have information and we shall not conclude our inquiries.''. We should consider that sort of practical process, because that is how those bodies work. There is no once-and-for-all handing over of information, then finish: there are often many meetings between the police, who collect the evidence, and the CPS, which decides on the evidence. We need to ensure-soon-that such procedures are covered.

<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I take the hon. Gentleman's point. It is our intention to ensure clarity. I have listened carefully to the points made and I will have another look at the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>any act done for the purpose of enabling the decision  to be made<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
to make sure that it is precise. We are clear about what we intend, but some checking might be required to ensure that the interpretation is clear.

<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
Having said that, I shall deal with a couple of other points that were raised. If the trial goes ahead, allegations of discrimination will be dealt with during that trial. That is an easier position to be in. If the trial does not go ahead, the position would be different. A matter concerning a terrorist would be dealt with under relevant legislation, and it would not be open to someone, during those proceedings, to institute a civil claim. That would take a considerable time, and would not interfere with the proper investigation of a terrorist incident, which-particularly the extension of detention-is usually conducted over a few days.

<P>
The hon. Member for Aylesbury asked me whether Customs and Excise was covered in the same way. The answer is yes, because the provision is for the decision to prosecute. The collection of information is one thing and the decision to prosecute another.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman also asked me how the amendment applies to the balance-of-evidence test by the prosecution and the public interest. He was concerned about high evidential thresholds for one ethnic minority group in comparison with another. The code of practice for Crown prosecutors, when making decisions, is clear. It says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>prosecution is likely to be needed if the offence was motivated by any form of discrimination against the victim's ethnic or national origin.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The CPS prosecution manual provides guidance on that as follows:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`When considering the public interest test, you must balance the factors for and against prosecution carefully and fairly. However, cases in which there is a racial motivation are almost invariably serious; prosecution will usually take place unless there are very powerful public interest factors tending against prosecution which clearly outweigh those tending in favour'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Prosecutors have a positive duty to bring evidence of racial motivation to the attention of the court. That is reflected in the prosecution manual. The achievement of that is is specifically measured, and information gathered during the CPS racial incidents monitoring scheme has assisted us. The Home Secretary's action plan that followed the Stephen Lawrence inquiry showed that, in 1997-98, prosecutors met the objectives in 85 per cent. of cases. So, there is still quite a lot of work to be done, but the CPS is working on it.

<P>
The hon. Member for Aylesbury asked about a high evidential threshold for one ethnic minority group as against another. That will not occur. The matter is not one of the ethnic minority groups concerned, but that racism may be involved in a case. Of course, racism may be prepetrated white against black or black against white. The issue is not ethnic origin, but racism, to which the CPS may have to give extra weight in making the decision. A white man is no more likely to be prosecuted than a black man, but a racist is probably more likely to be prosecuted, because a multiracial society that seeks to succeed needs to express its abhorrence of anyone with racist motivation.

<P>
The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey has said that he will not press his amendment to a vote. I shall look again at its working to satisfy myself that the Government have achieved all that we seek to achieve. I ask the Committee to support the Government amendment.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I do not want overly to extend the debate; I should like to make just two points in response to it. The first follows an implied suggestion of the hon. Member for Aylesbury. It may make for better legislation if we make sure that, if we are ro cover criminal law and decisions to prosecute, the legislation makes clear that the exemption covers the decision to prosecute or not to prosecute.

<P>
I understood the Minister's response that, by definition, if one proceeds with a prosecution there can be argument but, to take an extreme case, that does not mean that there may have been improper behaviour earlier in the process. A decision not to prosecute does not lend itself to being a less improper practice than a decision to prosecute. The legislation may be more clearly balanced and may be seen to by applying the principle fairly across the board if it relates to both, even though by definition there is another forum for one but not for the other. Will the Minister reflect on that?

<P>
Secondly, as well as considering the drafting, so that we cover the decision but not ancillary and earlier events, when the Minsiter replied to the amendments on the immigration and nationality directorate, the Government proposed an amendment that provided for a monitoring process. It draws on previous legislative experience and parallels the terrorism legislation monitoring that the hon. Member for Aylesbury and I recently debated at length in a Standing Committee. I share the view that person cannot second-guess a decision to prosecute. The CPS, however-like the police and the courts-must be subject to a monitoring process. Interestlingly in the terrorism legislation, four parties were represented on the Committee and there was all-party agreement that there should be regular reporting and review of the effect of the legislation and, by definition, the dcision whether to prosecute or not. The person who conducts the review and his predecessors did not go into each decision, but as a test of whether the legislation was working, they looked at the number of decisions to prosecute and at complaints. They talked to the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission.

<P>
I do not have a fixed view, but if there is concern that the CPS, or parallel processes in Scotland, should not be exempt from being monitored, we must ensure that we meet the concern. As in any other public service, there may be systemic discrimination-it may not be against black people, but against others-by a bad egg in the CPS, to put it bluntly, or someone who is not doing their job properly. Will the Minister reflect on how to reassure people that the CPS behaves in a non-discriminatory manner?

<P>
One rather surprising result of the good decision a few years ago to divide the process between the police collecting evidence and the CPS making the decision is that people are often angry with the CPS when it decides not to proceed or to proceed with a lower charge-I do not mean on racial grounds. The Parliamentary Secretary, Privy Council Office, the hon. Member for Sherwood (Mr. Tipping) nods. Constituents regularly complain that the CPS should be going ahead, but is not. We must ensure that we do not say, ``This group of people is immune from scrutiny in the general way'', so that people may be assured that they are not slipshod or inattentive, but are doing their job properly.

<P>
There are issues under the surface. The Committee has at least one more opportunity to get this right and I detect a willingness to do so on both sides. We have moved a little, but not far enough. I am happy that we do not oppose the Government's alternative. However, we reserve our position to return to the matter on Report. I hope that we shall discuss it outside the Committee before then.

<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>
Clause 1, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<H4><center>Schedule 1</center></H4>
<H4><center>Public Authorities</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> I beg to move, amendment No. 33, in page 10, line 15, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(3) In sub-paragraph (1), the term ``government department'' includes non-departmental public bodies and executive agencies.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment would extend the definition in schedule 1 of a Government department to include non-departmental public bodies of executive agencies. I will be brief since the Government's earlier announcement in Committee that they will move towards a generic definition of ``public body'', rather than the list system proposed in the schedule, makes my amendment somewhat otiose. I will give the Minister the opportunity to respond, if he wishes, but I assume that since non-departmental public bodies and executive agencies will be included in the Government's generic description, the amendment has been superseded in that sense and I shall be prepared to withdraw it.

<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Secretary, Privy Council Office (Mr. Paddy Tipping):</B> The hon. Gentleman has done my work for me.

<P>
<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> I am grateful to the Minister and beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> I beg to move, amendment No. 31, in page 10, line 37, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(3) Sub-paragraph (1) does not include any unit or part of a unit which is for the time being on active service.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The amendment would exempt units of the armed forces on active service. As the Minister will know, my noble Friend Lord Cope moved a similar amendment in the House of Lords. The Government took the view that it was unnecessary because it would be wrong to allow the armed forces, even while on active service, lawfully to act in a discriminatory way on the grounds of race or ethnic origin. I should make it clear that I do not intend to endorse an objective of allowing the armed forces to act in such a way, and neither do I think that anyone involved with taking decisions in the armed forces on recruitment and promotion would wish to do so.

<P>
Indeed, from my conversations, particularly with senior officers at the two Royal Air Force bases in my own constituency-Halton and High Wycombe-I have been struck by their vigorous determination to pursue policies that allow for equality of opportunity for people, regardless of ethnic origin. The officers concerned see that as a way of making the best use of the talent available throughout British society. They also take seriously their ambition to ensure that Her Majesty's armed forces are fully representative of the country that they exist to defend.

<P>
The amendment is not about making an exemption on the ground that the armed forces somehow need to be permitted to pursue discriminatory policies. Rather, I seek to defend them from the risk of spurious litigation in respect of acts in the heat of the moment while on active service.

<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
The Under-Secretary said when we debated the concept of indirect discrimination that, although he was confident that the Bill, as drafted, was robust and would allow sensible public policies on the part of the police and other agencies to continue unaffected, nevertheless there was bound to be a risk of legal action, albeit on spurious grounds. Certainly, the report made last week to the Lord Chancellor's Department showed that senior lawyers advising it are concerned that there will be attempts at judicial review and challenge to public policy, partly as a result of the Human Rights Act 1998 and partly as a result of this Bill once it becomes law.

<P>
The amendment would provide a certain defence for the armed forces so that decisions made by officers on active service about which unit or individual should be sent to carry out which duty could not subsequently be questioned by people with all the benefits of hindsight, in the comfort of civilian life, who try to make judgments on how soldiers and other service men and women in the field should be taking decisions.

<P>
<B>Sir Robert Smith </B>(West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine): Is there a working definition of ``active service'' in other legislation that would assist me in understanding whether the amendment should be accepted?

<P>
<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> There is, I believe, a definition. The hon. Gentleman will have to forgive me; I do not have the name of the relevant Act at the forefront of my mind. That point was touched on in the debates in the House of Lords.

<P>
I hope that the Government will be ready to think further about whether there is adequate defence of the armed services from unnecessary and spurious litigation and attempts to second-guess judgments made in the field in the heat of the moment in the light of the best evidence available to the officer at the time.

<P>
<B>Sir Robert Smith:</B> I understand the concern not to constrain forces on active service, because obviously at that point we need them to protect our nation. However, I would be worried if they were exempt from the values of the nation that they were defending.

<P>
On a technical point, my understanding is that the Bill is about how the services would relate to third parties and not the example used by the hon. Member for Aylesbury of an officer deciding where to deploy which troops. That would be an internal matter for the services, rather than an external one for a third party. The Bill will be relevant to how the services behave towards third parties in carrying out their functions on active service. I would be concerned if we were to reduce our values at that point.

<P>
My experience of the RAF was as a cadet at school. The hon. Member for Aylesbury referred to the heat of the moment. Because of the professionalism of our services, the heat of the moment is when all one's training comes to the fore and one is focused on carrying out actions as part of a trained and disciplined force. It is not necessary to exempt the services since the Bill will not constrain them when they are on active service.

<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> I am grateful for the comments made by the hon. Member for Aylesbury about the importance of the armed forces and how, given his experience, he believes that there is a strong commitment to equality throughout the organisation. There is a strong feeling in the armed forces that they had a poor reputation in that regard, although they have worked hard for a number of years to dispel it. Much is being done in that respect through the Ministry of Dfence-Commission for Racial Equality partnership agreement.

<P>
The armed forces do not agree with the amendment, however it is drafted. They believe strongly that they are a public authority. They need to show their commitment to equality and they are making good progress.

<P>
The hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine was speaking with the enormous authority of having been in the cadet force at school. I do not know whether distance coloured his memory, but it had an effect on it.

<P>

<B>Mr. Robert Smith:</B> I may be called up.

<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will be called up, but whether he has seen active service is a different matter. He may have been fitter once. As he rightly ssaid, there is a problem about defining ``active service''. I shall look at the phrase which, as the hon. Member for Aylesbury reminded us, was discussed in the other place. Active service can mean just being a member of the armed forces and taking part in its activities. The day-to-day business of being a member of the forces is defined as active service.

<P>
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will reflect on what I said about the commitment of the Ministry of Defence and the armed forces to take a full part and to feel the full rigours of the Bill. I hope he takes comfort from my undertaking to reconsider the meaning of the phrase ``active service''. I will write to him about it. With that assurance, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
 
<P>
<B>Mr. Lidlington:</B> I am grateful to the Parliamentary Secretary for his response and to the hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine for his comments. We look forward to his military memoirs.

<P>
The Minister will forgive me if I am slightly dubious about his assertion that the armed forces are lined up behind the Government's proposal. Such is the professionalism of the armed services that they will do what any Government, of any political persuasion, tell them to do, however much as they might grumble into their coffee about a Minister's views. When the Conservative party was in office, it was difficult, even in private, to exact from a Royal Air Force officer the remotest criticism of Defence Ministers, even when they were cutting the number of RAF personnel.

<P>
I am grateful to the Parliamentary Secretary for being willing to consider the definition of active service. As I said earlier, the amendment was tabled to avoid any risk of officers commanding troops in the field having to worry about what the lawyers might think some months later when they assess, from an arm chair, decisions that were taken professionally, but often urgently, with little time for reflection or for consulting others.

<P>
I hope that Ministers will reflect carefully on the position, particularly in the armed forces, and generally in the public services. Ministers should carefully consider how best to protect the position of professional and responsible officers or officials who must take difficult decisions and who should be able to do that without worrying overmuch about spurious or malicious legal challenges months later. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 15, in page 12, line 29, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`42A. The Queen's Houseold,'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The amendment would add a new category of the Queen's household to the list, which is an interesting little byway in the Bill. I hope that the Committee will agree that it raises an interesting issue. As the hon. Member for Aylesbury hinted when he moved the previous amendment, we are in a sort of ``Alice in Wonderland'' world, because we are moving amendments to a schedule that will disappear. However, it is perfectly proper to debate whether groups of people who have been suggested for inclusion will be covered by the general proposition. No more obvious question falls to be asked that that relating to the Queen's houshold.

<P>
I have no great military recollections to share with the Committee, although in cadet air force training I rose to the great rank of sergeant. In opposition, we cannot have successes in the same league as those in government, although I know that I need wait only a year for that to change. Some years ago, one of my great successes was a ten-minute Bill in which I argued that the Queen should pay income tax. Lo and behold, she agreed to that within six weeks. The Bill also aimed to ensure that the rules of succession were non-sexist, and I gather that such a change is on the royal agenda too. Buoyed by that success, I raise again the issue of reforming the royal household. That matter seems to be open for consideration, and I hope that we will make progress on it.

<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine and I consider our position to be straightforward. The Queens's household should be covered by the race relations legislation, as all similar bodies are. Committee members may not have reread Hansard, or perhaps they were not present, but on Second Reading of the Bill in the Lords, the Government Chief Whip asid:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>My Lords, I have it in command from Her Majesty the Queen to acquaint the house that Her Maajesty, have been informed of the purport of the Race Relations (Amendment) Bill, has consented to place her prerogative and interests, so far as they are affected by the Bill, at the disposal of Parilament for the purposes of the Bill.-[Official Report, House of Lords, 14 December 1999; Vol. 608, c. 127.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That seems to be an invitation that says, ``Good on you lads and lasses, get on with the job.'' I hope that the monarch and her household can be added to the Bill.

<P>
I will make two or three fairly obvious, but serious, points. First, I am advised that failing to extend the Bill to the Queen's household would put the United Kingdom in breach of its international obligations, which require ratifying states to provide legal redress to all victims of racial discrimination. If we exempt those who work for the royal household, we remove their remedy. That is wrong. Some years ago, we had the same debate about parliamentary staff, and I gather that the International Labour Organisation advised our authorities that it would be inappropriate to exempt black staff or members of the House of Lords, because that could violate the ILO's moral obligations. Parliament was not held to have a special status that justified exempting parliamentary employees. Therefore, the proposition is clear: everybody should be able to avail themselves of the law. The fact that someone happens to work for the royal household-as opposed to being a civil servant in the normal way and working for Parliament or whatever-should be irrelevant.

<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
The precedent, as I understand it, is that the Race Relations Act 1968 included the monarch and the royal household. I am concious that we must have a slight division in our minds. Obviously, there is a difference between suing the Queen as an individual and suing the monarch as an employer and the Crown. We are talking about legal action not involving the Queen personally but concerning somebody who in employed in public service.

<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> Perhaps I can help the hon. Gentleman. He is right to refer to Race Relations Act 1968. Employees of the royal household, however that is defined, are covered by our proposal. As in the convention, the Queen in her personal capacity in not covered.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> That summary is of assistance and hit two nails on the head at the same time; I am grateful to the Minister.

<P>
In the 1968 Act, there was an express inclusion of the royal household. I think that I am right in saying that the Race Relations Act 1976 Act excluded the royal household. I have not worked out the reason for that and I may be corrected by Ministers. My understanding is that the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 included the royal household. Certainly, two of the three Acts that could be regarded as precedents include the royal household, even the nost recent-for some reason that I do not entirely undertand-does not.

<P>
We are grateful to the Minister for the clarification that the Government's proposed definition includes the royal household. Does that mean that anybody working as an employee and receiving a salary cheque on the payroll would be able to avail himself of the Act in the normal way, if he believed that any of his employer's actions breached the Race Relations Act, as amended?

<P>
<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> Would the hon. Gentleman care to speculate whether the posts of Vice-Chamberlain, Treasurer and Comptroller of Her Majesty's Household are covered by current race relations legislation? There might be protests from the hon. Member for Islwyn (Mr. Touhig) that the Welsh were being discriminated against in their opportunity to take on such posts.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> There is nothing that a Welsh person is not capable of achieving, not least, for many centuries, being the monarch. I do not think that the Welsh have any cause for complaint. Occasionally, they do not succeed on certain playing fields, but that is only a temporary aberration.

<P>
I understand the hon. Gentleman's point. He mentioned three people who are technically members of the royal household, although they are Ministers. I do not know exactly where their allegiance lies; I suppose that it lies with both the royal household and the Government. They are certainly paid by the same person-the taxpayer.

<P>
Will the Act include all public servants, as it were, who work for members of the royal family on the civil list, or members of the royal family when they are carrying out their public duties? Will that include all those who work in any capacity for the royal family, just as those who work for Members of Parliament, or for Parliament itself, are included? I imagine that this is the only time when we will consider the issue.

<P>
The Minister has said that in the end the Bill will include the Queen's household. For the purposes of clarity-it will be clearer when the Bill has been amended on Report-does that mean that the Queen's household and other employees of the royal family, whether on the civil list or not, will be categorised as employees of public authorities? Is that how they will be covered in the Bill? Is their status the same as that of civil servants or others in the schedule 1 list? It looks as if progress will be made and more bastions of the state will fall without overly inconveniencing anyone. I hope that I have encouraged a consensus throughout the Committee that the amendment is a good idea, and I hope that the Minister will accept it.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> In moving the amendment, the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey said that it was an interesting byway. I am tempted to ramble up it, but my hon. Friend the Member for Islwyn would not allow me to do so. The hon. Gentleman spoke again on the basis of his enormous experience as a sergeant in the cadet force. He has obviously risen since: he must be at least a general or a key lieutenant in the Liberal Democrat party.

<P>
I acknowledge the complexity of the subject. We have examined the issues carefully. I was asked about the position of employees who work either for the monarch herself or for people on the civil list. We believe that such people are covered by the Bill. After enormous research, I discovered that the person responsible for employment in the Queen's household is the Treasurer to the Queen and Keeper of the Privy Purse. Legal responsibility falls on that person and there are parallel responsibilities on other royal bodies. The Queen's household carries out public functions through employees, but it has been a long-standing convention that the Queen herself is not covered by this or any other Act of Parliament.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman may wish to modernise the process. I heard what he said about the payment of income tax. I am sure that someone will read ourproceedings and acknowledge his points, but it is not within my gift at the moment to act on them.

<P>
<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> Given what the Minister said about the responsibilities of the Treasurer to the Queen and Keeper of the Privy Purse, do the Government intend the holder of that office to be treated under the Bill as a public body and therefore subject to the obligation to promote racial equality? How will that aspect of the Bill bite on the royal household?

<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> That is clearly our intention.

<P>
The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey asked about parallel responsibilities in the 1968 Act and the Sex Discrimination Act 1975. Rather than bore the Committee with a long and tedious explanation, let me say that the circumstances are not quite as he describes them. He may wish to return to the matter later. I shall write to him in the near future and set out the position in detail.

<P>
The final problem with the amendment, which I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw, is that the term ``Queen's Household'' has no entity in law. The amendment is therefore technically deficient. He will acknowledge the key point that persons employed within the Queen's household are bound by the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I am grateful for the Parliamentary Secretary's reply. I shall open my post with extra eagerness over the next few days, awaiting his in-depth analysis of the legislation as it applies to the Queen's household, or whatever it should properly be called. I will be happy to withdraw the amendment, but may I do two things first? First I should like to pay tribute to a dogged pursuer of these issues-Phillip Hall, whom I have met in the past. I refer those who may be interested to a succinct and well expressed article in The Independent on 10 April by Phillip Hall and Paul Lashmar, who raised the issue with me when we were preparing to discuss it in Committee.

<P>
My second point relates to reality, rather than merely to Bills in Parliament. I understand from the work of Phillip Hall and others, and from inquiries made of the Palace, that 3 per cent. of the total work force of the Queen's household, as it defines it, is drawn at present from ethnic minorities. The household of the Prince of Wales has slightly more than that, but no figures are publicly available for the Queen Mother's household. I do not have the figures for staff working for other members of the royal family who are on the civil list.

<P>
The issue is important. I am encouraged to learn from the article that the Palace recognises that it has the same obligation as any other institution in society to ensure that its recruitment at all levels reflects the society of which the Queen is the monarch and of which members of the royal family are representative. It is a good thing if everyone knows that they are included and that there are no special categories or exemptions. The Queen, in both her Commonwealth and United Kingdom roles, must clearly be seen to be head of a private and a public service that represents the entire community. With gratitude to those who have pursued this and thanks to the Minister for his answer and for the prospect of more, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 22, in parge 3, line 20, after ``(2)'' insert ``and (4A)''.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to ake amendment No. 23, in page 3, line 32, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(4A) Subsection (4B) applies to-<P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(4B) In making the recommendations or giving or refusing the approval regarding terms and conditions of an appointment or the termination of such appointment the Minister of the Crown or Government department or other public authority shall not discriminate against another person.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> We are making good progress. Amendment No. 22 is the peg and amendment No. 23 is the substantive amendment. The amendments relate to a matter similar to that addressed by the next Government amendment. Amendments No. 23 is designed to ensure that office holders are covered by the legislation: it simply aims to give office holders the protection against descrimination that the Bill would give employees.

<P>
As you will know, Mr. O'Hara. the members of the Commission for Racial Euality are themselves appointed. the list of office holders is large, including past chairmen of urban development corporations; people who have chaired the Equal Opportunities Commission; and other propel who were not employees, but office holders under the Crown. Occasionally, Members of Parliament seeking a get-out clause become office holders of the Chiltern Hundreds. The amendment would ensure that there is a non-discriminatory way of dealing with such people. We must ensure that, whatever their racial or ethnic background, members of the community are considered equally, are able to participate equally and have equality of conditions and settlement if their employment is terminated, if they take early retirement, or if they resign from public appointment.

<P>
People in public appointments are often important role models for society. It is important that appointments to the chair of bodies such as Sport England or the arts councils, for example, are seen to be non-discriminatory. There should be no discriminatin against potential applicants and people working in the field.

<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> I am not without sympathy for the arguments advanced by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey. However, the provisions of the Race Relations Act that relate to appointments are complex. The Bill is not the right vehicle for the wholesale revision of those provisions, which involve difficult and complex legal issues. We suspect, for example, that they might conflict with the Nolan recommendations on public appointments, and the process of revising them would be most complex.

<P>
As I said, I have some sympathy with the amendment and I want to give it further consideration. It might be possible to table and amendment on Report, but we have aleady said that we will give substantial consideration to the Commission for Racial Equality's third review of the Race Relations Act, with a view, when parliamentary time allows, to introduce a further measure on the subject. We would also have to consider the Equal Opportunities Commisison's review of the sex discrimination legislation. That said, I do not exclude tabling an amendment on Report. We had the report only yesterday of the result of the case of Perceval-Price and others v. Department of Economic Development and another, and we want to consider it.

<P>
We will keep open the option of tabling an amendment on Report, but we are favourably disposed to the concept of bringing appointments within these provisions. It will be a big job of work to do that properly, and we may have to leave it for a further legislative opportunity. For now, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> First, I give in to the Minister. I do not have a brief on the case reported yesterday and he has a host of civil servants to help him, so he is one jump ahead of me.

<P>
I am grateful for the Minister's response. I am aware that a general review of legislation is in train and I am happy about that backstop, although I hope that there will be an early opportunity for amendment. To put it bluntly, I will be troubled if there is no commitment to the proposal in the next Labour party manifesto. People are concerned that we should get the matter right and that it should not be lost in the long grass. The Minister is right to say that it is not just a matter of race equality; gender equality and other issues must be considered. My colleagues and I made a commitment in our previous manifesto to a comprehensive equality Bill, because we think that that is the right way to ensure that all those other matters are addressed.

<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> We have said publicly that we propose to implement, through one or more Bills, several features of the CRE and IOC reviews. That is a clear commitment, not a vague proposal for the distant the future that may never come to pass. It is a question of waiting until parliamentary time allows.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I was waiting to hear that phrase before the end of the Minister's intervention. I understand that, and the Minister knows that I have been supportive of the Government's intention, expressed since they entered office, to introduce legislation on the subject. I have no reason to disbelieve them when they say that they will do so as soon as is reasonably possible. The danger with ``as soon as parliamentary time allows'' is that it might mean five years down the track, as well as next year.

<P>
Finally, it would be helpful if the Minister would also undertake-on the record or otherwise-to refer the matter formally to the Nolan Committee; that can be done by correspondence requesting the Committee to add it to its work plan. In that way, we will have not lost an opportunity to adopt that approach as well. If the Minister agrees, I am happy to put it on my shopping list of matters to discuss with him and with the hon. Member for Aylesbury. Were the serried ranks of Conservative Back Benchers here in full strength today, I might have been tempted, with my hon. Friend the Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine, to press the amendment to a Division, but given that we have been so let down by our Opposition colleagues, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment, and to return to it when the Tories have recovered some of their numbers.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 34, in page 3, line 28, at end insert-

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) Subsection (4) also applies to-<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) any recommendation made by a Minister of the Crown or goverment department in relation to the conferment by the Crown of a dignity or honour; and<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) any approval given or refused by such a Minister or department in relation to any such conferment.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The amendment extends the provisions relating to Government appointments that under clause 2 of the Bill apply to dignities and honours. The main form of dignity nowadays is peerage-

<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> Never a truer word spoken.

<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey compliments me on my good briefing by officials. I am using, I understand, the appropriate words, but they cause me some difficulty.

<P>
The amendment provides that recommendations of Ministers and Government Departments in relation to dignities and honours will be brought in line with the existing provision in section 76 of the 1976 Act, covering Government appointments. The Government believe that similarities in the processes of making Government appointments and recommending individuals for honours mean that they should be treated in the same way under the Race Relations Act. The amendment achieves that and I commend it to the Committee.

<P>
<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> I am intrigued by the enforcement mechanism. Will the CRE sit in on the work of the honours scrutiny committee? Will there be investigations into political honours-those given to working peers-as well as into the honours and peerages awarded under the regular honours lists? How do the Government propose to scrutinise the process? How are they to devise a test of whether the grant of honours complies with principles of racial equality?

<P>
There is common ground in the Committee that we all want people from every ethnic and racial background in Britain to be rewarded for achievement and public service. However, I hope that we shall not allow ourselves-albeit with the best intentions-to set a quota for Members of the Order of the British Empire to be appointed from black minorities, or from Wales, Scotland or wherever. That would be an unhealthy state of affairs. I am sure that that is not the Goverment's intention, but well-intended laws sometimes have unintended consequences that are not always to the public's advantage.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> Little amendments quite often conceal a great deal of mischief, so I was looking forward to the Minister's speech in support of the amendment, and he did not disappoint me.

<P>
Like the hon. Member for Aylesbury, I have two factual questions, and one that runs along similar lines to his. My hon. Friend the Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine has prompted me to ask where the policing mechanism is, and that is a serious question. However, to turn to my two questions, I was a bit surprised to hear the Minister say that the most common dignity, as defined in the Bill, is a peerage. When I saw the amendment, my assumption was that it covered all honours-peerages, knighthoods-

<P>
<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> Privy councillorships.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> Yes, Privy councillorships and all the other things in the honours list. It would be helpful to know whether those are included. I should mention that the Minister might, unwittingly, have revealed a state secret. If peerages are, indeed, the most significant sub-category, we might be in for more of them than we bargained for. Some of us would say that we have had enough of them and that the aim of slimming down Parliament might not be served by the Prime Minister or a collective vetting system nominating waves of people.

<P>
The second issue is that we are moving towards a more independent scrutiny system for some honours, and the Nolan Committee is considering other issues. One aspect of the hidden agenda that my hon. Friend and I discussed is that considerable numbers of people-although still a minority-are offered things that they choose not to take. By definition, such things never becomes public, and nor would people want themto. Our question is about the practicalities: if someone is nominated to a House of Parliament or to a particular office, such as the Privy Council, where he has certain powers-less so in the case of holders of titles, MBEs and Officers of the Order of the British Empire-how will the policing be exercised? We loook forward to the monitoring of this aspect of the new dispensation.

<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Departments give advice in relation to honours, and that will be the subject of the challenge. Appointments that are made on the recommendation or approval of Ministers are treated separately in the Bill. Obviously, it will not be possible to challenge the Queen, but it will be possible to challenge the Department that makes a recommendation, because it is right that such recommendations should be susceptible to challenge. However, we hope that challenges will be rare, because we are aware of the sensitive issues that they are likely to raise. Taking all that into account, the Government believe that the proper route for such challenges is probably judicial reivew in the High Court.

<P>
One other issue is whether there should be an appointments commission and what its role should be. Bodies that carry out public functions will be caught by section 19B, and an appointments commission will be such a body. That would be the judicial review mechanism, and Government recommendations or recommendations by an appointments commission would be subject to that policing mechanism. I hope that that addresses the main points.

<P>
The provisions will not affect honours that have already been awarded, but only claims by those who, as a result of discrimination, have not been given an honour or dignity that they would otherwise have received. On that basis, I hope that the Committee will accept our amendment.

<P>
Amendment agreed to.
