I welcome you to the Chair, Mr Amess? May I also thank all members of
the Committee for their participation in Tuesday’s session? It
is sometimes easy to be cynical about changes to Parliamentary
procedure, but that was the first time I have been through that
procedure on a Bill. I hope everybody else found it as useful as I did.
The opportunity to talk directly to the experts who lie behind what is
quite a technical Bill was a very good innovation, and I am grateful to
everyone for their constructive and helpful contributions.<a class="bkMark" name="11051974000013">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">This is a
technical amendment that takes account  of changes to the
procedure for making Scottish  statutory instruments in the
Scottish Parliament. Identical amendments are being tabled to a series
of Acts that are going through Parliament at the moment. For those of a
technical bent, part 2 of the Interpretation and Legislative Reform
(Scotland) Act 2010, which is a Scottish parliamentary Act, came into
force on 6 April 2011, which explains why the amendment is necessary.
The 2010 Act includes provisions on the making of Scottish statutory
instruments, and as a direct consequence of those changes, Westminster
Acts passed after that date have to make specific provision, where
appropriate, for the new measures.<a class="bkMark" name="11051974000014">&#160;</a>

Olympic Games and Paralympic Games Act 2006 gives Scottish Ministers
the power to make advertising and trading regulations, and clause 2
amends the Parliamentary procedure for making these regulations.
Accordingly, the Government amendment ensures that the Bill will
reflect the changes for making Scottish statutory instruments in the
Scottish
Parliament.<a class="bkMark" name="11051974000015">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I would like to join the Minister in thanking all
our witnesses who gave evidence at the sessions on Tuesday, which were
exceptionally helpful and reassuring in enabling our discussions this
morning to be based on evidence and expert advice. That demonstrates
good use of that procedure before scrutiny of the Bill. I also welcome
you to the Chair, Mr Amess.<a class="bkMark" name="11051974000021">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment 3
is a probing amendment, following the evidence on Tuesday from Chris
Allison of the Metropolitan police. In all matters related to ticket
touting, I defer to the expert on ticket touting, my hon. Friend the
Member for Washington and Sunderland West (Mrs
Hodgson)—<em>[Interruption]</em> No, no, no, not in doing it, but
in devising proportionate public policy. We were reassured by the
evidence from Chris Allison, and the purpose of the amendment, which
was tabled before the evidence session on Tuesday, is to probe whether
the maximum amount in the Bill is sufficient to create the deterrence
that everybody would like to see. We want to ensure that ticket touts,
many of whom operate on a large and profitable scale, do not regard the
level of fine as simply an occupational hazard that they can easily
write off in the profit that they make.<a class="bkMark" name="11051974000022">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That was an
issue that we looked at closely during the Beijing games, where the
Minister and I were observers almost throughout. There are limits to
the analogy between the London and Beijing games, but it was reported
in the latter that some type A tickets for the opening ceremony, priced
at the equivalent of £460, ended up on sale for the equivalent
in yuan of nearly £18,000. At our games, the top tickets for the
opening ceremony are £2,012 —there are many people who
put in a bid for such tickets at any price and are now nervously
waiting to see whether £8,048 has come out of their bank
accounts—and could have a very profitable sell-on value. Our
amendment would therefore make sure that a £20,000 fine is not
regarded as an occupational hazard, but is a substantial deterrent to
touting at that level.<a class="bkMark" name="11051974000023">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
conclusion, my hon. Friends and I were greatly reassured by the
assistant commissioner’s evidence to the Committee on Tuesday.
He is a key arbiter regarding the application of the appropriate level
of fine, which he considers to be £20,000. In this probing
amendment, we are seeking similar reassurance from the
Minister.<a class="bkMark" name="11051974000024">&#160;</a>

This debate presents an opportunity to recap some of the excellent
information that we received on Tuesday which, as we have heard, was an
excellent and useful session. Like my right hon. Friend, I hope to
obtain assurances from the Minister. My right hon. Friend tabled the
probing amendments to stimulate debate on this issue, and she has
succeeded in doing so. I know that she is satisfied, as I, along with
the rest of the Committee, following the evidence from the assistant
commissioner on Tuesday, believe that the measures in the Bill are
sufficient.<a class="bkMark" name="11051974000025">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">However,
there are a couple of issues that I wish to raise. I will not delay the
Committee too much because, although they relate to the aims of the
Bill, they do not need to be put into legislation. The first concerns
awareness, which we mentioned on Tuesday, and hopefully the Minister
will discuss it with the London Organising Committee of the Olympic
Games and Paralympic Games. The majority of people who have applied for
tickets do not know that it is illegal to sell them, much less that,
subject to parliamentary approval, doing so could be punishable by a
fine of up to £20,000. As I have said, that is because ticking
touting for almost everything else, while considered unsavoury by many,
is allowed and even supported by the Government; the Minister and I
have our opinions on that matter, which we have debated at length. The
outcome is that people are perhaps more likely to buy from a ticket
tout and might even consider ticket touting themselves.<a class="bkMark" name="11051974000026">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The Minister
said on Tuesday that the rules were stated in the terms and conditions
of sale on the ticketing website. However, I am sure that he, as much
as any of us, may be guilty of not always reading through the boring
bits of small print on a website when buying something, and sometimes
just ticks the box to say that he has read the terms and conditions.
Although I did not go through the process—as I have said, I
intend to buy from the resale exchange facility to test it out—I
understand that applying for the tickets was fairly laborious, no doubt
necessarily so. Having made the selections and decided how many
thousands of pounds they were possibly willing to commit on their
credit card, it would be understandable if an applicant did not have
the patience to read through the small print.<a class="bkMark" name="11051974000027">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Perhaps the
Minister could speak to LOCOG to see if there is a way of making it
absolutely clear to anyone lucky enough to win tickets in the ballot
that they may not resell them through any mechanism other than the
official channels, or in a private transaction, at face value, to
friends and family. Perhaps there could be a bold section on the back
of the ticket, with the full implications in plain English. I do not
think that it is beyond the ticket designers’ ability to
incorporate that section, and I imagine that the tickets have not yet
been designed or
finalised.<a class="bkMark" name="11051974000028">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Other
awareness campaigns would also be appropriate to ensure that people do
not buy from unofficial sources—the Minister referred to that in
his contribution on Tuesday. In his evidence, the assistant
commissioner said that the police would work closely with LOCOG to get
that message out, but perhaps the Minister, and his very able
Department, could also work on
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11051974000029">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">My
next point arises from the assistant commissioner’s evidence, in
which he explicitly said that touts targeting the games are operating
for other music and sporting 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 66<a class="bkMark" name="Column66">&#160;</a>
                           </div>events, and are involved in other criminal activity. That is something
else on which the Minister and I have exchanged views. From reading the
evidence, I am fairly confident that my position has been vindicated,
at least in part, by what the assistant commissioner said. He also
spoke about the impact on the UK’s reputation; touts hanging
around outside venues and transport hubs make a place look lawless, and
that is not the kind of image we want to portray to the people who come
from around the world to see the games.<a class="bkMark" name="11051974000030">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The same can
be said about touts for other types of tickets. Coincidentally, UK
Music published a report on music tourism on Tuesday—the day on
which we discussed this in Committee—which claimed that live
music and festivals are worth £1.4 billion to the UK’s
economy annually, and that people from other countries are responsible
for a fifth of that revenue. It is clear therefore that if touting for
the Olympics is a matter of protecting the reputation of our great
country, efforts should be made to protect our reputation with the far
greater number of people who come here to enjoy some of the fantastic
cultural events that we are known for the world over, such as Wimbledon
and Glastonbury—even the Chelsea flower show, which the Minister
will no doubt have spotted was in the news last week because of ticket
touting. Bringing my remarks back to the Bill, I am satisfied, as is my
right hon. Friend, that the amendments need not be made. I look forward
to seeing the strong public awareness campaign that is needed to
support and improve the
deterrent.<a class="bkMark" name="11051974000031">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">

                           </span> I rise to take the opportunity to
say how delighted I am to serve under your chairmanship, Mr Amess.
Having done that, may I respond to the Minister’s comments about
the evidence sessions? I think that all members of the Committee would
agree that, while it was a very helpful session, the most helpful
evidence by far was given by Assistant Commissioner Chris Allison.
Members will be aware that, in response to a question I asked, he said
very clearly that the £50,000 figure proposed in the amendment
was disproportionate and inappropriate. He went on to point out that,
were we to make the amendment, it might lead us into difficulty because
the court procedures that would have to be followed would be different,
and therefore more time consuming and difficult. He gave us a very
clear steer that we should avoid going down the route proposed by the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11051974000032">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
the issue has been raised by the hon. Member for Washington and
Sunderland West, who rightly takes great interest in these matters, I
hope that the Minister will take her comments on board, and those of
others. There is an urgent need to make clear not only the illegality
of touting and its various forms, but the fact that there will be an
exchange system in place, because many people are not yet aware of
that. The sooner we can promote that more vigorously, the
better.<a class="bkMark" name="11051974000033">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Finally,
may I say to the Minister that, while I am delighted by the assistant
commissioner’s evidence about the vigour with which touting at
the Olympics will be tackled, I hope that the same vigour will be
applied to touting at football matches, as I do not believe that that
is taken seriously enough? We are all very exercised

                           </div>about the issue of touting. We know that measures will be in place for
the Olympics and Paralympics and for football, but

we need to address the issue of touting and what we can do to stop
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11051974000063">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> May I begin by thanking the right hon. Lady the
Member for Dulwich and West Norwood for tabling the amendments? I
understand why she has done so. I suspect that had we been having this
debate 18 months ago I would have done exactly what she has done this
morning. I also thank the hon. Lady the Member for Washington and
Sunderland West for her contribution.<a class="bkMark" name="1105205000001">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">May I say at
the outset—I have said this before to the hon. Lady the Member
for Washington and Sunderland West—that I do not personally have
strong feelings about this, although the hon. Lady does? At the other
end of the debate, some people believe that ticket touting is a
reasonable free-market activity. I do not subscribe to either of those
views; I am happy to be led by the evidence.<a class="bkMark" name="11051974000035">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The original
provisions were included in the 2006 Act. However, when we bid for
almost any global sports event, there is an anti-touting provision in
the host nation contract that we have to sign. It is not just for the
Olympics; it is becoming much more widespread. The original provisions
of the 2006 Act led to a fine of £5,000. As a result of
Operation Podium, the Metropolitan police said that they thought that
fine was insufficient and that it should be £20,000 instead.
This was backed up—and I agree with my right hon. friend the
Member for Bath—by the excellent evidence of the assistant
commissioner on Tuesday. That was an instance where having the expert
in front of the Committee was very helpful. I spoke to him again
afterward the evidence session, and he made it clear that that fine is
sufficient. He was keen that we should stick to £20,000, given
that a higher fine would lead to extra complications.<a class="bkMark" name="11051974000036">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I do not have
a doctrinaire position one way or another; this was driven by the
operational requirements of the Metropolitan police. That is why we
have gone for £20,000. The hon. Lady the Member for Washington
and Sunderland West made a good point about awareness. Yes, we have all
bought airline tickets with two pages of tightly typed conditions,
where we tick the box at the bottom and move on quickly to credit card
payment. If the measure is going to work, it is vital to target
criminality, so that we do not catch out people who have simply done
something that they think will be helpful to a friend. It is vital that
the message about this is correct. I undertake personally to write a
letter to the chief executive of LOCOG to make this point. By good
fortune, we have an Olympic Board meeting this afternoon, which both
the right hon. Member for Dulwich and West Norwood and my right hon.
friend the Member for Bath will attend. I will ensure that we have an
opportunity to report on the progress of the Bill should we conclude
proceedings today, and I will make that point at the board on behalf of
the hon. Member for Washington and Sunderland West so that it gets the
airing that it deserves.<a class="bkMark" name="11051974000037">&#160;</a>

relevant authorities, given that, as we heard from Hugh Sumner and
others at our evidence session, parts of the ORN will support venues
outside London.<a class="bkMark" name="11051974000048">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Clause 5 will
enable the Olympic Delivery Authority to set the penalty charges for
traffic contraventions during the games, and proposes that final
approval of the level of charges for the violation of Olympic traffic
regulations should lie with the Secretary of State for Communities and
Local Government. The purpose of our amendments is to argue that those
final powers and responsibilities should lie with the Mayor of London
instead. That is one way in which Labour believes that the clause could
be
improved.<a class="bkMark" name="11051974000049">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
case is one of consistency and the proximity of accountability.
Significant powers have been devolved to the Mayor in recent years,
including housing, economic regeneration and, most recently by the
coalition Government, full responsibility for the Olympic legacy. It
therefore seems inconsistent that final approval of the level of
charges for violating Olympic traffic regulations should lie with the
Secretary of State rather than the Mayor of London.<a class="bkMark" name="11051974000050">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We now have
devolved government for London. Under the previous Government, in 1999,
the Mayor was given further responsibilities. Through Transport for
London, the Mayor was given the power to impose congestion charges,
emission charges and a workplace parking  levy. We also decided
that the Mayor should have the power to appoint and set the budget of
the Metropolitan

                           </div>Police Authority and to set the budget for the London Fire and Emergency
Planning Authority. Government for London, which had previously been
out of step with other western capitals, was clearly important, and it
has turned out to be popular with Londoners and economically vital to
securing London’s place as a competitive centre for business and
commerce.<a class="bkMark" name="11051974000051">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I make no
judgment about the respective merits of either incumbent in handling
transport issues, but the amendment would establish the important
principle that ultimately, the elected Mayor of London should have the
final say in approving the charges proposed by the Olympic Delivery
Authority. The fines have the potential to be controversial in London
and for Londoners, so it is only right that London’s elected
representative should determine at what level they are set for the
relatively short period in which they will apply.<a class="bkMark" name="11051974000052">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The second
part of our amendment relates specifically to the ODA’s duty to
consult the relevant authorities, particularly in relation to the
Olympic route network that will operate outside London. Having made
those points, I commend the amendment to the Committee, in the
interests of consistency with the other powers that now reside with the
Mayor.<a class="bkMark" name="11051974000053">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I thank the right hon. Lady for the amendment.
As she is a former Minister for London, I understand why she tabled
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11051974000054">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
will deal with the amendments in reverse order. Amendment 2 requires
the ODA to consult the relevant local authorities outside London before
it sets the level of penalty charges, and the ODA has already done so.
Indeed, that was a key part of its consultation. Having considered the
matter last night, it is possible to do what the right hon. Lady seeks.
As she will know, having been in this position herself, the Secretary
of State is able to give binding direction to the ODA under the 2006
Act. We could, if she so wishes, write into the regulations a binding
commitment—a direction—that

                           </div>the ODA must consult all relevant local authorities. We could give such
instructions, which would meet the intention of her
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11051974000055">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On
amendments 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9, the 2006 Act made provision for setting
penalty charges for games-related contraventions in London. The
Secretary of State was given that power because there are venues
outside London, and it was deemed sensible and practical to have one
single body responsible for all the regulations, rather than having two
separate bodies, with one inside London and one outside. Given our
conversation beforehand, and the way in which the right hon. Lady has
set out the issue, I accept that it is important to her and I am keen
to preserve the sensible, co-operative and consensual nature of our
discussion. I do not have a direct answer as to how it might be doable
this morning, but if she is happy for me to do so, I will give the
matter some thought. I suspect it will be difficult to make the Mayor
responsible for contraventions outside London, but we can consider
whether we could have a sort of double lock so that the Mayor is
responsible inside London. I cannot promise the right hon. Lady that
that is possible, but if she will give us time to consider the matter,
I will make sure that my civil servants come back to her with an answer
before
