Question again proposed, That the amendment be made.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that with this we are taking new clause 33—Rail Freight Users' Consultative Committee—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`.—(1) A Rail Freight Users' Consultative Committee shall be established to represent the interests of the customers and rail freight.
<P>
(2) It shall be the duty of the Rail Freight Users' Consultative Committee, so far as it appears expedient from time to time—
<P>
(a) to keep under review matters affecting the interests of the rail freight customers of the railway in relation to freight services and infrastructure;
<P>
(b) to make representations to, and consult, such persons as they think appropriate about these matters;
<P>
(c) to co-operate with other bodies representing the interests of other users of the rail system and services.
<P>
(3) The Authority shall have a duty to consult with the Rail Freight Users' Consultative Committee on all matters relating to rail freight.
<P>
(4) The Rail Freight Users' Consultative Committee shall be recognised as a statutory consultee in respect of—
<P>
(a) proposals for closure of passenger services (whether major or minor);
<P>
(b) proposals for closure of any infrastructure;
<P>
(c) network change procedures;
<P>
(d) all documentation circulated for consultation by the Rail Regulator; and
<P>
(e) reasonable requirements of operators.
<P>
(5) The Rail Users' Consultative Committee shall consist of—
<P>
(a) a chairman appointed by the Secretary of State after consultation with the Authority;
<P>
(b) such members, being not less than 10 nor more than 20 in number, as the Authority may from time to time appoint, after consultation with the Secretary of State and the Chairman, having regard to the variety of interests involved in the carriage of goods by rail.
<P>
(6) The Authority shall provide reasonable accommodation and a secretariat to enable the Committee to perform its duties, together with funds for reasonable travel and expenses of the Committee members.'.<P>

<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Mr. Keith Hill):</B> I want to discuss the detail of the amendment and the new clause, which were tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Scarborough and Whitby (Mr. Quinn), before I turn to the broader issues that are associated with rail freight.
<P>
Amendment No. 855 emphasises the importance of the needs of customers of rail freight. The new clause would establish a rail freight users' committee—we shall discuss that proposal in due course.
<P>
The amendment would impose on the Rail Passengers Council a duty to co-operate with the customers of rail freight users. We agree that rail freight is important and that the need to develop rail freight is one of the key reasons for setting up the Strategic Rail Authority. As my hon. Friend knows, the franchising director has no rail freight responsibilities, although the SRA will be able to co-ordinate strategy towards, and to balance the capacity demands of, passengers and goods.
<P>
Having said that, I do not believe that that is the best or most appropriate way in which to help rail freight or passengers, for reasons that I shall explain. We have been keen to strengthen the powers of the Rail Passengers Council and to ensure that it can be an effective champion of the passenger. That is why we have extended its powers to co-operate with other bodies representing the interests of users of other public passenger transport services. We recognise that a passenger is a consumer of more than just the railway and we are aiming for integrated journeys.
<P>
However, the main role of the Rail Passengers Council is to speak up for passengers. Co-ordinating with freight users as well as passenger groups would distract it from that core function, and, spread its expertise rather too thinly. I accept that passengers will have an interest in the possible conflicts between freight and passenger traffic but we believe that that will be better handled, and more effective, at the level of the SRA. The Rail Passengers Council can best use its expertise, in the range of passenger concerns, by being the eyes and ears of the passenger and feeding passengers' views to the SRA as part of the SRA's wider remit.
<P>
I congratulate my hon. Friend on tabling new clause 33. The nature of freight services, and the relationship between the customer and the service provider, is, however, very different from that of passenger services.
<P>
Unlike franchised passenger service operators, the private freight operating companies are not required to maintain any particular level of services and they rely entirely on attracting and retaining their customers to maintain their businesses. Clearly, freight operators already have a strong incentive to listen to their customers and to resolve any problems that may arise. The main role of RPCs will be to speak up for passengers and to represent their interests when things go wrong and to ensure that train operators take their complaints seriously. Freight services by their very nature tend to be used by private companies, which are better placed to represent themselves and to take up complaints directly with the freight operator concerned.
<P>
The new clause would place a statutory duty on the Strategic Rail Authority to consult the proposed rail freight users consultative committee on all matters relating to rail freight and in respect of closure proposals and other matters. I fully accept that we want to protect rail freight interests and infrastructure. However, making such a committee, as a proposed RFUCC, a statutory consultee on all matters relating to rail freight as well as being a statutory consultee in respect of all major and minor closures, network changes and the undefined ``reasonable requirements of all operators'', would place a massive burden on the administrative system at a considerable extra cost. Those consultation requirements would be far greater than those that exist for the passenger committees.
<P>
I reassure my hon. Friend that safeguards of freight interests will be put in place. The SRA will be able to take freight interests into account when considering passenger-related closure proposals, and the authority will be able to define its own reasonable requirements of Railtrack in respect of the strategic capability of the network. I assure my hon. Friend that the Government are committed to supporting rail freight as part of an integrated and sustainable freight distribution system. I am sure that he agrees with me that, in that regard, the record speaks for itself
<P>
I am happy to say that rail freight continues to attract new business, although there is clearly much more to attract. We want to encourage further growth, and we are prepared to pay for it where it makes economic sense to do so. Establishment of the SRA means that developing fail freight will finally be part of the strategic management of the whole rail sector. The shadow SRA is already working on the freight element of its strategy, which involves vital issues of capacity, demand and investment. The overall objective remains to put more f eight on rail.
<P>
We drew on the advice of the shadow SRA in preparing the 10-year plan for transport and we made it clear that there has to be more investment to expand the network's capacity to carry freight. The 10-year plan involves a long-term strategy and it will tackle the legacy of under-investment and fragmentation. I hope that my hon. Friend will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lawrie Quinn </B>(Scarborough and Whitby): I have listened carefully to the remarks of my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary. In view of the safeguards that he placed on record, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael Moore </B>(Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale): I beg to move amendment No. 1011, in page 118, leave out lines 31 to 39 and insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(7B) In considering the interests of rail passengers in relation to railway passenger services and station services the Railway Passengers' Council shall have regard to the interests of—

<P>
(c) individuals with low incomes; and
<P>
(d) individuals residing in rural areas
<P>
but that is not to be taken as implying that regard may not be had to the interests of other descriptions of passenger.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take the following amendments: No. 966, in page 118, leave out lines 31 to 39.
<P>
No. 1012, in page 119, leave out lines 5 to 13 and insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(9B) In considering the interests of rail passengers in relation to railway passenger services and station services each Railway Passengers' Committee shall have regard to the interests of—

<P>

<P>

</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 967, in page 119, leave out lines 5 to 13.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moore:</B> A recurring theme in our debates, which has been mentioned by hon. Members on both sides of the Committee, is the need to ensure that the interests of certain groups, including those who are disabled, of pensionable age, on low incomes or from a rural area, are brought to the fore in relation to the development of an integrated transport system, not least because one of that system's key objectives is to develop social inclusion. That involves ensuring that those who are disadvantaged, whom the market of en neglects and ignores, have a say about such developments. I moved the amendment, which also appears in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Bath (Mr. Foster), in that spirit.
<P>
The amendment would require the Rail Passengers Council and the railway passengers committees to take proper account of the interests of those groups of people. The Government have introduced similar conditions for those groups in other Bills, especially in the Utilities Bill. I hope that, in the spirit of joined-up government, which is another great theme of this Administration, the Government will make this Bill consistent with other Bills and ensure that vulnerable groups in our society, who are often ignored and whose interests require special attention, are not left out of the system.
<P>
I hope that the Under-Secretary will not use the list answer as his defence, although his body language suggests that he may do, and that he will give assurances about the way in which the interests of those groups of people will be defended and promoted by the new consultative committees.

<P>

<B>Mr. Robert Syms </B>(Poole): I will not detain the Committee for long. Amendment No. 966 would delete proposed new subsection (7B) because those provisions will make the Secretary of State too involved. Why does the Under-Secretary believe that those provisions are necessary?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I am afraid that I must once again invoke argument C—this time, in relation to the amendment and those grouped with it. That is not to say that I do not have sympathy with the people to whom the hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for Bath believe the Rail Passengers Council and the consultative committees should pay regard. Those groups are the most vulnerable and they may be the most heavily dependent on railways. However, it is not necessary or—as I explained, for argument C reasons—desirable to include such provisions in the Bill.
<P>
We are concerned about the under-representation of some groups on public bodies, and we, and the Rail Regulator, are putting much effort into widening the base of rail passenger committee appointments. I speak from my experience as an Under-Secretary who, along with the Rail Regulator, has a statutory responsibility for improving membership. The crux of the matter is that many bodies already include people who have disabilities and who were appointed to represent such interests.
<P>
Many of the issues that are of concern to people with disabilities relate to the railways physical structure. Under the terms of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995, the Disabled Persons Transport Advisory Committee—a statutory body to which I have direct responsibility—has to approve every request to modify the structure of new rolling stock. To that extent, the issue of accessibility is already dealt with by statutory requirements.
<P>
One of the functions of the RPC and the consultative committees is to speak up for passengers and to be their champion. Of course, they need to consider who the passenger is and the best interest of all passengers, especially those who are most vulnerable. I do not think that the Bill needs to tell them that—their role is clearly set out and they have been effectively carrying it out, under their old name, for many years.
<P>
Amendment No. 966, which was tabled by, among others, the hon. Members for Poole (Mr. Syms) and for Hexham (Mr. Atkinson), would remove from the Secretary of State the power to exempt certain services from the remit of the consultative committees and the council. I cannot accept the amendment, for reasons that will not be wholly amazing to the hon. Member for Poole. I reassure him and other Committee members that the power is not intended to deprive groups of passengers of their consumer rights and that it will be used very sparingly.
<P>
In this context, we are mainly concerned about the small, but important, group of heritage railways, which, largely, do not operate as scheduled services—they are leisure attractions at which enthusiasts can experience travel on heritage trains. Often, those railways are run by volunteers who give up their spare time. The powers of the committees and the council would not be appropriate—those railways do not supply a service on which commuters rely and it may well be that such powers would be onerous to the volunteers who run the railways. This is the best example of the way in which we would use the powers. If there are other cases, they would be very limited, and we would consult first the council.
<P>
I hope that my assurances satisfy the hon. Members for Poole and for Hexham, and that the hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moore:</B> The Under-Secretary went out of his way to give assurances. People will take close note of his comments. We may wish to raise that issue during later stages of the Bill. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 1017, in page 122, line 45, leave out from `section' to `which' in line 46 and insert

<P>
``(1A) In sections 17 to 22C above (and Schedule 4 to this Act) references to a railway facility (including references to any track, station or light maintenance depot) or a network include references to a railway facility (or any track, station or light maintenance depot) or a network'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This is the most technical of amendments, to make it clear that references to a railways facility in certain specified provisions of the Railways Act 1993 extend to facilities proposed to be constructed or in the course of construction. We should have preferred to do that by a relatively simple amendment to the definition of ``railway facility'' in section 83 of that Act, but we found that it did not work. The amendment is less elegant, but it works.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Clause 207, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.

Clauses 208 and 209 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 210</center></H4>
<H4><center>Closure of unnecessary track to be</center></H4>
minor closure
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 971, in page 124, line 14, after `necessary', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and is unlikely to become necessary'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This is an important clause, because it relates to the closure of unnecessary track. There is always concern when unnecessary track is closed, because many groups have aspirations about reopening sections of track and, once the track has gone, they do not have the opportunity to do that. I should be interested to hear what the Minister thanks about our well-crafted amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> Let me reassure the hon. Gentleman that there is a prospect of goodies to come, but not yet, I fear.
<P>
The clause widens the definition of minor closure to include the track in stations and light maintenance depots that they do not need or where closure of part of the station or depot is proposed. In the past, such track closures have had to go through the full closure process, which has caused unnecessary delay and bureaucracy.
<P>
The amendment requires the authority to judge whether the circumstances under which it is considering this type of closure proposal might change and whether the section of track or associated installations might once more become necessary for providing passenger services.
<P>
I can understand the hon. Gentleman's concern that we should not give the authority carte blanche to close down parts of the railway that we later discover we need. We are not allowing that to happen. The clause will not cover track outside stations or depots, that will still be covered by the full closure process.
<P>
The making of a determination by the authority under the clause is discretionary, but I assure hon. Members that we do not expect it to make a minor closure decision lightly or without considering its wider purposes. The authority has wide-ranging duties to develop the railway, not to dismember it, and to protect passengers' interests. If it decides that an operator's proposal is not a minor closure, the operator will have to go through the full closure process. It would then be a matter for the Secretary of State to decide.
<P>
We want to streamline the closure process without making it easy to close parts of the railway. Under the Railways Act 1993, the closure process was unwieldy and bureaucratic; we want to make it workable. I hope that, with those assurances, the hon. Gentleman will seek to withdraw his amendment.
<P>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(1) Section 34 of the Railways Act 1993 (Passenger Transport Authorities and Executives: franchising) is amended as follows.
<P>
(2) After'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 1020 to 1028.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> The clause clarifies the relationship between the passenger transport executives and the authority.
<P>
PTEs have wide powers under section 34 of the 1993 Act. For each passenger rail service in their area they can give notice to the franchising director—in future, the SRA—specifying the level and quality of services needed to meet public transport requirements in their area, including the basket of fares to be charged for those services. Whatever the PTE specifies must then be included in the relevant franchise, and the PTE meets the cost.
<P>
It is right that PTEs should champion local transport needs. I have no doubt that they will continue to do so vigorously, but we are establishing the authority centrally to develop the railway network to a nationwide strategy. Therefore, we do not intend to reduce the PTE's role or to modify its powers to specify services, but we must ensure that a balance can be struck between local and more strategic considerations, and that is the purpose of the clause.
<P>
The clause provides that the SRA should not, without a direction from the Secretary of State, implement a notice from a PTE that will prevent it from complying or seriously hinder it in complying with directions given to it by the Secretary of State or Scottish Ministers. Amendments Nos. 976 and 977, which are next on the amendment paper, affect that provision.
<P>
The clause also provides that the SRA should not act on a statement from a PTE if, or to the extent that, doing so would have an adverse effect overall on rail passenger or freight services, whether inside or outside the PTE's area. Finally, it provides that the SRA need not act on a statement if so doing would increase the payments that it must make under the franchises.
<P>
The Government amendments relate, first, to the proposed procedure for resolving disputes between PTEs and the SRA. Section 34(17) of the 1993 Act sets out a general procedure for resolving disputes over franchising matters between a PTE and the franchising director—in future, the SRA. It provides for either party to refer the matter in dispute to the Secretary of State, who may then give the PTE or the authority such directions as he thinks fit. That might include a requirement under section 34(1) for the authority or PTE to enter into a franchise agreement on terms decided by the Secretary of State.
<P>
We intend these dispute provisions to apply also to the new provisions in the clause. If there is a conflict between local and strategic considerations that the parties cannot resolve, it can be referred to the Secretary of State, who is ultimately accountable to Parliament for local and national railway services. He will determine where the balance lies. In so doing, he will not act in a quasi-judicial capacity—that is, confined to adjudicating between conflicting claims from the PTE and the SRA. He will act as he considers appropriate, balancing all the facts and circumstances of the case and having regard to representations by the SRA and PTEs. Under section 34(19) of the 1933 Act, he can even disapply parts of section 34 to arrive at the correct result.
<P>
However, the PTEs have made representations to us that the Bill may not quite achieve that, so we have tabled amendments Nos. 1020 and 1025, which we hope will provide useful clarification. They remove the words ``in its opinion'' from the clause, to make it clear that, if there is a dispute, it is over the facts of the matter and not over whether the SRA holds a certain opinion. Amendment No. 1028 then makes it clearer that, when a dispute is referred to the Secretary of State under section 34(17), he may resolve it as he thinks fit. I hope that members of the Committee, not least those who have the PTEs' interests at heart, will welcome the amendments.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 1019 and 1021 to 1023 contain technical drafting changes, so that the adverse effect test by which the SRA will judge whether it should disregard a PTE statement is on all fours with the separate test of compliance with directions or guidance.
<P>
With regard to PTE statements affecting SRA payments under franchises, the PTEs have also expressed concern to us that, under the clause, the SRA need not act on a statement if doing so would increase the payments that it must make under franchises. The provision relates not to payments of grant by the SRA to the PTEs, but to payments by the SRA direct to franchise operators. Our intention is to ensure that the local requirements specified by PTEs in their statements do not impose additional costs on other franchise services, for which the SRA then has to pay.
<P>
The Bill prohibits the SRA from acting in such a case on a PTE's statement under the 1993 Act unless there are special circumstances. That amounts to a general presumption against acting on the statement. On reflection, we believe that that is too strong, as there may be cases where the SRA is willing to carry the extra cost, which may be quite small. For instance, a PTE may wish to enhance a local service which, to gain the greatest benefit, should be extended for a short distance beyond the PTE boundary and therefore needs to be supported directly by the SRA for that part of the journey. That barely counts as special circumstances, but we would not want to rule it out. We have therefore tabled a simple set of amendments, amendments Nos. 1024, 1026 and 1027, which provide that the SRA need not act in a certain case. That enables us to remove the reference to ``special circumstances''.
<P>
I hope that the Committee will welcome the amendments, which have been made in response to positive representations from the PTEs and members of the Committee.

<B>Mr. Atkinson:</B> Devolution is always fertile territory for Opposition Members wishing to probe the Minister, hence our amendment. We want to establish what will be the relationship between the Scottish Executive and the National Assembly for Wales, on the one hand, and the Strategic Rail Authority, on the other.
<P>
Subsection (2) makes it clear that

<P>
of freight services, presumably to and from Scotland and Wales. That could result in a freight service moving across the border, and I can give an example with reference to the railway line so beloved of the hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale—the old Waverley line. It used to join up with the border counties line, which used to run through my constituency, and I believe that the hon. Gentleman's friends also want to open part of it. The problem is that that line crosses the border into England and, if the Scottish Executive were sufficiently impressed with the proposal by the hon. Gentleman and his friends, that the line should be reopened between Edinburgh and Carlisle, Scottish Ministers might feel that it was of great benefit to Scotland, but the Strategic Rail Authority might take the view that it was of no benefit at all to England. There might be some merit in such a difference of view, because, as the hon. Gentleman will agree, the main interest in the line would be in the section from the border towns to Edinburgh, rather than that from the border to Carlisle. In such a case, however, would the Scottish Executive have the power to subsidise the construction—or reconstruction—of that rail service on the English side of the border, or would that have to be funded by the Strategic Rail Authority? What would happen if the Strategic Rail Authority was not interested in doing that, although the Scottish Executive were enthusiastic?
<P>
I can think of other examples with freight trains. I believe that there used to be—indeed, there may still be—a car transporting train that took tourists' cars from the south of England to Scotland. If the Scottish Executive decided that they wanted to re-create that service, who would pay for it for the whole journey from Edinburgh, Stirling or wherever to London? Would it be paid from the Scottish budget, from the budget of the Strategic Rail Authority or from both, in due proportion? If it were to be paid from both budgets, what would be the relevant proportions?
<P>
I am sorry to complicate what might be a fairly simple matter. If my hon. Friend the Member for North Essex (Mr. Jenkin) were here, we could move on to the subject of Europe, but I am much less competent in European matters than he is, so I shall limit myself to talking about the United Kingdom.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moore:</B> I rise with some surprise, although perhaps not with as much surprise as other hon. Members may feel, to welcome the contribution by the hon. Member for Hexham. That was the surprise for me, because I have always been slightly concerned about his party's attitude to the Waverley line, not least on the English side of the border. He has flushed out an important issue, it is important that we understand where the responsibilities lie. I am glad to add, implicitly if not explicitly, the hon. Gentleman's name to the list of supporters of the scheme.
<P>
<B>Mr. Atkinson:</B> I need to make my position clear. The company that proposed to reopen the entire length of the Waverley line, including a spur down into my constituency, made one great error, which has caused us many problems. It failed to talk to, or even to consult, the people across whose land the railway now runs. It was proposing to build new bridges on people's land without proper consultation and behaved in such a way that it managed to get many people's backs up, which will not help its construction plans. Also, it did not address the singular problem: how does one move passenger trains through the central ammunition depot at Longtown?
<P>
<B>Mr. Moore:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes some interesting points, but it is slightly more tricky to flush out whether he is in favour of the scheme. Perhaps the Under-Secretary will reflect on that matter when he responds. We must address some of these more technical issues, and I look forward to his response.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I hardly like to intrude on private grief. However, in pursuing an interesting case of ``what-„iffery'', the hon. Member for Hexham seems to be hoist on his own petard and now appears more or less to support this interesting cross-border scheme. I shall return to the funding issues he raised after commenting on amendment No. 978.
<P>
The amendments all deal with the arrangements for the administration of freight grants, which are set out in the clause and have been agreed with the devolved administrations. It may help the Committee if, before I address the amendments, which I accept are probing amendments, I explain why the system has this structure.
<P>
The agreement with the devolved administrations was that they should administer grants for freight within their respective areas, following the practice before devolution, so there is no change there. However, as part of the devolution settlement, it was agreed that the overall Great British structure for grants should be retained. General freight grant schemes should therefore be determined by the SRA and administered in Scotland and Wales by Scottish Ministers and the National Assembly for Wales. That is what the provisions achieve.
<P>
The SRA will produce schemes for freight grants that the devolved administrations will administer in their areas. The SRA will start on the basis of the grants schemes that are currently the function of the Secretary of State under sections 137 and 139 of the Railways Act, but it will look at the possibilities for innovative new schemes. That is why I cannot accept amendments Nos. 978 and 980, which would allow the SRA only to make schemes outside Wales and Scotland and would give the devolved administrations autonomy within their areas. That is not a policy that we can accept. The point of making schemes is to make them GB—wide and to ensure that policy towards freight is on a GB basis. I should have thought that the official Opposition would welcome that.
<P>
I want to deal with the specific example raised by the hon. Member for Hexham, which was leapt on with such joy by his near-neighbour from across the border, the hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale. With regard to cross-border grants, I assure the hon. Member for Hexham that there will be no problem with joint grants. As I said, such a scheme worked in Scotland and Wales before devolution. In this structure, each funds its own part and we have aligned criteria to ensure a GB approach.
<P>
I understood the specific question of the hon. Member for Hexham to be this: would it be possible, in the reopening of the line that he is so passionately advocating, for the Scottish Executive to fund the part of the service that lies outside Scotland? The answer is no, which may not be good news for Northumberland, but may be good news for Scotland.
<P>
<B>Mr. Atkinson:</B> The Minister has been helpful. If I understand him correctly, the position is that, if the Scottish Executive decided that it wanted the Waverley line to be opened, it would have to convince the SRA that it was a viable project from Edinburgh to Carlisle, and the SRA would have the final say on whether it would operate it. If the SRA decided that it was a viable service but required subsidy, the bit from Edinburgh to the border would be subsidised by the Scottish Executive and the bit below the border by the SRA. Is that correct?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> The answer to each of the hon. Gentleman's two questions is yes and yes. In the light of that explanation, I hope that he will seek leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Atkinson:</B> I shall slowly withdraw my amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> On a point of information, I must make it clear that in this debate we are discussing freight grants and not passenger subsidy. That is an important correction to make, which I am pleased to see the hon. Gentleman appreciates. With that correction, I again invite him to seek to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Atkinson:</B> I apologise, because I made a slip of the tongue. It is disappointing. When I saw the concern on certain faces nearby, I thought that I might have scored a hit, but apparently it was my fault and not the Minister's. Therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

Clause 216 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 217</center></H4>
<H4><center>Competition functions of Regulator</center></H4>
<P>
Question, proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I should be grateful if the Under-Secretary could set out a little more clearly how the Competition Act 1998 will function. Under the clause, responsibility will be concurrently between the Rail Regulator and the Director General of Fair Trading. Will the Under-Secretary set out how that would operate and give members of the Committee a little more detail about this important subject, in which I am sure many of them take an interest?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I am pleased to respond to the hon. Gentleman's request for clarification of the clause.
<P>
Since 1 April, the Rail Regulator has enjoyed powers under the Competition Act 1998 concurrently with the Director General of Fair Trading, in respect of anti-competitive agreements, practices and so on that relate to the supply of railway services. The clause amends section 67(3) of the Railways Act 1993 to make it clear that the regulator's Competition Act jurisdiction would not be confined to railway services in the narrow Railways Act sense of the phrase. It will also cover certain other specified services relating to railways over which he has no general jurisdiction under the 1993 Act. Those services are the provision or maintenance of rolling stock, the development, maintenance or renewal of a network, station or light maintenance depot and the development, provision or maintenance of systems designed wholly or mainly to facilitate the provision of railway services. The Secretary of State has the power to add to or subtract from the list of services relating to railways, and that requires the affirmative procedure.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked a number of other questions, in particular in relation to concurrent jurisdiction and double jeopardy. The Government have already minimised the risk of double jeopardy through the Competition Act 1998 (Concurrency) Regulations 2000, which came into force on 1 March. They are fully effective in preventing double jeopardy—they prevent process double jeopardy and remedies double jeopardy. The Director General of Fair Trading and regulators have to agree which of them is to exercise functions before any one of them can exercise formal investigatory powers.
<P>
The Competition Act 1998 also provides that a regulator should make a final enforcement order in respect of a licence only if he is satisfied that the order is the most appropriate way to proceed under the 1998 Act.
<P>
Question accordingly agreed to.

<P>

<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 981, in page 127, line 36, leave out `may' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`shall'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This is an important clause because it deals with pension guarantees. The SRA will take over the relevant responsibilities. The clause states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Authority may give guarantees to the trustees of an occupational pension scheme if the Authority considers that it is desirable to do so.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment would replace the word ``may'' with the word ``shall'' because, as a responsible employer, the SRA should give firmer guarantees than those contained in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I assume that the intention that underlies the amendment is to ensure that British Rail's approach to the provision of guarantees to pension schemes in order to ensure a proper level of benefits to pensioners will be continued. The proposed amendment would not have the desired effect, but I hope that the hon. Gentleman will contain himself until I have explained the matter further.
<P>
We have been giving further thought to this whole issue. The pensioners of the older schemes, who currently rely on the provision of guarantees by the British Railways Board to maintain full funding of their schemes and indexation of payments are, generally, BR's oldest and poorest pensioners. BR has ensured in the past that those pensions have always been secured and indexed in the same way as pensions from BR's own newer schemes. However, in some cases there may be no legal obligation on BR to continue that practice in the future and thus no obligation that we could transfer to the SRA by a transfer scheme.
<P>
I am accordingly happy to say that we agree with the concerns that seem to underpin the amendment. We believe that the pensioners should be given assurances about the future security of their pensions, including indexation. In relation to the privatisation of BR, Labour Members fought long and hard to get the previous Government to ensure the future security of railway pensions. I know that that is the case because I was there. Pensioners should know that current pensions will always be paid and that the real value of those pensions will be maintained through indexation during the whole of their retirement.
<P>
We are therefore considering the position carefully and we will discuss the matter with BR and the trustees of the funds, with a view to bringing forward at a later stage an amendment that will guarantee the position of the pensioners and ensure that additional funding is provided in such cases whenever necessary.
<P>
In view of that approach, I hope that the hon. Gentleman, who has scored a minor victory in a good cause, will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I thank the Under-Secretary for his answer. Many people will be very happy with his reassurances. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 999 and 1000.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> Amendment No. 996 widens the scope of consumer protection transfer schemes to include all the licence exemption matters in paragraph 2 of schedule 16. The need for the amendment was identified as a result of the work on the draft consumer protection transfer scheme, copies of which were provided to the Committee earlier. Amendment No. 999 is consequential, and amendment No. 1000 is housekeeping.

Amendment agreed to.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 1029, in page 244, line 7, at beginning insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) Where the Regulator has not made his decision with respect to a proposed closure before the time when section 208 comes into force, anything done by or in relation to him before that time in connection with any of the functions transferred from him to the Secretary of State by that section shall be treated after that time as if done by or in relation to the Secretary of State.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment is a standard savings provision to ensure a seamless transfer of closure functions from the regulator to the Secretary of State. The closure process is quite lengthy, with a number of important procedural steps. It would be undesirable if, as a consequence of the transfer of functions, formal notices required under the Act had to be republished because they referred to the regulator rather than to the Secretary of State.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 1001, in page 244, line 15, at end insert—

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`Code for protection of disabled rail users
<P>
8A.—(1) The code of practice under section 70 of the Railways Act 1993 which is current at the time when the repeal by this Act of that section comes into force shall be taken to have been prepared and published by the Authority under section 71B of that Act.
<P>
(2) The Regulator shall give to the Authority details of any consultation undertaken by him under section 70(2) of that Act before that time in relation to future revisions of that code; and that consultation shall be taken to have been undertaken by the Authority under section 71B(2) of that Act.

8B.—(1) Any functions conferred on the Regulator by regulations under section 130 of the Railways Act 1993 which are in force immediately before the coming into force of paragraph 30 of Schedule 16 be treated after that paragraph comes into force as if conferred on the Authority.
<P>
(2) Any rules made by the Regulator under or by virtue of that section which have effect immediately before the coming into force of that paragraph have effect after that paragraph comes into force as if made by the Authority.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Paragraph 39 of schedule 16 provides that anything done by the regulator relating to a consumer protection transfer scheme is to be treated as if done by the SRA, but there is no similar provision in respect of anything transferred by virtue of parts I and II of schedule 16.
<P>
The basic intention is that the SRA will inherit actions relating to consumer protection taken by the regulator. The amendment provides additional savings to ensure a seamless transfer. For example, the SRA will not need formally to re-adopt codes or rules adopted by the regulator.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Question proposed, That this schedule, as amended, be the Twenty-fifth schedule to the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Atkinson:</B> I want to raise a couple of points on the schedule in relation to the first appointments to the authority.
<P>
It must be a great rarity to find in statute law that somebody has a guarantee of a job. It is intriguing that the Bill should state that the chairman of the shadow authority and the franchising directors should move up to their posts. In normal circumstances, the Secret of State has the power to appoint all members to the SRA, and, having appointed them, choose its chairman. I imagine that the franchising director was directly selected, and the chief executive of the authority can also be chosen by the Secretary of State. Therefore, why is the provision in the Bill?
<P>
I do not want to be unduly personal, but why, for instance, is Sir Alastair Morton guaranteed the job, regardless of what happens? I am sure that it will not happen, but he could go bonkers between now and when the authority is established. He might even join the Conservative party in a moment of great sanity, but he would not then endear himself to the Deputy Prime Minister. What happens— it is an interesting question and I would welcome an answer—if the Secretary of State decides that he does not want, for various reasons, to appoint these two individuals to the job? They have got him bang to rights, because it will be in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> Let me respond to the fascinating issues raised by the hon. Gentleman, whose well of curiosity seems to know no depths. He asked about first appointments and the guarantee of the job. We made it clear from the start that these appointments would move into the new posts. The Bill formalises our oft and publicly declared intention.
<P>
It will be a relief to the hon. Gentleman and other members of the Committee to know that if Sir Alastair went bonkers—I am not sure that that is a parliamentary expression—he would be liable to dismissal. Notwithstanding some of the misgivings of some of my hon. Friends, if he joined the Conservative party, he would not.
<P>
Schedule 25, as amended, agreed to.
<P>
Clause 223 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> New clauses 34, 35 and 36 are printed in the wrong order on the amendment paper and are relevant to part V rather than part IV. However, new clauses 31 and 32 are relevant to part IV. Does the hon. Member for Coventry, North-„East (Mr. Ainsworth) now wish to complete part IV or move something else?
<P>
Further consideration adjourned.—[Mr. Robert Ainsworth.]
