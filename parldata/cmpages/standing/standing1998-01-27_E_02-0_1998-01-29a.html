<H4><center>Clause 29 <br>Power to alter regions</center></H4>

<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Colin Breed </B>(South-East Cornwall): I beg to move amendment No. 6, in page 15, leave out lines 12 to 14.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss amendment No. 24, in page 15, line 12, leave out `do not' and insert `may'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Breed:</B> The thrust of purpose of the amendments is to give the Secretary of State the power to vary the number of regions up or down in future. Clause 29 would place an unnecessary constraint on the Secretary of State, should experience show that a region was too large or was not considered to be necessary, by setting it in concrete that there must be a specific number of regions.
<P>
Experience may demonstrate in the first year or two that it would be sensible to split a region. Experience in the south-west, and many of the representations made during the consultation exercise, demonstrate a lot of support for a separate Devon and Cornwall region, for example. The same may be true in other places.
<P>
We hope that Conservative Members will feel able to support the amendment. They have argued that there should be no eastern region. The power to vary the number of regions would provide flexibility to achieve that. There was considerable argument before the Bill was drafted. We recognise that use of current administrative structures was necessary to get regional development agencies off the ground quickly. However, we do not believe that that is a reason why those structures should remain, if there is clear evidence in favour of a redrawing of boundaries, and a demand for it.
<P>
I hope that the Government will consider the amendment helpful. It would provide the flexibility to redraw boundaries where that was seen to be sensible.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Yeo </B>(South Suffolk): I have some sympathy with the amendment, as the hon. Member for South-East Cornwall (Mr. Breed) suggested that we might. My attempt on Tuesday to create an extra agency in the western region did not succeed and did not attract the hon. Gentleman's support; he and his colleague promised to oppose the Bill constructively, so I was disappointed that they felt unable to join me against their coalition partners in government to reflect the views of the people of that region.
<P>
My attempt to reflect concerns in the south-west was thwarted on the altar of ministerial rigidity and by the Under-Secretary of State's unwavering fixation with keeping everything bureaucratically and meticulously aligned with Government offices. However, that issue will not go away. In an earlier debate, the Under-Secretary said that she did not want endless debate about boundaries. However, her blind refusal to listen to argument has guaranteed that that will occur.
<P>
The amendment would open the possibility of a separate western region for Devon and Cornwall. Even more usefully, as the hon. Member for South-East Cornwall pointed out, it would allow for a reduction in the number of regional development agencies. For example, it would be possible to eliminate East Anglia from the Bill's provisions so that it could be revisited later. Even if we cannot persuade the Government to reconsider their attitude in Committee or during later stages, it would be helpful to include that possibility in the Bill.
<P>
I believe that this matter will arise again when we come to consider directly elected regional assemblies, although, as we discovered on Tuesday, the Government are cooling off slightly on that. I hope that those assemblies are to be put to the people in a genuine referendum. I say ``genuine'' advisedly, not meaning the kind of hustling through under cover of a separate proposal that is to happen in Greater London. The people of London have been denied the opportunity to vote on whether they want a directly elected assembly. It seems that the people are consulted on issues that suit the Government rather than on the proposals that the Government intend to impose on the people.
<P>
Notwithstanding the damaging constitutional precedent of what is happening in London, a chance for the English regions genuinely to vote on the single issue of whether they wanted a directly elected regional assembly might show that in some regions the answer is no. It jolly nearly was no in Wales. Without the help of some procedure at the ballot box, which has generated considerable controversy--I put it no more strongly--the answer in Wales probably was no.
<P>
If in future there are referendums about directly elected regional assemblies, I believe that some regions--certainly East Anglia--might vote no. It would then be time usefully to examine the performance of regional development agencies. The amendment creates the opportunity for a Minister to terminate the activities of an RDA by abolishing it, and that would be valuable. For that reason, I hope that the Minister will accept the amendment.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions </B>(Angela Eagle): We have already discussed at length the justification for the boundaries of the RDAs set out in schedule 1, which are based on the administrative boundaries of Government offices and on local authority boundaries. The hon. Member for South-East Cornwall said that he could see the sense of using those boundaries initially. We, too, see the sense of using boundaries already well established for economic purposes.
<P>
We think that we have the right number of regions. Opposition Members have argued that some regions are too big and that we may need to add to the proposed nine regions. The Government do not agree. We believe that we are right to develop on the present economical regional boundaries and to build on established and developing relationships within them.
<P>
It has been argued that the arrangements proposed in the Bill do not properly take account of the needs of the south of England and that a case can be made to increase the number of RDAs in the south. I do not accept that case.
<P>
In some areas in the south, regional identities may be less strong than in other parts of the country. For a variety of reasons, including the proximity of the capital, regional groupings may be less well established. That is not, to my mind, an argument for an increase in the number of regional development agencies. Rather, it argues for each region devising its own method of working, taking account of its own regional, sub-regional and cross-regional needs. RDAs will need to ensure that cross-regional working is efficient and effective and that proper sub-regional arrangements are in place.
<P>
The hon. Member for South-East Cornwall argued that his area of the south-west was a separate region. The hon. Member for South Suffolk (Mr. Yeo) argued in debates on previous amendments, to which he referred today, the case of Devon and Cornwall. However, anyone who has visited Devon and Cornwall knows that the Cornish believe that they should have their own RDA, and do not want to be included with Devon. There is therefore no consensus across such areas about where the boundaries should be. We can either have endless arguments about boundaries, or we can move forward to create a system that will help regional economies to grow. The Bill as it now stands contains flexibilities to allow sub-regional and cross-regional working. We think that that is sufficient flexibility.
<P>
The south-east region is a large region geographically, with a large population of more than seven million people. Any proposals to divide it, or to merge part of it with other regions, would create difficulties by disturbing the balance that has been reached in other adjacent regions. As we have already found in our earlier debates, it is difficult, in some cases, to find answers that are unarguably right, or that would command a better consensus than the proposals in the Bill. The danger of a power to increase the number of regions is that it might be used to create smaller and smaller entities, in an attempt to respond to local concerns, with the result that many of the advantages of a regional perspective would dissolve as matters were dealt with on a local level. That defeats the purpose of the Bill.
<P>
The key will lie in the working arrangements that RDAs adopt. Within regions, there will need to be effective arrangements for the delivery of services and for the exchange of information.
<P>
Cross-regional working, as we discussed earlier with respect to the Thames gateway initiative, will also be important. The south-west and the south-east may want to put in place arrangements that deal with the special needs of south coast towns. Similarly, the eastern region, the south-east and London will need to continue with the close working relations that are necessary to take forward the Thames gateway initiative and to deal with the economic interdependence of London and the surrounding area. The Bill allows that flexibility but the amendments would put it in jeopardy.
<P>
The hon. Member for South Suffolk mentioned the creation of a Greater London authority. The previous Government abolished many local authority organisations, including the GLC, without asking the people or putting it in their manifesto. We have manifesto commitments to create all the bodies that we are now creating, which we intend to fulfil. We were elected with an overwhelming majority to put our manifesto commitments into place, which is what we will continue to do.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Curry </B>(Skipton and Ripon): One of the sensible precepts in politics is to try to keep options open. Indeed, that is one of the reasons why I am not in wholesale communion with my party on some issues.
<P>
The Under-Secretary has given us a series of non sequiturs. No one would dispute that when establishing a new entity, it makes sense to use a stretch that already exists. However, she said that there was no consensus about where structures might eventually lie, and whether people would vote for things. Is it not sensible, therefore, to leave the option available?
<P>
The initial structure may not be perfect for all time; it may not have that sort of biblical certainty. Rather than developing an endless multiplication of substructures, or an endless biological soup of sub-agencies, if the Under-Secretary is serious about wanting to take things down to the level of the people and trusting them, which is a catechism that we hear constantly from the Government, there may be a case for taking matters to a lower level. We do not pre-empt the outcome. The Government should take the commonsense approach and give themselves the chance to respond to changes. They may want to ensure that there will not be endless multiplication--if regional particularity did not stop at some stage there would be no point in setting up a strategic objective. There is no reason why the Government should not include some safeguard measures.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Under-Secretary should take the sensible option in this situation--she should say that she will consider whether it is absolutely necessary to set the present structure in concrete from the start, and whether there is a case for adding to--or for substracting from--the number of RDAs.
<P>
In our previous sitting we discussed the south-east region and the needs of the Thames gateway--its needs are more pressing today. The channel tunnel link may be in jeopardy. The Under-Secretary knows which Department has responsibility. The channel tunnel rail link is much more important than the Sheffield supertram, in relation to which the Government took the sensible decision of telling Sheffield to stuff it. The intermediate stations are crucial for the regeneration of the Thames gateway. If they will not be built, there may be a case for reconsidering the relevant structures to ensure the gateway's regeneration. The Under-Secretary should not lock herself in; she does not need to do so. She should go away, reconsider the proposal and add a safeguard, if necessary, to ensure that the process will not run away with itself. She should accept that the basic proposals in the Bill are right--after all, we want to accept the structure--but that there may be a need for change. The Government should have the option of responding to local wishes, which have been well expressed. After all, the Government said that that was their constant preoccupation.

<P>

<B>Angela Eagle:</B> The size of the English regions is important because, as we discussed earlier, it gives the right economy of scale--it provides the critical mass that is needed for regional economies to develop and to become more efficient. That will help to increase the regional cake--although the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon (Mr. Curry) might prefer to refer to a biological soup. His description was the first in which I have heard RDAs referred to as living things. It is an interesting concept. There are no Chinese walls around the boundaries. We believe that nine English regions is the right number. The Bill contains sufficient flexibility to ensure that traditional ways of working and new ways of co-operating within regions and across regions will be maintained. That is the right way forward, and we therefore believe that the amendment is unnecessary.
<P>
I agree with the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon that we should keep our options open, although we shall discuss that matter in more detail later. However, the Bill will do that better without the amendments, which would close down our options. I suspect that I shall return to the right hon. Gentleman's arguments many times today.
<P>
<B>Mr. Breed:</B> I appreciate the Under-Secretary's comments on the amendment. We should set up the RDAs swiftly and put all the necessary structures in place. It would have been counterproductive to have an endless discussion about boundaries. Consensus is based around local authorities, businesses and organisations. The proposal may be a pathfinder to regional chambers, which are in the public sector rather than the private sector. The proposed constraint would impose boundaries on those regional chambers where there may not be a consensus about where the boundaries should be drawn. To provide the flexibility to enable that consensus to come about, the Government are presenting a fait accompli. That may dissuade some people who would have been supporters of regional chambers from giving their whole-hearted support, because they are being offered something that is set in concrete, a boundary that cannot be altered. The Government are saying ``Nine regions, that's it. That's what you must accept, or nothing.'' If there was clear consensus before the chambers were set up that the boundaries should be changed, it would work against the RDA principle if the boundaries could not be changed.
<P>
The consensus is not wholly tested. As the Minister will know, we have tabled other amendments in which we suggest that the Boundary Commission should be involved before the regional chambers are set up. It is essential that there should be an opportunity for flexibility.
<P>
I am grateful for the comments of the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon, who said, probably far more eloquently than I could, that to close our options at such an early stage, when we were trying to move forward swiftly and accept that the existing structures were helpful, did not necessarily mean that the boundaries would be correct when we moved on to the next stage, which the Minister knows we are keen to do. I believe that the clause could be an unnecessary bar to obtaining the wholehearted support of people for regional chambers, when the time comes.

<B>Mr. Breed:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 26, in page 15, line 21, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(aa) the Boundary Commission,'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
As I intimated a little earlier, we believe that there should be consultation with the Boundary Commission before the boundaries of any RDA are changed. We have already heard that if we are locked into a nine-region structure, certain amendments and changes could be made at the edges which would not change the number of regions but would change their boundaries. Much of the logic of earlier amendments applies to this amendment.
<P>
There needs to be genuine consensus and a genuine feeling that people make a contribution to their region. We are aware that in a few areas there is rivalry and competition, but most people accept that there are clear communities of interest and identity. By their nature, regions are unlikely to have that community of interest, because they encompass large areas. There may be certain anomalies at the boundaries. As the Government have chosen the off-the-shelf, administrative structure, the regions may not necessarily have the most effective, efficient, or, indeed, accepted boundaries. Nor will they necessarily be acceptable for the regional chambers. That is why we believe that, once the RDAs are set up, but before regional chambers are introduced, individuals and organisations should be able to submit evidence to the Boundary Commission, so that the regional chambers have the full agreement of the people in that region.
<P>
As I have said, much of the consensus so far has been confined to the private sector and to certain organisations involved in economic development, employment and other aspects. However, moving on to the next stage requires a much broader consensus. RDAs must have the confidence that they have the support of the people in their areas. There could well be opportunities to make representations to the Boundary Commission which would marginally change the regions' boundaries. We suggest that we have an opportunity now to provide further flexibility; to ensure that people identify with their region, support it and work with it.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> I ask the hon. Member for South-East Cornwall to remember that we are talking about regional development agencies, not about regional assemblies or regional government. This is the first part of a process which we hope will involve people further.
<P>
Amendment No. 26 requires the Secretary of State to consult the Boundary Commission before making an order under clause 29. We do not think that this is necessary or desirable. Under clause 29(4) the Secretary of State is required, before making an order to alter the extent of a region, to consult every regional development agency affected by the proposed order, every local authority whose area is affected by the proposals and such other persons as he thinks fit.
<P>
It is right that the RDAs and the local authorities affected should be statutory consultees. Their areas, their work and the partnerships of which they are part might all be affected by an order. They might have valid objections to what is proposed or constructive suggestions to make, but it is not self-evident that that will always be so in the case of the Boundary Commission. The Boundary Commission has a remit to review the electoral boundaries of the parliamentary constituencies, whereas RDA boundaries are drawn on the basis of administrative areas, which currently form the government offices for the regions. While in some cases there may be considerations which make it appropriate for the Boundary Commission or the Local Government Commission for England to be consulted, and the Secretary of State may do this under clause 29(4)(c), there should not be a statutory requirement to consult them in all cases.
<P>
The Bill allows for consultation where appropriate with the Boundary Commission, but goes wider to allow a Secretary of State to consult the Local Government Commission for England. The Bill is already flexible, so I ask the hon. Gentleman not to press his amendment. The Boundary Commission may well be a consultee, but we do not see a case for making it a statutory consultee on every decision.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Breed:</B> I thank the Minister for her words. The Bill clearly will set up RDAs, but the Government have made it clear that that is the first step towards a wider perspective of regional government. The Bill is extremely important in that it sets up the RDAs, but it could also produce a blueprint for future structures. If organisations and structures are created now, it will be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to change them later.
<P>
It seems ridiculous that any future regional assemblies might not have boundaries coterminous with those of the regional development agencies. We know how district, parliamentary, county and European boundaries work. We should take the opportunity not only to consider the here and now but to see the Bill as part of a process that will lay down structures and boundaries with future repercussions.
<P>
The amendments were intended to provide a degree of flexibility and to tailor around the edges rather than to insist on administrative structures set up some time ago which are possibly not appropriate to future demands. However, having made what I hope were helpful points, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Breed:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 27, in page 15, line 27, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(4A) Where the Secretary of State has consulted a regional development agency under subsection (4) above but does not intend to accede to representations made to him by that agency, he shall publish these representations and his reasons for not acceding to them'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We see the amendment as an important way to demonstrate openness so that everyone will be aware of the reasons for decisions. People often invest a great deal of time, money and effort in making representations to all sorts of bodies, only to feel that their representations seem to have been ignored. Sometimes decisions are not communicated in an acceptable way.
<P>
It is important that representations made to the RDAs are properly considered and given the importance that they demand. The Secretary of State should be prepared to make public the reasons for any disagreement, which would be an important contribution to openness. People should make representations in a democratic society and, even when decisions go against them, they should understand why decisions have been taken. It is not unreasonable to request that decisions be made public. It would encourage people to engage in the process to know that they would learn the reasons for the final decision.

<P>

<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> The amendment seems wholly inoffensive. I am not sure how riveting the reading for which it provides would be. I suspect that most members of the public may have more interesting things to read than the Secretary of State's reasons for rejecting representations from a regional development agency on why its boundaries should be altered. However, partly because these matters are scarcely the stuff of headlines, it would be extraordinary if anyone objected to the Secretary of State making the reasons available to the small number of people who may be affected by them. I cannot understand how a Government so proud of their alleged commitment to openness and accountability could find anything to object to in the amendment.
<P>
I am encouraged to see the Under-Secretary scribbling on a sheet of paper. I was afraid that we were about to have another session of her reading from her typescript.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> We have had plenty of that from you.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> We have had plenty of reading. I look forward to hearing the Government's view of an entirely inoffensive proposal.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> I do not know what I would do without my daily dose of insults from the hon. Member for South Suffolk. I would be very disappointed.
<P>
The best reply that I can offer is an assurance about our approach to openness, but I must add that it is not necessary to put the amendment's requirements into every clause of every Bill.
<P>
I was interested that the hon. Member for South Suffolk found the amendment inoffensive, given that he was a member of a Government who for 18 years made no progress on freedom of information. Within eight months of being elected, the Government have produced a White Paper on freedom of information and we will legislate. I hope that the hon. Member for South-East Cornwall realises that the context within which we are discussing openness has changed considerably since May 1997. I hope that he will take account of that.
<P>
Clause 29 requires the Secretary of State to consult all interested parties, including the agencies concerned, before making an order to alter the areas specified in the Bill. The amendment would require the Secretary of State, where he or she proposed to make an order that did not follow the wishes of an RDA, to publish the RDA's representations and the reasons for not following the agency's wishes.
<P>
I do not consider the amendment appropriate. As with any decision made by the Secretary of State in relation to statutory functions, he or she might wish to publish written representations, to make them available to all parties and to make known the reasons for the final decision. That is done regularly, and I suspect that it will be done even more often when a freedom of information Act is in place. It would also be consistent with the spirit of our attempts to make government more open. It would also make it a statutory duty for the Government to ensure that they make information available, which would be a very different approach from that which we have suffered--if I may put it that way--for the past 18 years.
<P>
Publishing representations would be a matter of good administrative practice but we do not believe that it should be a requirement in every Bill. We have an overarching commitment to freedom of information, and we shall have a statutory right to it once the relevant legislation has passed.
<P>
The Government should have the freedom to keep the people in touch with their thinking, and to say how they intend to respond to representations, according to their circumstances. I assure the hon. Member for South-East Cornwall that one of our primary considerations will be to be as open as possible in our relations with those who have views, especially the RDAs and local authorities, with which we will be required to consult.
<P>
One last protection will apply in circumstances in which there is no meeting of minds between the Government and an RDA about a particular proposal, and the Government decide nevertheless to proceed to make an order. Hon. Members will have a last resort--which I hope can be avoided in most circumstances--by which they can pray against the order in the House of Commons, and Parliament can then take a view on the issue. That is what the Bill provides for in its present form, and I think that that is the right degree of protection. I therefore urge the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Breed:</B> I accept what the Under-Secretary has said, especially her last assurances that I think provide a degree of protection. The reasoning behind the amendment is born out of recent experience of the representations that have been made, especially those from my part of the country. When people look at the picture in the round, and take account of everybody's representations, they begin to see how decisions have been arrived at. That greater degree of understanding makes people more willing to fall into line. When they feel that their particular point of view has not been understood or accepted, and they have not been able to see the complete picture of the decision-making process in a published form, they often remain unconvinced and wish to continue the debate.
<P>
The amendment would have provided a means for people who do not agree with a particular decision to at least understand why their representations failed to win favour. I nevertheless accept the Under-Secretary's comments, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<B>Mrs. Jackie Ballard </B>(Taunton): I beg to move amendment No. 25, in page 16, line 3, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(aa) that this meeting be open to the public,'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In his opening remarks, the hon. Member for South Suffolk, who I think also wants to give me a daily dose of insult, referred to Liberal Democrats as coalition partners. All the amendments moved so far have been moved by my hon. Friend the Member for South-East Cornwall and I, and the only division showed a coalition between ourselves and the Conservative Members.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> Does the hon. Lady not recall--perhaps she had left the Committee--that I proposed amendments on Tuesday for the exclusion of the eastern region from the Bill and for the division of the south-western region into two regions. The amendments were debated, the Committee divided, and the only Committee Members who voted against the Government were Conservatives?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Ballard:</B> That proves my point. Sometimes Liberal Democrats vote with the Government when we think that they are right, and sometimes we vote against them when we think that they are right. Sometimes we vote alone if the Labour and Conservatives parties are ganging up together. That leads me to the point of the amendment. I have a natural distrust--which I probably share with most of the population--of all Government, and I believe that a commitment to openness, no matter how sincerely felt, can often disappear when a party takes office. Openness needs to be enshrined in legislation.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
My party has painful experience of what happens when a name is changed, and I know of the powerful emotions that can be generated. If the boundaries of an RDA are changed, or if a region feels that it has developed a particular identity that is not reflected in the name that is originally adopted, the RDA may decide to change its name. That decision is of such importance that the Government think that they should convene a special meeting to do so. The amendment would require that meeting to be open to the public. That meeting would not cover confidential, commercial information or personnel issues, and there is no reason why it should not be open to the public.
<P>
I hope that the Government will accept the amendment. I am sure that they do not believe that the Bill is perfect in every aspect. The amendment would allow the public to attend meetings about changing the name of an RDA.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> I think that the amendment is baloney from start to finish. It is a terrible mistake to confuse open government with the public's presence at meetings. They are entirely different matters.
<P>
The amendment suggests that the one decision that an RDA can take--about what it calls itself--which does not make the blindest bit of difference to anyone, should be open to the public, and that the decisions that it takes on matters of substance should not be open to the public. If ever there were tokenism, that is it.
<P>
The Liberal Democrats may find endless hours of entertainment in debating changes of name, but what matters is the number of votes that that party collects and the role that it plays in the House and in the government of this country. I remember debating for hours whether the Council of Ministers in Brussels should be open to the public. No one in his right mind would expect that to happen, and, if it did happen, no one in his right mind would expect the power to make decisions to migrate from the Council chamber.
<P>
The amendment is a piece of Liberal Democrat tokenism and it does not add up to a row of beans. I hope that for once the Government will be robust and that the Minister will strictly follow the message that is no doubt on the piece of paper that has just been handed to him. I should not be surprised if the word ``appropriate'' does not flit in and out of it somewhere.
<P>
What on earth is the amendment about? We should spend our time discussing the subjects that really matter and not the need to change names, which is a particular predilection of the Liberal Democrats.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> The right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon must be very careful or he will be accused of being in coalition with the Government. Definitions of the words ``overwhelming'', ``unanimous'' and ``coalition'' have taken on a whole new meaning since the hon. Member for South Suffolk joined the Front Bench. No doubt we shall hear further interpretations and definitions later.
<P>
I must inform the hon. Member for Taunton (Mrs. Ballard) that the Bill is very good and well drafted not only because of the Department's professionalism--which is taken for granted--but because we have consulted widely. The results of the 1,500 responses were not quite unanimous--1,494 were in favour, and the hon. Member for South Suffolk found six that contained slight criticisms. Once we had that information, which showed that we were on the right tracks, a White Paper was published and sent out for wide consultation. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State and I visited the regions again, and in the south-west more than 380 people attended a meeting that was organised in Exeter on 6 or 7 January. While others were swanning around in the Caribbean, some of us were working.

<B>Mr. Stephen Day </B>(Cheadle): What is wrong with the Caribbean?
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> I would love to be in the Caribbean, but some of us had to do some work during the recess. We took our responsibilities seriously.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Ballard:</B> Did any of the representations that the Minister received in response to his various consultations state that RDA meetings should be open to the public?
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> The answer is yes. I shall explain the conditions under which those meetings should be open to the public.
<P>
We face a problem, which was alluded to by the hon. Member for South-East Cornwall, because the British people believe that over the past 18 years Governments have had preconceived ideas and ``consulted'', and have taken no account of the results. We have inherited that problem, but we have undertaken genuine consultations, which have had a demonstrable effect on the White Paper and the Bill.
<P>
The Bill will allow RDAs to change their name by resolution at a specially convened meeting. The amendment would require any such meeting to be held in public, but the Committee should not accept the amendment. I do not object in principle to the suggestion that RDAs should, in appropriate circumstances, open meetings to the public--we want more openness, better accountability and greater effectiveness in non-departmental public bodies. Our consultation paper, ``Opening up Quangos''--which was published last November, and which was slightly embarrassing to the previous Administration--proposed that non-departmental public bodies should hold meetings in public. We want to encourage such practices in all RDA meetings, and not only in those convened under the clauses's provisions.
<P>
In principle, I want RDAs to lead the way in that regard by opening up their work to public scrutiny and by being more accountable to the people whom they serve. There is no reason why a meeting convened under the clauses's provisions should not be open to the public. I do not, however, believe that it should be a statutory requirement; RDAs should take that decision for themselves.
<P>
During our consultations people said, ``Yes, we want the power and the responsibility to deal with the relevant issues,'' which I discussed at our previous sitting. They do not want us to tell them what to do. We are devolving powers and we have faith in people to execute those powers in a responsible way. That is why we oppose the amendment and why I hope that the hon. Member for Taunton will not press it to a vote. The hon. Lady should have faith in the people who will serve on the RDA boards, and who will ensure that the system is as transparent and as open as possible. If it is, those people will earn the respect of the people on whose behalf they act.
<P>
<B>Mr. Breed:</B> I accept the Minister's assurances. The board members of an RDA could decide for themselves to hold a meeting in public.
<P>
It may sound innocuous and, in some ways, demeaning to say so, but changing the name of an agency is considered to be of such importance that an entire clause is devoted to it. It is also of such importance that an agency will have a meeting to discuss it. The decision to change a name is likely to be at the end of a process that has been boiling up for some time and which has generated much public interest. The amendment would give the public the opportunity at least to observe that meeting. We do not believe that the issue is controversial, and we hope that as much of the RDA's business as possible can be conducted in public.
<P>
Perhaps we are oversensitive, but those of us who have been in local government for many years and have been subjected to ``consultation'', which we thought was our opportunity to contribute to a debate or a subject but usually turned out to mean being advised of what would happen in three weeks' time, have perhaps had our thinking coloured. Perhaps over the coming years consultation will revert to its previous meaning--that people will be consulted, their views taken into account and any decisions reached conveyed to them in a way that would be publicly available. If this matter is important enough to be given a clause of its own, surely it is not wholly inappropriate to include the further safeguard that we propose.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Ballard:</B> The right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon said that name changes were a Liberal Democrat predeliction. We have done it only once. But openness is a Liberal Democrat predeliction. He also accused me of confusing open meetings with democracy. In my experience of local government opening meetings to the public, that is the first step towards involving the public in other ways in the business of local government and towards proper democracy. We shall table amendments later to the effect that RDA meetings should be open to the public when they are discussing other matters of substance. As my hon. Friend the Member for South-East Cornwall said, the fact that name changes have a clause to themselves must mean that the Government recognise the process as a matter of substance.
<P>
The Minister said in effect, ``Trust us. We want these matters to be open, but we will trust the RDAs to make these decisions for themselves.'' The key difference between members of an RDA and members of local government, when it comes to trusting them to be open and accountable, is that members of the agency will not be accountable; they will not have been elected at a local level. Therefore, if the RDA decides to hold all its meetings in secret, no one locally can make a fuss about it and say, ``We won't vote for you again because you're meeting in secret''.
<P>
In my understanding of devolution, the central power retains the right to decide which core issues are so important that it will insist that the devolved parts of the state meet those issues. There will be no disagreement that equal opportunities are a core issue and there should be none on openness being a core issue. Therefore, we wish to press the amendment to a vote, because we believe that it is important.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`unless the number of vacancies or defects in appointment should bring the total number of members below 10.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Breed:</B> Thank you, Dr. Clark, for your helpful hints. We shall try to ensure that what we hope to record will be recorded.
<P>
Clause 2 is important to us, because board representation is at the heart of RDA and will ensure that the RDA operates efficiently and effectively and commands the support of the region. That is why we think that the minimum size of the board should be 12. Indeed, I think that the Government more or less accept that 12 would be a sensible minimum number. If the board is to represent the full range of organisations and have better geographical representation, a minimum of 12 members would seem appropriate.
<P>
I refer to geographical representation because, as the Bill stands, the interests that need to be represented on the board could be provided by people who live and work within five or 10 miles of the proposed headquarters. If they were, it would be difficult to suggest that the board was representative of all the different parts of the region. We hope, therefore, that the Government will recognise that it is necessary to ensure that there are sufficient people on the board to make it representative and that its members cover the whole geographic area. In my own part of the world, bearing in mind the representations that have already been made by Cornwall, for instance, there seems to be no identifiable voice on the board from that important part of the region, and that may be replicated in other regions.
<P>
It is also essential that the full and undivided interest of members of the board should lie in their region and their board.
<P>
Honourable Members may have served on committees and boards whose members served on other committees and boards as well, perhaps as chairman of one and as member of another. That often happens on school governing bodies. Councillors sometimes have multi-membership of different councils. That can bring about enormous conflicts of interest.
<P>
It is essential that all board members give their undivided attention and have no conflicts of interests other than in representing that region. It is therefore important that no person be a member of more than one RDA board.
<P>
Finally, amendment No. 40 proposes the insertion at the end of line 6 of schedule 2 of the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``unless the number of vacancies or defects in appointment should bring the total number of members below 10.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is another safeguard to ensure adequate representation. It effectively creates a quorum of 10 for the RDA board so that important decisions cannot be seen to be, however inadvertently or however much for the best possible reasons, taken by a small group of members of a board, when those decisions could have enormous implications for some parts of their region.
<P>
The clause is important; the amendments stiffen the proposals. They are sensible amendments to enable boards to have wide representation. They ensure that decisions are taken by a good proportion of the board, that the interests of members of a board are specific to that region and that members do not have conflicts of interest between different RDAs.

<P>

<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I should like to speak to amendment No. 42, which is tabled in my name. I do not share the view of the hon. Member for South-East Cornwall that it is necessary to alter the minimum and maximum number of members of boards that are in the Bill.
<P>
However, I should like to explore how long members of RDA boards are expected to serve. The Bill does not appear to provide a fixed term for membership of boards. I am not sure why that is so. I do not suppose, although anything is possible under this Government, that the Secretary of State intends the appointments to be lifetime appointments; I certainly hope not.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> What of the House of Lords?
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> The Minister is moving into very interesting territory from a sedentary position. Is he about to reveal new Government thinking about the future of the House of Lords? The matter to date has been the subject of consultations of a most private nature only. I am sure that the Committee would be extremely interested--subject to your approval, Dr. Clark--if the Minister would enlighten us. I am not sure whether it is a threat to existing Members of the House of Lords to say that they will perhaps not serve for life, but there we are.
<P>
It would be helpful if the Bill spelt out a limit on the service that it expected of those who are appointed board members. I am not especially anxious that four years is the right period, although it is a good starting point. If the Government suggested a different term, we would obviously consider it. Nor do I have an especially strong view about whether reappointment should be possible only once, or for more than one additional term.
<P>
However, I do think that some guidance is necessary. The Secretary of State is seeking unfettered discretion in this clause, and in many other clauses. Hon. Members may want to return to the extent of that unfettered discretion. The absence of any limits is rather curious. It will also be helpful to indicate what length of commitment will be expected from individuals who are considering serving on such boards. It is possible to envisage some embarrassment arising if some people serve for one year and others for two, three or four years. There may be unease among people who may come in and out of favour with the Secretary of State. The Government must have considered that. I look forward to hearing why the Bill does not refer to it.
<P>
<B>The Minister for the Regions, Regeneration and Planning (Mr. Richard Caborn):</B> I shall try to answer each point in detail. Given the number of quangos set up by the previous Government, I should have thought that Conservative Members would be past masters of the details of appointments. The amendments relate to terms of appointment for members of the RDA boards. In framing the Bill, we were conscious of the need for flexibility in the size of boards and in the experience and skills to be found on boards.
<P>
In the White Paper, ``Building Partnerships for Prosperity'', we have outlined what we believe to be the right size of board, but we must allow for changes in circumstances. We cannot foresee what will happen in the individual regions or events that might make smaller or larger boards more appropriate. Similarly, it is important to retain flexibility in the terms of appointment. There may be good reason why we want to reappoint members or appoint members for varying periods of time. The legislation as it stands can accommodate that.
<P>
Amendment No. 2 would require that the number of members of each RDA board could not fall below 12.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> The 12 disciples.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> I sympathise with the proposal that each board should have at least 12 members if it is fully to reflect the right mix of regional skills and experience. Indeed, the White Paper recognised the pressure to consider boards of up to 15 members. The White Paper also made clear our intention to aim for boards of 12 and that is what we shall do. There is some precedent for that in what happened with the Scottish Development Agency.
<P>
I do not know whether the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon was a member of the previous Administration when the then Prime Minister, Baroness Thatcher, set up a development agency in Northern Ireland, which was modelled on the SDA and the Welsh Development Agencies.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> The board to which I referred predated even Mrs. Thatcher and came from an even higher source. I was thinking of the disciples.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> I always appreciate a divine touch from Conservative Members. I feel that we are on the right course and that the almighty is looking down on us.
<P>
It is important to retain flexibility in board appointments. Thre are a number of instances in which board membership might fall below 12. In some cases, it may be helpful to leave a seat vacant until an applicant with suitable experience is recruited, or board members may resign before their term is up, leaving a vacancy which cannot be immediately filled. In such cases, we want the Secretary of State to have flexibility over making appointments to ensure the best long-term overall mix of board members, and the hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon will agree that that is important.
<P>
I ask the Committee to accept my assurance that we will appoint boards of 12. I urge that the amendment be withdrawn.
<P>
Let me turn to amendment No. 31. In appointing members to the boards of the RDAs, we will ensure that they have sufficient time to devote to the work. That is important. I am still taking counsel from several bodies that contributed to the consultation about the appropriate amount of time. I am advised that going for too much time might rule out a considerable number of people who want to serve but cannot give so much. It will be a balancing act.
<H4><center>[Mr. David Curry in the Chair]</center></H4>
<P>
No board post will be full time and we expect members to be involved with other bodies and businesses. It is for their skills and experience in those other areas that they will be appointed. It is extremely unlikely that we would want an individual to be a member of more than one RDA board. I take on board what the hon. Member for South-East Cornwall said about ensuring that people have local knowledge and are respected within their regions.
<P>
We expect RDA board members to be champions of their regions and to have strong ties with their regions. For that reason, it is hard--though not impossible--to envisage circumstances in which the Secretary of State would want to appoint the same individual to more than one board. Someone with a large factory could be on the board in two regions. It would be very unusual for a person to sit on more than one board, although I cannot rule out the possibility, even if I do not quite see it happening. The Bill needs to remain flexible.
<P>
As we have heard, amendment No. 42 seeks to place a maximum of four years on the length of time for which members can be appointed and allows for only one reappointment. The Bill does not restrict the length of appointments or limit the number of reappointments. That is compatible with guidance issued by Sir Leonard Peach, the Commissioner for Public Appointments. His guidance states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The length of appointments is a matter for departments.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is how the previous Administration dealt with appointments to non-departmental public bodies and others, and it is the convention. Lord Nolan put no restrictions on terms of appointment, but it will be generally around three years.
<H4><center>[Dr. Michael Clark in the Chair]</center></H4>
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Sir Leonard's guidance also states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Reappointments to the same post should not be automatic. The performance of the postholder should be reviewed. A second reappointment should be exceptional and normally subject to a scrutiny process, including considering other candidates.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Sir Leonard added that short-term second reappointments to cover amendments need not go through such a scrutiny process but that reasons should be recorded. From my experience of reappointments to quangos during recent transitions, that flexibility is helpful in ensuring that there is no disruption in organisations while we are rethinking their roles.
<P>
Sir Leonard clearly envisages, as do we, circumstances in which second reappointments are necessary and desirable. It is important to retain flexibility on the term of office and the number of times members may be reappointed. Appointments to RDAs are likely to be made for three years. Under normal circumstances we do not envisage reappointing members more than once, but the Bill must provide for the exceptional as well as the expected.
<P>
It is easy to foresee circumstances in which a third reappointment would be helpful. There are several reasons why a short-term second reappointment would be needed, such as bridging an election period or a period leading up to change in the structure of a body or its disbandment. Another reason may be to ensure a minimum level of knowledge and stability at a time when a large number of members of the body are simultaneously reaching the end of their period of office.
<H4><center>Minimum Wage</center></H4>
<P>
A second reappointment for a full term is not inconceivable. It may be that there are no other candidates with suitable experience or skills. If such a term were to be considered, we would ensure that the process was transparent and clearly demonstrated that the candidate for reappointment was outstanding in comparison with others. Flexibility in the term of appointments and in our ability to reappoint is essential and I urge that the amendment be withdrawn.
<P>
As for amendment No. 40, flexibility in board membership is essential. Although I have made our intentions to appoint boards of 12 clear, there may be unforeseen circumstances in which the membership of the board, for reasons of choice or accident, falls significantly below that number. Schedule 2 therefore provides that the validity of any proceedings of RDAs should not be affected by such a fall in numbers, whether it is caused by a vacancy or by a problem with the appointment of a member. We do not think it would be appropriate to limit the number of posts that may be vacant before the RDA's validity is questioned. We must maintain flexibility in this respect.

<P>

<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for clarifying the Government's thinking on the length of time for which people will be appointed to the board, and for the general guidance on how often members may be reappointed. I accept his assurances, and I shall not press my amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Breed:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for the clarification. It seems to me that we are being very flexible about the idea of flexibility. Earlier this morning, we were seeking to provide the Government with the flexibility to make modest changes to boundaries. The Minister now appears to wish to retain flexibility for these clauses, which we believe could lead to misuse, confusion and--in the cases that I suggested--conflicts of interest.
<P>
We believe that geographical representation will be necessary, and that the board will need at least 12 members. We accept that it would be extremely unusual for a person to be a member of two boards. However, the sort of decisions that RDAs are likely to make--on inward investment and attracting particular industries, firms and organisations--will almost inevitably include an element of competitiveness with other regions. The Welsh Development Agency has made forays into my part of the country to attract businesses to Wales from the south-west. I know that we have been assured that that will no longer be the case but, clearly, when there are inward investment opportunities, different regions will have opportunities to attract that investment. I believe that it would be wholly inappropriate for an individual to be a member of two boards, both of which could be competing for the same inward investment. Apart from the issue of confidentiality of information, such an individual might find himself in a difficult situation. Nevertheless, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Ballard:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 28, in page 1, line 17, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(1A) At least 4 members appointed under subsection (1) shall be councillors from local authorities within the region.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> (1B) A member appointed under subsection (1A) shall resign from the agency if he ceases to be a councillor.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following: amendment No. 32, in page 1, line 21, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(2A) In appointing persons to be members of a regional development agency the Secretary of State shall have regard to the geographical representation of the whole region.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Ballard:</B> We feel that the representation on the RDA and the method of appointment are crucial to ensuring that the legitimacy of the RDA is recognised across the region. They are also crucial to the future formation of elected regional assemblies.
<P>
The Minister said earlier that members of the RDA should have proven local knowledge and respect across the region. Elected councillors will already have proved that they have local knowledge and respect in their areas. If there is to be a proper partnership between local government and business interests, which I imagine will be represented by means of direct appointment by the Secretary of State, it is important that members of local authorities are represented on the RDA board--people who already have a democratic mandate, unlike those appointed by the Secretary of State.
<P>
However, we have experience, as the Government have, of the Committee of the Regions. People were appointed to it because they had a mandate as a member of a local authority and some then lost their seat at an election. There was then a tussle about whether they had the right to continue to serve on the Committee of the Regions, because they had lost their mandate. Therefore, the second part of amendment No. 28 says that a member who loses his or her local mandate should no longer be eligible to be a member of the board. It is important to make explicit that link between board membership and democratic legitimacy.
<P>
RDAs will cover large geographical areas, which are mostly a mixture of city, urban and rural. I take the south-west as the area that I know best. People in the area represented by my hon. Friend the Member for South-East Cornwall, who feel that they are the forgotten county at the tip of England, are worried, as are people in other parts of the south-west region, that the rural voice may be lost in the RDA. They are concerned that, with the demise of the Rural Development Commission, the RDAs may be led by big business, which is generally situated in the cities rather than out in the sticks of Cornwall or even in the backwoods of my constituency. Therefore, amendment No. 32 is designed to prevent the domination of a board by members from one locality, who may represent one area to the detriment of other parts of the region.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> I want to explore some of the implications of appointments to the RDAs. How will local councillors be selected? Everyone will be nominated, although the Secretary of State will make the appointments. Will councillors be suggested by the local authorities? In Yorkshire and the Humber, for example, there is an embryonic regional assembly, which no doubt will wish to make nominations. How do the Government intend to make the nominations from local authorities? I do not believe that there should be a fixed number. I do not agree with the idea that a certain percentage of members should be from local authorities, but how they will be chosen is an important matter.
<P>
All over the country, many councillors sit on county and district councils. Indeed, some of them become Liberal MPs. This accumulation of mandate--
<P>
<B>Mrs. Ballard:</B> As the hon. Gentleman was looking at me when he said that, I should point out that I was not a member of a county and a district council at the same time. It was in sequence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> I was referring to the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough (Mr. Willis).
<P>
<B>Mrs. Ballard:</B> He is not in the Room.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> He is not in the Room, but I was pointing out that there was what the French call a cumul des mandats. An accumulation of mandates is quite common and is perfectly legitimate. Would the Minister regard somebody who was a county councillor and a district councillor as too busy a person to sit on a regional development agency, for example? How would he react if the nominations were the leaders of some of the big cities? Let us take my own region, a region dominated by large unitary authorities. The leaders of Sheffield, Leeds, Bradford and Huddersfield may well believe that they have the experience to sit on the RDA, but they are all, to all intents and purposes, full-time local politicians. Indeed, I changed legislation to allow them to receive expenses more proportionate to the tasks that they undertake. How would the Minister react if they came forward? Would he expect the nominations from local government to represent different sorts of councils? Would he, for example, expect nominations from a county council, which would be likely to deal with a more rural area, as well as from the unitary councils? Would he expect somebody to be from a district council? After all, the functions discharged by local government differ according to the council. Because the process of creating the unitaries went only so far, just about every form of local government fauna that one can imagine will be represented in a region.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
How will the names come forward? How will the Secretary of State choose them? Will he have an eye to the geographical representation? Will he expect the nominations to be representative politically as well as geographically? Will he expect the members to represent the overall political balance in a region? We all know that local governments change in the course of a Parliament. They may be predominantly Labour now, but it is possible that, five years from now, local government will have an entirely different complexion, because that has always happened in the past. How will that be reflected?
<P>
These are important questions, especially as the Minister is encouraging local authorities to get together into proto-assemblies, and no doubt they will want to put names forward. How will he go about selecting from among them?
<P>
Geographical balance is important. People who are coming not from a local authority sector but from, say, business or education are likely to be extremely knowledgeable about their business, their sector or their enterprise, but there is no reason why they should have a specific geographical identification. They may well live in one part and work in another. A large number of people in my constituency live in the Yorkshire dales, for example, and commute into Leeds, Manchester or Bradford to do their business. Will they be regarded as having knowledge about the rural area, about industrial processes or about the area where their factory is situated? The Minister gave the interesting example of the business man whose factory straddled a number of areas and who might have legitimate experience in more than one region. How he will find the time to be on the RDA is another matter. I have focused on the local authority because amendment No. 28 refers specifically to local authority matters.
<P>
We must be careful about the second part of amendment No. 28, which refers to loss of local mandate. If a local councillor who is a member of the urban development corporation loses his seat, he should not necessarily have to resign. He has a valuable accumulation of experience, and to appoint somebody who did not have that experience would not necessarily make sense. I accept that, if he is there as a representative of the local government side, there will be a time when that has to be recharged, as it were, but losing an election should not necessarily disqualify, if the other members of the board wish to see him remain and he has valuable experience. I urge the Government to be flexible.
<P>
It will be interesting to hear what the Minister says, because the question of appointees, to which we shall have to return later, is important.

<P>

<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> First, I want to make it clear that the RDAs are there to tackle the economic deficit that we believe exists. The analysis is in the White Paper. That will be their job, and that is what we are discussing. Directly elected regional assemblies would have a much wider remit. One would look for different qualities in people. We have a specific focus on that.
<P>
We do not propose that board members be delegates. Far from it. The White Paper moves away from that and we are looking for people who can bring together experience from within a region to tackle particular issues. We are trying to make sure that a board of 12 people will be able to represent a region politically, geographically and sectorally. They will deal with the specifics outlined in the Bill and the White Paper. It would be ludicrous to set up an organisation that would conflict with another in the political or industrial sector. The object of the exercise is to put together a board of people respected by their peer group who can deliver a strategic overview, as charged by the Bill.
<P>
We will consult with the Local Government Association on local authority representatives. We will also consult with regional bodies. We shall always go through the Nolan procedure, which is clearly laid out. We will do all that, just as I did as I went around the country, to seek nominations from local authorities, the business sector, academia, the voluntary sector and the rural sector.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> Will the Minister have any quota--informal or open--for female or ethnic minority representation on the boards? Every time there is an appointment, I get a letter from the Minister concerned asking for suggestions that meet those needs. Most recently, I was asked that question in relation to the Yorkshire dales national park. I had to point out that the only ethnic minority there would be people who came from Lancashire.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> One could make a comment on that, but I will not. We want to make sure that all of each region is represented on boards. Since arriving at my Department, I have been disappointed, not in the context of RDAs but in other appointments or reappointments, with the lack of choice that we are given. I believe that some lists have not been challenged for a long time. I want people from the wider aspects of our society to make sure that their names are sent to Departments, to No. 10 or to the appointments board.
<P>
I am concerned that white, middle class males are nominated time and again. Mr right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has twice sent back a list that contained no women or members of ethnic minorities. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary has done a lot of work on this. The right Hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon may laugh about this, but societies change, and we should reflect that. Balance makes for better quality decisions. We are trying to produce a system that reflects balance from the bottom up. We have become too used to the previous Government's dictatorial attitude. The right Hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon accepts that local authorities and many institutions have been undermined and centralised. It is time to change that culture. That is difficult, but we are winning that battle by consulting genuinely and reflecting people's views.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> The Minister misunderstood my last intervention. Does he start with a clean sheet for nominations? No matter how many people he consults or how many names are suggested, he must, at some stage, sit down and pick 12. Recommendations will come from the regional offices, no doubt. We need to know on what basis he will make his decision. He might say, ``We have an absolutely open mind. We want people who represent a balance of the region and who will bring expertise.'' He might also say, ``At the same time I have a second set of criteria, namely, that there must be people who represent ethnic minorities''--we all appreciate that they are an important part of the population--``or women members, who should be more fully represented.'' If he said that, he would be laying down certain criteria that would affect the choice. I am simply trying to explore the issue and to find out what the criteria are.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> Absolutely. There are many minorities in our society today. The Conservatives are a minority, and we must consider their right to be on the boards. They are a very small minority in some regions, and their numbers are shrinking. However, because they are the Loyal Opposition, we believe that they should be considered as a political party. All minorities will be considered.
<P>
I do not mean to be too frivolous. The boards must be business-led because they must deal with the structural weaknesses in the competitive and economic base of the relevant region. There should also be a large minority of directly or indirectly elected representatives on the boards. We gave an appropriate steer in the White Paper by saying that we wanted roughly four local authority representatives on each RDA board, assuming that the appropriate consultations were successful. The balance will be geographical and political, and it should include democratically elected bodies and the business community, which has the skills to deal with structural weaknesses in a region's economic and competitive base. That is what the RDAs are for.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I am worried about this. I had not intended to intervene, but my right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon raised a very important point, to which the Minister gave a trivial response. I am not sure whether he did that because he did not understand my right hon. Friend's question or because he did not want to discuss it. We need to know whether appointments to RDA boards will be made on merit. Will the best individuals to meet the agency's purposes, as they are defined in clause 4, be chosen, or is another agenda involved? As my right hon. Friend said, we do not necessarily think that that would be wrong, but we do need to know. Will a certain number of people represent ethnic minorities or women? Is there a separate agenda for the appointments?
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> Absolutely not. That demonstrates the narrowness with which the previous Administration made many of their appointments. The machinery that we inherited for making appointments and reappointments involves a very narrow choice. I forget how many thousand appointments need to be reviewed in my Department, but I am concerned about the machinery for making appointments, which involves vetting. We do not represent our society in its totality when selections are so narrow.
<P>
I have said in the House and in every region that I have visited, and I say again this morning, that that is why I am asking people to send me the names of people who should be considered. I do not care whether they are black or white, male or female, whether they work in a local authority, the business sector or in academia, or whether they are vice-chancellors. If they can make a contribution, I say to them, ``Please make sure that my Department knows about you.'' People will be picked for their skills. There must be fair and equal consideration when appointments are made. That has not happened to date, and it worries me and my colleagues. I extend my invitation in all seriousness. I am encouraged by the number of people who are applying. We are having an impact. People believe us when we say that they will be considered. We will continue to push that. The names that have already been submitted are encouraging.
<P>
On amendment No. 28 specifically, we believe that getting the board membership of the RDAs right is crucial to their success. We shall choose people who are committed to the values of public service and who have experience in areas relevant to the work of the RDAs.
<P>
The purpose for which the RDAs are being established makes it necessary that the boards contain members with substantial business skills and experience. Those with a business background will therefore predominate. However, the boards will reflect a balance of regional interests, not least those of local government.
<P>
We intend to avoid a fixed composition of sectoral interests. We shall look for candidates who can bring a range of experience. In particular, we shall look for those who have combined experience across a number of sectoral interests within a region. However, in the White Paper we propose that appointments to four of the 12 positions on each board be made from among local councillors in the region. We believe that that will help the boards to be more responsive to the communities that they serve.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> I am sorry to press the Minister, but this is important. I am reassured by most of what he said, but will he confirm that there will be no such thing as an ex officio local government appointment to the RDA? Will the leader of Sheffield--for whom I have much respect; I know him quite well--of Leeds, of Huddersfield or for that matter of North Yorkshire county council, from the mere fact of holding that position, necessarily secure a position on the board?
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> I give the hon. Gentleman that assurance. We expect, and I hope, that those who are nominated will reflect what I have said this morning and what was in the White Paper. We are looking for the best people for those positions. The chairperson of the economic regeneration committee in a local authority may be the right person; he may have the right skills. It is highly likely that his other employment will be in the business world. Candidates for the boards may have skills and experience in rural areas; there are some very good councillors who are skilled in rural areas. We must examine that very carefully. There are no set seats--or smoke-filled rooms.
<P>
A provision such as the hon. Member for Taunton proposes may give rise to difficulties in complex situations. For example, for special reasons, we might want to appoint a board of 12 or more members, but there might be no justification in appointing more than three councillors. Similarly, council members might resign shortly before the end of their term. In the interests of achieving a political and geographical balance and a balance between types of local authority, it may be deemed advisable to have only three RDA members from local authorities until the fourth can be replaced. Local government may not want to take up all of its allocation. I cannot foresee any such eventualities on the horizon, or indeed beyond the horizon. However, I am sure that hon. Members will understand that they must be provided for.
<P>
The hon. Lady's proposals are in line with our proposals. However, the amendment would work only for boards of 12 or more members. We do not intend to have boards on which half of the members are from local authorities. That would be the case under the proposed provisions, should the number of board members fall to eight or nine, which is allowable under the legislation.
<P>
The legislation must retain the flexibility to deal with smaller boards. The clause provides that flexibility. I ask the hon. Gentleman to accept my assurance that we shall honour our commitment in the White Paper about the level of local government involvement on the board. The White Paper made it clear that, like other candidates, members from local authorities must possess the necessary skills and experience to make a contribution to the work of the board. They should not act as delegates. It is clearly inconsistent with that view to require members to stand down on losing their local authority seats.

<P>

<B>Ms Rosie Winterton (Doncaster, Central):</B> I am sure that my hon. Friend the Minister has had many meetings with the Yorkshire and Humberside regional assembly. Will he comment on the points that it made about members of the board standing down from the local authority if they lose their electoral mandate? It made a number of comparisons with urban development corporations in this respect.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> My hon. Friend is right. I have had a number of discussions with the Yorkshire and Humberside Regional Association and others on this issue. Two weeks ago I was explaining our position to the Local Government Association.
<P>
First, members of the boards are not delegates; they are there for their own skills and as of right. I am sure that the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon will know that although the UDCs had local authority members on their boards, they were not delegates. The local authorities decided that if their representatives lost their seats they should retire from the boards. Again, my understanding is that they were not delegates; they were appointed by the Minister for the skills that they could bring to the UDCs. I can see no difference between the approach to UDC appointments and our approach to RDA appointments.
<P>
However, if local authorities wanted to use the same structures, and that had all-party support, that would be acceptable to the Government. If people resigned after an election, we would appoint from a list that we would hope to receive from local authorities. It is a valid point, and I am glad that I have had the opportunity to put on the record the Government's approach and the representations made to me by the Local Government Association and the Yorkshire and Humberside Regional Association.
<P>
To ensure the continuity of personal contributions, we think that it is important that board members should not be required to resign if they lose their electoral mandate. It would, of course, be for individual members to decide whether or not they wished to remain part of the RDA board on losing their seat. I therefore urge the hon. Member for Taunton to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
As for amendment No. 32, in addition to providing for board members to have a range of skills and experience, we intend to reflect an appropriate balance of regional interests in the compositions of boards. In doing so, we will consider a range of public and private bodies that are active in the region, the geography of the region and its urban-rural balance. As I explained earlier--I feel that it is worth repeating--board members will not be representative of any particular group, body or geographical area; they will be expected to take into account the interests of the region as a whole in reaching their decisions. It would therefore be inappropriate to amend the Bill in the way proposed. I urge that the amendment be withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Breed:</B> May I say a few words on amendment No. 32, which I alluded to earlier this morning.
<P>
Under the Bill in its present form, it would be perfectly possible to appoint a board with narrow geographical representation. The Minister has assured us that geographical representation will be taken into account in making appointments, but we feel that it is important enough to deserve mention in the Bill.
<P>
In recent years, it has seemed to me that many appointments, especially those made in my region, are given to the same people. The same faces seem to appear on different boards at various meetings, so the list of possible appointees seems to be getting ever narrower. So I am delighted to hear that the list is widening and I hope that there will be as much publicity as possible to encourage people to put themselves forward for appointment. There is a feeling that people can only be nominated. I am sure that they could be self-nominated, however, and I hope that many people will do so.
<P>
It will clearly be necessary for people on the board to wear more than one hat. Local councillors in rural areas may have a deal of experience in a certain industry, or even be large employers. To suggest that a business-driven board can be peopled only by business men and women is wrong.
<P>
When appointments are made from a widening list, I hope that geographical representation, which is how the board will be seen to be representative, will be great. The board may have a great deal of local knowledge, People may have lived in a region for many years and be conversant with all that happens there. They may have moved to a big city simply because of circumstances, for their job perhaps. They will be appointed for their knowledge of a particular region, but their address may be elsewhere. Geographical representation needs to be known and understood by everyone. A list of the board's members and the mini-CVs of members must clearly display members' interests especially their geographical interest.
<P>
People who feel that they have something to contribute on a particular subject must be able to contact someone on the board with whom they can identify. People should feel included and it would be difficult for someone from one geographical part of an area to feel an identity with someone who appears to live elsewhere. If we are to have large regions, it is important that all opportunities are given for wide geographical representation.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Ballard:</B> I am tempted to say that Ministers find the business of selecting people to appoint to boards and quangos very tedious. Perhaps they should hand over the job to the electorate. Directly elected organisations would save them from having such a large in-tray of conflicting interests.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> People have got wrong what the regional development agencies are. I will spell it out again. Even on the Scottish and Welsh scenes, and in London if the capital decides to have a directly elected authority, the development agencies will still exist and will be appointed by central Government, the Scottish Parliament, the Welsh assembly or the mayor of London. Those bodies will still set up a quango.
<P>
There is nothing wrong with quangos. What has been wrong has been the clear political manipulation of them. I have given the widest opportunity for people to put their names forward. We will set up quangos; the development agencies will be quangos, whether they are responsible to central Government, regional government, the Scottish Parliament or the Welsh assembly. The RDAs will not be elected in future, even when our devolution programme is in place.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Ballard:</B> I thank the Minister for that explanation. I was already aware of all that. He could reduce his in-tray by allowing appointments to be made by a regional tier of government and save himself some work.
<P>
I want to develop the argument about whether unelected quangos are the right bodies to disburse large amounts of public money.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon wondered what sort of people would be suitable to serve on the boards and the kinds of people who might be too busy, such as people who had dual mandates in local government. One might argue that the managing director of a large business would be too busy. It always amazes me how many people are extremely busy but find time voluntarily to give up their work to take part in all sorts of organisations. We all know that if one wants someone to do something, the best person to ask is a busy person.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> Does the hon. Lady agree that people who have retired from a busy business or other life might be available? Has she speculated on the Government's attitude to the appointment of people over the age of 60 or 65?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Ballard:</B> I thank the right hon. Gentleman for that intervention. I was about to move on to the issue of retired people. I have great sympathy for the Minister in finding a suitable balance for appointments to a board that has to reflect the make-up of a geographical area in all sorts of demographic terms. Age profile is important. Something that has concerned me and, I am sure, others over the past 10 years is the increase in the percentage of local councillors who are over retirement age. I would be the last person to argue that local authorities were necessarily representative of the communities that they serve. It is important that board membership should represent a sensible age balance and should not comprise all retired people or all people in their 20s.
<P>
I accept the Minister's assurances that he intends to honour the White Paper commitment to have at least four members, which I take to be a third, from local authorities. He clearly recognises the importance of having people on the board who have a democratic mandate but who also represent broad local authority interests rather than narrow community interests from their own geographical area. I am disappointed that the Minister will not accept that a local authority member who is on the board by virtue of being an elected councillor and who loses his seat should not remain a member of the board. However, I hope that he intends that, should a local authority member lose his seat, the next vacancy for board membership should go to another local authority member. The Minister is nodding, so I take it that that is his intention, in which case I shall seek to withdraw the amendment. I shall be happy if he intervenes to make it clear that that is his intention. He does not.
<P>
<B>Mr. Day:</B> He is just smiling.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Ballard:</B> Hansard does not record the Minister's smiles, unfortunately, beguiling as they are.
<P>
I was pleased to hear the Minister's assurances that he seeks geographical balance and a balance between urban and rural areas and that he accepts that that is important, although it is not written into the Bill. Because I am a generous person, I shall accept his assurances on both those matters.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I want to clarify one point. The Minister said that there was nothing wrong with quangos. That is perhaps a sentiment that one would expect, as he is taking through the Committee a Bill which sets up nine new quangos. However, I want to be clear whether that represents an official shift in Labour party policy. I refer the Minister to Hansard for 20 February 1997, when the right hon. Member for Sedgefield (Mr. Blair), as he then was, said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``We need to roll back the tide of quangos''. [Official Report, 20 February 1997: Vol. 290, c. 1076.]<P>

<P>
It would help the Committee if we understood which of these two statements now represented the Government's policy.

<P>

<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister was absolutely right. We shall roll back the tide. I have said clearly to the Committee that quangos have been misused. In 1975 a Labour Government put on to the statute book the Scottish and Welsh Development Agencies, both of which have stood the test of time, and indeed are quangos, in the real sense that they were there to do a job and tackle, in that instance, the economic problems of Scotland and Wales. Indeed, Lady Thatcher then went on to do exactly the same for Northern Ireland. We are doing for nine areas in England exactly what we did in 1975. It is not the quangos that were wrong; it was the way in which they were abused politically by the previous Administration that brought them into disrepute. As my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister said, we will roll back that tide. That is not to say that we will remove them altogether; we will use them where they are appropriate.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The mover, the hon. Member for Taunton, wishes to seek to withdraw her amendment, but as the hon. Member for South Suffolk has spoken since she expressed her to do so, I am not allowed to accept that motion. It may be for the convenience of the Committee if I explain that aspect of procedure in the Committee. The hon. Gentlemen may not have intended to prevent the withdrawal of the amendment. Had he indicated that he wanted to speak earlier, it could have been withdrawn. Alternatively the hon. Member for Taunton might have waited a moment or two before she withdrew it so that the hon. Gentleman could speak first. I say that only because I think that the Committee will go on for another two or three weeks and if hon. Members want to seek to withdraw amendments, I should like to facilitate their ability to do so.
<P>
The Committee will understand that I have to stay within the rules of the House. I cannot accept withdrawal of the amendment, but that does not mean that we have to have a Division. We can decide the matter by voice.
<P>
Amendment negatived.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Ballard:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 29, in page 1, line 17, at end insert

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(ca) such persons as appear to him to represent rural interests in the agency's area.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Ballard:</B> I am grateful for your guidance in the earlier matter, Dr. Clark, although I was not perhaps entirely at fault. As I said at our first sitting, this is a learning experience for my hon. Friend the Member for South-East Cornwall and me, if not for others.
<P>
We have had an interesting debate about the composition of board membership, and the Minister accepted the need for rural and urban interests to be balanced on it. Amendment No. 29 would merely ensure that at least one board member had direct experience of rural matters. As I said earlier, people in rural areas are concerned that a large RDA covering a large geographical area may be weighted towards the concerns of urban areas and urban regeneration rather than the need for rural regeneration and economic development in the rural parts of the area. That arises specifically because the RDAs will have half the budget of the Rural Development Commission. I understand that what is to be done with the other half of the budget has not yet been decided. It is vital that the RDAs do not spend that budget in seeking to attract large-scale businesses which, although they may give some prestige to the region and to the RDA, could not be absorbed in the rural areas and would not be appropriate in those areas. The Rural Development Commission has been particularly successful in initiating small-scale developments that are environmentally and economically appropriate to rural areas. I am thinking of village shops and small business developments. It is vital that RDAs should have a distinctive approach to rural regeneration, which is quite different from urban regeneration. That is why at least one member of each board should have proven experience in rural matters.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I want to speak particularly about amendment No. 9, tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Cheadle (Mr. Day) and me. There is genuine and deeply felt concern that RDAs will be urban based and urban in focus. They will be more interested in urban problems and issues and will be dominated by the urban. Their offices will be in towns. Their officers and staff will be drawn primarily from urban interests.
<P>
The extent of that concern was evident on Second Reading and in the responses to the consultation document. During Tuesday's sitting of this Committee, and again this morning, the Minister made several references to the importance of consultation, but was dismissive of my reference to the efforts required of any hon. Member who wants to study the responses in full. I found that surprising, given his emphasis on the support that the consultation had apparently given to the Government. If it was so supportive, it is surprising that he has not made it more readily available.
<P>
On the need for rural interests to be represented on the board, the responses are particularly instructive. The views of the National Farmers Union are quoted not once but twice in the White Paper, leading me to assume that the Government regard NFU views as important. On page 45, for example, the NFU is quoted as saying:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``There is clear merit in having one agency take a strategic overview of the needs and potential of a region''. As the Minister has such regard for the NFU's views, he may wish to know what it said elsewhere in its response about board membership. The NFU said:<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The legislation which creates Regional Development Agencies should require them to have regard to the needs of their rural areas and reflect those needs in their policies and programmes. It should also prescribe a minimum quota of rural interests on the membership of Regional Boards and''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
this is the key point--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``require the Agencies to consult with appropriate rural interests''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am sorry that there was no room for that quotation in the White Paper.
<P>
I do not suggest that the White Paper completely ignores the rural dimension in its selection of quotations. The Minister chose the following from the Consortium of Rural TECs, quoted on page 25 of the White Paper:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The regional functions of the RDC should be incorporated into the RDA which should maintain a `Rural issues desk'.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
However, the consortium also has views of relevance to clause 2. Under the heading ``RDA boards'', the consortium's document quoted in the White Paper said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Efforts to reflect major company representation and ethnic diversity on RDA boards could unwittingly result in a lack of rural representation. It is vital that rual businesses' interests should be represented as part of the balanced membership of an RDA board reflecting the diversity of the region.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree with that quote's implication that there are no women in rural life?
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I am not sure how the hon. Lady finds that opinion in the quote. Perhaps she reveals a certain sensitivity about the subject, but that is not my concern. That organisation took the trouble to respond to the consultation process, and its opinion was quoted--I imagine, with some approval and certainly with due recognition of the importance of its views--on another matter relating to RDAs. It was useful to hear what the Consortium of Rural TECs thinks about the board membership of RDAs, and I rather share its view.
<P>
The Minister--or perhaps his officials--were hard put to find much that was positive in the response of the Country Landowners Association, although there are some positive comments in its submission. It is a well-respected, mainstream, non-partisan body and the Department would have been embarrassed not to have quoted its opinion, especially because so many lesser organisations were being summoned to the party's aid to create the impression of widespread support. As our sittings continue that impression appears more diluted.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The CLA was quoted in the White Paper and, no doubt, the Minister would include its comments in the package of universal support that he mentioned earlier. Its views appear on page 16 of the White Paper. It stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The test for RDA involvement must be when the issue is too big to be resolved by a single County Council or Unitary Authority, yet not of a scale requiring national intervention.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Those parts of the CLA's response that the Minister chose not to quote in the White Paper contain a more specific suggestion than that which is in the passage that is quoted there. Paragraph 22 of its response contains its view of the membership of RDAs:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The CLA is concerned with the representation of rural areas within the RDAs. There is a real danger that RDAs will be biased towards representing urban interests. In order to ensure that RDAs do take into account the needs and aspirations of rural entrepreneurs, and of people living in rural areas generally, the CLA would argue in favour of a dedicated rural representation on the Board of the RDAs.''<P>

<P>
That goes further than my amendment--it is more in line with amendment No. 29, which was moved by the hon. Member for Taunton. However it is interpreted, it constitutes a powerful argument in supports of my case.
<P>
The Rural Development Commission was quoted twice in the White Paper, but again the quotations were highly selective. Its views on board membership were--perhaps predictably--excluded from the White Paper. I am not altogether surprised that chapter 10 of the White Paper, which is entitled ``Structure and Accountability of RDAs'' and which deals with board membership, relies mainly on a quotation from the TUC. The Rural Development Commission has a strong recommendation to make about board membership. Paragraph 18.b) of its report, which is entitled ``Membership'', states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``There should be at least 1 member of each Regional Development Agency with rural knowledge and experience''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That selection of quotations gives the opinions of organisations that the Minister thought it was worth quoting in the White Paper. He mentioned several times the importance of consultation. Those organisations have powerful views on the need to ensure that rural interests are properly represented on the boards of RDAs. It is difficult to see why the Minister--

<B>Angela Eagle:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman think that there should be a rural representative on the London RDA?
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> If the Under-Secretary had troubled herself to read my amendment, she would have seen that I am merely suggesting that there should be consultation with representatives of rural interests, just as the Bill provides for consultation with representatives of local councils, of employers and of employees. My amendment asks the Government to accept the need to consult other interests as well.
<P>
Perhaps the Under-Secretary did not get further than reading amendment No. 29, which requires the representation of rural interests in the form of a particular member. Her intervention would have been more appropriate to the earlier speech dealing with that amendment.
<P>
It is difficult to understand why the Minister of State might want to refuse to consult people who represent rural interests. If he does, he goes against much of what he has said in the two sittings of the Committee that we have had so far. Consultation with outside bodies has taken place after the consultation paper. It has also been a feature of his justification for the Bill. The amendment is merely designed to extend that process of consultation.
<P>
I should explain to the Committee why I believe that amendment No. 9 is preferable to amendment No. 29. I recognise that amendment No. 29 would ensure that RDA boards included a person with direct experience in rural matters. That would certainly be a great deal better than nothing. However, it is nowhere near enough.
<P>
In many parts of the country, the nature of the regions for which the boards are being established would produce more than one board member if consultation took place on a properly organised basis. To suggest that one member of 12--or possibly even one out of 15, if the number of board members is that high--would be adequate in the case of East Anglia is complete nonsense. Across the country, four-fifths of the land is rural and one-fifth of the population lives outside large towns. In some regions, those proportions are even more dramatic. If we are to have proper representation--
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> I was just reflecting on the debate that took place on Tuesday on the Floor of the House, in which the hon. Gentleman told us that we have concreted over the whole countryside to build houses.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> What I said on Tuesday--I am glad that the Minister gives me a chance to say it again--was that it was clearly the Government's intention to concrete over great chunks of the countryside. That interpretation is the direct result of the decisions that his Department has taken in the past nine months.
<P>
The proper representation of rural interests in regions such as East Anglia would result in more than one member of the board being needed to bring proper balance and expertise to its deliberations. The danger of amendment No. 29 is that RDAs and the Government might conclude that having a token board member representing rural interests would adequately discharge their obligations to the rural areas. It would not, especially in the more rural areas.
<P>
I am sure that the Minister is aware of the considerable interest in the clause that exists outside this place. Indeed, the Government's attitude towards the amendments may be regarded as symbolic of their attitude towards rural interests in relation to the Bill as a whole.
<P>
I want to avoid the procedural confusion that I may unwittingly have caused at the end of the previous sitting. I therefore state now that I shall press amendment No. 9 to a Division, even if the Committee has previously divided on amendment No. 29. I urge the Minister to consider carefully the arguments that have been put forward in support of the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> I rise to support my hon. Friend. It is a crucial issue--as the Minister will recognise when he pays attention; I realise that the attractions of the Under-Secretary are clearly greater than mine.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> Look at the time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> I am aware of the rules of the Committee. I do not believe it sensible to appoint one person with the label round his neck of representing the countryside. The Liberal Democrats are wrong to suggest that and so are the CLA. That label would mean that everyone else on the board need not concern himself or herself about the countryside, almost by definition. I want the entire RDA to recognise that the countryside has as many legitimate demands for regeneration as anywhere else. That is why the current regeneration budget is universal in its application, and I hope that it will continue to be so.
<P>
The whole board should be seized of the importance of the countryside, which brings us to clause 31 and the mandate and terms of reference to be given to the RDAs. No doubt a mission statement will eventually be produced as such things are in fashion.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will make it clear in the directions setting up the constitution of the boards that everyone on the boards will know that they represent every part of their area. The countryside ranks high in the priorities of the boards and has needs that are often difficult to define. Poverty and underdevelopment is often less obvious in the countryside and subsequently less easy to remedy. All that my hon. Friend the Member for South Suffolk wants is consultation during the appointment process. He is not asking for someone with a label round his neck and I hope that the Minister can endorse my hon. Friend's approach in order to allay fears that, justified or not, are alive in the countryside.
<P>
Difference is demonstrated in my region where south Yorkshire and west Yorkshire include countryside that runs to the Ribblehead viaduct, which is light years away in almost every aspect of its culture. I hope that the Minister will recognise diversity in his responses.
