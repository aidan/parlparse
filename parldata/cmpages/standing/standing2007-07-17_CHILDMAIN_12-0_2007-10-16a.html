							<a name="07101690000426"></a>Paul
Rowen:
						</b> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second
time.</div>
					<a name="07101690000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new clause
is a probing clause, and we are seeking information from the Minister
about private arrangements and, in particular, on how the new scheme
will work, once it is in place. I am sure that the Minister will argue
that the Government have already carried out research&#151;for
example, the indicators of future choices survey&#151;that shows that
they were correct in their estimate of the number of people who were
going to move to private arrangements. However, I want to point out to
the Minister that the survey was conducted with current users of the
CSA to find out what they would do when CMEC comes into
being&#151;whether they will register with CMEC on the new
maintenance agreement, whether they will register on the old agreement
or whether they will leave the system altogether. We feel that ongoing
research is needed to examine what people actually do once the
commission is
established.</div>
					<a name="07101690000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">As we
have discussed, the big group at risk is those who do not enter the
system at all. There will therefore be no reason for anybody to keep
track of them, and a large proportion of them may well be parents on
benefits who would previously have automatically enrolled before the
repeal in this Bill of section 6 of the Child Support Act 1991. In
particular, we want the research to focus on how many people have no
maintenance arrangements in place, especially as the purpose of the
Bill is to maximise the number of children for whom an effective
maintenance agreement is in place. I am sure that the Minister will
agree that we all want to tackle child poverty, and if we can encourage
voluntary arrangements that work and ensure that parents pay their fair
whack, it will help to do that. We feel that we need some sort of
research to keep track of that and to ensure that some of the concerns
that we have raised do not fall through a crack.</div>
					<a name="07101690000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">We know about the advice and
information services that the commission will provide, which might be
contracted out or handed over to the private and voluntary sectors. It
is important for them to have an opportunity to feed back to the
Government on their experiences and the people whom they see daily. Are
such people going through voluntary agreements? If they are not
following through those agreements, why not? What action might the
Government need to take? The matter will probably not need legislation,
but it might mean that the contracting out arrangements for support
need to go further than the Government have
envisaged.</div>
					<a name="07101690000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
the Minister may not agree with the new clause, I hope that he can
assure us that some such review will be carried out and reported to the
Select Committee. The private arrangement aspect of the Bill is its
most novel feature, and it is the cornerstone of its success. It is not
necessarily those who are in the system who are of concern, but those
who move into those 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column416" />Column number: 416</div>arrangements and might not enter into any private arrangements. If they
do not enter into a private arrangement, we need to know
why.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07101690000427"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:
						</b> I appreciate the hon. Member for Rochdale
tabling the new clause and discussing it in the way in which he did. He
is right to point out that we all have a concern in seeing how the new
system unfolds and ensuring that it meets the objectives that we have
set for it. I remind him that the commission is required to produce an
annual report of all its activities, which will always be an
opportunity for hon. Members and Parliament to review its progress. It
is open to the Select Committee to inquire at any time into how the new
arrangements are going, but that is a matter for the Committee, not me.
However, I am certain that I want to follow
progress.</div>
					<a name="07101690000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman is also right that the changes are big changes, especially
those to the voluntary arrangements, which is another reason why it is
important to take time over the transition. We need to spread knowledge
about the changes and make sure that all the other organisations and
bodies that are engaged with people going through the separation
process become aware of the support services, which will be very
important, and the move towards the far higher disregards, which will
completely change the incentive for parents with care to seek
arrangements under the new system.</div>
					<a name="07101690000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">I assure the hon. Gentleman and
others in Committee that we are fully committed to ensuring that a full
and comprehensive research programme is conducted to consider all the
issues that he has raised, and others. Indeed, research has already
told us a significant amount about all those areas, and it has helped
us with the decisions that we have been making about the design and
implementation of the information and support
service.</div>
					<a name="07101690000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I have
said, it is important not to rush research, and I am sceptical about
the value of linking research programmes to legislation in the direct
way set out in the new clause. I reassure the hon. Gentleman that we
are committed to publishing the findings of our research as soon as
they are available. In the area covered by his new clause, for example,
we have published independent research on the attitudes of parents
towards the reforms, and we have conducted a telephone survey of a
significant proportion of the current agency case load, asking about
the choices that people are likely to make once they can transfer to
the new
arrangements.</div>
					<a name="07101690000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
latter research showed that a significant proportion of CSA new scheme
parents with care on benefits&#151;almost two in five&#151;would be
likely to consider going for a voluntary arrangement, supported by the
services that we plan to introduce. Unsurprisingly, the research also
highlighted that there are advantages and disadvantages to voluntary
arrangements and that they are not suitable for everyone. Where a
voluntary arrangement is not preferred by parents, they will, of
course, be supported by the statutory maintenance service.</div>
					<a name="07101690000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">The relationship and separation
survey is also due to be published early next year. It will build on
the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column417" />Column number: 417</div>evidence provided by the telephone survey through face-to-face
interviews with around 2,500 parents who have voluntary arrangements or
arrangements through the CSA or the courts. I hope that I can reassure
the hon. Gentleman that we will continue to conduct and publish
research to ensure that the new maintenance system is as effective as
possible, and to evaluate its success. There will be abundant
opportunities for Parliament to monitor and assess performance through
various processes as we move into the new arrangements. I hope that
that is sufficient to reassure the hon. Gentleman and that he will
withdraw the
motion.</div>

service&#146;s information strategy, the Criminal Records Bureau, the
National Air Traffic Services system and the national programme for
information technology in the NHS, as well as the moving of the GCHQ
computer system.</div>
					<a name="07101690000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is a brief list. Thankfully, not all of them were at the Department for
Work and Pensions, but it is worth putting on record that the recent
history of Government&#151;of both parties, it is fair to
say&#151;has not been glorious. The new clause is a small, practical 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column418" />Column number: 418</div>proposal to ensure that there is one individual who will see the
contract all the way through. In the civil service, as elsewhere, it is
not unusual for people to be moved after a time, perhaps because of
other opportunities that fit their career path, but with public sector
contracts of this size and importance, there is a valid case for one
person earning stars on the career path by seeing the project through.
I hope that the Minister will look favourably on the new
clause.</div>

							<a name="07101690000430"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:
						</b> Before I respond specifically to the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s point, I shall respond generally. It is a kind of
mantra&#151;time and time again we hear public sector IT contracts
slated by people reeling off a list such as that. I urge, however, that
it be kept in proportion. There have been some huge, remarkably
successful public sector IT contracts. I pray in aid the IT programme
in my Department that introduced direct payment of benefits after the
phasing-out of order books. It was a huge programme and a massive
investment, and it came off almost without a hitch. We have examples of
projects that worked very well, as well as those that throw up
problems.</div>
					<a name="07101690000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is also
important to keep the issue in balance. It is not as though the same
problems do not exist in the private sector. Some huge private sector
IT contracts have not exactly gone smoothly. It is not just that only
the poor old Government have IT problems. The issue can come up in
private sector as well as public sector operations. I say that to
balance the comments predictably made by the hon. Gentleman, but I
reassure him that as a non-departmental public body, the commission
will have to adhere to the EU and public sector procurement regulations
and all associated requirements regarding value for money and
transparency. In addition to the procedures under the regulations, the
commission will follow the guidelines set out by the Office of
Government Commerce to ensure that it maintains a rigorous approach to
its procurement.</div>
					<a name="07101690000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the hon. Gentleman&#146;s idea in the new clause, the Department for
Work and Pensions and the agency already have in place a dedicated
contract manager to oversee the current IT contracts. It is expected
that that practice will be continued by the commission once it has been
established. It will develop a commercial strategy of its own, which,
as previously mentioned, will follow EU and public sector procurement
regulations and Office of Government Commerce procedures, which promote
the importance of contracting authorities having in place a dedicated
procurement and contract management system. I therefore think that the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s objective is met and that his new clause is
therefore unnecessary, so I hope that he will agree to withdraw the
motion.</div>

Selous:
						</b> I have heard what the Minister had said, and of
course he is right that there have been huge IT projects that have been
successful. He might have mentioned the Pension Service system in his
own Department, which has been reasonably successful. However,
independent observers and those who study the effect on our public
finances agree that the overall record shows that we must do a lot
better than we have in the past. Sadly, vast amounts of public money
have 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column419" />Column number: 419</div>been wasted, and the inefficiencies have meant that people using
services have not been well
served.</div>
					<a name="07101690000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">I listened
carefully to what the Minister has said. He said that a senior manager
is currently responsible for the project, and I believe that he said
that it was expected that that person would remain in place in CMEC
when it is established, but I shall stick to my guns on this one. We
know enough history to learn from what has gone wrong in the past, and
I wish it to be stated in the Bill that that individual will indeed
stay in place until the computer contract has been bedded down. I shall
therefore press the new clause to a
Division.</div>

but, for example, an investigation ought to be initiated if the
non-resident parent had significant dividend income that was logged by
a different system&#151;we should recall our earlier discussion of
the different pots of income that are on separate HMRC systems. I
understand what the hon. Gentleman is saying and that the basis for
initiation would be prior year HMRC tax accounts, but there could still
be cases in which an assessment did not include the full scope of a
person&#146;s income. In such cases, given the separation of sources

agreement might not fully reflect the scope of
income.</div>

							<a name="07101690000467"></a>Paul
Rowen:
						</b> I hope that the Minister will accept the new
clause. We are moving to a different situation from that under the CSA,
which places the onus on the parent with care to provide evidence
before a variation will be made. Under the new system, the commission
will progressively gain access to more information about the financial
circumstances of non-resident parents with care&#151;it will not
happen overnight. It is about gaining progressively more information.
There is no way that from day one of the commission&#146;s operation
its systems and HMRC&#146;s systems will be set up in such a way that
information flows smoothly and without glitches. I am thinking in
particular about what the hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire has
said about dividend income, which is declared in a totally different
context from that in which any other earned income is declared, and
which may well be declared later.</div>

							<a name="07101690000468"></a>Andrew
Selous:
						</b> I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will confirm my
understanding that dividend income is disregarded for child support
purposes, unless the parent with care seeks a variation and can prove
that dividend income is being received, which they may not have the
power to do. That, in part, may give a fuller answer to the hon. Member
for
Angus.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07101690000469"></a>Paul
Rowen:
						</b> I agree with the hon. Member for South-West
Bedfordshire. Dividend income is a substantial part of some
people&#146;s income, so it should be taken into account. When a
family splits up, the longer the split, the more difficult it is for
the parent with care to say, &#147;This is the income source that you
need to look at, and therefore you need to have a variation on
it.&#148; Once the systems are operating with HMRC, during the year
in which an initial income assessment is made, based on previous years,
more information, which may not be directly available to the parent
with care, may come to light, demonstrating that there are considerable
assets that should be taken into account in any maintenance
calculation.</div>
					<a name="07101690000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
situation is simple: it is about allowing the commission to initiate
that variation, which is an important principle. If the systems between
HMRC and the commission work well, there will not be a once-over flow
of information, but a continual flow of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column422" />Column number: 422</div>information. Knowledge and systems operation will
get better. The commission&#146;s ability to make that variation is
an important flexibility that would not detract from the principles of
the Bill, but would ensure that it works better. I understand that the
commission may not want to burden itself by having to run checks
automatically, but that is not the point. The number of parents for
whom dividend or other income sources are an important part of their
income is tiny but nevertheless important. When the information comes
to light, it must be acted upon, so I hope that the Minister will look
on the new clause favourably and understand what we are trying to do,
which is to ensure that all information and income is properly taken
into account.</div>
					<a name="07101690000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07101690000470"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:
						</b> I am grateful to the hon. Members for
South-West Bedfordshire and for Rochdale for speaking to the new
clause. I entirely understand the motivations behind what they have
said, but I shall try to demonstrate that the provision already exists
to achieve what they rightly seek. Sufficient powers are already at the
disposal of the agency as it is&#151;the commission as it will
be&#151;to address their points. Furthermore, the means that they
have encouraged us to use would throw up some
difficulties.</div>
					<a name="07101690000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">Sections
28A to 28G of the 1991 Act allow the rules by which a maintenance
calculation is made to be varied in special circumstances. For example,
a non-resident parent may incur significant travel costs in order to
see their child, or a parent with care may feel that the income figure
used on the assessment is inconsistent with the income needed to
maintain the lifestyle of the non-resident parent. They are variations
as we know them. Currently, before a variation can be made there must
be an application by one of the parents, which the CSA then considers.
The new clause would allow the commission itself to initiate the
process of making a variation, without being asked to do so by either
party involved in the
case.</div>
					<a name="07101690000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are aware
that parents with care can find it difficult either to make an
application for a variation in the maintenance calculation or to know
when to make one. Few of them are likely to have an intimate knowledge
of the non-resident parent&#146;s finances, certainly as time goes
on, and particularly if they are non-resident parents who already
manipulate their finances to reduce their maintenance liability.
However, we do not believe that it would be helpful to have the
commission make variations without an application, as the amendment
proposes. First, the commission will not routinely hold all the
information that would suggest the need for a variation. For example,
it would be very unlikely to hold information about the lifestyle of
the non-resident parent and whether it is significantly inconsistent
with the declared income, or information that suggests that the
non-resident parent is diverting income to a new partner. We simply do
not think that the commission is ever likely to have such information
at its
disposal.</div>
					<a name="07101690000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">Officials
are in discussion with HMRC about the types of income information that
they will provide to the commission for maintenance purposes,
but, although it may include information on certain types of unearned
income, it would not cover all non-resident parents with such income.
Hence, variations would be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column423" />Column number: 423</div>initiated for only part of the caseload, which would
create an inequity
problem.</div>
					<a name="07101690000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">A further
reason why the amendment is inappropriate is that it would apply to all
types of variation. Six of the grounds for a variation are those on
which a non-resident parent applies to have their maintenance reduced.
Five of those are for cases where the non-resident parent has certain
expenses&#151;for example, the costs of maintaining contact with
their children. We see no reason why the commission should initiate a
variation in such cases, as the non-resident parent has at their
fingertips all the information and evidence that they need to make an
application. If they believe that paying the expenses means that they
will be unable to pay the liability under the standard
maintenance calculation, they can apply for a variation. Some
non-resident parents may easily be able to afford to pay the basic
maintenance liability, despite paying expenses. The commission will
ensure that non-resident parents have access to information about
variations, but it should be their decision to apply for
one.</div>
					<a name="07101690000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are liaising
with key stakeholders and are currently considering all aspects of the
variations scheme. Any resulting changes would, of course, be set out
in secondary legislation. As part of that work, we are looking at
providing more information, so that parents are better informed when
making variation applications. In particular, we are considering how we
might alert parents with care that an application for a variation may
be appropriate. We are considering developing a system of risk
profiling to highlight such cases, which may well include exactly the
sort that have been mentioned. We think that that will allow better use
of the commission&#146;s resources than would placing an onus on the
commission to initiate a variation in all likely cases. The commission
will also be able to use its information-gathering
powers to investigate applications, once such an application is drawn
to its attention. With those assurances, I hope that the hon. Gentleman
will withdraw the new
clause.</div>

Selous:
						</b> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second
time.</div>
					<a name="07101690000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new clause
is an attempt to get a little bit of equity between the court-based
system and the operation of the commission on the amount of full and
frank disclosure that is made between the parties. It is proposed for
the commission that the parent with care will be deprived of the
opportunity to check that the information given is correct or complete
and therefore will not be able to evaluate whether the commission has
made an appropriate decision by reference to the information provided.
In that context, will the Minister tell the Committee what will be the
position in relation to HMRC and its usual, quite proper rules of
privacy regarding income? We touched on that area in earlier debates,
but this is a useful opportunity to revisit
it.</div>
					<a name="07101690000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new clause
would help parents with care to take ownership of their cases and
ensure that they are not kept in the dark in respect of any aspect of
them. Then, armed with that information, they would be able to decide
whether they wanted to apply for a variation. I hope that the Minister
will look favourably on the new
clause.</div>
					<a name="07101690000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07101690000489"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:
						</b> I will try to reassure the hon. Gentleman on
this new clause. We already have the powers to make regulations to
decide what information can be disclosed to parents under the 1991 Act.
Current regulations give the Child Support Agency the power to release
all details relevant to the maintenance calculation, including the
income of the non-resident parent. Furthermore, the Data Protection Act
1998 allows both parents access to all the details of their case, as it
relates to them. Parents with care have access to data protection
prints setting out the maintenance calculation for their case, which
can be used to highlight discrepancies between expected and actual
maintenance liabilities. As such, parents with care have access to all
the information that they require to query details of the maintenance
calculation that they believe to be
flawed.</div>
					<a name="07101690000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 17
would allow the commission to disclose inappropriate information, such
as the address or contact details of the non-resident parent, to the
parent with care, with little additional prospect of an improved
maintenance decision coming from that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column425" />Column number: 425</div>disclosure. We must ask whether the damage to the privacy of the
non-resident parent, which is important, and the opening up of the
commission to the threat of legal challenge could justify such a
change.</div>
					<a name="07101690000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">The use of
HMRC income information as the basis for maintenance calculations under
the new statutory scheme would also be affected by the powers that the
new clause would provide. The use of such a broad power of information
disclosure could endanger the flow of information from HMRC to the
commission. Section 18 of the Commissioners for Revenue and Customs Act
2005 in effect prohibits the disclosure of income information that has
not been used for the maintenance calculation. As such, the existence
of the power under the new clause would perhaps prohibit HMRC from
providing the commission with vital income information&#151;the
opposite of what I am sure the hon. Gentleman would want to be the
case.</div>
					<a name="07101690000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although it is
true that parents with care have access to a much broader range of
information once the appeals process has begun, that is the appropriate
forum for access to that type of sensitive information. A closely
monitored legal environment is a far more appropriate domain for the
release of that information than unregulated disclosure by the
commission. Although it is appropriate at the appeals stage for both
parties to have access to a wider range of information to ensure that
disputes can be resolved, we do not believe that disclosing that type
of information in all cases, the vast majority of which will never go
to appeal, should be considered. I hope that, in view of those points,
the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the
motion.</div>

Rowen:
						</b> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second
time.</div>
					<a name="07101690000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 19
has two parts: proposed new subsection (a) would give the parent with
care the right to make representations, orally or in writing, to a
court or appeal tribunal, if enforcement action is planned; proposed
new subsection (b) would give the parent 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column426" />Column number: 426</div>with care the right to apply to a magistrates court or appeal tribunal
in order to make their own enforcement
actions.</div>
					<a name="07101690000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is ironic
that if the commission or CSA were to initiate an enforcement action,
the person directly affected&#151;the parent with care&#151;who
might have important information about the financial position or assets
of the non-resident parent cannot make any direct representations to
the court or tribunal. That seems to go against any sense of natural
justice, given that they will be directly affected by the enforcement
action. Any decision taken in the court or tribunal will have a major
impact on the income that they
receive.</div>
					<a name="07101690000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">During
previous discussions, we talked about the small number of non-resident
parents who have hidden assets. However, the assets of most other
non-resident parents will be more visible, but not necessarily of a
type that is reported to the commission for the purposes of
maintenance. We should not exclude the parent with care from making
representations. I am not saying that they should make the
determination, but given that they and the child in their care will be
directly affected by the decision of a court or tribunal, they should
be allowed to make
representations.</div>
					<a name="07101690000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">Proposed
new subsection (b) would provide for what the R (Kehoe) <i class="I">v.</i>
Secretary of State for Work and Pensions judgment specifically
excluded. At the moment, a parent with care has no right to recover
child care maintenance direct from the non-resident parent. That right
was removed by the Child Support Act 1991. I accept that in the vast
majority of cases a parent with care would not want to initiate their
own action, but I am sure that there are examples of parents with care
feeling aggrieved with the CSA, as it is currently operated, for making
an enforcement action that did not take account of everything. The
second part of the new clause would give them the right to initiate
their own action, which we think is a fundamental
right.</div>
					<a name="07101690000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">Proposed new
subsection (a) would allow them to make representations, and proposed
new subsection (b) would allow them to take action, if they felt that
that taken by the commission was not appropriate. If exercised, those
rights would be important to the parent with care. They might well not
be used often; I suspect that the first right would be used a lot more
often than the second. Nevertheless, given that they are directly
affected by enforcement decisions, they should be able to make
representations. I hope that the Minister will carefully examine that
matter and see what we are trying to
achieve.</div>
					<a name="07101690000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07101690000492"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:
						</b> I welcome the opportunity to discuss new clause
19. The commission will need to keep both parents informed. However, we
must be clear: the commission&#146;s role is to consider the position
of both parents and the welfare of the child or children involved. Its
duty is not to act solely as the representative of the parent with
care.</div>
					<a name="07101690000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clauses 20 to 28
contain a number of administrative provisions to streamline the
enforcement process and enable the commission to take swift and
effective enforcement action. The parent with care has the opportunity
to contest maintenance calculations at an earlier stage, and giving
them the opportunity to make 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column427" />Column number: 427</div>additional representations will not assist the court
further in making the right decision; indeed, it could result in a
delay to the enforcement process and incur additional
costs.</div>
					<a name="07101690000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">Where
enforcement hearings are held in open court, the parent with care can
watch the proceedings, although they have no right to make
representations to the court. In practice, however, magistrates courts
usually hear such cases in the family court, where they have a power to
exclude persons who are not directly involved in the case. The court
has discretion to permit a person who has adequate grounds for
attending to be present, although they still do not have the right to
make
representations.</div>
					<a name="07101690000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection
(b) of the new clause would give the parent with care the right to
apply to a magistrates court or appeal tribunal to effect collection
and enforcement measures under clauses 20 to 28. That
would not be feasible, however, as most of those
measures would be administrative and the responsibility of the
commission, not the courts.</div>
					<a name="07101690000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new
clause would therefore delay the enforcement process and greatly affect
the court&#146;s business. In view of that, I hope that the hon.

motion.</div>

							<a name="07101690000493"></a>Paul
Rowen:
						</b> I have listened to what the Minister has said, but
I cannot agree with him. He has not explained how allowing the parent
with care to make written or oral representations at a hearing that is
already scheduled could delay the decision by the court or the
tribunal. As he has correctly stated, the parent with care already has
the right to attend, but like someone present at their own funeral,
they cannot say anything. In this case, the parent with care should be
allowed to say something or to put in a written
application. I cannot understand how that would delay the
proceedings; it should merely ensure that the court or the tribunal has
all the information in front of it before making its
decision.</div>
					<a name="07101690000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">My second
point related to whether someone could initiate an action themselves.
That is likely to occur in only a small number of cases, but it is
nevertheless important that people should have the right to initiate
such an action. I would therefore like to press the motion to a

					<a name="07101690000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am sure that I
can see a glint in your eye, Mr. Taylor, as we reach the
last new clause on the amendment paper. New clause 22 is similar to new
clause 19, which we have just debated, but it relates to cases in which
the commission has been trying for more than a year without success to
recover debts owed to a parent with
care.</div>

pm</div>
					<a name="07101690000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new clause
would give parents with care the power, if they chose to use
it&#151;it would not force them to do anything&#151;to approach a
magistrates court or the sheriff in Scotland to seek enforcement of the
debt owed to them. That useful measure would enable the parent with
care to take some control over their case and would provide an
incentive for CMEC to ensure that it was as successful as possible in
collecting debt. I commend the new clause to the
Minister.</div>
					<a name="07101690000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07101690000511"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:
						</b> I thank the hon. Member for South-West
Bedfordshire for tabling the new clause, which provides me with the
opportunity to allay concerns&#151;I hope&#151;regarding the future
enforcement of child maintenance. It sets out circumstances, as he has
described, where the parent with care could enforce a child maintenance
debt.</div>
					<a name="07101690000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">I remind the
hon. Gentleman that the provisions in the Bill will support parents
with care in choosing how to pursue child maintenance initially. We are
establishing the information support service, revoking section 6 of the
Child Support Act 1991, to give parents with care the chance to take
greater control over their maintenance arrangements. Where a parent
with care chooses the commission to calculate and collect child
maintenance, the new powers provided in clauses 19 to 28 will
supplement the existing powers to ensure a faster and more
wide-reaching enforcement process.</div>
					<a name="07101690000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">The commission will have a
range of options available to enable it to enforce the maintenance
payments, including the deduction of earnings order, the current
account deduction order and/or the lump sum deduction order, all of
which will only be operable by the commission. Similarly, only the
commission will be able to make an administrative liability order,
which will allow for the use of bailiffs and, in England and Wales,
applications to the county court for third-party debt orders and
charging orders that can lead to forced sale of property. Where the
non-resident parent is wilfully refusing or culpably neglecting to pay
maintenance, the commission can force the surrender 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column429" />Column number: 429</div>of passports or apply to the courts for disqualification from driving,
for a curfew order or even for committal to
prison.</div>
					<a name="07101690000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">In view of the
extensive range of provisions available to the commission, I urge the
hon. Gentleman to consider the circumstances under which the parent
with care, on pursuing maintenance in the magistrates courts after one
year of enforcement action by the commission, would be any more likely
to have success.</div>
					<a name="07101690000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand the sentiment behind the new clause. Since its inception in
1993, the Child Support Agency has, in too many cases, been slow or has
failed to enforce maintenance as assessed. However, allowing the parent
with care effectively to take over enforcement action from the
commission where it has not collected all moneys due could act as a
disincentive to the commission to pursue its more difficult cases. I
ask the Committee to consider the wider-reaching impacts of the new
clause. It could risk complication and duplication in the courts,
without any significant benefit to the children, and it could be
inequitable in cases where the non-resident parent owes maintenance to
more than one parent with care and/or the Secretary of State. In view
of that, I urge the hon. Gentleman not to press the new clause to a
Division.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07101690000512"></a>Andrew
Selous:
						</b> I have listened carefully to the Minister. He gave
a summary of the CMEC&#146;s powers to enforce and collect debt and
to ensure that debt does not accumulate in the first place, the vast
majority of which we Conservatives are happy with and welcome. However,
none of what he said in respect of those matters touched on what new
clause 22 is trying to do, which is to address a situation where all
those powers have failed and the commission has had a full year to
pursue debt that has accumulated in spite of the various powers that it
will have. Many parents with care have, under the CSA, felt too
powerless to do anything themselves to recover the huge amounts of debt
owed to them.</div>
					<a name="07101690000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">It was
only in the last sentence or so that the Minister made me think twice
about the new clause&#151;when he mentioned the possibility of the
power it contains being used to pursue a non-resident parent whose
affairs were complicated and who had perhaps become a parent with care
himself. In the light of that, I am prepared not to press the new
clause, although I may perhaps think about taking it up again in
another format. However, given what he has said, I beg to ask leave to
withdraw the
motion.</div>

							<a name="07101690000514"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:
						</b> We have reached the end of the Committee stage,
and, in one sense, it has been a long journey because we started on 19
July. In another sense, it has not been such a long journey, because we
took a long time off in the middle of that and managed to get through
the Bill in 12 sittings.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column430" />Column number: 430</div>
					<a name="07101690000296"></a><div class="hs_Para">May I first thank you,
Mr. Taylor, for chairing our proceedings and for the fine
manner with which you have done it? I also extend my thanks to your
colleague, Mr. Chope, for the sittings that he chaired. I
owe thanks to several other people, including my hon. Friend the Member
for Caerphilly, who has kept us whipped and in order, and the
Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, my hon. Friend the
Member for Stirling, who took us through important clauses relating to
enforcement, debt and those today that related to mesothelioma. I am
grateful to her.</div>
					<a name="07101690000297"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
grateful also to the leading spokespeople for the other
parties&#151;to the hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire for
approaching the Bill constructively and with great seriousness and
thought. I am grateful to the hon. Member for Angus, who has been
similarly assiduous on many points about which he had concerns. He
contributed much value to our proceedings. I was going to extend
similar thanks to the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and
Strathspey, but I guess that he is polishing his CV. Therefore, I will
extend those thanks to the hon. Member for Rochdale instead, who has
borne the brunt of that role.</div>
					<a name="07101690000298"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to thank my hon. Friend
the Member for North-East Derbyshire, who has given me support as my
Parliamentary Private Secretary during the course of proceedings. She
has had to be ready at any time to supply me with mid-flight refuelling
and has been ever expectant. I would like to pay tribute to my hon.
Friend the Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone for his
contribution, in particular to our debates on mesothelioma. He denied
that he was an expert and then proved that the opposite was the case by
speaking articulately and with great knowledge about that important
subject.</div>
					<a name="07101690000299"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also thank
all of the other members of the Committee for their attendance, support
and contributions. All of our sittings have been, without exception,
constructive and extremely good natured, and the Bill has been pretty
well scrutinised. As a result of our proceedings, we have collectively
improved the Bill, and that is one of the main purposes of these
sittings. In that respect, it is a job well done.</div>
					<a name="07101690000300"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, I want to thank the
Bill team, who have been with us throughout, were involved long before
our proceedings, and have been a superb support to me and my hon.
Friend the Under-Secretary. We are very grateful to them for their
immense hard work in bringing this important legislation though in such
good shape.</div>
					<a name="07101690000301"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is a
tough area in which to legislate and a difficult part of the welfare
world. We are legislating in this area only because of such things as
relationship breakdowns, emotion and tension, and as a result of the
unfortunate fact that some parents wish to be non-compliant, preferring
instead not to face up to their responsibilities. If everyone always
faced up to their responsibilities, we probably would not need the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="07101690000302"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are dealing
with human failure&#151;it is not for us to judge, but it
happens&#151;and it is inevitably difficult to deal with. We know
that there is no perfect solution. I was not here at the time, but the
same things could have been said about the legislation that brought the
CSA into existence. That had cross-party support and many 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column431" />Column number: 431</div>similar things may have been said about why it had to be brought into
being. It has not had a happy history, which is why we are now taking a
completely new approach to trying to secure a reliable and workable
system of child support.</div>
					<a name="07101690000303"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are building on the lessons
learned from the CSA&#146;s history. I stress again that the failings
of that agency are in no regard to be visited on its staff, either then
or now. They have been working with and trying to make the best of a
broken system. They want nothing more than to be part of a good,
efficient and effective child maintenance and support system that
delivers for the children. I thank them for all their efforts in
working with the current system, but also for the help that they gave
Ministers as we considered the reforms that led to the introduction of
CMEC. We have engaged with them and drawn on their knowledge and
experience, and they are as hopeful as we are that we have found a good
solution.</div>
					<a name="07101690000304"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is a
fundamental change&#151;a big change&#151;that relies much more on
extending choice to parents and pulling the state out of arrangements
when perhaps the state should not be there. Hopefully, it will give
much more support and guidance to the people to make those choices and
put in place the arrangements necessary to support their
children.</div>
					<a name="07101690000305"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are also
significantly strengthening enforcement. Unfortunately, as I said
earlier, we sometimes have to deal with those non-resident
parents who would rather not face up to their responsibilities and
who, in so doing, damage and harm the reputation of the
countless non-resident parents who consistently, steadily and
faithfully honour their obligations to their children. We must not
forget them simply because the minority behave in that way. We should
not cast aspersions on the vast majority who do exactly the right
thing.</div>
					<a name="07101690000306"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are trying
to learn from the lessons of the past in making these big changes,
which are backed with enforcement to ensure that we do the best we can
for the main people involved&#151;the children. We hope and believe
that the commission has a far more effective structure and organisation
in order to get the flow of maintenance that is so essential to the
children, and it is on their behalf that we act.</div>
					<a name="07101690000307"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thank all hon. Members again
for their contributions. Together, we have improved the Bill. I think
that we will have provided a good service for many thousands of
children in the future.</div>

							<a name="07101690000515"></a>Andrew
Selous:
						</b> I begin by thanking you, Mr. Taylor,
for the way in which you have kept us in order&#151;firmly and
fairly, but always with good humour. I put those compliments on the
record also for your co-Chairman, Mr. Chope, who chaired
some of our earlier proceedings. I also thank the police, the
<i class="I">Hansard</i> writers, the Clerks, the Door Keepers and those
officials without whom we the Committee could not have
worked&#151;people who are not in the front line, and whose words
will not appear in the <i class="I">Official Report</i>, but who we all realise
are essential to our proceedings and without whom this place could not
work. I say that as someone who sometimes queues for tea for his own
staff.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column432" />Column number: 432</div>
					<a name="07101690000309"></a><div class="hs_Para">Earlier in our proceedings, just
before the summer recess, the Under-Secretary of State for Work and
Pensions, the hon. Member for Warwick and Leamington, said that he
would have a summer of reflection&#151;a chance to reflect on what
had been said up till that point. That was the case, but there are
still a few weeks for an autumn of discernment as we run up to Report
and Third Reading.</div>
					<a name="07101690000310"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that the Minister and his hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State
for Work and Pensions, the hon. Member for Stirling, will reflect on
our debates. It is not always easy or appropriate in Committee to think
deeply about technical and complicated issues, but I am sure that I
speak for all hon. Members on the Opposition Benches when I say that we
want to make the Bill work. We supported it when we thought it should
be supported, and we tried to be constructive when we thought things
could be done
better.</div>
					<a name="07101690000332"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.15
pm</div>
					<a name="07101690000311"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thank the
Minister for his kind words. Both Ministers have been courteous and
have unfailingly taken interventions, which have often been long,
complicated and technical. I have watched the odd moment of slight
terror as they turned to their officials hoping for a piece of paper
coming towards them, but our proceedings have been seamless, as
<i class="I">Hansard</i> will
show.</div>
					<a name="07101690000312"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thank my hon.
Friends, particularly my hon. Friend the Member for Forest of Dean, who
has important responsibilities for disabilities and who has
assisted me throughout long periods of our proceedings. I also thank
our Whip, my hon. Friend the Member for Peterborough, who has kept us
in order, and my hon. Friend the Member for Weston-super-Mare, who sits
on the Work and Pensions Committee and whose advice I always
welcome.</div>
					<a name="07101690000313"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Selection
Committee has appointed my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Bedfordshire
to another important Committee, and I want to put it on the record that
she is doing important work further along the corridor. I am
particularly grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry for his
wise and sage advice. He has followed these issues for many
years.</div>
					<a name="07101690000314"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to put
on the record the fact that the staff of the CSA have laboured under
huge difficulties to try to make it work in years gone by. They, too,
have shared the frustrations of all hon. Members as we have dealt with
such issues in our constituency mailbags. It is not their fault that
the computers have not worked as well as they would have liked or they
have not had the tools at their disposal to make enforcement work as
well as it should have done. It is important to put that on the
record.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07101690000516"></a>Paul
Rowen:
						</b> I echo some of those thanks, particularly those to
you, Mr. Taylor, and to Mr. Chope for chairing
our proceedings so well. We have had 12 sittings and kept to schedule,
but no one would complain that they have not had the opportunity to
express a point of
view.</div>
					<a name="07101690000317"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thank all
staff of the House who have assisted you&#151;<i class="I">Hansard</i> and so
on&#151;and who have played an important part. On
behalf of my hon. Friend the Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and
Strathspey, I thank 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column433" />Column number: 433</div>the two Ministers who have answered the points that we have raised. We
have not always agreed on the substance, but we have always been
assured that we would receive
answers.</div>
					<a name="07101690000318"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is my
first experience of a work and pensions Bill&#151;it will probably
not be the last&#151;and, as other hon. Members have said, it covers
hugely important issues. The CSA is important and affects many of our
constituents. Its staff have laboured on the huge task of getting it
right. I know from my office&#146;s daily contact with it that they
strive with a system that is broke and not working, but they ensure
that it delivers.</div>
					<a name="07101690000319"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that with further changes that we might make as the Bill moves
through the House, we will have the basis of a workable solution. I am
sure that every hon. Member intends to ensure that this aspect of
legislation is dealt with and works properly. That was the intention of
the Act that set up the CSA. It has not worked, and I hope that the
Bill puts that in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column434" />Column number: 434</div>perspective. I thank all hon. Members, particularly Opposition Members,
who have supported me and assisted in moving important
amendments.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07101690000517"></a>The
Chairman:
						</b> I shall certainly pass on the sentiments of
those who have spoken to my fellow Chairman, Mr. Chope. I
express my gratitude to him for chairing two sittings at very late
notice, and I thank the Clerk to the Committee for his unfailing
patience and excellent advice. The legislative ship, after a long
voyage of 13 weeks and 12 sittings, straddling a summer recess, is
docking four hours and 40 minutes earlier than the target out time.
That is due in no small measure to the spirit and good order that has
characterised the debate, for which Mr. Chope and I are most
grateful.</div>
