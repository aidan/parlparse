</P>
<P>
<B>The Minister for Small Firms, Trade and Industry (Mrs. Barbara Roche):</B> I beg to move,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> That, during the proceedings on the Late Payment of Commercial Debts (Interest) Bill [Lords], the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock and half-past Four o'clock.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I welcome you, Mrs. Roe, to the Committee and congratulate you on presiding over what I believe is your first full-length Bill Committee. You are an experienced hon. Member and well respected throughout the House, and we all look forward to your wise chairmanship.
<P>
It is with great pleasure that we begin proceedings on the Bill. It will aid our small business community, which is the backbone of our economy. Small businesses have sought such a measure for a long time and I pay tribute to the hard campaigning work of Stan Mendham and the Forum of Private Business. The Bill has great support in the business community and I look forward to a constructive debate.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Cheryl Gillan (Chesham and Amersham):</B> On behalf of Opposition Members, I warmly welcome you, Mrs. Roe, to the Committee. We are delighted that you will be overseeing our proceedings. I join the Minister in saying how pleased we are that you are Chairman of a Standing Committee. Your reputation is without parallel. You have a long track record in the House, not least with your sterling service on statutory instruments Committees. We shall try not to be too much trouble.
<P>
<B>Mr. Eric Forth </B>(Bromley and Chislehurst): Speak for yourself.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Gillan:</B> I cannot answer for my right hon. Friend, but I am sure that all members of the Committee will observe your chairmanship, Mrs Roe. As the Minister said, you have a reputation for being fair and I am sure that you will govern our proceedings wisely. I have not checked the records, but this Committee might be a first: a lady is in the Chair, the Minister is a lady and a lady is leading for the Opposition.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> Is not the term ``woman'' used these days?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Gillan:</B> I prefer to be considered a lady, and I hope that I shall live up to that epithet during our proceedings. Later today, the Chair will be passed to my right hon. Friend the Member for Maidstone and The Weald (Miss Widdecombe), so those proceedings will also be a truly female-dominated event.
<P>
I warmly welcome to the Committee the Clerk, the Officers of the House, Hansard and those who will be guiding us through our proceedings. Officials are often asked to pass expedient notes to the Minister. I hope that that will not happen here. I have a feeling that the Minister has been working on the Bill for such a long time that I can hardly imagine there will be a single matter with which she is not fully conversant. I hope that her officials will regard our proceedings as a bit of a rest rather than too arduous a task.
<P>
I thank the officials at the Department of Trade and Industry, who from time to time have advised me on proceedings. When I was a junior Minister in the Department for Education and Employment, I encouraged my officials always to offer courtesy to the Opposition parties, and I was pleased that the Minister's officials did the same for my office. I am most grateful for that.
<P>
I should also like to welcome my right hon. and hon. Friends, who are so ably supporting me. I am slightly humbled, because between them they have spent more years as Ministers than I have in Parliament. I could not wish for a band of more redoubtable men to support me in Committee. My right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Mr. Forth) has a long and distinguished record in the House, but has also been a Member of the European Parliament, and the will no doubt be able to help the Committee with matters pertaining to Europe. He has a track record in business, which will be most valuable to the Committee. He was a management consultant and has worked with companies such as Rank Xerox and Ford.
<P>
However, perhaps the most distinctive aspect of our sitting today is that my right hon. Friend is serving on a Standing Committee at all. I am sure he will intervene to correct me if I am wrong, but I believe that it is 10 years since he has served on a Standing Committee. I am sure that we all warmly welcome him and will find that he has not lost his edge--he may be as difficult from the Back Bench as he always was from the Front Bench.
<P>
What can I say about my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Page)? He is a successful business man; he has been a Minister in the Department of Trade and Industry. I once read a biography that said that he was able to talk the shop floor lingo. I shall be looking to my hon. Friend to make a valuable contribution to the Committee.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Solihull (Mr. Taylor) doubles up as our Whip. I am conscious that he has also been a successful DTI Minister, and he is a lawyer. I know that the Minister for Small Firms, Trade and Industry, the hon. Member for Hornsey and Wood Green (Mrs. Roche), is herself a lawyer of some renown, but it will help to have two lawyers to battle out any finer legal points that arise in Committee.
<P>
So I have a small but extremely effective team. I also extend a welcome to the sole Liberal Democrat member of the Committee. I believe that there are other Liberal Democrat members of the Committee, but they have not appeared. I hope that the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Cotter) will not be sitting in glorious isolation during the Committee, although I must say that that merely reflects the presence on the Benches on Second Reading.
<P>
On Second Reading, I felt extremely sorry for the Minister. She was virtually on her own, with only the occasional roving Whip looking in. She had virtually no support from the Back Benches, and we did not have as full a debate on Second Reading as I would have liked. We fielded several hon. Members but, sadly for such a flagship Bill for small businesses, there was a poor attendance on the Labour Benches.
<P>
The hon. Lady referred to the small business sector as being the backbone of business in this country. That is irrefutable. I welcome the chance to sit on both mornings and afternoons, as provided for by the sittings motion, so that we will have the opportunity to discuss issues of late payment--which, as we all acknowledge, cause all businesses problems, but can have a disproportionate effect on small businesses. It is normal practice on the first day of a Committee to sit only from 10.30 am until 1 pm, but I believe that it has been suggested that we sit at 4.30 pm today. I hope that the Minister will confirm that; I shall gladly give way to her for her to do so.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> That is implicit in the sittings motion.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Gillan:</B> We have an understanding that we shall sit twice today, which is unusual. That is to be welcomed, however, because of the seriousness of the Bill and of the matters that we need to discuss. I understand that the Minister has an appointment next Tuesday with the Council of Ministers in Europe, and may experience some difficulty. I do not know whether the Minister will make other arrangements, should we sit this time next week. Obviously, we shall extend any necessary courtesy to the Minister, and if the Bill is still then in Committee no doubt other arrangements will be made. The Minister appears to be one of the most hard-working Ministers in the Department of Trade and Industry--I am afraid the only hard-working one, which does not say much for the rest of them. Opposition Members do not want to hamper her in performing her ministerial duties.
<P>
I used to work in business, and the late payment of debt is something that I have experienced in my company and seen in others, and I have seen the grief that it causes. My father was a redoubtable Scot--rather like my right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst--who lived by the mantra, ``Never a lender or a borrower be''. Owing money beyond the time due for payment was anathema to my father, an attitude that we would all like to foster in our personal lives and in business. However, on Second Reading, doubts were expressed that the Bill would achieve such a state of business nirvana.
<P>
The Minister's intentions are first class, but I doubt that the Bill will provide the panacea for which she hopes. I have always argued that it would have been better had the Minister started with the Government, as we did when in government. On Second Reading, we had exchanges about the percentage of late payments recorded in a table of information about Government Departments. The Minister went some way towards agreeing that while I was at the Department for Education and Employment the record had improved, despite her initially maintaining that it had deteriorated. It is alarming when a Minister presents a Bill to alleviate late payment of debt when she has failed to look in the direction of her colleagues and other Departments. It is often small businesses that suffer, a fact which I hope we shall be able to explore.
<P>
I should like to point the Minister to a letter that appeared in The Daily Telegraph on 23 January 1998 from Mr. Gower of Cowes, on the Isle of Wight. The letter states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Last November, my company was asked by the Meteorological Office (part of the Ministry of Defence) to quote for a small quantity of specially-made components.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> Since the MoD did not have an established credit account, I requested that the purchase order should incorporate a written undertaking that payment would be made within 30 days.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am sure that the Minister would agree that that period of time is what she intends. The letter goes on to say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Although this was agreed verbally, the official order bore no such undertaking. Subsequent requests produced various indignant responses to the effect that it is not government policy to make any commitment regarding payment. As a matter of principle, I stood my ground and, as a result, the order was cancelled, even though the goods had already been manufactured.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Nothing in the Bill will address that contingency. I hope that during our proceedings the Minister will talk to her officials and find out what happened in Mr. Gower's case. The name of his company is Davall, and Mr. Gower has sent me his notes.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Richard Page (South-West Hertfordshire):</B> I hope that my hon. Friend will add that we hope that the Minister will tell us exactly how the Minister of Defence's payment process works, from the placing of the order to the delivery of the goods and payment. That would be an interesting tale for us to hear.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Gillan:</B> My hon. Friend is right. Mr. Gower did me the courtesy of sending me some of the paperwork attached to the order. He wrote to the Meteorological Office on 5 December in 1997:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The goods required by you on 9 December 1997 are now ready and packed for immediate despatch.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> We are, however, unable to release the goods until we have your written undertaking regarding payment, as detailed on our Order Acknowledgement No. 4338 dated 2 December 1997. This was discussed when the original inquiry was made by you by telephone on 25.11.97.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
A note was made on the same sheet of paper on 8 January 1998:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Chased again. . . Not policy to give undertaking to pay within a specified period.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There follows what is obviously a quotation from an official at the Meterological Office:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ```Never been asked to do this in 30 years. We are a Government Department' etc. etc. Very indignant! Order cancelled!!''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
What a sad and sorry tale to tell--and that is only one example.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> Does my hon. Friend think that during our sittings we should take every opportunity to explore whether Government Departments and public bodies will be able to provide mechanisms by which to make payments within the time scale implied by the Bill? If I remember rightly, my hon. Friend raised that point on Second Reading. We shall have to investigate that question at some length in the context of the proposed transitional periods, which we hope that the Minister will clarify when we reach the relevant clauses. Does not my hon. Friend consider that to be an area of vulnerability in the Bill--the sheer ability of the public sector to deliver its payments in a timely fashion?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Gillan:</B> My right hon. Friend makes a good point, and one that is apposite to the sittings motion, because it concerns the length of our proceedings. In some areas of government, such enormous numbers of bills and invoices pass through that I am not sure that any mechanism could successfully prevent late payment in some instances.
<P>
The Minister comes to the Committee with good intentions, so I want to support her. I want to ensure that the Committee sends a Government policeman--sorry, a Government policewoman--to patrol the other Departments of State and the agencies. I am sure that the Minister will agree that the figures that I was given for the amount of unpaid bills in any one quarter in the national health service are alarming. Only 80 per cent. of bills sent to NHS trusts and agencies are paid on time. That means that 20 per cent. are not paid on time. If I am right, that is about 600,000 bills a quarter. We shall not argue over that. The Minister looks askance at me, but it is not satisfactory. If I were in her position, instead of writing more legislation I should want to put my own house in order. I hope that the Minister will put her own house in order as well as legislating, and I hope that I can strengthen her resolve to come down on her ministerial colleagues in other Departments with a very heavy hand.
<P>
It is important to remember that late payment matters not only to small and medium-sized businesses; it matters also to large businesses. I hope that, in our proceedings, we do not alienate large businesses, which can suffer enormously from the late payment of debt, often because contracts are so large. A delay in a large contract payment can severely affect cash flow for a larger business.
<P>
The Minister has pursued such legislation ruthlessly; she did so even before the election, when she was shadowing the Department. I commend her for that, because it is not as popular a move as she would like us to believe. I have many examples in support of that statement, but I start with recent research, entitled ``Dialogue with Business Owners'', carried out by the small businesses research centre at Kingston university for Horwath Clark Whitehill, chartered accountants. One of the businesses interviewed commented:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Government is saying `Do as I say, not as I do.' They should lead by example and that would have a bigger effect than anything.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That anonymous quote on the Government's direct role backs my thesis that the Committee should have the opportunity to discuss the payment practices and the payment record of Government.
<P>
That, however, is cold comfort to Mr. Gower and Davall Relays on the Isle of Wight. I hope that the Minister will look into the matter, and that she will find an opportunity to comment and give a word or two of encouragement.
<P>
The conclusion of the research document, ``Dialogue with Business Owners'', exemplifies my feeling that the Bill is not as necessary as the Minister would have us believe and that more should be done in other areas. There is little confidence among businesses that the Bill will have the effect that the Minister wishes. In answer to the executive summary, it was stated that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Overall, with a few exceptions (e.g. in construction) late payment was not a big problem among the businesses and any legislation that was introduced would make little difference to their business practices. Instead there was a need to change the culture of payment practices of which government legislation could only be a minor part.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Bill is probably a minor part of the picture. We did not vote against Second Reading, and I made it quite clear why that was so. We are not convinced of the need for the heavy hand of legislation, but we do not wish to be churlish or to stand in the way of anything that could improve life for businesses.
<P>
I am sure that my hon. Friends will contribute to our debate on the sitting motion. I hope that Labour Members, too, will join us, although, judging by the past, they often sit there mute. I do not wish to insult Labour Members, I want merely to encourage them to speak. Given the giddy array of new Labour Members--and some old Labour Members--Government Back Benchers have a wealth of experience to offer. I hope that they will contribute to our debates from time to time. Having been in a similar position in my first three years as a Member of Parliament, I know that it is best to ignore the Whip and branch out on one's own. Otherwise, it will be difficult for hon. Members to explain to their constitutents why they did not contribute to some flagship Labour legislation.
<P>
I am about to conclude my remarks, Mrs. Roe. You have been patient with me and have allowed me to range widely. If I did not raise certain matters while we were discussing the sittings motion, there may be little opportunity to discuss them later in our proceedings. Opposition Members do not oppose the sittings motion and we are willing to sit in Committee for as long as it takes. I say in a gesture of friendship to the Minister that if our proceedings last longer than next week and she is in some difficulty, I am sure that an accommodation could be reached through the usual channels. I look forward to our discussions and I am sure that the Bill will leave Committee--if not adjusted in the way that we would wish--better discussed and aired.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brian Cotter </B>(Weston-super-Mare): I, too, congratulate you, Mrs. Roe, on taking the Chair of the Committee. I am heartened to learn of your great experience, as it will be of great benefit to me as this is the first Bill that I have had to shepherd through on behalf of the Liberal Democrats. I should be grateful for any advice and help that you can give me. I shall try not to be too much trouble. If I am, that will probably be due to lack of experience. Not being a lady, I apologise for breaking the circle. There is not much that I can do about that, but perhaps there is a case for men to be represented on the Front Benches in this day and age when ladies are rightly well represented in the House.
<P>
I support the sittings motion and I hope that we proceed with the Bill in a business-like manner. The Liberal Democrats have long supported such legislation, so I am pleased to be a member of the Committee. I strongly support the Bill; we need both the stick and carrot. The Minister referred to Stan Mendham and the Forum of Private Business. Not only have they been behind such an approach to business, but they have carried out a great deal of in-depth research into such matters and have regularly undertaken surveys over many years.
<P>
As the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs. Gillan) said when she referred to fiscal organisation, people will say that the Bill will make little difference to their business practices. That has been said throughout history but, if we do not have such a Bill, no change will come about. We need the stick and the Bill will lead to a change in our culture. The integral part of the measure is to encourage people to concentrate on what is a serious issue. We can all come up with statistics and points. It is frequently said that 50 per cent. of small business borrowing is used to service late payment of commercial debt. There is much truth in that; many small businesses suffer from cash flow problems. In my experience, businesses wait for bills to be paid much longer than they should and it is more difficult for small players to pay bills on time. Regardless of any objection, the Bill will help to set the scene for change.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I shall not speak at great length because there will be time to deal with matters later. However, the Minister will recall that, when I asked her whether she agreed that both local and national Government are bad at settling bills, she said that she did. That is why we must address the issue. As the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham has said, Government should set an example.
<P>
I hope that the Committee considers the Bill constructively. I know that many people in business look to us to ensure that the Bill is strong and, in particular, that it supports small business. I look forward to our debates.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Forth:</B> I join the welcome given by the Minister and my hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham to you, Mrs. Roe. I suspect that the Committee will be harmonious and, as has been said, that it will concentrate on what Standings Committees should do: consider the detailed provisions of a Bill, the thrust and principle of which was broadly agreed on Second Reading, although Opposition Members expressed some reservations.
<P>
My fear is that the Bill is declaratory--one of the gesture pieces of legislation with which we are inundated. I have always had my doubts about that being a principle of the legislative process, especially as so many political parties repeatedly claim to believe in deregulation, yet seem constantly to give reasons for exceptions to that principle. The Bill might be such an exception. However, on Second Reading, the House said that it wished to proceed with the Bill and our job as a Standing Committee--guided by you, Mrs. Roe--is to decide what should be considered in detail and what changes should be made.
<P>
The sittings motion urges the Committee to hit the ground running. That is slightly unusual, but I do not object to it. We should all be well prepared for the work ahead of us, even though we shall go straight into it this afternoon.
<P>
This is a 17-clause Bill, which is small by some standards. I remember steering a 350-clause Bill with 50 schedules through the House in 1992-93, so a Bill of 17 clauses is not exactly enormous, but it is important. Its importance lies in the impact that it should have on many businesses.
<P>
I am unsure whether I subscribe to the general view that the Bill is about large companies failing to pay small companies on time. My view is that there is as big a problem with small companies failing to pay other small companies on time. Therefore, the Bill's impact--if it has one--will be much more widely felt than just proddiing with stick or inducing with carrot some large firms that are recalcitrant payers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cotter:</B> Often small businesses struggle to pay their bills because big businesses do not pay them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> That is a tempting analysis, in which there may be an element of truth. Increasingly, when I do business with small suppliers as a consumer, they ask for cash up front. Funnily enough, I ordered two different items for relatively small businesses this morning, and as a naive, unsuspecting and rather trusting consumer, I have parted with my money before seeing the goods. The hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare may criticise me for that, but smaller firms have that facility in a relatively favourable market.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Gillan:</B> Does my right hon. Friend agree that when small businesses are owed money, it is often other small businesses--I believe the figure is 70 per cent.--who owe it to them?
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> I agree. Of course, that is logical as the vast bulk of businesses in this country are very small.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor </B>(Solihull): To reinforce that point, will my right hon. Friend take note that in the borough of Solihull, 72 per cent. of businesses employ 10 or fewer people?
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> Yes, and I suspect that my hon. Friend has visited most of them several times in his distinguished career, so I am sure that he speaks from sound knowledge. I hope that the Committee will bear that point in mind before we get too carried away with the idea that this Bill will have a one-sided impact.
<P>
I believe that the Committee should sit mornings and afternoons to get on with its work because although the Bill is relatively modest in its scope--17 clauses--there are, interestingly, 19 amendments to it, including, to my surprise, five Government amendments. My hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham paid generous and just tribute to the Minister for her hard work and knowledge, and one would have thought that given the extent of consultation and preparation, it would not be necessary for the Government to table five amendments to add to those tabled by the Opposition. The Committee has been given a hint that the Minister does not believe that the Bill is in proper shape to be passed on to the statute book, so the Committee has work to do. Even the Minister is telling us that, by tabling her own amendments. There is ample work to do, even given the Bill's modest scope and size.
<P>
Our amendments will command the Committee's attention during morning and afternoon sittings until our deliberations are completed. My hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham referred to possible commitments that the Minister may have next week, of which I have no knowledge, but which may become relevant to our sittings if we are unable to complete our deliberations in time. Should difficulties arise, we shall do our best to accommodate her, but only time will tell whether it comes to that.
<P>
I welcome the sittings motion because it means that the Committee can get on with its work and get stuck in to all the amendments. I look forward very much to hearing the Minister's explanation of the Government amendments, to see how far she believes they will improve her own Bill; we shall judge them on the basis of the arguments. I hope that we can get started as I look forward to dealing in detail with the provisions of the Bill and the various groups of amendments to it. The sitting motion reflects that need and urgency, and I welcome it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> I add my welcome to the unanimous welcome of the Committee to you, Mrs. Roe, as Chairman. We are equally unanimous in wanting commercial debts to be paid on time. In fact, I know that small businesses would also like their retail customers' debts to be paid on time--but the Bill does not address that. We have common cause on the Bill. Like my right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst, and every other Member of the Committee, I welcome the sittings motion and the fact that we will have another sitting at 4.30 p.m. on the basis that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``If it were done. . . then 'twere well It were done quickly''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I have one slight worry. I hear the Minister's commitment to hop over to Europe again for another interminable meeting of the Council of Ministers. I am concerned that in this rush, some of the objections and constructive proposals that may be made by outside bodies may not reach us in time to be adequately debated in Committee. This morning, I was talking to a trade association that has serious reservations about the Bill's effectiveness. I told it that if it has any thoughts on the matter, I would be only too willing to consider them. If I thought that they were relevant, I would obviously raise them here.
<P>
The Bill is in danger of raising expectations about what it will deliver. Every time that I hear the Minister speak and look into her eyes, I can see that she is starting to feel that the Bill is sliding into the category of something that seemed like a good idea at the time.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Gillian:</B> Is my hon. Friend aware that the Minister is reported in a magazine to have said that 60 per cent. of trade associations representing small businesses are not in favour of the Bill? I do not know whether my hon. Friend has had an opportunity to read the article in network, but such uncertainty about the Bill is reflected in the Minister's admission.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> I always find it difficult to base my arguments on what I read in the press. That offers us opportunities to gallop into the regular examples in which the press has not accurately portrayed issues that confront the House. Such examples are legion, and if I were to raise them, you, Mrs. Roe, would be right to fix me with a steely look and tell me to return to the matter in hand. I find it difficult to resist that temptation, because I should like my comments to range beyond this country to foreign climes, such as equatorial Africa.
<P>
But I must not do that. I must return to the Minister, who is starting to realise that the Government are in danger of over-hyping the Bill. They are raising an expectation in the hearts and minds of the small business man and woman that they will find most difficult to fulfill. On Second Reading, I said that the Bill was being regarded as the philosopher's stone--that any form of late payment or bad debt on which it was rubbed would be miraculously turned to gold. Such would be the power of the statutory right of interest that companies could even consider reducing their credit control departments; that right would be the solution to all their problems. To suggest that would be highly misleading.
<P>
I hope that the message that goes out from the Committee is that the Bill is a small adjunct to try to help to change the culture towards prompt payment by large and small companies--it matters not which. Whether a company is owed money by a big or a small company, that is still an outstanding debt that affects its bank interest charges. I am worried that the over-hyping will produce a corresponding disillusionment when small business men and women find that to recover the interest on moneys outstanding they must still resort to court procedures.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
This is probably the best time to express the hope that the European dimension will be set against all the clauses and amendments that we shall debate. As we all know, the matter is under consideration; there is talk of a European directive within a year or so. It is only right to try to ensure that we place the Bill safely on the statute book so that we do not have to plough it all up again in two or three years' time merely to put it in line with the directive.
<P>
My final, and perhaps most important, point is to reinforce what my hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham said, which was endorsed by the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare: the Government must lead by example. The variety of payment methods that the Government operate are often confusing and unsatisfactory when dealing with smaller businesses. My hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham quoted an example of a Government Department acting arbitrarily and arrogantly. I have previously expressed my gratitude to the Minister for her support in chivvying and harrying Departments to get them up to speed. However, that is just the first part of the argument. Will the Minister ensure that payment processes are satisfactory and understood? I find it difficult to appreciate how the Ministry of Defence, for example, can pay such a high percentage of bills on time, working within conventionally understood contract periods that every small business is expected to fulfill. I am looking to Government to set a good example. Why are not the Government at the forefront of the measure? Why are they trailing towards the back, letting others go first?
<P>
I have already expressed my anxiety about the Bill's being over-sold. I look forward to a series of constructive debates. The Bill will work and have credibility only if Government are upfront and leading.

<P>

<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> I follow in the spirit of my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Hertfordshire, hoping that the Minister will give a lead in several matters, as only she, with the power and might of Government behind her, can. I should like to make a constructive contribution in the spirit of my colleagues' contributions.
<P>
One of the phrases that we shall use over and over again is ``small business''. We all think that we know what a small business is--until we attempt to define it, when suddenly, a phrase with which we are all comfortable becomes slightly elusive. I have the highest regard for the Department of Trade and Industry; I enjoyed my time there. However, I am not sure that the Department of Trade and Industry is quite sure what a small business is. In fact, I think that the vast majority of British business is invisible to the Department of Trade and Industry because it does not have instruments of sufficient magnification to be able to see them, because they are so small. It would be helpful if the Minister gave us some guidelines on what the Government regard as small businesses.
<P>
During an intervention in the speech of my right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst, I referred to the borough of Solihull. I have the honour to be one of the two Members of Parliament who represent that area. In many ways, it is a typical borough. I concede that it is quite prosperous, but it has enormous economic variety--ranging from very small businesses to Land-Rover, which employs about 10,000 people.
<P>
Statistics have been prepared carefully by Central Careers, Central England TEC, the Employment Service, Solihull Business Enterprise--of which I have the honour to be chairman--Solihull Business Link, Solihull chamber of commerce, Solihull college and Solihull metropolitan borough council, which, since last Thursday, has been adorned by more Conservative councillors. I have been told by such organisations that the number of businesses in Solihull that employ one to four people is 52&#183;9 per cent. Those employing five to 10 people amount to 19&#183;4 per cent., those employing 11 to 24 people is 13&#183;8 per cent. and the number employing 25 to 49 people is 7&#183;1 per cent.
<P>
That means that 93&#183;2 per cent. of businesses in a typical English borough employ fewer than 50 people. Yet one definition is that a work force comprising 50 people is the interface between small and medium-sized businesses. Such a definition is like a will-o'-the-wisp; one cannot get hold of all the definitions. If the boundary between a small business and a medium-sized business is 50 employees, should we not remind ourselves that 93&#183;2 per cent. of businesses in a typical borough are small businesses.
<P>
For many years, I operated a small business, which employed one to 11 people at various times. I am pleased that the number rose from one to 11 and did not fall from 11 to one. When one is providing a service and hoping for someone else to pay for it, the rule about payment is to size up one's customer pretty carefully first.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I start on a note of harmony. I thank the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham for her courtesy and especially her welcome and her kind words about the officials in the Department. She is absolutely right. Of course, it should be the practice for Members of Parliament to have as much information as possible about legislation that is proceeding through the House and that is how I intend to assist the Committee. I thank Conservative Members for their courtesy and their humorous remarks. At least three of them have served in the Department of Trade and Industry at some stage in their careers. A daunting task is ahead of me and I shall watch my words and manners.
<P>
That was the nice part of my response. I shall now refer to some of the points that have been raised. The Bill is long overdue. The previous Government set their face against it, despite all surveys of the small business community having shown an overwhelming endorsement for such a measure. The Government will take no lectures from the Opposition about the Government's payment performance. Their record--and they had 18 years to get it right--was unhappy. It is not surprising that it was so bad, given that the former Deputy Prime Minister bragged that he got where he was in business by stringing his creditors along. That remark went down very badly with the small business community. In part, it led to the reported comment of the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham--I shall, of course, give way if she wishes to deny them--that, during the months preceding the election, that comment lost the Conservative party the small business vote.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> Would the Minister agree that making ill-judged and unfortunate remarks is not the sole preserve of the former Deputy Prime Minister?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for saying that those remarks were ill-informed. It would have been nice if the former Deputy Prime Minister had apologised to the small business community for his bad example.
<P>
I shall deal first with the matter of Government payments. I can tell the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire, my predecessor at the Department, that we shall publish a league table of the Government's payment performance before the summer recess. I have followed the hon. Gentleman's excellent practice and I pay tribute to him for it. If small businesses complain that they are paid late by Government Departments or by large firms, I shall seek background information if there is no contractual dispute. The hon. Gentleman rightly set up that practice, which can be very helpful to small firms. I may gain the displeasure of my officials by talking about it, because we shall receive more letters, but it is a useful service and the hon. Gentleman is to be congratulated for starting it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> As this debate seems to be turning into a sort of mutual love-in, I must thank the Minister for her kind words. I am delighted that she is continuing that practice.
<P>
The Minister says that her officials will not regard her offer with glee and joy, but will she expand a little? Of the 27 cases that I examined, only two were the result of late payment. Although small and medium-sized companies complained about not being paid, the complaints were either the result of the iniquitous pay-when-paid contract or of the quality of goods and services. Has the proportion of those cases changed?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> That is an interesting point. Certainly, the cases that I have investigated have been a mixture. Some were difficult to judge because legal proceedings were in train, in which cases it was not appropriate for a Minister to intervene. In other cases, a dominant supplier had imposed terms that the small supplier felt were unfair. Not all complaints are about late payment; some are about unfair terms. However, I pay tribute to my officials as we sometimes manage to resolve the problem--I hope to the satisfaction of both parties. It is a helpful service and it is greatly appreciated by small firms.
<P>
As for the case mentioned by the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham, if Mr. Gower wants to contact the Department, or if the hon. Lady can pass the papers to me, I shall be happy to look into the matter.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Gillan:</B> I am happy to pass photocopies of the papers to the Minister. They were given me in my capacity as shadow spokesman and I asked Mr. Gower whether I could use his case as an example. As the Minister knows, I was shocked by the story and an investigation would be most welcome. I shall be interested in the outcome, as, I am sure, will Mr. Gower.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I am grateful for those comments; I shall, of course, undertake to keep the hon. Lady fully informed.
<P>
The Committee will be interested to know that Government accounting rules require Departments to pay within 30 days unless otherwise agreed. I reassure the Committee that small businesses will be able to act against the Government and other public bodies as soon as the legislation is enacted and commencement orders are in force.
<P>
I also reassure the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst that this is not a regulatory measure. I am as keen as anyone else to cut red tape as far as it affects business. This is not a regulatory measure--it puts the remedy in the hands of the creditor to enforce if he or she so wishes.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
On Second Reading, I spoke about the history of the Bill and the fact that in about 1893 the Law Lords were dismayed that there was no right to interest. Small businesses up and down the country face the problem of late payment. They have problems with cash flow and feel the effects disproportionately of late payment. The Bill is not a panacea in itself; it is an important measure in the armoury of small business. On Second Reading, I spoke about the Better Payment Practice Group, which is looking at the package of measures that go together with the Bill.
<P>
I know that Conservative Members signed an early-day motion in 1994 in support of such a right to interest. The hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham supported the measure then--not only did she sign it, she was in the top six of those who did. It is regrettable that the Government at the time did not see fit to introduce the right to interest.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Gillan:</B>We dealt with the matter on Second Reading, when I said that at the time of signing the early-day motion, I believed that statutory interest on late payment of debt was a serious remedy for the problem. After discussing it with Ministers and considering the matter in more detail, I came to accept that it is not the only possible remedy. Indeed, it is such a small part of it that more effort and concentration should be made in other areas. I had no problems with signing the early-day motion, but I changed my mind after being better educated. I hope that that is something that the hon. Lady will take on board: if she becomes better educated, she may change her mind. After all, that is a woman's prerogative.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> The hon. Lady has done well to cover her embarrassment. She has rather moved against the grain of businesses in this country which, when asked, support a statutory right to interest. The Institutue of Directors, for example, received 1,700 responses to a survey of its membership, 69 per cent. of which favoured a statutory right to interest.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> There is always a tendency to bandy statistics about. The hon. Lady may know that the previous Government consulted twice: once in 1994 when I said that it was very much an even balance; and again in 1996. I refer to a Department of Trade and Industry press notice dated 18 June 1996--it must be true if it comes from the press office of the DTI--which said that eight out of nine organisations representing small firms which responded to the review did not want a statutory right of interest on late payments. Such organisations are specifically dedicated to looking after small business; they are not organisations that have small businesses as members. There is a great deal of difference.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> The hon. Gentleman will know from his great experience that the small business organisations have chopped and changed their views on the legislation and some have altered their position. The 1996 consultation was very narrow and looked back only on 1994. When individual small businesses are consulted, they favour the Bill. That attitude is spreading to big businesses as well. A recent survey conducted by the banking industry revealed that 71 finance directors of large companies agreed that interest should be charged on the late payment of invoices. That is because large companies now believe that it is in their own interests to have good, viable suppliers.
<P>
The Bill is important. It will address the unethical practice of businesses entering into agreements that they then do not keep. It will give businesses that for which they have been asking for some time--a statutory right to interest on late payments.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> I seek the Minister's assurance that before she concludes her remarks, she will deal with my question about what is a small business.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I will do so now. The hon. Gentleman rightly raised this point during the Committee that considered the National Minimum Wage Bill, and we discussed it then. He makes an important point. He is also right to ask about micro businesses. It is certainly important that we do not consider all small and medium-sized enterprises to be the same. We must segment the market, and the Government and the DTI need to have different policies for different sectors.
<P>
It is difficult to decide where to fix a number. Some new-technology businesses may have a large turnover with relatively few staff. Nevertheless, for the purpose of this Bill and other Bills, we have had to fix a figure.
<P>
When we discuss the amendments to clause 17, we will deal with that matter. The point made by the hon. Member for Solihull is valid, but we have had to choose a mark, and we have used the number 50 because it is one of the limbs of the definition of a small business in the Companies Acts. I appreciate the hon. Gentleman's point.
<P>
The Bill is an important measure, and the sooner that we fulfil our responsibilities in Committee, the sooner we can make a contribution to improving the culture of payment practice in this country.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Resolved,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> That, during the proceedings on the Late Payment of Commercial Debts (Interest) Bill [Lords], the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock and half-past Four o'clock.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before I call the first amendment, I have an announcement to make about amendments. I remind the Committee that adequate notice should be given of amendments. As a general rule, I do not intend to call starred amendments during either morning or afternoon sittings.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> On a point of order, Mrs. Roe. Following your helpful guidance to the Committee, if the Committee's proceedings were to move with some speed, following up the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Hertfordshire about giving people outside a chance to respond, would you be prepared if necessary--in spite of your ruling, which I understand--sympathetically to consider amendments tabled rather later than we would normally wish?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I will certainly consider what the right hon. Gentleman has said, but the rules of the House are clear. I will take into consideration anything that he brings before me.
<H4><center>Clause 1</center></H4>
<H4><center>Statutory interest</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Cotter:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 18, in page 1, line 13, after `term', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and shall apply to all debts regardless of whether the principal sum has been paid'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, we may consider amendment No. 1, in page 1, line 13, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(2A) Any liability to pay statutory interest shall give rise to a separate right of action which may be pursued irrespective of whether or not the principal sum of the qualifying debt to which it relates has been paid.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Cotter:</B> The amendment tabled by me and my hon. Friend the Member for Eastleigh (Mr. Chidgey) is necessary; it is technical but important.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Gillan:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for giving way. I did not want to interrupt his speech so prematurely, but he said that the amendment was tabled both in his name and that of the hon. Member for Eastleigh, but we have yet to be graced by his presence. Can the hon. Gentleman tells us whether the hon. Member for Eastleigh will grace us with his presence during the Committee's sittings?
<P>
<B>Mr. Cotter:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for Eastleigh has great confidence in my ability--a confidence that the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham might not share, but that is her problem. As you will appreciate, Mrs. Roe, my hon. Friend would be here but for some important business that he must do elsewhere on behalf of the House.
<P>
The amendment is intended to clarify the separation of statutory interest from a principal debt. It makes it clear that statutory interest must survive payment of the principal. It is important to make the point that interest gives rise to a separate right to action regardless of whether an initial amount has been paid.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Gillan:</B> I am surprised that the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare moved his amendment so briefly, but I congratulate him on the brevity of his speech. Indeed, I was jolly lucky to make an intervention. Perhaps I should not have been apologetic; if I had not intervened so swiftly, I might have missed my chance.
<P>
Amendment No. 1, which has been grouped with that of the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare and his phantom Friend, is a probing amendment, and I am sure that the Minister will recognise it as such. The hon. Gentleman needed to do the amendment more justice because it relates to a serious matter. I hope that the Minister will say what I want to hear in her response. Given the great interest of many outside bodies, such matters should be placed on the record.
<P>
The Bill has already gone through procedures in another place, where the Earl of Home suggested improvements to the Bill, including the simplification of the drafting of clause 1. As I have said, many bodies and associations outwith the Committee are extremely interested in the Bill's final shape and form. The Minister has already generously acknowledged the role of the Forum of Private Business, and I associate myself with those remarks.
<P>
I also associate myself with many of the other organisations, including the Confederation of British Industry, the Small Business Bureau, the Federation of Small Businesses, and the Institute of Directors, which have taken an active interest in the Bill. Those organisations have told me of their concerns about the amendment. I know that they have expressed those concerns to the Minister, who has looked carefully at the issues that they have raised.
<P>
The amendment strengthens and clarifies the critical separation of the statutory interest from the original debt. If statutory interest is to provide an effective deterrent, a separate right to action, together with separate assignability, will form an important plank in the bridge that we are trying to build.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The statutory interest due on any debt will be but a mere morsel compared with the size of the original debt. It follows that suppliers will be unlikely to put the main debt at risk to collect a smaller sum of interest. If the interest could be pursued at a later stage, it would act as an added disincentive to late payment for various reasons--in fact, without action even being taken to recover the interest. I am sure that the Minister agrees that that would not be possible without the clear separation of the two debts.
<P>
The Minister for Trade, Lord Clinton-Davis, responded positively to the suggestions of Conservative peers and expressed concerns similar to ours. He agreed that a separate right of action for interest should be established beyond doubt. The amendment would establish the reassurances that Ministers acknowledge are needed--that statutory interest will give rise to a separate assignable course of action. I hope that we have created an opportunity for the Minister to give those reassurances.
<P>
We welcome the amendments made in another place by the Government. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst ably pointed out during the debate on the sittings motion, the Government will table further amendments and I shall have more to say about them later when we discuss them. It is good in one way that the Government have an open mind, and I hope that the hon. Lady will accept the amendment or articulate and expand on the issue so as to give the reassurances that are sought by business, the associations that represent it and by Conservative Members.
<P>
We would welcome clarification that the right to statutory interest is an implied term in a contract to which the Bill will apply, and that statutory interest will be treated in the same way as interest carried under an express contract term. That would go some way towards allaying fears about the wording, for example, of clause 13(1), in which the right to assign is confined to qualifying debts--a term that excludes interest on late payment.
<P>
I have a couple more questions for the Minister. They concern matters that have been raised by outside associations and it is right and proper that we should know her opinion. The firm of lawyers, Dyson Bell Martin, has done some sterling work on the legislation and has expressed some views about it. Can the hon. Lady confirm that there is no restriction in the Bill on the parties' ability to compromise on the purchaser's liability to interest after the debt has been created? Does she agree that acceptance of the principal debt, which has been proffered in full and final settlement of the debt, would preclude further pursuit of interest on the debt either by the contracting party or an assignee? That issue has been raised by Dyson Bell Martin and I hope that the hon. Lady will give the Committee a detailed response.
<P>
What would happen if an action were commenced by an assignee for interest alone? Does the Minister envisage difficulty that, as a matter of practice, evidence from the assignor would be required to prove the original debt and the contractual terms on which it was created? If such actions depend on the co-operation of the original creditor, how does she view the practical difficulties pertaining to the recovery?
<P>
I appreciate that the Minister has given the matter a great deal of thought and fully understands the issues, but I hope that she will treat the amendment in the spirit in which it was tabled--as a probing amendment--and will clarify the matter. Lord Clinton-Davis has given assurances in another place, but it is now right and proper that a Minister serving in the House of Commons should confirm the matter beyond reasonable doubt. I hope that she will also do me the courtesy of picking up the other two points raised on behalf of the forum by its solicitors.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Forth:</B> I am a bit nervous about the amendments, notwithstanding the succinct speech by the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare, which did not really give us much to get our teeth into, and the more comprehensive explanation given by my hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham. Coming to the matter with a fresh mind, I wonder whether the amendments threaten to over-complicate matters in a counterproductive manner.
<P>
I can well imagine that in most cases the matter of the principal is clearly definable. It is the starting point for the process on which the Bill rests. I hope that later in our deliberations we will have the opportunity to discuss what role will be played--as it always has been--in disputes between parties over quality, quantity, timely delivery, and so on.
<P>
I am sure that all members of the Committee are aware that such new techniques as just-in-time deliveries are likely to complicate the definition of the consignment, even in the case of the principal due. That may be difficult enough--as I say, I hope that we will return to that later--but the amendments threaten further to complicate matters, because the interest element, which the amendments are intended to separate out, is likely to be even more difficult satisfactorily to define. Also, because the sums involved in interest will be much smaller than the principal, they will give rise to more difficult judgments by the parties about whether they are worth pursuing.
<P>
The Minister has stressed, and I accept, that that is not a coercive but a discretionary matter for the parties involved. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of the measure will rest substantially on the extent to which parties are prepared to invoke it. If they choose not to do so, the Bill will be largely nullified. My concern about the approach taken by the amendments--even though my hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham has tabled one of them in a probing spirit--is that if the mechanisms in the Bill start to get too sophisticated or complicated, its effectiveness will be blunted.
<P>
I am looking for reassurance from someone--I do not know whom; perhaps those who have tabled the amendments--and I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say. I want to be much more satisfied than I am at present that the amendments would not over-complicate matters to the extent that they have a negative effect on the Bill. My hon. Friend said that hers was a probing amendment. We know nothing of the motives of the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare, because he was succinct to the point of oblivion. I look to my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Hertfordshire, who I sense is about to seek to catch your eye, Mrs. Roe, and to the Minister, to clarify the purpose of the amendments and whether they are likely to be effective. My inclination at present is to be suspicious of what effect they might have.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> I shall be brief, but not so brief that my hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham will have to intervene in the next five seconds in order to say her thruppence-worth before we reach a conclusion.
<P>
The clause and the group of amendments go to the nitty-gritty detail of how the Bill will work and are similar to the ideas that have worried so many small-business organisations in the past. They fear that the clause will be used against small firms, rather than help them, will lead to longer credit periods, and will legitimise the practice of late payments. I look forward to what the Minister has to say as the custodian of the umbilical cord of knowledge, skill, legal advice and general support that stretches from the officials on the Bench to her, to feed through the necessary requirements to move the Bill forward.
<P>
Does the agreement preclude chasing residual debt? What will be the requirements for proving the debt? Both questions touch on the right to assign a debt and the matter of debt-collecting and factoring. I must delicately disagree with the Minister; when consultations took place, organisations were not precluded from sending in their thoughts and advice, but in the main, contributions came from organisations that had consulted their members. I confess that I did not approach each organisation, such as the Federation of Small Businesses, and ask how many small businesses it had consulted. This morning, I spoke to the representative of a trade association with more than 10,000 members, which is firmly of the opinion that the Bill will not help its members, and will do nothing but implement and consolidate some of the draconian agreements made by larger companies.
<P>
How will a company operating debt collection or factoring work? I envisage such companies going out of their way to establish a procedure to hound the small business sector. During my original consultation, one organisation wrote especially vicious and savage letters, complaining because the Government were not going to introduce a statutory right of interest. I do not include the Forum of Private Business, which was quite upfront in its arguments in support of the measure. I shall not explain why I disagreed with its assessment methods and objected to how it presented the information. That is now history. It was only when I discovered that the company was a debt-collection agency that I realised that it was not approaching the matter with a philanthropic view, but saw it to its advantage.
<P>
As the Committee knows, when a company hands over its debt to a factoring organisation, that organisation pays up front an agreed chunk of the money. It is then up to that organisation to collect the money from the company's customers. Just as God made little apples, I envisage the factoring company arguing that because a debtor has exceeded the agreed terms, it wants a statutory right of interest. There may be an opportunity later to ask what the Minister is doing about the small claims court, which I envisage difficulties. I know that the directive is working towards a fast-track procedure, so that such claims can be dealt with speedily, but I can see the factoring organisations and the debt collecting organisations hounding someone who goes over the agreed terms.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
We might say that that is fine, but what will happen next? I shall not bore the Committee as I did the House on Second Reading by going through the proceedings and listing the time delays caused by the issuing of invoices, end-of-month statements and so on. That will come later, and I look forward to that rerun. The business man being chased for that extra bit of interest will say to his customer that, although his terms are such and such, he is being chased by X, Y or Z and that his terms in future must be so many days plus. Immediately, the credit period is extended, and when that happens it will go to the limit, not just to the average.
<P>
I shall be glad to hear what the Minister has to say, but my concern is that by going down that route, we shall be extending the period of late payment, legitimising it, and putting it into the terms of contract. That will not help the small business, which is our aim.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> It has been an interesting debate. You will be relieved to know, Mrs. Roe, that although it has been wide-ranging, I shall not be tempted down some of the byways because I would certainly earn your stricture if I did so. However, we shall have the opportunity to explore later some of the issues raised by the Opposition.
<P>
First, I can tell the hon. Members for Weston-super-Mare and for Chesham and Amersham that I appreciate the spirit in which the amendment was moved. I understand their concern. Indeed, the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham was good enough to say that it was a probing amendment, moved so that we could examine the question further.
<P>
The hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham rightly referred to the representations made by a number of business organisations. I am grateful to the business representative organisations for their input. The Green Paper extensively consulted the business community, and we discussed the subject with the business representative organisations before and after its publication and once the Bill was published.
<P>
I understand the concern that lies behind the amendments, which is that the Bill should provide a separate right of action for interest. I hope that it reassures people to know that the Government share that view. The hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham is absolutely right that the matter was raised in another place by Lord Home; she was right also that some assurances were given by my noble Friend, Lord Clinton-Davies, the Minister for Trade.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Gillan:</B> As I anticipated in my opening remarks, the Minister is articulating the words that we hoped to hear. Could she not go further and accept the amendment? If it was accepted, it would be a final definition of the Government's position. I believe that the amendment would clarify and simplify clause 1, to the benefit of businesses. Will the Minister accept it?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I was about to explain why we could not accept the amendment. I know that the hon. Lady is reasonable--she is an honourable Member--and I hope to be able to convince her that the amendment, although useful in probing the Government's intentions and to put our assurances on record, is not necessary. I do not want to denigrate our debate, because it is important.
<P>
The Government share the view that the Bill should provide a separate right of action for interest. We have not sought to state that explicitly in the Bill as it is unnecessary to do so. We believe also that it would create difficulty in ensuring that the measure operated in step with other legal principles. The right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst has hinted at some complexities.
<P>
The Bill creates a right to interest. Once it has been created, the supplier can pursue an action in pursuit of that right. Such an action may be pursued regardless of whether the principal debt from which the right arose remains outstanding. The position will be the same as it is now for contractually agreed interest. Members of the Committee may be aware that, technically, principal and interest form part of the same debt. The right to statutory interest is dependent on the contract giving a right to the principal to the extent that the contract sets the amount of the principal and may also set the date when the debt should have been paid. Therefore, one cannot separate the amounts entirely. It would be difficult to do so.
<P>
Other principles of general law are at stake. When a dispute has arisen and the parties settle it, they cannot later unpick it. The settlement may have compromised the claim for interest. If a party chooses to make a claim for just the principal or interest and that is determined by the court, further action on the other claim may be barred by the res judicata principle, which I remember dimly from my student days.

<P>

<B>Mr. Forth:</B> Now may be the appropriate time for me to make a certain point. What the Minister may have in mind is the large number of transactions that involve an initial contract for supply, but involve also repeated deliveries. The automotive industry comes to mind, where parts are delivered against an initial contract repeatedly and on a time-critical basis, but are subject to quality assessment and the timeliness of delivery. The concept of principal becomes difficult to determine in such circumstances, never mind the concept of interest that may be related to it. Does the Minister accept that in such cases, which are frequent in commercial transactions, definitions become difficult? An attempt to imply under the Bill that transactions are simple and straightforward could be misleading and complicate the whole issue.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I understand the right hon. Gentleman's argument. Although helpful, it was not the point that I had in mind. I am referring to when a court has finally adjudicated on a matter. For example, if a party accepts the principal and gives an effective waiver of the interest, that party is so bound. All those existing principles under contract law according to the established system make for certainty and finality, without which commerce could not work. As the right hon. Gentleman said, it is important that there is certainty in business transactions, which is why we have drafted the Bill to fit in with the existing principles behind the law of contract.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> The Minister referred to a settlement that had gone through the court process. What would happen if an individual reached a settlement figure, but some interest or part of the debt was outstanding? Although an agreement was reached on a one-to-one basis, could it be reneged on?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I shall go on because those points were rightly raised by the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham. I shall deal with those points and with assignment. I assure the Committee that the Bill has been drafted to allow a claim for interest to be assigned, for example, to a factor, who can then claim for the interest alone. Clauses 1 and 13, to which the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham referred, will have that effect.
<P>
If the debtor tenders the principal alone, the creditor can accept it on account and then pursue the interest. The principal and interest are part of the same debt. So long as it is a qualifying debt, the interest is also a qualifying debt even if the principal has been paid. The hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham raised that point.
<P>
On the point raised by the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire, acceptance of the principal in full and final settlement precludes an action on the interest. That must be right, if that is what the parties decide to do. We shall discuss some of those matters later.
<P>
The hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham raised an important point about evidence. Of course the assignee needs the co-operation of the original creditor to prove the facts in court. That is part of the normal court process and will not change the separation of debt. The amount of interest due is necessarily dependent on the amount of the principal and on the date for its payment.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Gillan:</B> Is the Minister saying that she accepts that, if an assignee pursues a matter later, more significant costs would be incurred because of the need to establish the paperwork in such circumstances?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> No, not at all. The Bill will give an automatic right to interest. The enforcement procedure is a matter for the courts. However, in many cases such a right is automatic, so enforcement through the courts will not be necessary. It is difficult to know how many cases will go to court.
<P>
We have had a good, thorough debate. I am grateful to the hon. Members who have spoken for airing the matter. I hope that I have managed to persuade Opposition Members that the amendment is unnecessary, but if they decide to press it to a Division, I shall ask the Committee to reject it.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Gillan:</B> I think that my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Hertfordshire wanted to intervene on the Minister.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The hon. Gentleman sat down.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Gillan:</B> I am sorry, Mrs. Roe.
<P>
I have listened carefully to the Minister, and I am grateful to her. I am sure that those listening to the debate and those who study the record carefully will be grateful for some of the assurances that she has given. However, the crux of my argument is that we believe that this is an important amendment to a significant clause. I hope that we have an opportunity to discuss the clause in a stand part debate.
<P>
The amendment would simplify the wording of the clause. I use the word ``simplify'' because I hope that it will appeal to my right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst. However, the Minister has said that she will not agree to the amendment, so we shall press it to a Division to place on record the fact that we believe that the clause could be simplified.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cotter:</B> I, too, shall press the amendment to a Division. I spoke briefly in moving the amendment because, given the fact that the matter had been discussed in the House of Lords, I thought that the Minister had points to make in response. Notwithstanding what she said, my information from the many people who have lobbied me is that the amendment is worth while. There may be a loophole in the Bill; any such loophole must be closed. The Minister made comments about the fact that when courts have adjudicated on matters, enforcement proceedings have sometimes been costly. We must press the amendment, because we want to avoid the time of the courts being taken up unnecessarily with appeals.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Gillan:</B> We have already had nearly two hours of debate, and it has passed in the twinkle of an eye.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> Give us a twinkle.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Gillan:</B> My right hon. Friend should remember that I am not a thing of the night, although I was once described as a little ray of sunshine, which is more a thing of the day.
<P>
Clause 1 is a substantial clause, and it would not be right to let it stand part of the Bill without making some remarks about some of the areas that have already been touched on by some of my hon. Friends and--albeit briefly--by the lone Liberal Democrat member in Committee.
<P>
It is sad that Government Members of the Committee, not all of whom were present for the Division--but the majority of them were--are still sitting mute and making no contribution to the debate. I encourage them to make a contribution to the debate on clause 1 stand part, because it will be pretty embarrassing when they are talking to businesses and not a word has passed their lips.
<P>
I can see that the Government Whip is getting upset; he thinks that I am inciting mutiny. I am not; as I said, there must be a wealth of experience among Government Members--at least, that is what they would claim--and I am sure that the Committee would benefit from their words of wisdom. Substantive and extremely astute observations have been made by Conservative members of the Committee, but the poor Minister has been performing alone.
<P>
Clause 1 is the heart of the Bill. As we have already said, the motivation behind the Bill is good but a little naive.
<P>
I want to concentrate on the way in which the Bill will be welcomed--or not welcomed--outside the House, the Department's record and how the clause will affect its performance. Earlier, I referred to some research that was conducted on behalf of Horwath Clark Whitehill, with which I am sure the Minister is familiar. It shall share with the Committee some of the survey's other conclusions. It is not true that there has been 101 per cent. welcome for the Bill and, although the Minister, with the best of intentions, keeps talking it up, it would not be right to allow some of the scepticism to be brushed aside and not brought out into the open.
<P>
The survey revealed some interesting views on late payment. I should be interested to hear the Minister's response to the comments that were made about the undermining of relations with customers or clients, such as
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``It may affect a general cultural change--I don't think it will be enforceable. Certainly not by our business. If we start to collect interest from some of our customers they could simply go somewhere else. People think they have the right to cancel things that they have ordered. They haven't any right at all but you can't sue them if you want to do business with them next week.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>Other companies said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Cash flow is a problem for any company, because you can make money by not paying. But I can't see this getting through because of pressure from large firms . . . I think it is a dangerous thing for small businesses. I don't like the sound of it at all, the big customer is going to say `let's not deal with the small companies, let's deal with the big companies'.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>A business person commented:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``I can see a lot of problems because it will create bad feeling.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>People are out there, doing a real job in a real world and running real businesses. We sit in Parliament having dry discussions. We must take on board such comments and I hope that the Minister will take into account what small businesses are saying, which she says are extremely supportive of the Bill. The executive summary to which I referred earlier also makes some acute observations.
<P>
It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Making sure that money was flowing into their business was obviously a concern for all the business owners. However, experiences and views on late payment and the efficacy of late payment legislation was mixed. The bulk of businesses were not cash businesses and so potentially represented the types of firms which legislation was aimed to protect . . . Discussions on late payment revealed the close relationship business owners had with their customers''--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
a matter that I raised on Second Reading. The summary continued:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``there was a need to protect this relationship and make sure that nothing came between them and their customer--including any late payment legislation. If late payment legislation was used against a malefactor this may be the last piece of work to be undertaken for that firm. Thus, while most firms were not against the legislation the overwhelming majority would not use it for fear of loss of custom or developing a bad reputation.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The opinion was that the legislation was impotent anyway.

<P>

<B>Mr. Cotter:</B> I wonder where the hon. Lady is on the matter of late payment. I am sure that she is getting fed up with being referred to.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Gillan:</B> No, not in the slightest: keep going.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cotter:</B> In response to the Minister, the hon. Lady had said that she had signed an early-day motion thinking that that was the be all and end all but that, since then, she had been educated further.
<P>
Surely we all accept that the Bill does more than give a statutory right on interest. It gives encouragement, with codes and practices. The Bill is not just a stick; it also acts as a carrot. What is the hon. Lady's approach? Would she suggest that nothing is done? Although the Bill is based on a statutory right to interest, it also enforces the culture of early payment. Without the Bill, nothing would happen. What would the hon. Lady suggest?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Gillan:</B> I know that the hon. Gentleman is isolated on the Opposition Benches, but has he listened to any of today's debate or of the Second Reading debate? I have made it clear that we are not fundamentally opposed to the Bill, because we do not endorse late payment. However, we seek to improve it. I have maintained firmly that the Minister and her colleagues should be dealing first with other measures. Indeed, that is the view of businesses and it is right that we should put those views on record. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will have the opportunity to take up that matter with the businesses that were surveyed. They have a practical view of the Bill, a substantial part of which is contained in clause 1.
<P>
One part of the executive summary was most telling. It said that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Discussion on late payment also revealed an underlying cynicism and suspicion of government. Business owners pointed out that government bodies have slow bureaucratic payment systems. Some expressed the view that it would be better to lead by example rather than introduce legislation which may be problematic and not address the crux of the problem.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is exactly my argument.
<P>
I said earlier that the Bill was not overwhelmingly welcomed, and some of the quotes mentioned in that survey certainly endorse that view. On the direct role of Government, the businesses questioned made some very telling statements. One said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``We do not deal with government agencies because of our early experiences that they are the worst payers in the whole wide world.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That leads me to question the Minister on the Bill's effect on Government Departments. The long-awaited table on the payment performance of Government Departments and their agencies is due to be published before the summer recess. It is a great shame that that table was not ready in time for the Committee stage. The table was last issued by the Paymaster General on 27th November 1997. I had hoped at least that an interim table would have accompanied the Bill.
<P>
We should be used to such delays. The National Minimum Wage Bill was presented to the House without any information on what the national minimum wage should be. So why should we expect a Bill on statutory interest on late payment of debt--a large part of which debt must be laid at the door of Government agencies, based on the figures and implicit criticism in what the Minister said before on the subject--to be presented with information about how the Government are doing?
<P>
I hope that the Minister will measure the success of the Bill, particularly of clause 1, but how will she acheive that? Will she make lists showing the amounts of interest recovered? If so, and if they are large amounts, the Bill will not have been a success, because it will not have changed the culture; but it will be a success insofar as it will have put more costs on to industry. Will the Minister measure the length of payment periods? If they are extended by even one day, the Bill will have failed; many organisations and businesses feel that that will be the result of the Bill. Indeed, that has happened in other countries. How will the Minister establish whether payment periods have been extended as a result of the Bill?
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Will the Minister measure the Bill's success by counting the number of continuing business relationships, or will she attempt to take the temperature of the water and see how many business relationships founder? The feeling among businesses is that if businesses resort to the provisions allowed under the Bill, the relationship between them is at an end. Will the Minister measure the number of businesses that terminate their relationships with other companies?
<P>
How will the Minister measure the Bill's success? Unless she sets the parameters at this stage, there can be little doubt that businesses and industry, which have not been uncritical of the Bill, will continue to be sceptical.
<P>
The Minister has made a great deal of fuss about small businesses and made a great fanfare of how important they are to the Government. She has frequently quoted the newspaper article that says that the Opposition will have no new policies for some time to come, and that we have lost the small business vote. I am quite happy for the Minister to repeat those reports of an interview, for the simple reason that I am honest about my party's position. We must have lost some of the small business vote; we must have lost some of the medium-sized business vote. We must also have lost some of the women's vote and some of the men's vote.
<P>
I am prepared to say that because we nevertheless achieved a large number of votes, and we are in the process of realigning our party to win a considerably larger number of votes than the Government at the next general election. I do not know how the Government can be so smug, because they received fewer votes at the general election than we received at the previous general election--hardly a triumph. They may have won in numbers of Members but not in terms of the macro-vote.
<P>
As I say, the Minister can repeat that newspaper article as often as she wishes, but we understand that measures need to be taken to create a culture whereby late payment becomes antisocial. We believe that the Bill will not achieve that on its own. The Minister does not believe that either. I do not understand why the Minister has wasted her energies on the Bill when there is so much to be done elsewhere.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will address the points that I have made, which have come out of the mouths of businesses. I hope that she will tell us in detail how she aims to measure the Bill's success. At least we can then make some progress before moving on to the Government amendments to later clauses.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for initiating this short but relevant clause stand part debate. It enables me to explore briefly what has always worried me about this Bill in particular and such legislation in general. Such legislation seeks either to change the culture of business and commercial transactions or, expresssing it in another way, to alter the relationships that exist between suppliers and customers. That might or might not be a desirable or laudable aim, but I doubt whether the result of such an effort will necessarily be positive. My hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham has mentioned that point.
<P>
We have heard frequently that the general assumption underlying the Bill is that larger firms dominate or exploit smaller firms. We have been told frequently that that is the main source of the problem. As I said, I have doubts about that, although it is undoubtedly an element of the problem. However, I suspect that there is almost an equal element, in that small firms exploit other small firms for whatever motive--perhaps to enhance their cash flow or to pass back the problem that they have collecting their debts.
<P>
The key to our consideration of how clause 1 will work is the likely response of firms to one another in the context of the Bill. I have in mind the possibility--I put it no more highly than that--that a larger firm might do one of a number of things if it wants to mitigate the Bill's effects. First, it might seek to vary the terms of trade. Perhaps we shall explore that in more detail later, but suffice it to say that it is at least a possibility.
<P>
Confronted with what a company might view as a vexatious use of the Bill, it might suggest to its, perhaps relatively small, supplier changing the terms of trade from net 30 days to net 45 or net 60 days. No doubt, the large firm would find good reason for doing so. Such a change would nullify any beneficial effect of the Bill and would therefore be counterproductive.
<P>
On Second Reading, my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Hertfordshire raised an issue that has given me pause for thought, given his enormous experience of such matters. Apart from the fact that the Minister said, rather sinisterly, that she had powers, either under existing legislation or under the Bill, to intervene in commercial relationships, if a company could not vary the terms of trade, it could in certain circumstances resort to an alternative-- re-sourcing with an another supplier.
<P>
If a company thought that it was being hounded by a supplier, it could simply decide to re-source with another supplier. I image that, because it would be starting a commercial relationship with that new supplier, it could freely negotiate the terms of trade. It would not vary the terms of trade, as in my first option; it would seek, ab initio, to negotiate fresh terms of trade with the new supplier of the same or similar product or component. The company would then want to negotiate net 45, 60, or perhaps even 90 days, to avoid what it saw as the iniquitous provisions of the Bill.
<P>
If all that failed, some businesses might--it is a possibility only--resort the time-honoured tactic of querying quality, quantity, timeliness or a combination of all three. Anyone with commercial experience will know that that happens in any case; it is a natural part of the commercial process. If one business contracts to supply to another a certain quantity of the goods--the performance, fitness for purpose and quality of which is usually specified--it is a normal part of the process that, on delivery or later, the goods are assessed against the order and that that, perfectly legitimatley, can give rise to several queries. It is equally well known that the process can be tightened or loosened depending not only on the goods' fitness for purpose but on the approach that the customer wants to adopt to the supplier in the context of the payments mechanism.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for South-West Hertfordshire spoke briefly on Second Reading about the difficulties in many, if not most, cases of providing a mechanism that would satisfactorily underpin the aspirations of the Bill. I hope that he will expand on those comments, because he was referring to an important point. I am outlining the possible complications that would arise from queries about quantity, quality or timeliness of delivery as well as other factors, such as the matching of delivery notes and the acceptance of quality being put into the payments mechanism and the problems that would arise from that.
<P>
I want to illustrate my fear that the Bill, however well motivated, could be counterproductive. My hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham asked about the mechanisms by which the Minister would measure the effectiveness of the legislation. A starting point would be to take some measure of the existing payments record and measure it again subsequently. That might be imperfect, however, because we would have to break down the negotiations that took place in the public sector as opposed to the private sector. A key factor that we shall be considering later in our proceedings is the relationship between the public sector, Government Departments and agencies and private-sector suppliers. That is on the minds of many members of the Committee and we shall want to explore it fully.
<P>
Suffice it to say that I remain to be more convinced than I am at present that the outcome of the Bill will be as unremittingly positive as has been suggested. As I said on Second Reading, the Minister said that the Bill was ``no panacea''. I welcome her words, but I want to go a stage further and suggest that, if we are not careful, there will be a risk that it could almost be counterproductive. If too many people avail themselves of its powers and create too many difficulties in their relationships between customers and suppliers, there could be a negative effect. I hope that I am proved wrong, but I wanted to put down my own marker at this stage and say that that is a possibility and that, if there is a negative effect, none of us should be too surprised.

<P>

<B>Mr. Page:</B> I said that we were concerned about three aspects: first, that the Bill had been oversold; secondly, that the Government should lead by example; and thirdly, that we should pay due attention to the European directive that lingers and looms on the horizon. We do not want to plough up the legislation if the directive forces hits us with vast changes. My right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst made a relevant point when he referred to the aspirations behind the Bill. All members of the Committee agree with them; it is just some of us are more cynical than others.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> Will my hon. Friend expand on the instinct and intuition behind his last point? He said that all members of the Committee agree. He has heard briefly from Opposition Members--very briefly, as it turned out, from the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare--but how can he divine Labour Back Benchers' views when, regrettably, none of them has to date uttered a syllable in Committee?
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> I have many responsibilities, but trying to delve into the minds of Labour Members requires a skill beyond my meagre capabilities. Indeed, I cannot understand why anyone would want to be a Labour Member of Parliament, so there is a mental divide before we even begin the argument--and I am sure that if I were to do so, you would quite rightly pull me to order, Mrs. Roe. I do not want to go into a black hole and not come out again.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
To return to the Bill's aspirations, hoping that my right hon. Friend will not lead me astray, I agree with him that the Minister left a strong impression that if the contracts imposed on small businesses were unfair or lengthy, she would do something about it. Those were not her exact words, but I look her straight in the eye to say that I should be left with that impression if I were listening to the debate from the Gallery. I am worried, because that takes us into another raft of legislation and contract terms that would be even more complicated.
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham and I mentioned earlier, about 60 per cent. of trade associations remain unconvinced that this method will help their members tackle late payments. I have already mentioned that no one can do more in the argument than refer to the attitude of the four clearing banks, two of which are against the measure, and two of which support it. One of those that support it said that it would not work, but that it will help to change the culture. If the measure helps to change the culture and to encourage the receipt of payments on time, it will be a small addition to the vast raft of other measures that have been put on the statute book over the past two years.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Gillan:</B> I must agree with my hon. Friend that anything that changes the culture is welcome. However, closer examination of a country such as France, in which a large majority of companies pay their bills on time, reveals that payment periods have been extended to about 90 days. Therefore, in France, there has been no panacea: such measures have, arguably, resulted in the lengthening of payment terms and, in the final analysis, have made more companies worse off, rather than changing the culture of payment in France.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> My hon. Friend leads us to comparisons within Europe. It is clear that a statutory right of interest is not the immediate panacea of all ills. Examination of Europe was a powerful dissuader from using parliamentary time to add further legislation and information to the statute book.
<P>
As I said at the beginning of my speech, many small businesses will be disappointed when they discover that to access their money, they will still have to resort to applying to the courts. I hope that the Minister will--I shall not say ``come clean'', as that would be unfair--be a little more open about how the small claims court procedure will operate, perhaps introducing a fast-track procedure for small business men and women who are chasing their money.
<P>
The clause, along with others, mentions qualifying debt. Strong legal advice that I have received suggests that under the English principle the ownership of goods passes when the contract of sale is made. Big players can make changes. My right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst asked me about the relationship between suppliers and their customers. I spoke to a trade association this morning that does not support the Bill. It told me that initially it thought that the Bill would help its members. When it examined it a little more carefully, however, it realised that it would not have the effect that it hoped for. It realised that draconian terms may be imposed by suppliers, although I appreciate that a company can apply muscle when it is the customer--especially when it is buying a large amount from a small company.
<P>
I could cite example after example of large companies saying, ``We shall not worry about the credit terms of small companies; we shall not worry about invoices; we have a direct debit, sign here and as soon as you get our product your account will be debited.'' Large companies, such is their power, will not allow 15, 30 or 40 days to pay.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Gillan:</B> I thank my hon. Friend for giving way once more; he has been most generous in doing so. I seek his opinion on the effect of electronic commerce, which will allow instant transactions. For example, a book will be ordered on the internet from a bookstore in California and payment will be expected before the goods are dispatched. Electronic commerce will have a tremendous effect on commercial payments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> My hon. Friend takes us into the electronic age, and I have no doubt that, provided somebody is prepared to sign on the dotted line and agree to an instant deduction, everything will be possible. A large company being supplied by a small company, however, may not agree to such an arrangement and may prefer a credit period, which gives it the use of goods and services before it pays for them. That, again, tilts the balance in favour of large businesses.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that it can be a mistake to assume that the large operator has the advantage? A small operator may design, for example, a better light bulb, and large operators would pursue him to buy his idea--on his terms.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> That may happen, but not in the majority of cases.
<P>
What I would like to raise--provided that I do not get any more help from my hon. Friend the Member for Solihull; this is what I was trying to address from the start--is the debate taking place within the European Union on the title of goods, and how it will affect us. It is being suggested that, contrary to the English principle that title of goods passes the moment that the contract of sale is made, title of goods should be retained until the buyer has paid the full price. We can foresee a degree of legal complication resulting if we are to bring about that state of affairs. It is important that the Minister addresses that issue and explains to what extent the Bill may be affected by that and may need to be changed in that regard.
<P>
Through sheer laziness, I have a general penchant for unifying European legislation. I like to know that I am doing the right thing in whatever European country I am doing something, because it happens to be the common rule of law. The retention of title to property is an important instrument to secure proper payment. If the person who has the product realises that until he has paid he does not have title, there are all sorts of advantages in relation to reclaiming the goods or services in question. I am sure that the Minister will appreciate that point.
<P>
However, the Commission is only too well aware that existing differences raise a considerable legal problem. The work necessary to bring about harmonisation and simplification will be extremely important.
<P>
The reason I raise that issue is that I wonder whether the Minister can tell us whether it will be difficult to adapt the Bill to any EU directive--I will be asking her to clarify other aspects of the draft directive--that says that title does not pass until the goods are sold. We must bear in mind the huge set of complications that arise when a product passes down a distribution chain concerning where the various rights stop and start. We can imagine the difficulties that may arise when the wholesaler delivers the goods to the retailer in some countries, when we may run into the problem of transfer of title on retention. That is one reason why I am a great believer in the delivery of a simplified message throughout the whole of Europe.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> My hon. Friend raised an interesting point that I do not think that any other member of the Committee has made, concerning the rights that are activated through a supply chain. Those of us who were unfortunate enough in younger days to be law students will remember the case of Donoghue v. Stevenson, which opened up the possibility of redress by the consumer against the original manufacturer, rather than the intermediate retailer. My hon. Friend is exactly right to draw attention to the fact that in chains of supply there is a series of interlocking rights, claims, redresses and entitlements. That is a difficult field that requires the level of scrutiny in which the Committee is rightly engaged.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> Answer that! I would be remarkably bold to move into areas well know by my hon. Friend, with his legal background. His comments reinforce my point that the European Union is going in a direction which, unless there is a substantial change of heart, we will follow. My concern is that the Bill should be drafted in such a way that, as I said, we do not have to plough it up again in a few year's time to re-do part of it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> On that point, is my hon. Friend aware that proposals are currently before the European Union--
