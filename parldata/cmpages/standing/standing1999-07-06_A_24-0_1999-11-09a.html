<P>
Question again proposed, That the amendment be made.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that with this we are taking amendment No. 477, in Clause 130, page 59, line 32, at end insert

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`or the competitive position of the United Kingdom'.
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Howard Flight </B>(Arundel and South Downs): I recollect that my main point was that the language of clause 2(3) and clause 129 does not make it clear that the word ``competition'' is meant to cover both not impeding domestic competition and supporting international competitiveness. Since our debate on the clause and the Minister's verbal announcement, we have had a further Government statement on this territory, according to which the Government propose to substitute the Competition Commission for the Treasury as the party to which the Office of Fair Trading will report. In the Government's press release, the focus is very much on domestic competition, not international competitiveness. As I understand it, the Government propose to table major amendments to clause 129 on Report. In view of the Minister's statement this morning and subsequent amendments, it is becoming clear that we will not have a full discussion and exploration of the new amendments until we reach that stage.

<P>
Returning to our two amendments, the Minister has tried to persuade us that international competitiveness, as well as not impeding domestic competition, will be included within the brief and report of the OFT. However, we are not convinced that the wording of the relevant provisions achieves that, so we intend to put our amendments to the vote. The amendments are necessary to give effect to the intentions of the original clause 20. They set out what should be the case with regard to competition.

<P>
<B>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Miss Melanie Johnson):</B> Perhaps I can help the hon. Gentleman further. Let us be clear. International competitiveness is not covered explicitly in clause 129(2), which deals only with anti-competitive effects. If the FSA were to regulate in an anti-competitive way, one would expect that to impact on the competitive position of the UK. That was the connection that I made. The UK would be a less attractive place to do business if UK regulators regulated in that way. Keeping firms out of the market for no good regulatory reason would make us less competitive internationally. Fewer firms would be competing in the UK, which would be bad for UK competitiveness.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Let me give a specific example. The interpretation of the FSA's market abuse rules might be such that American bond traders conclude that the UK is not an attractive place for them to do their international business and they might switch it to Zurich. That is an example of regulation making the UK less internationally competitive. We would, therefore, lose out in terms of employment and all the other add-ons that go with people doing business here.

<P>
That example has nothing to do with the state of domestic competition. Since the beginning of the Committee's proceedings, our intent has been that the FSA should conduct itself in such a way as to encourage our international competitiveness; it should certainly not discourage it. The head of the FSA has always said that that should be his task. My example is not related particularly to the state of competition in the domestic economy.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> The point is that the FSA can ultimately do nothing to ensure that the UK is always the most competitive-that is not its job. Its job is to give due weight to competition concerns in the way in which it operates and regulates. I am not sure whether there is an answer to the hon. Gentleman's question. Competition concerns and international competitiveness might pull in different directions, although they would not often do so in practice.

<P>
For example, the FSA might subsidise the fees of those who operate in an area that attracted overseas customers. That could be said to improve the UK's competitive position, but it would be undesirable for the FSA to continue such a practice. Its job is not to promote domestic champions in that way, nor is it the job of the international competitiveness principle in the Bill.

<P>
The FSA must conduct itself in a way that takes account of the principle of international competitiveness. That duty is placed on it in clause 2. The provisions before us deal with oversight in the area of competition.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> That still does not tell me clearly what constitutes the task of the Office of Fair Trading. Is it to examine whether the rules, principles and whatever else the FSA might be dealing with appear to the reasonable man, whom we defined in the market abuse clause, to be unreasonably damaging Britain's international competitiveness? Such a task should be very much part of competition scrutiny, which is why we have tabled the amendments. However, I do not hear the Minister saying that it will be part of the brief. The Government's announcement is drafted very much in the language of domestic competition. Nowhere does it say or even imply that the OFT will have a duty to report to the Competition Commission on the international situation. Indeed, the commission is not necessarily equipped to play a part because it deals with domestic competition.

<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell </B>(North-East Bedfordshire): Just a few sentences to reinforce the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs (Mr. Flight). Every time I listen to the Minister's answer, it appears to be cosily boxed in. She deals with the competitive position in the United Kingdom, but not with the broader question of whether the regulatory regime in the United Kingdom might become anti-competitive and make it difficult for those who operate here, as opposed to from some other country, to compete. While the Minister usually says that she wishes to give that impression, the wording of the clause without our amendment does not do so. Those who study her words are unlikely to get much comfort. I think that we should press the matter to a vote.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> Perhaps I will come back one more time and then Opposition Members can decide whether they want a vote. There is some confusion here between competition and the international competitive position of the United Kingdom. There is a difference, as the Opposition argued before the summer recess, and we need to keep it in mind. The permitted purposes do not cover the international competitive position of the United Kingdom. Ministers could not say that an anti-competitive rule was justified on the grounds of international competitiveness, for example.

<P>
The OFT is the UK's national competition regulator. Over the years it has built up a great deal of expertise in that role, not least in its existing function of competition scrutiny of the FSA's rules under the Financial Services Act 1986. We believe that it is well placed to have this role in future. International competitiveness raises different issues and I suspect that it is not an area where the OFT would claim any special expertise any more than it would on matters relating to the other principles of clause 2(3), such as the most efficient and effective way for the FSA to use its resources.

<P>
We do not think that the FSA should be subject to formal OFT scrutiny of the effects of its actions on UK international competitiveness. There is not another statutory body with an equivalent role for the other principles. That does not mean that the FSA will not want to take into account the views of consultees and the producer and consumer panels on this issue. In the end, the FSA itself should be responsible for how it takes account of international competitiveness, but that is different from competition.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I thank the Minister for clarifying the position as we had understood it. Our starting point is that both domestic competition and international competitiveness are addressed right back in clause 2(3). Howard Davies and many others have been at great pains to argue, correctly, that good regulation is a competitive advantage internationally and that bad regulation is a competitive disadvantage.

<P>
I asked the Minister how much the Government proposed to beef up the OFT to deal with its role here. It is entirely necessary and desirable for the OFT to be competent to review and report on what the FSA is doing to boost Britain's international competitiveness or, as the case may be, to damage it. We see the need for our amendments as strongly as ever and in the spirit of what the Chancellor has just talked about in the Chamber this afternoon we suggest that it would be sensible to equip the FSA to fulfil that role. Otherwise it is just left hanging in mid air: there is no scrutiny of the impact of its actions on our international competitiveness which, in terms of jobs and national income, is perhaps even more important than domestic competition.

<P>

<B>Mr. Andrew Tyrie </B>(Chichester) rose-

<P>
<B>Hon. Members:</B> ``Oh''.

<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> The reaction of Labour Members is regrettable, but I am sure that I will be able to persuade them that what I am about to say is worth listening to.

<P>
A long introductory speech about chapter III was read into the record. I was not able to follow it fully, and, given all its particulars, I doubt whether any member of the Committee was able to. I raised a point of order to ask whether the Economic Secretary could give a commitment that henceforth such statements could be given to members of the Committee in advance. I received the same reply as on previous occasions, which was, ``I'll do my best.'' But that is not good enough.

<P>
I saw the Minister immediately after this morning's sitting and asked her whether the statement could be distributed before this afternoon's sitting. The hon. Lady refused, even though it had already been read into the record.

<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> May I clarify that we put a copy of the pre-Budget statement relating to these matters on the Board at about 4 pm. I have a copy here which the hon. Gentleman is welcome to take. That was the best that could be done between this morning's sitting and now.

<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I am afraid that I was not able to take it up because I was not aware of it. My hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs now informs me that I could have obtained a print of it from another source. However, neither document is the one to which I refer. I was referring to the Minister's statement in Committee this morning, not to one directly connected to the this afternoon's announcement by the Chancellor. It is impossible to absorb this information because of the speed at which it is being given to us. I must ask the hon. Lady to reconsider her decision because it is unacceptable.

<P>
On the detail of the hon. Lady's statement, she covered not only chapter III but a wide and important area relating to clause 129. I shall do my best to concentrate on clause 129, but to cover the points that I want to make, I will have to discuss-at least briefly, as the Economic Secretary did-issues that relate to other clauses.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Because the Economic Secretary properly went wide in speaking to the first group of amendments, I am happy to allow a wide-ranging debate on the clause. I hope that that is helpful.

<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> Thank you, Mr. Atkinson. That was very helpful.

<P>
The arrangement under chapter III is messy. Four powerful institutions are capable of having an interest and a say in the relationship between regulation and competition, including the FSA, the Office of Fair Trading and the Competition Commission. Under the current rules, the OFT should consider the detail-

<P>
Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.

<P>
<H5>6.35 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
On resuming-

<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I was just saying that the Bill's treatment of competition represents a complicated-in fact, rather messy-arrangement. Having had a few more minutes to think about the best way to proceed, I shall make my key general point-which connects closely with what the Minister said about chapter III-and return to one or two specific issues when we reach later clauses.

<P>
Under the Bill, the FSA, the OFT, the Competition Commission and the Treasury all have a role to play. The OFT will consider the detailed individual rules to assess whether they affect competition, the Competition Commission will have a general overview, and the Treasury will be left with the decision on whether to accept or reject a recommendation. The position is somewhat altered by the press release that has just been issued, as I shall explain when we reach the relevant clauses.

<P>
Conservative Members have argued from the outset that competition should be right at the heart of the Bill. Time and again we have found that we would have been able to avoid much difficulty in discussing certain clauses if competition had been defined as a statutory objective in clause 2(3). I shall reiterate why that is the case.

<P>
The importance of the competition objective, and the great damage that regulation could easily do to it, cannot be overstressed in respect of the pre-eminent position of the City. I cite as an example barriers to entry into the banking market. That market is changing rapidly. While there have been four clearers for a long time, recently there has been an explosion of new players-such as supermarkets and insurance companies-trying to enter the market. If, for example, prudential regulations or capital adequacy ratios were to be set at an inappropriate level, that would create a substantial barrier to entry into the banking market. The consequences for competition would be profound. Clause 129 and the subsequent four clauses deal specifically with ensuring the right balance between the competition objective and the need for regulation.

<P>
The risk of discouraging new entrants to the market cannot be overstated. The Bill contains far too much regulation that is designed to deal with the existing financial system, and not enough flexibility to deal with what might exist in a few years' time. We may have to deal with competition opening up in areas where we are only just beginning to think about it-for example, companies entering the banking market through the internet, which we discussed in relation to an earlier clause.

<P>
Last year, the Chancellor asked Don Cruickshank to launch an investigation into the competitiveness of the banking sector and produce a banking review. He has done a lot of work on that, which is still in progress-he has not yet submitted his final report. However, some months ago he issued an interim report, in which he made significant recommendations in respect of each of the clauses. One of his main recommendations, which Opposition Committee members have also consistently made, is that competition should be elevated to the status of an objective. He unequivocally stated that

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the FSA should have a primary competition objective, in addition to its regulatory objectives.''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
In her statement today, which I hope that she read, and which I am sure that she penned herself, the Economic Secretary said:

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``It is vital that in fulfilling its statutory objectives the FSA continues to regulate in a way which does not unnecessarily distort competition.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
In other words, she is making a clear genuflection in the direction of the need to elevate competition to the status of an objective. In the light of that, will she look again at the matter on Report? We might then avoid considerable grief, and perhaps some evening sittings, and the examination of chapter III would be far less difficult.

<P>
<B>Mr. Nigel Beard </B>(Bexleyheath and Crayford): The hon. Member for Chichester (Mr. Tyrie) has made the same point-that competition should be an overwhelming objective-time and again during our proceedings. Time and again, the answer has been that, in such a case, two major regulatory authorities-the Office of Fair Trading and the FSA-would share the same objective, and the financial services industry would be regulated in two ways.

<P>
Chapter III in no way detracts from the importance of competitiveness; rather, it sets out the mode by which it should be achieved. The Office of Fair Trading will retain the competition watchdog role that it fulfils in every other sector of business. If the FSA is seen to transgress, it will be the Office of Fair Trading's responsibility to do something about it.

<P>
According to the Economic Secretary's press release, the steps that will be taken have changed but the principle has not. If we were to follow the line that the hon. Member for Chichester (Mr. Tyrie), has repeatedly plugged, the financial services industry would be in a mess. It would not be well served by two regulators vying to take the same steps.

<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> The hon. Gentleman is articulating precisely the case that the press release has superseded.

<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson indicated dissent.</B><P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> The Economic Secretary shakes her head, but we will now have two authorities competing in the same area. Page 2 of the press release states that the Office of Fair Trading and the Competition Commission will be allowed,

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``when investigating complex monopolies, to consider and comment on any part played by FSA rules.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
With regard to complex monopolies, the problem to which the hon. Gentleman is alluding is now being conceded.

<P>
<B>Mr. Beard:</B> But under present arrangements, the two authorities have clear and distinct objectives. The line that is being plugged is that they should be given the same objective, but the result would be a muddle. Moreover, if the FSA were to be given the competition objective to which constant reference is made, its dealings with international regulators would be highly suspect, but the hon. Gentleman and his colleagues have not dealt with that point. The industry needs international regulation, which can be achieved only through competition among the FSA's counterparts in different countries. If they believe that a primary purpose of the FSA is to advance the competitiveness of British industry, they will regard with suspicion everything that the FSA says. Those points have been made time and again, but I have not once heard an Opposition Member discuss them, despite the fact that we keep on plugging the same point.

<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I think that the hon. Gentleman misinterprets-perhaps not deliberately-our comments on making competitiveness an objective. Our view is not that the FSA should be a regulator of competition in the industry, but that competitiveness should be one objective among others to which the FSA should aspire in the conduct of its business. When the Economic Secretary referred in her statement to the FSA's statutory objectives, she was using our language.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman is making a long intervention. The hon. Member for Bexleyheath and Crayford is making a speech.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Beard:</B> If the proposal were agreed to, the financial services industry would be dealt with by two major statutory organisations that had exactly the same objectives. My point is that that would make the industry distinct from every other sector of business in this country.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> As the proposal stands, the OFT will examine the FSA's activities, and, if it thought that the FSA was impeding competition, it would report that fact. The competition commissioner might say, ``Yes, we believe that that activity is impeding competition''. However, the FSA could respond, ``Yes, it is, but we have to impede competition in order to achieve another of our objectives. So far as we are concerned, it is more important for us to achieve our four objectives than to pay heed to competitiveness, because that is how priorities are ordered''. Unless competitiveness has the same priority as other objectives, the proposal will create such a conflict.

<P>
<B>Mr. Beard:</B> That would be true if the FSA had the last word, but the original document's phrasing gave the Treasury the last word. The present document's phrasing, as I interpret it, gives the OFT the last word. The hon. Gentleman's point therefore does not arise, because the OFT is responsible for adjudicating matters involving competition. It could say to the FSA, ``You are being too zealous and you are spoiling our chances. You have got to stop that''. The FSA would have no option but to stop. Where is the problem in that?

<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> We shall discuss more fully the status of competitiveness as an objective.

<P>
The long statement that the Economic Secretary read out this morning whetted our appetites, but it gave us nothing to get our teeth into. It was not possible-I hope that those who advise the Economic Secretary are listening carefully-to take in her thoroughly important statement. It took her about 15 minutes to read it out. I have sat on many Committees during the past 20 years, but I cannot recall another occasion in a Standing Committee in which a similar statement was read out. The approach is wrong. It does not involve a breach of the law, but it is an unsatisfactory parliamentary procedure, and it should not happen again.

<P>
I do not blame the Economic Secretary-frankly, I expect that the approach was arranged at a very high level-but I do somewhat blame the Chancellor of the Exchequer. It is he who must take responsibility for his Department's conduct. No Government Department should use the approach that was adopted earlier to introduce a thoroughly important policy statement. Although we do not want an inhibited debate, that is what resulted. It appears that we are moving towards an area of rather more common ground, in which we want a constructive discussion about the duties with regard to competitiveness in the context of the Financial Services Authority. It is difficult to do so following a statement like this. I cannot imagine why a copy of the brief that the Minister read into the record could not have been given to us in the period between this morning's and this afternoon's sittings.

<P>
I do not blame the Minister, who has only been in post for a few weeks. However, the statement must have been typed up and approved by yesterday evening, and was, I suspect, in draft weeks before that, because one cannot produce such a long and careful statement without a great deal of preparation. It should have been typed up in a form in which it could have been handed round the Committee, and, sensibly, annexed to today's press release, which is so short-handed that it gives us very little opportunity to comment. That is enough grumbling, but I hope that it will be heeded.

<P>
My point on competition as an objective is that I am not sure that I agree with the hon. Member for Bexleyheath and Crayford that it would damage the system by introducing it into clause 2(3).

<P>
At present, competitiveness is something for which the FSA is to ``have regard'', as set out in clause 2(3)(e). The purpose of this morning's statement seems to be to enhance that. It is right to enhance it, and the right way to do that is to put it into subsection (3). I do not think that that would have a damaging effect. We intend to return to this matter on Report, when I hope that we shall see a whole swath of appropriate amendments well in advance.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I want to make a final point. In conducting our own surveys of City institutions, it was found that they were not especially keen on competitiveness being an objective. In my 25 or 30 years in the industry, I have found that regulation has reinforced cartels. It is not in the interest of cartels for competitiveness to be high on the agenda as an objective for a regulator. That is analogous to the debate that we had earlier about mortgage regulation, in which the Treasury pointed out that the big players in the mortgage industry wanted regulation in order to reinforce their cartelised position.

<P>
<B>Mr. Beard:</B> Is that not an argument for separating the supervision of competition from regulation? If competition is covered by the regulator, that may well generate cartels. However, if it is separate, and an independent authority has the right to examine whether rules of competition are being breached, that is a far healthier position.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> There is certainly a good argument for the process of competitiveness being investigated by the Office of Fair Trading, to which we have not objected. In fact, we have supported it.

<P>
I return to the slightly different issue of what weight the regulator should give to different issues in the process of getting on with regulation and rule-making. Without repeating the point ad nauseam, our view has always been that there were other priorities to which the regulator was obliged to give more attention than regulation that supported competition. We are uncomfortable with that prioritisation issue.

<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I somewhat regret whetting the hon. Gentleman's appetite with this morning's statement. We could have introduced the small changes that we are proposing without going into a scene-setting description of those changes. I tried to set the scene so that all hon. Members would understand what changes we foresaw. We have not yet tabled any amendments, and Opposition Members will be able to respond to the change in policy when we do so. Clearly, what I put on the record this morning will be available within a day or so, and Opposition Members will be able to use it to respond to the detailed amendments that will be introduced. That will provide an opportunity for detailed discussion.

<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I do not want to labour this point, but if it was not necessary to have a long scene-setting statement for those amendments, the substance of the statement could have been given later. Alternatively, if it was important, it should have been given in advance.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I have tried to be helpful, and to explain why I did not feel that it was essential to give the statement in advance. I am responsible for the Bill, and hon. Members can blame me if they wish. I hope that I have set out the Government's arrangements, the purpose of which is to prepare the way for amendments. Much of the debate will be revisited on Report, when we return to clause 2, to which many of the issues that have been raised relate. As I said, we will then have access to what I said on record.

<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I am encouraged by the Economic Secretary's last remark. Is it an indication that she will reconsider adding competition to the list of objectives?

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I am coming on to that point. We have carefully considered the case for a competition objective, in the light of the banking review team's interim report and of amendments tabled by Opposition Members. Clearly, the issue was raised in an earlier discussion. We concluded, however, that such an objective would not be appropriate. The objectives relate to the aims and purposes of regulation.

Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.

<P>
<H5>7.40 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
On resuming-

<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> As I was saying before the Division, our objectives concern the aim and purpose of regulation. A competition objective would be appropriate only if the FSA was a competition regulator and it is not. That is the job of the Office of Fair Trading and the Competition Commission. Opposition Members may shake their heads, but that is their job and I have no difficulty with that.

<P>
The hon. Member for Chichester discussed whether competition should be an objective. The principles place a statutory duty on the FSA and Mr. Don Cruickshank in his response to my comments today stated:

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Government believes that this outcome can be achieved without giving the FSA a primary competition objective in addition to its regulatory objectives. My concern has always been that the outcome should be as Ministers intend. I am not wedded to any particular means of achieving this, and I will welcome any changes to the Bill which deliver the outcome in practice.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> It sounds as though there is no difference of principle between what the Minister is trying to achieve in the Bill and what Mr. Cruickshank wants to achieve concerning competition. I realise that she has been in the job for only a few weeks, but this is a fundamental and major issue. I am not asking the Minister to give a commitment now, but will she give the matter some thought before Report? That would make the remainder of our scrutiny of the Bill a great deal easier and would be a great service to the Committee.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I am happy to say that I shall continue to think about the matter. I have been thinking about it for several months. The hon. Gentleman's reference to me being in post for a few weeks was kind, but I have been in post for several months and I assure him that I have been giving the matter active thought for much of that time.

<P>
The hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs seems to be confused about competition and competitiveness. The hon. Gentleman spoke for some time about competitiveness, but the clause refers to competition. We must be clear about the difference.

<P>
I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Bexleyheath and Crayford for his support today. His comments were in line with what I have just said about not wanting two separate organisations with primary responsibility as the competition regulator. That cannot be right, which is why we are resisting what Opposition Members are trying to entice us into.

<P>
I turn to the comments of the hon. Member for Chichester. I shall say more about the role of the Competition Commission when we come to clause 130. The Competition Commission and the Office of Fair Trading provide external scrutiny in the area of competition. In my response to amendments Nos. 473 and 474 I referred to the background of this part of the Bill as a whole and the changes that we are making to the FSA's internal processes. It is vital that the FSA gives full weight to competition concerns both when initially making rules and also on an on-going basis. Clause 2(3)(f) places a duty on the FSA to have regard to

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the principle that competition between authorised persons should not be impeded or distorted unnecessarily.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
We shall examine the wording of that principle and the ``have regard to'' formula to ensure that it works as intended and that the FSA gives full weight to competition. I can give the hon. Gentleman that assurance without difficulty.

<P>
This morning, I outlined additional changes that we have made to bolster the FSA's internal procedures. First, we shall ensure that the cost-benefit analysis will take account not only of direct costs on the regulator side but of the wider economic costs. Secondly, the FSA will be asked to cover in its annual report the effect of regulation on competition. That will help to ensure that the FSA continues to address competition issues.

<P>
<H5>7.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
These arrangements will, as I said, reinforce the FSA's internal procedures. As I mentioned this morning, they will provide the first line of defence. The second line of defence is external scrutiny arrangements, which we will debate in the next clause.

<P>

<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> May I ask the Minister a quick question? She kindly explained the appropriate cost-benefit analysis this morning. My right hon. and learned Friend the Member for North-East Bedfordshire (Sir Nicholas Lyell) asked for a letter setting out the methodology on which the cost-benefit analyses will be undertaken. I would be most grateful if she could tell us when we can expect to receive that letter.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I am afraid that I cannot give the hon. Gentleman the assurance that any further information about that will be forthcoming at this stage.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Could I ask the Minister whether the FSA's new requirement is to report annually on the impact of regulation on cost-benefit analysis? Does she intend just domestic competition to be covered? Howard Davies certainly believes that it is important to report on the FSA's effect on Britain's international competitiveness.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I said competition and, at this stage, I intend to stay with that.

<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I am sorry to take up more of the Committee's time. However, can the Minister tell us, if she is not going to notify us through a letter, how the wider public can gain some reassurance about the credibility and substance of the cost-benefit analysis?

Clause 129 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<H4><center>Clause 130</center></H4>

<H4><center>Reports by Director General of Fair Trading</center></H4>

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 476, in page 59, line 27, leave out `new'.

<P>
I trust that we can move on speedily. This is a probing amendment intended to ask the Government whether ``new'' qualifying regulations effectively means the original regulations. After the Bill is enacted, the regulations will have to be reissued and we are not sure whether ``new'' refers to the future after that time, or whether it applies to all regulations to be reissued.

<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I will have to say more than the hon. Gentleman might have expected in response to his point.

<P>
Clause 130 provides for the scrutiny of the FSA's regulating provisions and practices to establish whether they do, in fact, have a significantly anti-competitive effect. The responsibility for that is given to the Director General of Fair Trading, as the head of the Office of Fair Trading.

<P>
Subsections (1) and (2) currently require the FSA to send a copy of any new or amended regulating provision that it makes to the director general, together with a notice stating whether, in its opinion, the provision is likely to have an effect on competition.

<P>
As I explained, we will remove this requirement in line with Don Cruickshank's recommendation. The hon. Gentleman's amendment will therefore fall away. We shall, of course, retain the director general's to keep the FSA's regulating provisions and practices under review. The director general will be able to do this effectively because, in future, FSA rules will be available publicly in both draft and final form.

<P>
If the director general considers that a regulating provision or practice-either alone, or in combination with other existing regulating provisions or practices-has a significant anti-competitive effect, he must make a report of this fact, including details of the effect, for the Treasury.

<P>
However, if he concludes that there is no significant anti-competitive effect, then he may make a report of this to the Treasury, but is under no obligation to do so.

<P>
Before I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment, I should like to give notice about further amendments that we shall introduce to this and subsequent clauses in the light of Don Cruickshank's report.

<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Atkinson. I hope that the Minister will give us her notes on the amendments as we go through them clause by clause, rather than giving us notes for subsequent clauses, which she referred to earlier, because that would make it difficult for us to follow the debate.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> That is not a point of order for the Chair. Again, no doubt the Minister has taken note of what the hon. Gentleman said.

<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell </B>(North-East Bedfordshire): Further to that point of order, Mr. Atkinson. I am worried that the Economic Secretary is about to read another lot of stuff into the record.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> Very little.

<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> It is not helpful to conduct the Committee in this way; it is a matter of order. If there is a great deal of background material, Mr. Atkinson, I seek your guidance on whether it is appropriate to this amendment.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I must tell the right hon. and learned Gentleman that the Chair has no power to enforce things on Ministers. From the point of view of the Chair, and ordered debate, it is sensible, if long statements are to be made, that they are given to Members as this enables the debate to proceed more clearly. But I cannot enforce this on anyone.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I am in the hands of hon. Members, Mr. Atkinson. I could decide not to read this couple of pages onto the record, but thought that it would be helpful for hon. Members to have an outline of where we are going. In answer to the point from the hon. Member for Chichester about amendments, there are no Government amendments on the clause, so there is nothing relating to specific amendments. This is merely to give the Committee a flavour of where we shall be in the future, which I hope would allow hon. Members to reflect, and be well informed during debates.

<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> We are very grateful to the Minister. Can she give us a flavour of where we are going on clause 130 but not give us her comments, if any, on subsequent clauses until we have arrived at them. That would help us.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I shall read only what is necessary now, and be brief.

<P>
Don Cruickshank recommended that the Competition Commission should be the body to which the director general makes a report under this clause, and that Ministers should be taken out of the external scrutiny process.

<P>
We intend, therefore, to table amendments which will have the effect that if the director general finds that a rule or practice is significantly anti-competitive, he will report to the Competition Commission as well as to Ministers.

<P>
It will be the Competition Commission's responsibility to take a final decision on whether the regulating provision or practice is significantly anti-competitive. Taking the final decision will no longer be a job for Treasury Ministers. We believe this is right, given that the Competition Commission-

<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Atkinson. As far as I can tell, this applies to clause 132 and has little or nothing to do with clause 130.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. If the Minister were out of order, the Chair would intervene. Clearly some latitude is required on these matters if it will help the Committee. If the Minister goes on too long, the Chair will intervene, but that is at the Chair's discretion.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I shall be very tolerant and finish my remarks. I am trying to be helpful. If hon. Members do not want to hear it, they do not want to hear it. I am only trying to be helpful. I can stop speaking in an instant. Now, I am afraid that I have forgotten where I was.

<P>
<B>Vice-Chamberlain of Her Majesty's Household (Mr. Graham Allen):</B> Start from the beginning.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I shall not take the Whip's advice and start from the beginning.

<P>
The Competition Commission, not Ministers, has the necessary expertise to make the final decision. That fits well with its role under the Competition Act of hearing appeals against decisions taken by the director general and the utilities regulators.

<P>
If the commission finds that a rule is anti-competitive, the next stage in the process will be for it to reach a view on whether that rule is nevertheless justified by a permitted purpose. As I said, the permitted purposes are set out in clause 131. They relate to protecting the interests of financial services users, maintaining confidence in the financial system and ensuring compliance with international obligations.

<P>
Having come to a view, the Competition Commission will report it to Treasury Ministers, who will retain a right to override it. Obviously, I cannot foresee the future, but I do not envisage Ministers taking a different view from the Competition Commission, except in exceptional circumstances. That might, for example, arise if an anti-competitive rule was necessary to meet our international obligations.

<P>
However, it is important that Ministers retain the power to have the final say in this case. The reason for that is simple. The decision as to whether an anti-competitive provision or practice is justified is, at heart, a policy decision. Those involved in reaching a decision must make a trade-off between two different policy aims. The Competition Commission will be well placed to take a view, given its expertise on competition. As I said, I do not envisage that we will take a different view in the normal course of events. However, ultimately, responsibility for the trade-off between two competing policy aims must be a matter for Ministers; it is something for which we are accountable to Parliament.

<P>
The Competition Commission and the Office of Fair Trading support the proposals, as do the FSA and Don Cruickshank. As I said, we shall table amendments in due course to give effect to the proposals. In the meantime, I ask Opposition Members to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I want to ask the Minister one question and to make one observation. The Minister will recognise that she has done again what she did on the other clause-although, happily, more briefly. Hers is not the way in which to conduct a Committee. The proper way to do so in the present circumstances is to circulate material in advance so that we can study it. Instead, we have had to sit and listen to it being gabbled into the tape and will have to do our best to read it when it comes out in Hansard for our next meeting. I seriously ask the Minister to reconsider her approach and the Chancellor of the Exchequer to guide his Department on the way in which to introduce such matters. As I say, I have never known such things to happen before.

<P>
I want to ask the Minister one question about what she said, which I did my best to follow. I have read clause 130 and see that subsection (l)(a), which we are debating in relation to the amendment, has some bearing on subsection(3), which refers to the director general reporting to the Treasury that something does not, in his opinion, result

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``in the regulating provisions having a significant anti-competitive effect.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The Minister warned us not to muddle competition and competitiveness. To which does that phrase refer?

<P>

<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I want to ask the Minister two questions. First, will she confirm that I have understood the process correctly? The OFT will do its investigation and report to the Competition Commission, which will decide in principle whether it believes that something is anti-competitive. However, the Treasury, not the commission, has the power to implement the commission's decision.

<P>
Secondly, to return to the amendment, do the Government intend the proposed process to start immediately once the Bill is enacted and the various regulations flow from it? That is to say, the Office of Fair Trading will automatically be examining all the rules and regulations that the FSA starts issuing following the enactment of the Bill.

<P>
<H5>8 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> On the point about them being new, the clause does not cover rules that are reissued under transitional provisions. However the Director General of Fair Trading will have to keep all the rules and practices under an on-going review. The carry-forward rules are not therefore deemed to be approved by the director general and can be subject to scrutiny from the start.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I thank the Minister for clarifying the underlying point, but in view of the fact that there is going to be a redraft, we shall not pursue the matter. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 478, in page 60, line 7, leave out `may, if he thinks fit' and insert

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`shall'.
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
This is a straightforward amendment. Under the present draft the OFT is under no obligation to publish reports where it does not find anything that is damaging competition. We cannot see the reason for that degree of secrecy. It is healthy for the Treasury, the Competition Commission and everyone else to know that that is the case. The amendment requires the OFT to publish its report even when it finds that competition is not damaged.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> As I have said we will remove the requirement for the FSA to send the director general written notice when it changes a regulating provision. The amendment may well fall away in consequence.

<P>
I am not sure that we see any reason to change our approach but we will certainly consider the points made by the hon. Gentleman when we review the clause.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> We are happy to withdraw the amendment. We hope that the Government will heed our point that regulation is all about transparency: so let it be published. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
Clause 130 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<H4><center>Clause 131</center></H4>

<H4><center>Power of the Director to request information</center></H4>

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 479, in page 60, line 27, after `information', insert `relevant to the investigation'.

<P>
The clause empowers the OFT to get whatever information it wants from any person. We feel that that is too wide and that in all reasonableness it should be limited to what is relevant to the investigation that it is undertaking. Similarly, ``person'' is not defined and we assume that it includes the FSA itself. In the unlikely event that the FSA refused it would be in contempt of court and this is not a territory where the FSA should enjoy legal immunity.

<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for tabling the amendment. The clause gives the director general the powers he needs to carry out his investigations under clause 130. Those powers are clearly necessary if he is to investigate a matter properly. They replicate the powers given to the director general in section 123 of the Financial Services Act 1986. The powers are not aimed at the FSA which will, of course, co-operate with the director general, although there is nothing to stop him using those powers to order information from the FSA.

<P>
The powers are aimed mainly at authorised persons. In carrying out an investigation, the director general will need to investigate the effect of the FSA regulating provisions on competition. That cannot generally be done merely in the abstract. He will need to talk to those affected by the regulating provisions and, where necessary, have access to documents such as contracts that are affected or indeed come about as a result of the regulating provisions.

<P>
The director general is authorised under subsection (2) to require any person to produce any document that relates to the investigation. Under subsection (3) he may also require any person carrying on any business to disclose any information he may specify. The amendment would put an express limit on the information that the director general could require, that limit being information that is relevant to the investigation.

<P>
While I think that that is already the case, given that the director general will be under an obligation to act reasonably, I am happy to consider further whether we need an express reference to information relevant to the investigation as we have in subsection (2). On the basis of that assurance I hope that the hon. Gentleman will agree to withdraw his amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I thank the Economic Secretary. Given that undertaking, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<H4><center>Clause 132</center></H4>

<H4><center>Powers and duties of Treasury</center></H4>

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 480, in page 61, line 19, after `rules', insert `, principles or codes'.

<P>
I am not clear whether the amendment is needed given the proposed changes. However, the Treasury will apparently still have the power to alter the rules. The amendment would empower the Treasury to alter principles and codes, as well as rules, if it thought that competition was being damaged. The FSA's powers of regulation are expressed in not only rules but statements of principle and codes. That point of principle has arisen in a previous debate.

<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> As I have said, we shall change the procedures so that the director general will report to the Treasury and the Competition Commission. I am not convinced that the amendment is necessary. It would allow the Treasury to alter any code under the Bill or any principle issued under part V, as well as the rules. As the Committee will know, the Treasury can direct the FSA to take specified steps under clause 132(3)(a) to ensure that the significant anti-competitive effect of a regulating provision or practice is no greater than necessary for a permitted purpose.

<P>
In the case of rules and principles other than those under part V, which are also rules in this context, the Treasury can alter the rule under clause 132(3)(b), instead of directing the FSA to take specified steps. That is the same as the current position under the Financial Services Act 1986. It might be relatively simple for the Treasury to alter a rule. Rules tend to be free-standing texts and it would be easy for the Treasury to promulgate a change. However, changing codes or a principle issued under part V is unlikely to be straightforward because several changes might be required to different parts of the text-or, more likely, to the overall approach-to achieve the desired outcome. Therefore, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Although I appreciate the practical problems that the Economic Secretary has described, it is entirely illogical not to make it clear that the Treasury's powers relate to the various instruments by which the FSA regulates. In the unlikely event of the competition regulators and the Treasury concluding that competition is being damaged, it would be inappropriate for them to be empowered to change a rule, but not a statement of principle. The Economic Secretary undertook to reconsider the previous clause, and I ask her to look again at this provision.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> In response to the substantive point that the hon. Gentleman raises, I am happy to say that we shall reconsider the provision in deciding whether amendments are necessary to incorporate the Competition Commission into the review process.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> On that basis, I am happy to beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> Very briefly, I want to clarify my understanding of how the clause might change as a consequence of the press release. I do not want to go into too much detail, but to put it simply, the press release states that the Competition Commission will replace the Treasury's role under the clause and that that will be subject to ministerial override. In the debate on amendment No. 476 in clause 130, the Economic Secretary said that the ministerial override would be triggered only if, for example, an anti-competitive regulation was required to fulfil an international obligation. I tried to think of an example, but I could not do so. Will she elaborate on that comment?

<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I will elaborate briefly. I was arguing that the proposal might come into play when there were conflicting policy aims, and I could think only of the international example. However, I must reiterate what I said then, namely, that we cannot foresee the future. The override may be needed to deal with circumstances that we cannot presently anticipate.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The Economic Secretary did not respond to the first part of my hon. Friend's question. My presumption from her comments is that the Treasury, not the Competition Commissioner, will take action.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> Yes. If the Treasury concluded, for example, that the loss of competition went further than was necessary, it might direct the FSA to take action to rectify the situation or it could step in directly.

<P>

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> It would be helpful if the Economic Secretary could clarify one or two matters. I did not understand the changes that were made to clause 132, for reasons to which my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for North-East Bedfordshire and I have already alluded. Clause 133, in so far as I understand it, has been drafted in European terminology. It is designed to harmonise or to balance in language and substance European law and our approach to competition policy.

<P>
The two main planks of the continental system are embodied in the clause. They involve the abuse of the dominant position, or the monopoly power, and the prohibition of an agreement to distort competition, or the cartel power. As I understand it, those planks are all that European competition law rests on. The clause goes one small step further. It will retain part of the old regime that was created in the Fair Trading Act 1973, which involved the power to investigate complex monopolies. I hope that I have described the situation correctly.

<P>
The present position is that when the Competition Commission examines a complex monopoly, it is not permitted to take account of FSA rules or to judge whether those rules are in the public interest. The press release that the Economic Secretary discussed suggests, so far as I can tell, that it will be permitted to do so. That will toughen up the regime from the FSA's point of view. It appears that the FSA's discretion has been narrowed and that the Competition Commission's discretion has been widened. Have I understood the position correctly? The Economic Secretary's answer will help those who are trying to work out the practical effect of today's announcement.

<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> Yes, that is correct.

<P>
I shall briefly discuss the clause, which I hope will clarify our thinking to Opposition Members. All areas of the economy, including financial services, are potentially open to scrutiny by the competition authorities under the general competition legislation. The passage of the Competition Act 1998 strengthened that legislation. We are sure that that approach is correct, but it is essential to avoid any conflict between general competition law and the special competition regime that this part of the Bill will introduce. For example, if an authorised person took what appeared to be an anti-competitive action for no other reason than that he believed that he might make a profit, it would be right for his conduct to be investigated by the competition authorities.

<P>
If his action proved to be anti-competitive, he should be subject to investigation and sanction under the 1998 Act. However, if he could point to an FSA rule that compelled him to take the action, it would be wrong to punish him for a matter over which he had no choice. Of course, his action might still be regarded as unjustifiably anti-competitive. If so, the proper remedy would be to investigate the rule in question under powers granted by the clauses that we have just considered.

<P>
<H5>8.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
The present clause will provide that, when the Competition Commission investigates a possible monopoly under the powers of the Fair Trading Act 1973, it shall neither investigate nor report on the extent to which the FSA's regulating provisions or practices, or the behaviour of any authorised persons required or contemplated by them, might contribute to a monopoly or operate against the public interest.

<P>
As I said, we must ensure that there is no conflict between general competition law and our special regime. Don Cruickshank's report has revealed two problems with the current drafting of this and the following clause, and we shall table amendments to deal with them in due course. First, when the Competition Commission is investigating a monopoly under the Fair Trading Act 1973, it is undesirable for it to avert its eyes if a competition problem caused by FSA regulating provisions or practices is discovered. That could cause the Commission serious problems in making a proper assessment of the overall state of competition in a particular industry. If it cannot look at the full picture, it may not be able to suggest the best solutions. Therefore, we intend to remove the prohibition on the Competition Commission's considering and mentioning such matters in its reports.

<P>
Secondly, it is important that we get right the boundary between general and special competition regimes. Clearly, if a person is directed to do something by FSA rules, he or she should not be subject to enforcement action for anti-competitive behaviour. However, it is equally important that the exclusion should not cover actions that FSA regulating provisions do not require, and which the FSA itself perhaps did not intend, but which, arguably, were nevertheless encompassed by those provisions in some way.

<P>
Here, a tension between two important principles needs to be resolved. On one hand, we must ensure that FSA regulating provisions are clear and can be relied on with certainty by authorised persons. On the other hand, we do not want the FSA to be forced to regulate, and authorised persons to comply with its regulations, in an over-rigid, over-prescriptive manner. Therefore, we shall ask parliamentary counsel to look again at the words that are used to describe the boundary between general competition law and the special FSA competition regime. We have in mind that such action should not be subject to general competition law, but dealt with under the Bill, if-and only if-it were required, urged or legitimised by the FSA's regulating provisions or practices.

<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> The second half of the Economic Secretary's statement was directed not at clause 133, but at clause 134. If I may say so, that reflects our difficulty in considering the right clause at the right time. Clause 134 deals with exclusions, and has embodied in it the change in wording to which the Economic Secretary alluded.

<P>
I have one question relating to clause 134. With your permission, Mr. Atkinson, I am happy to ask it during consideration of clause 133.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Ask away.

<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> Clause 134(1) concludes by referring to

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the extent to which the agreement consists of provisions the inclusion of which is required or contemplated by any of the Authority's regulating provisions''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
Today's press release states that

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the conduct of financial services businesses is only excluded if it is required, urged or legitimised by FSA rules or practices''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The Economic Secretary has just quoted words to that effect. I have thought about how much tighter that formula is. I should be grateful if she could confirm that what we had before amounted almost to a general prohibition, and that what we have now is a very exceptional set of circumstances. Will she also elaborate on the extent to which the effect of clause 134 will be changed by the substitution of those important words?

<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I appreciate that some of my remarks also relate to clause 134, but there are many occasions in this complex Bill in which clauses interrelate with one another. Amendments frequently have to be tabled in different places in the Bill, and that is true in this case. In response to the point that the hon. Gentleman has just made, we shall obviously have to wait until an amendment has been drafted to get the exact words. We have not done that at this stage, and I cannot, therefore, give him any more clarification than I have already.

<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<P>

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I want to say, briefly, that, as with the previous clause, we shall need to take on board exactly the same points about the boundary between general competition law and the special competition regime here, and to make sure that that boundary is correctly defined. We propose to do that in the same way as I indicated for clause 133. I want to make it clear that those remarks apply to both clauses.

Question put and agreed to.
