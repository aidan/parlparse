<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001056000415"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Before we begin, I have a few preliminary
announcements. Members may, if they wish, remove their jackets during
Committee sittings, or, given the current weather, put on their
overcoats&#151;no hoodies though; I want to see who&#146;s who.
Please would all Members ensure that mobile phones, pagers and so on
are turned off or switched to silent mode during sittings. I remind the
Committee that there are money and Ways and Means resolutions connected
with the Bill, and they are here in the room. I also remind Members
that adequate notice should be given of amendments. To be eligible for
selection at a Tuesday sitting, amendments must be tabled by rise of
the House the previous Thursday, and for a Thursday sitting, amendments
must be tabled by the previous Monday. As a general rule, I and my
fellow Chairman do not intend to call starred
amendments.</div><a name="1001056000008"></a><div class="hs_Para">Not
everybody may be familiar with the process of taking oral evidence in
Public Bill Committees, so it might help if I briefly explain how we
will proceed. The Committee will first be asked to consider the
programme motion on the amendment paper, for which debate is limited to
half an hour. We will then proceed to a motion to report written
evidence, and then to a motion to permit the Committee to deliberate in
private in advance of the oral evidence sessions, which I hope we can
take formally. Assuming that the second of those motions has been
agreed to, the Committee will then move into private session and, once
it has deliberated, the witnesses and members of the public will be
invited back into the room and our oral evidence session will commence,
at around 11 am. If the Committee agrees to the programme motion, it
will hear oral evidence today and Thursday, and revert to the more
familiar proceedings of clause-by-clause scrutiny next week. I call the
Minister to move the programme motion standing in her
name.</div><a name="1001056000009"></a>

Hendry</b> (Wealden) (Con): We discussed the programme motion
previously and are broadly happy with that
arrangement.</div><a name="1001056000011"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="1001056000418"></a><b class="B">Simon
Hughes</b> (North Southwark and Bermondsey) (LD): Happy new
year to you, Mr. Bayley, and colleagues. I have no problem
in principle with the programme motion, but a practical issue arises
from the welcome fact that the Secretary of State is to make a
statement this afternoon on the Copenhagen summit, which is obviously a
matter of interest to all members of the Committee. It is scheduled to
be the second statement, which means that it will be at a slightly
uncertain time, but I would be grateful if the Committee would consider
allowing us to be present for that. I think that there is a general
interest, and it is highly relevant to what we are talking about. My
best advice is that it will not start until after 4
o&#146;clock&#151;probably more like 4.15 pm&#151;and I wonder if
we could therefore be prepared to adjourn this afternoon&#146;s
sitting to attend the statement and then return. That is not seeking a
change to the programme motion, but
accommodating&#151;</div><a name="1001056000012"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001056000419"></a>The
Chairman:</b> If the Committee wanted to do that we would have
to amend the programme motion. I am asking the Clerk to look at
that.</div><a name="1001056000013"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001056000420"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> I agree with the hon. Member for North Southwark
and Bermondsey. It would be in everybody&#146;s interest, and I was
going to ask to be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column3" />Column number: 3</div>excused from the Committee for that time and to leave my colleague in
his place. We would be happy if it were possible to make that
adjournment.</div><a name="1001056000014"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001056000421"></a>The
Chairman:</b> There is a practical problem, which is that we
have invited witnesses to come on the assumption that we are starting
at 4 o&#146;clock. Is it the best estimate that the statement will
start at about 4.15
pm?</div><a name="1001056000015"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001056000422"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> Probably. One never
knows.</div><a name="1001056000016"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001056000423"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> The practical solution, Mr. Bayley,
would be that we start with the witnesses at 5 pm instead of 4 pm. That
is the realistic implication, because by then the significant part of
the statement would be
complete.</div><a name="1001056000017"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001056000424"></a>The
Chairman:</b> It seems to me that that is what the Committee
wants to do, but the practical issue is that we have scheduled the
first group of witnesses this afternoon to begin at 4 o&#146;clock,
the second at 5 and the third at 6. It seems sensible to keep the Green
Alliance and WWF at 5 and Ofgem at 6. Does the Committee want to run an
hour later?</div>
<a name="1001056000018"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001056000425"></a>Simon

that today.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001056000427"></a>The

them, which suggests that the Committee meet at 4 pm this afternoon.

motion?</div>
<a name="1001056000021"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001056000428"></a>Joan

but perhaps if the three Front-Bench spokespeople were in attendance at
the statement, that would be to our satisfaction and not to the
detriment of the Committee.</div>

<a name="1001056000023"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001056000430"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> I cannot speak for colleagues; I was trying to
accommodate the general interest in ensuring that the statement was
well supported and well responded to. It is a practical suggestion, if
it works and if colleagues are unwilling to run
later&#151;</div><a name="1001056000024"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001056000431"></a>The
Chairman:</b> The practical problem is that we would have to
reschedule the witnesses and I cannot tell you whether that would be
possible. I think that the wisest course is to meet at 4 pm as proposed
in the programme motion, but to recognise that one Front Bencher from
each party&#151;including you, Mr. Weir&#151;may not be
present for the first hour of questioning.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001056000435"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Thank you all for coming to speak to us today.
Before calling Brian Binley to ask question one, I remind Members that
questions should be limited to matters within the scope of the Bill and
that we must stick strictly to the timings in the programme motion
agreed by the Committee. I hope I do not have to cut people off
mid-sentence, but I am required at 12 o&#146;clock precisely to bring
this panel to an end. As I have indicated to colleagues, we will work
through formal questions before I turn to the Front Benchers to see
whether they have further
questions.</div><a name="1001056000038"></a>

1</b><a name="1001056000436"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Brian Binley</b> (Northampton, South) (Con): Thank you,
Mr. Bayley. The panel will know that Professor Stuart
Haszeldine has described the CCS&#151;carbon capture and
storage&#151;competition as &#147;dead on its feet&#148;, with
only ScottishPower potentially being able to deliver by 2014. How
feasible is the Government&#146;s target of having a CCS
demonstration project up and running by
2014?</div><a name="1001056000039"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Rupert
Steele:</b></i> We are certainly happy that we can have a
working project for 2014. We have a test rig running at Longannet at
the moment, processing on a small scale. We have a had a significant
breakthrough there in reducing the energy required to operate it by
around a third, and those results are very encouraging. Provided that
everything proceeds effectively, we are confident that we can be there
for 2014.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column5" />Column number: 5</div><a name="1001056000040"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
2</b><b class="B"><a name="1001056000437"></a>Mr.
Binley:</b> The Government hope to have four demonstration
projects running by that time. Is that
feasible?</div><a name="1001056000041"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Rupert
Steele:</b></i> I think it would be difficult to have four
projects by 2014. I am not sure that that is the Government&#146;s
aspiration. I think they are saying four projects, the first by
2014.</div>
<a name="1001056000042"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001056000438"></a>Mr.
Binley:</b> It certainly is the aspiration to have four
projects running as a part of that
programme.</div><a name="1001056000043"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sara
Vaughan:</b></i> Ultimately,
yes.</div><a name="1001056000044"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
3</b><b class="B"><a name="1001056000439"></a>Mr.
Binley:</b> Can I finally ask whether you feel that the
Government will have the money available to fund the projects in the
way they
hope?</div><a name="1001056000045"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Rupert
Steele:</b></i> I think that part 1 of the Bill is intended
to achieve that. To the extent that a levy is raised, it can be spent
only on CCS. If the Government are prepared to accept the impact on
electricity prices as the costs are passed through to consumers, the
funding will be there. We certainly do not think that there will be any
difficulty in funding the demonstration projects that need to be funded
under the mechanism. We think it is a good mechanism that will allow
those very important projects to proceed without being constrained by
the difficult fiscal situation that is upon
us.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
4</b><a name="1001056000440"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Tobias Ellwood</b> (Bournemouth, East) (Con): Britain is
obviously involved in carbon capture and storage. Looking over your
shoulder, are you aware of any other projects around the world that are
at this level or ahead of us in the game, that we could use as a
successful example of a CCS
project?</div><a name="1001056000047"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sara
Vaughan:</b></i> Rupert mentioned his test rig in Scotland.
We are co-owners of the rig and are participants in that test. E.ON
operates across Europe and we have a number of test projects at pilot
stage. We are considering up to seven projects, some further along in
development than others. They vary in size, with the largest test, at
15 MW, quite considerable and others around 5 MW. We have a
number of different projects to look at different chemistry and
different technology to provide the best solution to take things
forward. We are also building a coal-fired station in Maasvlakte in the
Netherlands, which we hope to fit with carbon capture and storage. That
plant entered for European Energy Programme for Recovery
funding&#151;the Commission&#146;s funding&#151;and we are
confident that it was successful. While we remain committed to, and in
the competition for, the Kingsnorth project, we are also pursuing a
number of other avenues in order to get CCS off the
ground.</div>
<a name="1001056000048"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
5</b><b class="B"><a name="1001056000441"></a>Mr.
Ellwood:</b> I pose the question because there is a lot of
talk and positive inclination towards carbon capture and storage, but
it is a very new science. I was searching for evidence to say that it
is a workable solution. You are talking about continuing to do test
projects and pursuing various initiatives across Europe. Are you aware
of anywhere else outside your own interests that already has it up and
running?</div><a name="1001056000049"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sara
Vaughan:</b></i> I am sure you have already heard&#151;I do
not want to teach you what you already know&#151;about the fact that
there are a number of areas in which the different components of the
project are working separately. You will therefore see examples of
carbon capture and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column6" />Column number: 6</div>of carbon transport across the US, and you will see examples of
successful carbon storage. It is putting it all together, and doing so
on a certain scale, that, to my knowledge, have not been done to
date.</div>
<a name="1001056000050"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
6</b><b class="B"><a name="1001056000442"></a>Mr.
Ellwood:</b> Is that why you think, following on from the
question asked by my hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, South, it
is questionable as to whether we will be able to do this by
2014?</div><a name="1001056000051"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sara
Vaughan:</b></i> For our own part, the reason we are not
committing to the 2014 date is that our project has always been about
building a new super-critical coal-fired power station that has greater
efficiency than the existing sub-critical power station. We made an
announcement in October last year stating that, because of the
recession and the demand destruction that it has caused, the demand gap
that we expected to see in 2014 has now moved back to 2017. That means
that we have had to move the construction of the plant back, so, for
us, the 2014 date has followed that. However, the Government have made
announcements stating that the 2014 date is merely one of the criteria
that they will take into account when looking where to make awards in
the competition, so the fact that we cannot meet the date on our
timetable has not ruled us
out.</div><a name="1001056000052"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Nick
Winser:</b></i> May I pick up on a component that is dear to
National Grid&#146;s heart? We are working hard to develop the
mechanisms for piping the CO<span class="Sub">2</span>, which is often the least
discussed bit of this. One of the things that I think is worth bearing
in mind, looking at any future commercial framework, is the benefit of
building the pipes big enough, so that they are future proof and,
particularly where there might be an opportunity for a cluster of
emitters, we will not have to go back and build a second set of pipes.
It is important to think about
that.</div><a name="1001056000053"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sara
Vaughan:</b></i> I absolutely support
that.</div><a name="1001056000054"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
7</b><a name="1001056000443"></a><b class="B">John
Robertson</b> (Glasgow, North-West) (Lab): You mentioned the
Kingsnorth CCS tower and how it has been delayed. Five years ago at a
Scottish Committee, it was said that the earliest we could have a CCS
plant up and running properly would be 2025. With the four projects
that we are talking about going ahead, is there any likelihood at all
of reaching that 2025 deadline that the scientists said was the
earliest possible time we could expect up and running, fully functional
CCS?</div><a name="1001056000055"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sara
Vaughan:</b></i> 2025 for
four?</div><a name="1001056000056"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001056000444"></a>John
Robertson:</b> For one. We are not talking about projects; we
are talking about going on to the next
step.</div><a name="1001056000057"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Rupert
Steele:</b></i> I think 2025 is extremely unambitious as a
time frame. We are confident that we can be up and running in 2014 with
a full chain, including using some of Nick&#146;s pipes to move the
CO<span class="Sub">2</span> and working with Shell in the North sea to store it. As
long as the Government proceed with getting all the regulatory
arrangements in place, we will be there in 2014. I do not see why
others could not be there before 2020, so I would be disappointed in
the extreme if it took as long as 2025 to get anywhere with
this.</div>
<a name="1001056000058"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
8</b><b class="B"><a name="1001056000445"></a>John
Robertson:</b> Perhaps I could ask Sara Vaughan whether the
delays at Kingsnorth are an example of what is going to happen in years
to come. Will you give us some kind of solid promise that those things
are going to be in place and by a reasonable time?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column7" />Column number: 7</div><a name="1001056000059"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sara
Vaughan:</b></i> I am not in a position to give any solid promises, not
least because we still haven&#146;t had consent for the Kingsnorth
power station to go ahead, despite the fact that we put in the
application more than three years ago now, probably.</div>
<a name="1001056000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">If I speak to
my technical people, the engineers and the scientists who work in the
business on carbon capture and storage&#151;and there are a
considerable number of them in a number of different member
states&#151;they are all confident about the technology and the fact
that it will work. The areas that are more difficult are the political
support&#151;fortunately here in the UK we now have that political
support&#151;and the economics. The economics comes in two stages:
one is paying for the carbon capture and storage kit, and the other, at
the moment, is paying for the coal-fired power station to
justify that investment to fit the kit on to. Those are actually bigger
hurdles than the
technology.</div><a name="1001056000061"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
9</b><a name="1001056000446"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mike Weir</b> (Angus) (SNP): You have talked a lot about
competition, but the reality is that only ScottishPower and E.ON are
now involved. Can you tell us why other companies have dropped out?
Given the situation at Kingsnorth is there, in reality, a competition
going
on?</div><a name="1001056000062"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sara
Vaughan:</b></i> I think there is a competition. I hope
Rupert and I would agree that there is a competition. I made the point
earlier that as far as we see it, and we understand the Government see
it as well, the 2014 date is only one of the criteria. Rupert&#146;s
project is not fitting it on to a super-critical power station, which
we understood was one of the criteria. It would be fitted on to a
sub-critical power station, so I suppose from one perspective you could
say that neither of us meet all the criteria. From another perspective
you could say, &#147;Absolutely, we are head to head on it&#148;.
It is difficult for me to conjecture why the other players dropped out.
I think you are seeing somebody from RWE in the next session, so it may
be that they can answer that question better for
you.</div><a name="1001056000063"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
10</b><b class="B"><a name="1001056000447"></a>Mr.
Weir:</b> If 2014 is no longer the important criterion, we
were told that carbon capture and storage was essential to meet our
climate change targets. If you are now telling us that 2014 is
slipping, and might be slipping badly from what we hear, what does that
say about our ability to meet those
targets?</div><a name="1001056000064"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Rupert
Steele:</b></i> From our perspective, 2014 is still very much
on the table. We actually think that it is quite important to get on
with that, although both the Government and Opposition have come
forward with various proposals to make CCS mandatory for new plants.
That is extremely difficult with the level of knowledge we have of CCS
and its performance and costs at the moment. The only way that we are
going to solve that problem is by actually doing it. The sooner we do
it the sooner people will be in a confident position to think about
building new coal-fired power stations. So I think it would be a
tremendous lost opportunity if 2014 was allowed to
slip.</div><a name="1001056000065"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
11</b><a name="1001056000448"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Phil Willis</b> (Harrogate and Knaresborough) (LD):
Procrastination seems to be not only the thief of time. On this issue,
it appears to me that what the big power companies actually want is for
somebody else to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column8" />Column number: 8</div>foot the bill, so that at some future time you would make all the
profits. That is the reality of what we are talking about and that has
been the case for some considerable time. Picking up on John
Robertson&#146;s point, it is not simply about building a
demonstrator; the Bill is really about getting a demonstrator that
moves quickly into a fully fledged CCS-equipped plant. Given that the
European Commission has allocated some €165 million to a
possible CCS facility using the Yorkshire power stations, why are you
not jumping at that not only to use it as a demonstrator but to move
very quickly, post-demonstration, into a fully operational
post-capture, retrofit system?</div>
<a name="1001056000066"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sara
Vaughan:</b></i> The money that has been awarded to Hatfield
is for a pre-combustion rather than a post-combustion plant. Nick, are
you involved in that?</div>
<a name="1001056000067"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Nick
Winser:</b></i>
Yes.</div><a name="1001056000068"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sara
Vaughan:</b></i> My understanding is that that will go ahead.
It is a different technology, and one that certainly has a place in the
market. Indeed, before the Government said that they would support only
post-combustion, we were looking at doing a pre-combustion CCS station
at Killingholme, but we had to put that on hold when the Government
decided to support only
post-combustion.</div><a name="1001056000069"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Nick
Winser:</b></i> I can confirm that we are working with
Powerfuel at Hatfield. That is probably the most attractive opportunity
for clustering, which I think is the thrust of your question. In that
context, we would be seeking to set up the pipe network and in doing so
we are looking at the opportunity of not just building individual pipes
from each demonstrator, but trying to build larger pipes in a network,
which would allow a significant number of CCS plants to be
built.</div>
<a name="1001056000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is worth
remembering that of the order of 10 per cent. of the UK&#146;s
CO<span class="Sub">2</span> is emitted out of the Humber power stations and other
facilities. So if you can build a significant cluster there over a
period of time, there is a very big prize. One of the issues with the
CCS drafting in the Bill is that, in our view, it would be very nice if
it could be made broad enough, expansive enough and perhaps flexible
enough to encourage the roll-out of a significant network of
CO<span class="Sub">2</span> pipes to be there in some senses ready for a number of
power stations to connect in the Humber
valley.</div><a name="1001056000071"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
12</b><b class="B"><a name="1001056000449"></a>Mr.
Willis:</b> This is the point of my question. Would the three
of you support amendments to the Bill that widened its scope in order
to take in pre-combustion as well, to allow areas such as Yorkshire and
the Humber&#151;which are some of the most polluting areas in Europe,
never mind in Britain&#151;to be able to be fully
utilised?</div><a name="1001056000072"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sara
Vaughan:</b></i> I do not see that pre-combustion is
excluded. It was excluded from the first competition that was scoped
out by the Government, but they changed their policy to make it clear
that they would support up to four stations. I think they have now made
it clear that they will support pre and post and that pre is within the
ambit of the Bill as
drafted.</div><a name="1001056000073"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Nick
Winser:</b></i> We certainly think that two things could be
done to broaden this. First, it could enable a broader financial
mechanism to take forward not just some demonstration projects, but
commercial incentives to build projects thereafter in significant
clusters. That is a possible amendment that we would think was worth
considering. Secondly, there could be some broadening 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column9" />Column number: 9</div>to allow it look for the economies of scale of building fat pipes and
pipe networks. My own view is that we are probably going to need that
some time in the next few years. It may be that this is not the right
moment to put it in, but if this is not the moment, it may come quite
soon, because this area of technology will need quite a lot of
encouragement. It is a hugely important part of meeting the targets and
security of
supply.</div><a name="1001056000074"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sara
Vaughan:</b></i> I would echo that. I think the cluster point
and building for the future is an incredibly important point to bear in
mind. One of the things that we have discussed with the Government,
both in the context of the competition and more broadly, is that we do
not want to build a Kingsnorth-sized pipeline at Kingsnorth. We want to
build a pipeline that could take it if RWE were to build a coal-fired
power station next door. ScottishPower has a gas-fired power station
down there and, I think, is potentially looking to build another. In
the future we may well be capturing carbon from gas as well as coal.
Looking to the future and looking at Kingsnorth and the south-east,
where the demand is, we believe that that is another very apt place for
a cluster.</div>
<a name="1001056000075"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Rupert
Steele:</b></i> There is also scope for a cluster around the
central part of Scotland as
well.</div><a name="1001056000076"></a>

13</b><b class="B"><a name="1001056000450"></a>Mr.

is sufficient to deal with those issues?</div>
<a name="1001056000077"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Nick
Winser:</b></i> Yes, the amendments could either be added to
this Bill or come through another Bill, but, in the next couple of
years, to take this forward with real vigour we will need those broader
enabling powers in place.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
14</b><b class="B"><a name="1001056000452"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> I have a specific point on that: how many clusters
can the UK sustain? We have a project in the firth of Forth and the
Thames. That is difficult to put into a cluster, and there is obviously
the Humber in the middle. Is it reasonable for the UK to look at having
three clusters or should it be prioritising and saying that there can
be only
one?</div><a name="1001056000080"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Nick
Winser:</b></i> I think that it is reasonable to look at
three. It may be that, as we see the thing play out, it is clear that
we should prioritise one. But at this point, three is not
unreasonable.</div>
<a name="1001056000081"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sara
Vaughan:</b></i> You need to look at the present and the
future. While the Humber is, at present, probably the largest-emitting
area, if you look to the future it may be that many of those
businesses, industries and power stations that emit there will close
and other power stations will open elsewhere. We need to keep both in
mind.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
15</b><b class="B"><a name="1001056000453"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> On a more general question, can you help us to
understand how the competition has worked and not worked? Most of the
companies involved in bidding have pulled out and it is significantly
behind schedule on where it had hoped to be. What has gone well with
the consultation process and the bidding and what could have been done
better, so we can learn for the future?</div>

Steele:</b></i> It has been a long process. Part of that
comes from the nature of European public procurement law and the
processes that the Government have to go through to effect a legally
satisfactory procurement. It is a slow and difficult process and I know
that people in ScottishPower have found it quite challenging from that
point of view, but I think that that is inescapable.</div>
<a name="1001056000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">I sense that
there was some debate over a period about where the money was coming
from, which I think has been resolved by part 1 of the Bill, and that
may have affected the timetable. Hopefully, we are now very close to
the contracts for the feed studies being placed and, therefore, able to
go forward with a renewed sense of purpose. It is difficult for us to
speculate on why others have fallen by the wayside during the process.
I would say that the process has weeded out the serious proposals from
the less serious ones.</div>

<a name="1001056000087"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sara

to a greater or lesser extent, have done at the moment. I do not think
that it is perfect yet but that is probably the subject of another
question. They have not yet sorted out their position on CCS in
relation to gas. The policy paper on coal says that they have not made
decisions on that yet. I suspect the answer is that that is not in here
because the policy on it is not yet
settled.</div><a name="1001056000088"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
17</b><a name="1001056000456"></a><b class="B">Dr.
Alan Whitehead</b> (Southampton, Test) (Lab): Can I turn to
the method of funding CCS? You mentioned, Mr. Steele, that
the funding had been sorted out and is to be via the CCS levy. What
principles do you think should be applied in that levy? Should it be
market share? Should it be profit? Should it be turnover? How could it
be levied effectively and fairly?</div>
<a name="1001056000089"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Rupert
Steele:</b></i> We have some good precedents here because we
already have implicit levies for the renewables obligation for CERT,
the carbon emissions reduction target, and CESP, the community energy
saving programme. We have the social voluntary agreement and the
Government&#146;s proposals for feed-in tariffs. They all,
essentially, work on a market share basis. Some of them&#151;the ones
focused on the domestic markets&#151;tend to go by customer numbers.
The ones that relate to the market as a whole, which I think this would
be, go by megawatt hours.</div>
<a name="1001056000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">A flat levy is
the tried and tested route: it works very reliably because it is
reasonably stable. Although this week&#146;s weather may have
affected demand a little bit, over a year demand is relatively
predictable and therefore you know how much money you are going to
raise, which is very important. We think that trying to link it to
other things would inevitably complicate the tax base and effectively
make it unpredictable. The other thing is that if you tried to link it
to something such as carbon 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column11" />Column number: 11</div>content, you might find that the promoters of CCS projects, who tend to
be the people with coal-powered fire stations, would need to recover
more money in order for it to be viable for them to go ahead. So you
might end up slowing down the development of
CCS.</div><a name="1001056000091"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
18</b><b class="B"><a name="1001056000457"></a>Dr.
Whitehead:</b> So you are suggesting that this should be
universal? Should anyone be exempt from paying the levy&#151;such as,
for example, renewables suppliers?</div>
<a name="1001056000092"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Rupert
Steele:</b></i> Well, the renewables obligation does not
exempt renewables suppliers. I think that one of the problems that you
get into is that you get tangled up in working out what has happened to
the ROC, the renewables obligation certificate, and whether a
particular bit of electricity, as it is supplied, is renewable or not.
Obviously, we have a system for tracking that for the purposes of
advising people, on their bills, about where their energy comes from.
But it is pretty approximate. If you want to upgrade that system to a
standard that is good enough for fiscal purposes when hundreds of
millions of pounds are involved, then we need to rethink completely the
way we do those
calculations.</div><a name="1001056000093"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001056000458"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I think we should move on to social tariff
questions.</div>
<a name="1001056000094"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
19</b><b class="B"><a name="1001056000459"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> Obviously, the Government are moving in the Bill
from a voluntary system to a compulsory one. Do you accept that that is
because the voluntary system has
failed?</div><a name="1001056000095"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Rupert
Steele:</b></i>
No.</div><a name="1001056000096"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sara
Vaughan:</b></i> Not at
all.</div><a name="1001056000097"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Rupert
Steele:</b></i> The voluntary system has worked extremely
well. All the companies have complied with their commitments. They said
how much they were going to spend. The money has been spent and has
done a great deal of good. If this is going to be a permanent feature
of the energy market&#151;people clearly think it is going to
be&#151;I think it is completely appropriate to put it on a statutory
and formal basis. I think that the design of what is coming out of this
will be heavily helped by the valuable experience that we have had
running the voluntary system over the past couple of years, and that we
will have again next
year.</div><a name="1001056000098"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sara
Vaughan:</b></i> I very much agree with that. If you look at
Ofgem&#146;s report in relation to 2008-09 and the voluntary
agreement, you will see that, even though the target that was supposed
to be hit was &#163;100 million, &#163;157 million was actually
spent on social support. If you contrast that with the situation before
the voluntary agreement, where I think the figure was around
&#163;50 million a year, there has clearly been a great
deal of success in terms of the operation of the agreement. I agree
with Rupert, however, that you cannot just carry on rolling over
voluntary agreements. At some point, you have to formalise and put
those things on a statutory
footing.</div><a name="1001056000099"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
20</b><b class="B"><a name="1001056000460"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> So you both support the statutory footing,
although you do not think that, so far, the system has failed. Do we
therefore have a common definition? There are lots of debates about
fuel poverty, but, for the purpose of this one, are you prepared to
accept that the normal definition&#151;people spending more than 10
per cent. of their income on their fuel bills&#151;is the right one
and should be the backdrop to the debate about what we do next and what
we seek  to achieve?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column12" />Column number: 12</div><a name="1001056000100"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sara
Vaughan:</b></i> It is, as you say, the accepted definition.
When we look at people in fuel poverty, we tend to distinguish between
those in fuel poverty and those in severe fuel poverty, by which I mean
those who spend more than 20 per cent. of their income on heating their
homes. There are probably around half a million homes in that situation
in England. I think the priority in the first instance should be to
help those in severe fuel poverty, many of whom will also have been in
fuel poverty for a long
period.</div><a name="1001056000101"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Rupert
Steele:</b></i> The Bill clearly uses the statutory
definition of fuel poverty, which is rather different from the 10 per
cent. definition. It essentially talks about people having difficulty
heating their homes. On of the problems with the 10 per cent.
definition is that it under-rates the impact of income initiatives on
dealing with fuel poverty and therefore potentially distorts policy.
For example, an initiative that increases somebody&#146;s income by
an amount equal to half their fuel bill may not be sufficient to take
them out of fuel poverty, but a 10 per cent. reduction in their fuel
bill might be. That distortion means that, if we are going to stick
with that definition, we need to be aware of its deficiencies. I think
that it would be good in time for people to see whether the definition
could be improved, because it is defective in that particular
respect.</div><a name="1001056000102"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
21</b><b class="B"><a name="1001056000461"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> Thank you. I may want to return to that, but may I
now ask about the cost? The implication of the legislation is that the
amount spent on social tariffs might be increased. Consumer Focus has
estimated that, in the past year, across the board, your companies
spent half a per cent. of your turnover on social tariffs. What was the
figure in cash terms and what was the percentage in your spend terms
for the last full year for which you have the figures? Moreover, what
will the Bill&#146;s implication be in relation to how much you
expect it will cost you for the first year of the compulsory system, in
terms of both cash and
percentage?</div><a name="1001056000103"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Rupert
Steele:</b></i> I cannot give you the full numbers off the
top of my head, but what I can say is that this year our target was
&#163;10 million, give or take a few bob, and that we spent it in
full. The Government have said that they are targeting a total cost, in
a few years&#146; time under this system, of &#163;300 million.
They announced that in the pre-Budget report. Our company has a 10 per
cent. market share, so that would be a spend of &#163;30 million.
What proportion it will be of people&#146;s fuel bills will depend on
what energy prices
are.</div><a name="1001056000104"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sara
Vaughan:</b></i> Comparable figures. Our voluntary agreement
target for the latest year we have figures for, which is 2008-09, was
&#163;15 million&#151;a little bit larger than
Rupert&#146;s&#151;and we spent &#163;20.1 million. So we
overspent by &#163;5 million. That approximated at about &#163;2.80
per customer account that we have, which was actually the second
highest spend of the big six suppliers. I do not have a percentage, I
am afraid, but I would agree with Rupert&#146;s maths on the scaling
up to
300.</div><a name="1001056000105"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001056000462"></a>The

bring in on this
topic.</div><a name="1001056000106"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001056000463"></a>Simon

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
22</b><b class="B"><a name="1001056000465"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> One of the other definitional questions is,
&#147;Which groups should be included?&#148; Chronic illness is a
suggestion, as well as old age. Can you give us your wisdom as to the
categories that should benefit, including on the controversial
issue&#151;if you wish to comment on it&#151;of whether everybody
of pensionable age should
benefit?</div><a name="1001056000109"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Rupert
Steele:</b></i> I think the most important thing is that we
need to be able to find the people who we give the benefits to, and so
whatever definition you have needs to be a group of people that
somebody can identify. For example, we are in the process of doing a
pilot based on people over a certain age on the pension credit
guarantee. DWP is going to send us the data file and we will then apply
the credits to those people&#146;s accounts. We have a reasonable
degree of confidence that we will be able to get the benefit to the
people
concerned.</div><a name="1001056000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
somebody who is seriously ill, I think the question would be,
&#147;How do we know, and what is the process for managing
that?&#148; If you can find a process, I think we would be happy to
accommodate anybody, bearing in mind that the more people you put in
the basket the less each person will
get.</div><a name="1001056000111"></a>

I just respond to the question? In terms of the people who we believe
should receive assistance, we would probably look at the core group
that we think should receive assistance on an enduring basis. That is
formed of those people who are least able to react to the sorts of
shocks in fuel prices that are likely to come their way, inevitably as
a result of things such as feed-in tariffs, renewable heat incentives
and CCS levies coming in. They are likely to be the sorts of people who
are on fixed incomes, such as the elderly, who may well need support

social price support in addition to that. Our own fuel poverty

27</b><a name="1001056000473"></a><b class="B">Anne
Main</b> (St. Albans) (Con): Thank you. I noted with interest,
Mr. Steele, that you said it was about finding people to
ensure that they get the support they may need. Would you then support
the provision in clause 10 of the Bill to allow a redistributive
mechanism to recognise that some suppliers have more people eligible
for social tariffs? Secondly, do you think that having all these
different targets&#151;of people who are elderly, chronically sick
and so on&#151;is going to be so complex that it may be unworkable? I
am a little concerned about whether we are going to get it focused
enough and I would like your view on
that.</div><a name="1001056000125"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Rupert
Steele:</b></i> On the first question, on the reconciliation
mechanism, it is crucial to this kind of endeavour to ensure that these
customers remain attractive to us to supply. The last thing that we
want is a situation where we would rather our competitors supplied
these customers. The incidence of this kind of customer might vary
between companies and the reconciliation mechanism protects companies
against that effect, so that we have an incentive to go out and find
these customers and continue to give them the best possible
opportunities to be with us.</div>
<a name="1001056000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
essential to have a reconciliation mechanism that can work either
through the mechanism in clause 10 or a provision in clause 9 regarding
spending targets that would have a similar effect. One way or another,
it is really important that we have an incentive to service these
customers. Otherwise, people will inevitably look for sales channels
that do not tend to pick up old age pensioners, and that would be a
disaster. That is the first question.</div>
<a name="1001056000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">Is it going to
get too complicated? Not if we can help it. We spend a lot of time in
discussion with the Department to ensure that the proposals are

always  ask. We will work with the Government to make sure it
is feasible.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
28</b><b class="B"><a name="1001056000474"></a>Anne
Main:</b> I would like to go to Ms Vaughan on that point. You
said that there were customers who could be helped in certain
ways&#151;some with more installation, others with the billing. Do
you think that billing has been addressed enough in the Bill, so
that&#151;rather than it being in legislation&#151;customers can
have information about how to help themselves and about how you can
help
them?</div><a name="1001056000129"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sara
Vaughan:</b></i> All suppliers, certainly my own company,
work very hard with their customers to inform them about how they can
reduce their bills through taking out energy-efficient measures: loft
insulation, cavity wall insulation, low-energy light bulbs and all
sorts of other methods by which they can reduce their bills. That is
something that we see as an absolutely fundamental part of a
sustainable answer to fuel poverty. It is not just about throwing money
at the issue. It is about finding a long-term solution to
it.</div>
<a name="1001056000130"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001056000475"></a>The
Chairman:</b> We should move on to the question of
Ofgem&#146;s powers. Mike Weir, you were going to kick off on
that.</div><a name="1001056000131"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
29</b><b class="B"><a name="1001056000476"></a>Mr.
Weir:</b> What impact will the provisions in clauses 16 and
17, which require Ofgem to take into account carbon emissions and
security of supply, have on how Ofgem
works?</div><a name="1001056000132"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Nick
Winser:</b></i> For our part, we are very supportive of that
change. We think that its effect will&#151;hopefully&#151;be for
Ofgem to feel that it has a remit to look further ahead and to look to
mechanisms that will drive towards a low-carbon, secure and affordable
system in the future. So, it seems to us to be a thoroughly worthwhile
amendment.</div>
<a name="1001056000133"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
30</b><b class="B"><a name="1001056000477"></a>Mr.
Weir:</b> One of the great arguments has been on the question
of transmission charges and their impact on renewables. Do you think
that putting those under Ofgem&#146;s regulation will mean that it
will take a different view on issues such as these? Will it impact to
that extent, or is it more of an aspirational thing for the future, as
you seem to
imply?</div><a name="1001056000134"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Nick
Winser:</b></i> Many decisions are made by Ofgem on a whole
variety of financial arrangements around the industry. I believe that
those sorts of changes will probably impact on some of them and not on
others. On the transmission charging question, I doubt that this will
impact on transmission charging tariffs. Essentially, I think
Ofgem&#146;s view&#151;although you would have to ask
it&#151;would be that if there was to be a further subsidy introduced
by not charging the full cost of transmission, it would be better for
it to be introduced in an explicit way, rather than through the back
door of the transmission charging arrangements. However, I am aware
that you might not entirely agree with that point of
view.</div><a name="1001056000135"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
31</b><b class="B"><a name="1001056000478"></a>Mr.
Weir:</b> We could have an interesting argument on that one.
Moving on, specifically to national grid, clauses 18 to 25 introduce a
market power licence condition, strengthening Ofgem&#146;s power to
investigate sanctions in respect of abuse of the market. Can you
explain how the current system of balancing transmission-related
constraints gives electricity generating companies an opportunity to
abuse their market position? To what extent is that being
done?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column16" />Column number: 16</div><a name="1001056000136"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Nick
Winser:</b></i> The fact of the matter, the issue that that
seeks to tackle, is that at any time on an economically run
transmission system it is probably right for there to be a degree of
constraint. That means that you do not build, economically, a system
that for every minute of the year can transport all power from any
point on the system to any other point on the system. That is probably
not an economic thing to do. Nevertheless, it is well worth having a
very robust transmission system that can get quite close to
that.</div>
<a name="1001056000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">You would
expect, naturally, occasionally to have places that you cannot move
power from. For example, if you get a certain configuration of lots and
lots of power stations wanting to run in one particular area for one
short part of the year, it might be economic not to be able move for
that power. The cost then comes from bringing on power stations, which
might be more expensive elsewhere, to displace the ones that cannot run
fully. So I think that it is generally accepted, at least in principle,
that that is a sensible way to run the industry.</div>
<a name="1001056000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
significance of this now is that the industry will go through massive
change through the sources of electricity generation. The network will
therefore need to have very significant investment. Why is that?
Because we see the future as probably having large amounts of power
generated a long way from where it is consumed&#151;probably to a
greater degree than it is today. Even after you have all the energy
efficiency that we need, which is very significant, and lots of local
distributed generation, there will still probably be a requirement for
an increase in the amount of power that has to move in bulk from
offshore and around the coast to the load centres.</div>
<a name="1001056000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">Anyway, there
are probably cases where you would expect occasionally to have monopoly
positions in the system. In this phase of change, going forward, which
is going to be rapid with an awful lot of investment, the key to
solving this problem is for us to be able to invest vigorously in the
system and get the right system built. That is why we can be very
supportive of the Planning Bill that came in last year. We worked very
hard with Ofgem to try to make sure that we build enough transmission
quickly enough at all times. So that is the solution that we should be
aiming for, and most of our attention should be focused on making sure
we build enough transmission.</div>
<a name="1001056000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">Even with all
that said, there will probably still be significant amounts of monopoly
positions. Clearly, there is existing legislation that can control
that, such as the Competition Act 1998 and other competition
legislation. It is Ofgem&#146;s view&#151;or certainly the
Government&#146;s view, having talked to Ofgem&#151;that some
enhancement to that may be required. I am probably not competent to
judge whether that is the case. However, focusing on that issue, there
will naturally be some monopolies and probably in the next 10 or 15
years those monopoly positions may increase. If the view is that
existing competition legislation is not sufficient, then the National
Grid has no objection to
that.</div><a name="1001056000141"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001056000479"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I am going to turn now to John Robertson. I said
that at a quarter to 12 I would run around the Front Benchers to see
whether they had any further questions. If we have some time left I may
come to other colleagues who want to ask about these regulatory
matters.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column17" />Column number: 17</div><a name="1001056000142"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
32</b><b class="B"><a name="1001056000480"></a>John
Robertson:</b> I want to come back to a question that Mike
Weir asked and which I do not think you answered. To what extent have
the companies exploited the
system?</div><a name="1001056000143"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Nick
Winser:</b></i> From a National Grid perspective, we do not
do analysis of what would constitute exploitation of monopoly
positions. The regulator has done several investigations over the last
20 years into this. These are very complicated calculations because
these are very capital-intensive plants which last for a long time. So
as an observer of the regulator&#146;s reports on this&#151;and
they date right back to Professor Stephen Littlechild in the early
&#146;90s&#151;I know that these are difficult calculations. It is
work that is done by Ofgem and not by the National Grid and therefore I
would not seek to give an answer. It is quite a complicated thing to
work out and it is not part of our remit to work it out, frankly. It is
a matter for
Ofgem.</div><a name="1001056000144"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sara
Vaughan:</b></i> May I just come
in?</div><a name="1001056000145"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
33</b><b class="B"><a name="1001056000481"></a>John
Robertson:</b> I am sorry, Sara. I want to ask Rupert a
question because his company is one of the companies that were
investigated in the past, along with Scottish and Southern Energy,
following the allegations that they had supplied electricity to
National Grid at excessive prices. This did not go forward under the
Competition Act, mainly because of the time constraint; basically, they
were not sure whether we would get a result on it. Do you think the
market power licence condition that is going to be introduced in
clauses 18 to 25 will allow the Bill to provide a fair and
proportionate means of dealing with these kinds of alleged
abuses?</div><a name="1001056000146"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Rupert
Steele:</b></i> We were indeed investigated under the
Competition Act. The regulator closed that investigation without an
adverse finding against us. It muttered various reasons, but the
fundamental fact is that it did not believe that it had a case against
us that it wished to pursue, having investigated the matter thoroughly
and with our full co-operation. We should not start from a principle
that, as it were, we were guilty because we were investigated when the
conclusion was to close the investigation without an adverse
finding.</div><a name="1001056000147"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
34</b><b class="B"><a name="1001056000482"></a>John
Robertson:</b> And the market power licence
condition?</div><a name="1001056000148"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Rupert
Steele:</b></i> Do I think that the market power licence
condition is a good idea? I am cautious about it because the balancing
mechanism is the thing that ultimately signals the need for investment
in the network&#151;in the power generators and generation plants. By
potentially muffling those signals, this condition could have a
negative impact on the provision of time and investment. We would like
to see the clause amended to require the Secretary of State to consider
and form the opinion that any initiative that he takes under this
condition will not adversely affect investment in the
sector.</div>
<a name="1001056000149"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001056000483"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I must turn now to the Front Benchers.</div>
<a name="1001056000150"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
35</b><b class="B"><a name="1001056000484"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> Going back to the carbon capture element, the
objective of the Bill must surely be to make Britain one of the most
attractive places in the world for CCS development. We have the skills
in the North sea, we have the sequestration sites and we have the need.
Does the Bill on its own move us from where we are&#151;I would argue
that we are lagging globally&#151;to being in a position where we
will be natural leaders? 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column18" />Column number: 18</div>Does it give you, particularly the two companies with foreign parentage,
the ability to go to your boards in Germany and Spain and say,
&#147;This now does enough to make Britain the most attractive place
to
invest&#148;?</div><a name="1001056000151"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sara
Vaughan:</b></i> We still have a number of concerns around
the policy. It relates back first of all to something that does not
actually appear in the Bill, which is around the policy that was
announced on coal-fired generation. The Government said that they will
conduct a rolling review of whether the technology is economically and
technically feasible, and it will report in 2018. At that point, if it
is not, they will fall back on some undefined contingency
regime.</div>
<a name="1001056000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">That amount of
uncertainty makes it very difficult for anybody to make any investment
at all before 2018, because you do not know what it is that you are
trying to hit and you do not know what it is that you might be subject
to if you do not hit it. That is something that does not appear in the
Bill. On the face of the Bill itself, we are encouraged by the fact
that a power has been put in, effectively to fund retrofit of CCS to
stations when they have had a demonstration at that station, but it is
only a power.</div>
<a name="1001056000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">You might go
ahead and invest in your very expensive coal-fired power station with
its demonstration&#151;we are talking billions of pounds
here&#151;and then at some date in the future you might be told to
retrofit CCS to it. If the market at that point will support it through
the EU emissions trading scheme, or otherwise, that is fine, but if
not, you are relying on a potential power that at that point may or may
not be exercised to fund the retrofitting. That raises a large number
of uncertainties that people will have to take into account before
investing.</div><a name="1001056000154"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
36</b><b class="B"><a name="1001056000485"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> Do you think that primary legislation is needed to
address those issues or can it be done through different policy
announcements or secondary legislation?</div>
<a name="1001056000155"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sara
Vaughan:</b></i> The first point could be dealt with through
policy announcements. Whether those would then have to be backed up by
primary legislation would depend on exactly what the policy looked
like.</div><a name="1001056000156"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Rupert
Steele:</b></i> From our point of view, part 1 of the Bill is
excellent. We have suggested to one or two people that it would be nice
to have a clause to make sure that the exceptions to the levy do not
affect competition. But, substantially, we think that part 1 of the
Bill provides everything that is needed to create a really solid regime
that will make CCS very attractive financially as something to develop
in the UK. Clearly, it is not everything that we need. For one thing,
it depends on what schemes Ministers write under the powers presented.
They could be schemes that are effective or schemes that are
ineffective.</div>
<a name="1001056000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
there is a whole regulatory system around the storage of the
CO<span class="Sub">2</span>. A consultation on that has just closed. We do not know
what the Government will finally decide on that. So there is a lot of
work still to do in the political sphere before this is done, but this
is a huge step forward to making the UK an attractive place for people
to develop
CCS.</div><a name="1001056000158"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
37</b><b class="B"><a name="1001056000486"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> Okay. On a different part of the Bill, can I ask
your views on clause 27, &#147;Adjustment of charges to help
disadvantaged groups of customers&#148;, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column19" />Column number: 19</div>which gives the Secretary of State power to make a regulation to require
charges to be adapted if, in his view, some customers are being treated
less favourably than others? Are you anxious about the very open-ended
nature of that or is that something you are comfortable with and think
is an important move
forward?</div><a name="1001056000159"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Rupert
Steele:</b></i> A version of this has existed in the
Utilities Act 2000 and has not been used, so I guess on that basis it
has not been a problem to date. The thing that you would need to look
at if you were actually going to utilise these powers would be the
effect on the market and on other consumers. It may be that the powers
in part 2 of the Bill on fuel poverty are a more effective way of
dealing with that, combined with the non-discrimination powers that
have been taken by Ofgem pursuant to the probe.</div>
<a name="1001056000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not sure
that we have a great concern about these being in reserve on the
statute book, although there is a clause that says that if the
Secretary of State does not know any data, he can make it up.
<i class="I">[Interruption.]</i> It is clause 27(7). We have suggested that that
might be augmented with some obligations on the Secretary of State to
give his reasons and generally be a bit more thorough about
it.</div><a name="1001056000161"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
39</b><b class="B"><a name="1001056000490"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> I should like to ask one question on CCS and one
on charges. On CCS, there is an argument that says that, given
developments in the States and elsewhere, the technology will be
developed in other countries and it is nonsense for us to replicate
other efforts and spend all the money here, because we will be able to
benefit from other countries and other companies&#151;your
companies&#151;elsewhere doing the same. Is there a real need in your
mind for us to proceed to develop CCS, to have the funding and to work
through the technology on UK
land?</div><a name="1001056000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">You
have talked about the uncertainties, but is it not better just to be
told from the beginning, and should not the Bill tell you, that all new
coal-fired power stations will have to have CCS? Would that not give
you much better certainty than this possible retrofitting
later&#151;this equivocation&#151;that is the policy at the
moment?</div><a name="1001056000166"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sara
Vaughan:</b></i> I think I would answer that in a number of
ways. I mentioned before that, across Europe, E.ON is doing a number of
pilot projects. We are hoping as a group to learn from all those and to
be able to take what we learn and bring it back into the UK. One point
that we always made about Kingsnorth was that we did not build it as a
CCS testing bed, but we built it&#151;we wanted to do
so&#151;because the UK needed coal-fired power generation. We are
still of that view and the Government are clearly of that view as well,
as coal-fired power generation with CCS is part of the mix. Therefore
we should be looking to develop that in the UK and drawing on all the
know-how that we can possibly get from across Europe and elsewhere to
expedite that as much as we can.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column20" />Column number: 20</div><a name="1001056000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">The UK is
actually very well placed for CCS because of the offshore gas fields
that we have as CCS storage&#151;much better than Germany, for
example, where they have been having issues with onshore storage. I
certainly do not think that the UK should sit back and wait for
somebody else to do it. I think that we should power forward and do it
ourselves.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001056000491"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I have no discretion to extend this part of the
sitting beyond 12 o&#146;clock, so I turn to the
Minister.</div>
<a name="1001056000169"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
40</b><b class="B"><a name="1001056000492"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change
(Mr. David Kidney):</b> I have two issues to raise
on social price support. First, the energy companies usually get
nothing but brickbats, so I say thank you for taking part in the data
matching pilot that is to take place this year. Thank you also for
overspending on the voluntary agreements&#151;the extra &#163;57
million in year 1; keep it up! On that point, what does each of your
companies do under the voluntary agreement other than offer a social
tariff?</div><a name="1001056000170"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Rupert
Steele:</b></i> In our case, we support the ScottishPower
Energy People Trust, a body that conducts a number of local
initiatives, including things such as benefit entitlement checks; for
every pound that we spend on that, &#163;20 on unclaimed benefits is
identified. We also support the home energy heat helpline. We have a
number of initiatives with people who are on Fuel Direct, who have
large debts, and we have reassessed some of those. There has been a
variety of measures aimed at achieving the most that we could for fuel
poverty with the sum of money available.</div>
<a name="1001056000171"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001056000493"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> And you,
Sara?</div><a name="1001056000172"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sara
Vaughan:</b></i> We provide energy efficiency measures as
part of our Warm Assist tariff. In partnership with Age Concern, we
also pay cold weather payments to the elderly when the temperature
drops below a certain level. We have a caring energy hardship fund, a
trust fund similar to the one that Rupert was talking about. We also
offer benefit checks and a number of other initiatives. It is about
advice, support and positive measures as well as just being about
discounts off
bills.</div><a name="1001056000173"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
41</b><b class="B"><a name="1001056000494"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> Sara, how does the reconciliation mechanism
benefit your company if the measure is in kilowatt-hours rather than
customer account
numbers?</div><a name="1001056000174"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Sara
Vaughan:</b></i> It is not about benefiting our company. It
is actually about making the provision&#151;the pass-through, if you
like&#151;less regressive and more progressive on the basis of the
figures that we have seen. The way that it works at the moment is as a
flat-rate pass-through. It is like a tax; if it is &#163;23, it is
&#163;23 whether your bill is &#163;600 or &#163;300. If you look
at somebody who is a low user or if you look at a typical fuel-poor
customer whose usage tends to be lower, then it may account for 10 per
cent. of their bill, whereas it will account for only 3 per cent. of
the bill of a higher user&#151;and the customer who has a higher
income.</div>
<a name="1001056000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">What we
propose is that instead of it being on a flat-rate basis it should be
on a per-unit basis. Therefore, those fuel-poor customers who use less
energy would end up paying less as a proportion of their total bill. It
is not about benefiting E.ON at all; E.ON still ends up 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column21" />Column number: 21</div>effectively bearing the same costs. It is about making it a more
progressive and less regressive tax. That is something that Ofgem and
DECC have both picked up on in recent consultations as
well.</div>
<a name="1001056000176"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001056000495"></a>Simon

<a name="1001056000177"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001056000496"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Simon, you have about 50 seconds and counting
before the chopper comes down.</div>
<a name="1001056000178"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
42</b><b class="B"><a name="1001056000497"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> Clause 26 proposes allowing Ofgem to impose
penalties on companies over a five-year period rather than a one-year
period. Would you have any objection if that allowed complaints already
lodged, or arising from issues that have already happened, to be
investigated for five years&#151;that is, it would not be simply
prospective, but would deal with issues that have already
arisen?</div><a name="1001056000179"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001056000498"></a>The

horror, because of retrospective penalties.</div>
<a name="1001056000181"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Rupert

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001056000501"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Thank you very much for coming to meet and talk
with us today. I call Brian
Binley.</div><a name="1001056000189"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
43</b><b class="B"><a name="1001056000502"></a>Mr.
Binley:</b> Just to prove that this is not a game of two
halves, I shall ask questions similar to those that I asked in the
first part of the sitting. I would like to know from each of you how
feasible the Government&#146;s target is of having a CCS
demonstration project up and running by 2014. I do not care who kicks
off.</div><a name="1001056000190"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr.
Keith MacLean:</b></i> I reiterate what Rupert said. There is
a possibility there. In overall terms, we need to be moving as quickly
as possible to a collaborative rather than competitive approach on a
lot of these things. You heard the evidence earlier about the need to
have the supporting infrastructure, the transportation infrastructure
and the grouping of the projects. We 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column22" />Column number: 22</div>would make much quicker progress if we all sat down and tried to work
out how best to do all these things together, rather than pursuing a
pure competition approach.</div>
<a name="1001056000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having said
that, all the work has been done on that project. If ScottishPower is
confident in the 2014 time scale for that, I think it is realistic, but
our interest would be in the other three coming along and how quickly
that can happen. Working in collaboration will take us much faster
towards realisation than competition
will.</div><a name="1001056000192"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Mannering:</b></i> We answer the question by asking what the
two key stages are in building a new plant. They would be how long it
takes to get all the planning consents necessary and then how long it
takes to build the plant once you have the planning consents. If it
takes four to five years to build the plant and it is a case of how
long is a piece of string to get the planning consents, I guess one
would be looking at a minimum period of about seven years, so 2017
would probably look more
realistic.</div><a name="1001056000193"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
44</b><b class="B"><a name="1001056000503"></a>Mr.
Binley:</b> But in seriousness, we have been talking about
this issue for some time. Is that really a viable answer to give us
when you should have been working on this some time
ago?</div><a name="1001056000194"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Mannering:</b></i> It would be a viable answer for any of the
new demonstration projects under the extended competition, because we
do not have any details about how that would work
yet.</div><a name="1001056000195"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001056000504"></a>Mr.
Binley:</b> Any other
comments?</div><a name="1001056000196"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Philip
Davies:</b></i> Centrica is not currently actively developing
CCS projects, so it is probably best for me to defer to my competitors
on this, although I would say that the time scales do look
challenging.</div><a name="1001056000197"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Love:</b></i> Equally, EDF Energy is not part of any of the
pilot projects in the UK, although we do have some parts in
demonstration projects across Europe. On the timings, is 2014 feasible?
Again, Rupert was very confident from a ScottishPower perspective. I
just echo David Mannering&#146;s comments. A lot of joined-up policy
is needed to get these major infrastructure projects going&#151;the
planning, all the permissions you need, as well as supply chain issues.
We are obviously involved in new nuclear in a big way in the UK. That
is our main focus. There are similar issues there; trying to get
planning and joined-up thinking from various Government Departments
will be vital to get that
sorted.</div><a name="1001056000198"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
45</b><b class="B"><a name="1001056000505"></a>Mr.
Binley:</b> Is the real truth that you really did not want to
get involved in this rather frontier, pioneering stuff and you wanted
other people to do it? What other factors made you decide not to be
involved in the competition?</div>
<a name="1001056000199"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr.
Keith MacLean:</b></i> We were at a very advanced stage of a
project with BP from several years ago which, as you heard in the first
part of the sitting, was not allowed into the competition because it
was a pre-combustion project with gas. There was no shortage of
ambition to move forward with this technology. The limitations that
were put on through the competition rather stifled
it.</div><a name="1001056000200"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Philip
Davies:</b></i> Similarly, we were involved in the earlier
phase, looking at pre-combustion technology, which we have not pursued,

To come back to the point about the decision about pre-combustion

46</b><b class="B"><a name="1001056000506"></a>Mr.
Ellwood:</b> Looking at the statistics, the amount of
electricity that you supply, whether by coal or otherwise, is
impressive from the UK perspective. Therefore it is quite sad that you
have not been able to embrace this opportunity to participate in carbon
capture and storage. You obviously have your own reasons and you have
illustrated some of those now. They seem to hinge round the concern
about pre-combustion. If the Bill were to be amended so that funding
could apply to pre-combustion, although there is a question as to
whether it is the Bill itself or just the intention from a retrofit
perspective, would that change your stance at
all?</div><a name="1001056000203"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr.
Keith MacLean:</b></i> Again, as was said in the first part
of the sitting, the Bill does not exclude pre-combustion for the
remaining three of the four. It was the original competition for the
first of those four which eliminated pre-combustion. We would certainly
be hopeful that there is scope within the funding mechanism laid down
in the Bill to support at least one project with
pre-combustion.</div><a name="1001056000204"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
47</b><b class="B"><a name="1001056000507"></a>Mr.
Ellwood:</b> How do the other panellists
feel?</div><a name="1001056000205"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Philip
Davies:</b></i> It is possible. We would have to look at the
options, but I think I would agree with the comment that was
made.</div><a name="1001056000206"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
48</b><b class="B"><a name="1001056000508"></a>Mr.
Willis:</b> This is really important. Does the Bill as
currently drafted give sufficient encouragement and an appropriate
regulatory framework for pre-combustion for the three remaining plants
to go forward? Is all the pipework, which is essential if we are to
move from demonstrated to full production, covered in the Bill? Can you
give the Committee sufficient comfort that our drafters have got it
right, or should they be
sacked?</div><a name="1001056000207"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr.
Keith MacLean:</b></i> The drafting is wide enough to cover
all of that. The real test will be the actual funding levels that are
to be raised by the levy. The spending in all of this is going to be
quite lumpy. There will be the projects themselves and, as National
Grid was saying, there will be the transport infrastructure. If we are
going to be levying over 20 years in order to raise all this money, we
will not have an even spread of that money actually being
spent.</div>
<a name="1001056000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think the
real test will be whether the up-front funding that will be required in
order to make some of the strategic decisions for pipe sizes and
projects is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column24" />Column number: 24</div>possible. The Bill sets out the basic structure for raising the money,
but the actual decisions about how much money that will be, how it can
be spent and how finance for the up-front expenditure will come are
tests for the secondary legislation and further policy
development.</div><a name="1001056000209"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
49</b><b class="B"><a name="1001056000509"></a>Mr.
Ellwood:</b> May I ask David Mannering a specific question?
You mentioned that you were at advanced stages with the Government on
looking at a project in Tilbury. For the record, can you state why you
decided to
withdraw?</div><a name="1001056000210"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Mannering:</b></i> The issue for us is that we feel that
carbon capture and storage is still very much at the demonstration
phase. We need to be sure that the technology works. We need to walk
before we can run. Part of the difficulty was alluded to by Sara
Vaughan. There is the potential that one builds a 1,000 MW generating
station, for which demonstration funding is provided for 400
MW, and that at a later stage one is required to put CCS on the balance
of the plant, for which the funding arrangements and the market price
are extremely
uncertain.</div><a name="1001056000211"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
50</b><b class="B"><a name="1001056000510"></a>Mr.
Ellwood:</b> So Brian Binley was right when he suggested that
you are allowing other people to do the dirty work and see what comes
up.</div><a name="1001056000212"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Mannering:</b></i> I do not think it is a matter of others
doing the dirty work. It is a question of recognising that we are at a
demonstration phase and we need to understand how the investment and
research will be
recovered.</div><a name="1001056000213"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001056000511"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I should say that a lot of colleagues are trying
to catch my eye on this group of questions, so I ask colleagues to be
brief.</div><a name="1001056000214"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
51</b><b class="B"><a name="1001056000512"></a>Mr.
Weir:</b> I want to follow up on pre and post-combustion.
Given the terms of the Bill on restricting funding and the terms of the
Government&#146;s competition, what realistic chance is there of any
pre-combustion research and development being done in the UK in the
current circumstances? Has that boat effectively now sailed? Is it now
post-combustion or
nothing?</div><a name="1001056000215"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr.
Keith MacLean:</b></i> I should reiterate that we do not
think that the boat has sailed for the remaining three. With the
commitment to the four schemes, I think that Ministers could perhaps
give some clarification about the intention. Our understanding is that
within the scope of the four schemes, the intention is to have funding
for at least one available for
pre-combustion.</div><a name="1001056000216"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
52</b><b class="B"><a name="1001056000513"></a>Mr.
Weir:</b> What sort of time scale would you be looking at for
that? Given that many of our stations run on natural gas, it seems
crazy that we are not thinking of looking at that, at least in the
short
term.</div><a name="1001056000217"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr.
Keith MacLean:</b></i> The advantage of a pre-combustion
approach is that it is more flexible and could be applied to different
approaches. I reiterate that we are hopeful that the funding will
encompass pre-combustion. We are working on that basis and perhaps
Ministers could clarify the
point.</div><a name="1001056000218"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001056000514"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I wonder whether the Minister will
clarify.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column25" />Column number: 25</div><a name="1001056000219"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001056000515"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> I am very happy to clarify that point. There is
scope for both pre and post-combustion. That is covered by the levy
arrangements proposed in the
Bill.</div><a name="1001056000220"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001056000516"></a>Mr.
Ellwood:</b> But Joan, that did not apply to the trials and
that is the
problem.</div><a name="1001056000221"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001056000517"></a>The
Chairman:</b> One at a time,
please.</div><a name="1001056000222"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001056000518"></a>Joan
Ruddock:</b> There is a competition that is still continuing
for one demonstration project. That is for post-combustion. We have
agreed that there will be a total of four and so there remain three
that could conceivably be pre or post-combustion. The limit is on the
first competition project, not the subsequent three
projects.</div><a name="1001056000223"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001056000519"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I say gently but firmly to colleagues that we
have witnesses here and this is not the time to debate the issues that
we will cover in our clause-by-clause deliberations. Mike, did you have
a further
question?</div><a name="1001056000224"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001056000520"></a>Mr.
Weir:</b> No, I am
fine.</div><a name="1001056000225"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
53</b><b class="B"><a name="1001056000521"></a>Dr.
Whitehead:</b> You are not all participating in the
competition, but you are all likely to pay the levy. Do you think that
the best way of securing a fair allocation of the levy is to go for
simplicity, for carbon intensity or for other methods that might
reflect other views of what a fair levy might
be?</div><a name="1001056000226"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Love:</b></i> The response that you got to this issue from
Rupert Steele during the first part of the sitting was very good. He
basically said that there are established mechanisms for recovering the
costs of these kinds of schemes through the energy companies.
Certainly, from my perspective, simplicity is a very good objective in
these things. It is established and very simple and we would not have
the kinds of complications of trying to establish the carbon content or
carbon intensity of various inputs to the generation mix. That would
have to be audited and it would just increase the cost, the complexity
and not even give you a better result. I think that the way it is
currently envisaged, to stick with the tried and trusted method, is
probably
appropriate.</div><a name="1001056000227"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Philip
Davies:</b></i> I would offer a slightly different view. I
think that the arguments about simplicity made by competitors in the
previous session have some force, but, at the same time, the background
to this is that we are talking about significant additions to consumer
bills. While an argument can be made that there are precedents in
relation to how this may best be done from other, already existing
levies, one could make a case that it would be useful to look at carbon
intensity. For example, if British Gas customers are not benefiting
from CCS projects, should they be contributing to their
funding?</div><a name="1001056000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have measures of carbon intensity, such as the fuel mix disclosure
statistics that are published and used by the industry in its
marketing, so there are ways and means through which this could be
looked at. I take the point that there is possibly some perplexity
involved and that precedents from other levies suggest that that is not
a route to explore, but I would not be as clear as others have been
about it not necessarily being worth looking
into.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column26" />Column number: 26</div><a name="1001056000229"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Mannering:</b></i> May I give a different perspective on
that? If the levy is put on the carbon intensity of this different
generation, that effectively&#151;potentially&#151;gives an
additional benefit to renewable energy. Renewable energy already
receives benefits through the renewables obligation, and if suppliers
of renewable energy do not have to pay the cost of the carbon capture
and storage levy, that is, in a sense, an additional support mechanism
for renewables. It seems to me preferable to keep the support
mechanisms pretty clear-cut. One does that by charging the support levy
across all customers of all suppliers, so I would agree with the
simplicity
point.</div><a name="1001056000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is a further issue that bears thinking about, namely the balance with
which obligations are placed on electricity compared to gas. We know
that various commentators are understandably interested in the balance
of prices between electricity and gas, because some customers are off
the gas grid system. Indeed, the Bill itself contains a measure that
deals with that area. We also know that in the long term to 2050, the
future is to generate low-carbon electricity and use it for transport
and heat as well as for the existing things that electricity is used
for, so, in the long run, we do not want to deter customers from moving
to electricity&#151;we do not want the price signals to encourage
them to stay with gas or other fuels. What we have at the moment is a
situation in which many of the levies are focused more on electricity
than on gas. For example, electricity
consumers&#151;</div><a name="1001056000231"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
54</b><b class="B"><a name="1001056000522"></a>Dr.
Whitehead:</b> But with respect, there will be a renewable
heat
incentive.</div><a name="1001056000232"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Mannering:</b></i> That is right, but at the moment
electricity customers implicitly pay for carbon allowances through the
EU ETS, because the electricity system has to buy EU ETS allowances,
whereas customers who burn gas in their boilers at home do not have to
pay for EU ETS allowances. Equally, the new CES&#151;community energy
support&#151;mechanism is payable by gas and electricity suppliers.
It is also payable by electricity generators, but not gas producers. At
the moment, there is already a tilting of the cost of obligations on to
customers of electricity compared with customers of gas. It is
questionable whether that is in the long-term interests of where the
country wants to go with its low-carbon
transition.</div><a name="1001056000233"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
55</b><b class="B"><a name="1001056000523"></a>Dr.
Whitehead:</b> On the question of the allocation of the levy,
a lot of this, as Dr. MacLean has mentioned, is still in the lap of
secondary legislation, or will be. Do you have a view about the extent
to which that secondary legislation might incentivise allocations
through knowledge sharing? Should the knowledge sharing simply be a
public good, as a result of the allocation, or should those who are the
first movers perhaps receive some benefit, as a result of that
allocation?</div><a name="1001056000234"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Mannering:</b></i> Is the question, &#147;If demonstration
projects are funded by a levy and an obligation, should the knowledge
be shared across their rivals?&#148;</div>
<a name="1001056000235"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001056000524"></a>Dr.
Whitehead</b> <i class="I">indicated assent.</i></div>
<a name="1001056000236"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Mannering:</b></i> It seems to me that the answer must be
yes.</div><a name="1001056000237"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
56</b><b class="B"><a name="1001056000525"></a>John
Robertson:</b> This question was asked of the previous group
of witnesses. The Bill restricts funding to plants powered by coal, or
by coal and biomass. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column27" />Column number: 27</div>Should it be extended to cover natural gas and/or other fuels? I get the
feeling that the answer will be yes, so could you explain
why?</div><a name="1001056000238"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr.
Keith MacLean:</b></i> Coal is the more pressing issue at the
moment, because of the higher carbon intensity. It is understandable
that the focus of the initial funding is on that. Through the inclusion
of both pre and post-combustion projects, there can be useful learning
experience for gas projects, particularly around the transportation and
storage of CO<span class="Sub">2,</span> which will also apply to gas<span class="Sub">.
</span>Clearly, three or four years ago, with a project to go, we would
have argued strongly for gas. Since that opportunity has gone, at the
moment getting the focus on coal is important, as is making sure that
we get the appropriate learning experience about transportation and
storage, which can be subsequently applied to
gas.</div><a name="1001056000239"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Mannering:</b></i> We would agree with that. Moreover, in the
future one would anticipate an electricity system where gas power
stations are largely operating in flexibility mode to offset the
intermittency of some renewables. Therefore, the benefits of fitting
this very expensive technology to a gas plant that does not run very
often would need to be considered before one made a decision to go
ahead with
that.</div><a name="1001056000240"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
57</b><b class="B"><a name="1001056000526"></a>John
Robertson:</b> Philip, you seem to be outnumbered. What do you
say?</div><a name="1001056000241"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Philip
Davies:</b></i> Yes, I would have a different view on this,
as you guessed. As has been widely said already, this is about the
demonstration phase of the project. I think it is hard to see clear
reasons why you would exclude particular approaches or fuels, or ways
of going about projects at this stage. Why not let the technologies and
the operators, through their own efforts, work out which is the most
effective by letting them decide what they include, rather than
deciding at the front what is excluded? There is a difference between
this area and some of the areas that we are currently more focused on,
such as nuclear and renewables, where we regard the technologies as
more
proven.</div><a name="1001056000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
we support this overall initiative because we think it is part of the
portfolio of requirements that the country will have in future, as a
general rule it is dangerous to be too prescriptive about what is
included in and excluded from the
scheme.</div><a name="1001056000243"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
58</b><b class="B"><a name="1001056000527"></a>Mr.
Willis:</b> I am pleased to find that you agree with social
good&#151;that was quite an exciting answer you gave
earlier&#151;but can I return to
pre-combustion?</div><a name="1001056000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
seems to be a huge advantage that none of you have mentioned, which the
previous panel did not mention either. If you go to post-combustion,
you end up with CO<span class="Sub">2</span>, which is a cost in terms of being able
to transport and store it. If you go for pre-combustion, you are
creating hydrogen, which could be used and sold extensively for other
purposes, particularly involving the transport revolution, including
for hydrogen fuel cells and what have you. Have any of your companies
factored in the effects of being able to develop a hydrogen economy as
part and parcel of future pre-combustion use of carbon
capture?</div><a name="1001056000245"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr.
Keith MacLean:</b></i> There are certainly elements of the
use of hydrogen that have benefits, for instance, as you rightly point
out, the storage or transport of that for alternative use. But at the
moment, as was made 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column28" />Column number: 28</div>clear in the first session, one of the big issues around carbon capture
and storage is not whether the individual chemical or physical
processes work, but getting them all to work together, and getting that
to happen in an economic way. At the moment, if you extend that to
include all the difficult issues to do with hydrogen storage and
transport, it is adding a complexity that is likely to make it more
difficult, at the moment, to make progress than to be an added
incentive to move it
through.</div><a name="1001056000246"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
59</b><b class="B"><a name="1001056000528"></a>Mr.
Willis:</b> I am worried that the Bill is leading us down a
track of post-combustion. You have probably gathered that my particular
interest is to try to move it in a different direction. The technology
will be redundant by the time that we have completed the demonstrators,
because the science is moving on at such a pace that if we are going to
attract the Chinese, particularly, into this market, pre-combustion
will be the only way for us to have a much more saleable technology in
terms of using fossil fuels for other chemical processes. Do you agree
with
that?</div><a name="1001056000247"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr.
Keith MacLean:</b></i> We agree with the importance of
pre-combustion. We are interested in that and looking at options for
projects of that nature. As we have covered previously in this session,
we believe the Bill will potentially support those projects. So I do
not think there is an issue there. At a future date we can add the
flexibility for the use of hydrogen for other purposes as an added
benefit, but at the moment I think it would be an added
complication.</div><a name="1001056000248"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001056000529"></a>The
Chairman:</b> We really have to move on. We have only 15
minutes or so to ask questions about social tariffs, Ofgem and
regulation before I turn to the Front
Benchers.</div><a name="1001056000249"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
60</b><b class="B"><a name="1001056000530"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> I will not exactly replicate the questions to
colleagues, but rather I will focus on some of the
specifics.</div><a name="1001056000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">First,
David, your company made a submission to our Committee about social
tariffs that has some pretty robust comments in it. It says that you
support a social price system in principle, but it is critical of the
proposals. You also say that there needs to be a whole look at the
winter fuel payments scheme and so on. Describe for the Committee, if
you will, what you would now wish us to do in the legislation as we
change it. I accept the premise, but let us change from a voluntary to
a compulsory system. Describe what you think the system should
be.</div>
<a name="1001056000251"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Mannering:</b></i> First of all, we have for some while
endorsed a compulsory social obligation. We believe that the amounts of
money involved now are sufficiently large for it to be appropriate to
be done on a statutory basis. Secondly, it has come out of discussions
with contacts at DECC that we are potentially at a watershed here in
the regulation of the energy industry. An obligation of this nature may
persist for some while and the level of the financial commitment is
likely to be pretty substantial for some years and, therefore, it is
extremely important to get it right now. Something that is in statute
is much harder to change than something that is part of, say, a licence
condition imposed by the
regulator.</div><a name="1001056000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
guess that one of the main concerns is the definition of a benefit. My
understanding of the Bill is that suppliers must pay customers a
benefit. That has, potentially, a number of drawbacks. If your
obligation is defined 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column29" /> Column number:29</div>solely in terms of how much you give to customers, that might, first of
all, fail to incentivise the provision of benefits entitlement advice
because in doing that you are not yourself transferring a benefit to
customers. Equally, if benefits exclude the administrative costs
involved in providing the advantage to customers, it would discourage
certain activities, such as providing benefit entitlement advice,
because there you are not transferring any money. You are incurring an
administrative cost in giving the advice but not transferring anything
to customers, so that activity might be excluded from the scheme. We
think that that would be
unhelpful.</div><a name="1001056000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
drawback of excluding the administrative costs is that it might distort
competition. If one company has a relatively high share of customers
entitled to a benefit prescribed by the Secretary of State, which, in
turn, has more significant associated administrative costs, that
company has the potential to be disadvantaged because those
administrative costs are not part of any equalisation
scheme&#151;</div><a name="1001056000254"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
61</b><b class="B"><a name="1001056000531"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> Can you just hold it there? You are beginning to
open up the argument. Can I short-circuit that by asking all four
colleagues, given that we have a little time before we come on to this
part of the Bill, if they would each let us have a note about how they
see a compulsory scheme best working? The beginning of next week would
be helpful. Can I ask David to finish by asking if he supports the
principle of clause 10, which would allow the Secretary of State to
create a scheme to redistribute costs between suppliers? Do you accept
that as a principle?</div>
<a name="1001056000255"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Mannering:</b></i> Yes, I think that it is an essential part
of the scheme&#151;there is a caveat&#151;unless the amount of the
obligation is sufficiently large on each supplier that one does not
need to have any reconciliation&#151;that the entire obligation can
be undertaken within that requirement.</div>
<a name="1001056000256"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
62</b><b class="B"><a name="1001056000532"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> May I ask one more question? I ask all of you
this, starting with David Love. The question we asked to colleagues
before: in the last year for which you have the records, how much of
your current spend is on social tariffs and what do you each project
your spend to be under the first year of a regulated compulsory
regime?</div>
<a name="1001056000257"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Love:</b></i> I have not got the percentages; I have the
absolute numbers and I will certainly get back to you in the same way
that you asked the other participants to earlier. The obligation last
year was &#163;10.6 million and we overspent by 10 per
cent.</div>
<a name="1001056000258"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001056000533"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> So you spent &#163;10.6 million?</div>
<a name="1001056000259"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Love:</b></i> No, that was the obligation. We spent
&#163;11.6 million.</div>
<a name="1001056000260"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001056000534"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> Philip?</div>
<a name="1001056000261"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Philip
Davies:</b></i> We spent about &#163;80 million. The
precise number is around &#163;77 million in
2008-09.</div><a name="1001056000262"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
63</b><b class="B"><a name="1001056000535"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> And was that what you had targeted and
expected?</div><a name="1001056000263"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Philip
Davies:</b></i> That was well above our required
spending.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column30" />Column number: 30</div><a name="1001056000264"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001056000536"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> By a margin of about what&#151;10 per cent. or
20 per
cent.?</div><a name="1001056000265"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Philip
Davies:</b></i> I do not have the precise percentage. As a
proportion of industry spend, we have spent something like 60 per cent.
of the industry spend is actually British Gas spend on social
tariffs.</div><a name="1001056000266"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001056000537"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b>
David?</div><a name="1001056000267"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Mannering:</b></i> Our commitment is of the order of
&#163;20 million a year. Last year we overspent by about 9
per cent. and we expect to overspend again this year. My back of the
envelope calculation suggests that that is about half a percent of
turnover.</div>
<a name="1001056000268"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001056000538"></a>Simon

Keith?</div><a name="1001056000269"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr.
Keith MacLean:</b></i> We spent around &#163;21 million,
which was also an overspend. Looking into the simple calculation,
&#163;300 million was a fifth of the market. Our spend would be going
up to about &#163;60 million.</div>
<a name="1001056000270"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
64</b><b class="B"><a name="1001056000539"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> And you could let us have your best-guess
projection, for the first year of a compulsory system. Obviously, there
are lots of variables, but you must have a view on whether it would
cost you double the amount, or treble the
amount.</div><a name="1001056000271"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001056000540"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I think, actually, in view of the time, we
probably want to move on to our final questions about regulation. I
hope that the four companies will be able to respond positively to the
questions that Simon has asked, if possible by the end of this week.
That may limit the amount of thought and research you can put in, but
it will mean that the Committee will have it in time. Thank you for
that.
Mike.</div><a name="1001056000273"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
65</b><b class="B"><a name="1001056000541"></a>Mr.
Weir:</b> I want to start with the same question we asked the
other panel. What do you think the impact the provisions in clauses 16
and 17&#151;for Ofgem to take account of carbon emissions and
security of supply&#151;will have on the way they work, if
any?</div><a name="1001056000274"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Mannering:</b></i> Can I just open that one up? Not very
much, because I think that they have taken on board the new imperative,
since maybe 2007, already. The existing wording allowed them to factor
in a greater emphasis on social and environmental issues, but it is
quite clear that they have responded to Department of Energy and
Climate Change draft guidance that has been issued, I think in 2008,
and again more recently. That creates more of an imperative for them to
take an interest in social and environmental issues. So I think that
they are already
there.</div><a name="1001056000275"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr.
Keith MacLean:</b></i> I would not be as confident in making
that statement. I think that the evidence of the Government having to
intervene in the way that they have on transmission access is evidence
enough that there seems to be a difference in the emphasis, if not the
direction of travel, in that particular area. I think that it is true
to say that transmission and access to networks is probably the one
area where the biggest issue has arisen. We feel that the further
clarification that this year&#146;s Energy Bill provides to
Ofgem&#151;following the clarification in last year&#146;s Energy
Bill&#151;is moving in the right direction. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column31" />Column number: 31</div>Ultimately, we would be concerned about any wholesale change to the
remit, with its potential for unintended consequences. So, this is
moving us in the right direction. In that way I would agree with David,
but as well as the letter of the law that is being set down here, we
need to think about the spirit of the law. It is very similar to the
planning system, where you have one planning Act. One local authority
can take a very positive view within that Act and another one can take
a very negative view. We have to make sure that everybody in Ofgem is
working in the right spirit and has aligned incentives to deliver the
common goals that the Government are setting out, that we, as an
industry, are trying to deliver, and that hopefully the regulator is
also trying to facilitate. This is moving in the right direction, but
we do not think, particularly on transmission access, that Ofgem is
there yet, and on transmission charging&#151;absolutely
not.</div>
<a name="1001056000276"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Philip
Davies:</b></i> I think it will make some difference. As
David Mannering says, Ofgem has in some ways already moved on that and
this, in a sense, will just cement that. We share the direction of the
proposed change. We think it is appropriate, given the changing demands
of energy
policy.</div><a name="1001056000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
concern we have is that as policy making becomes more complex, with the
need to balance the increasing demands of security of supply, climate
change, low prices and customer service, the guidance that Ofgem
operates will be very important because there will be more of a
balancing act between the different objectives. If we want all this
investment to come forward, from an industry perspective part of the
point of an agency that operates at arm&#146;s length from Government
is that it creates a decision-making environment that provides at least
an element of predictability and stability for companies. When they are
looking at projects or big decisions that have an important Ofgem
component, they kind of know the rules of the game. Although the world
is complex and Ofgem&#146;s duties need to reflect that, we
nevertheless need to operationalise the change of duties so that the
sector understands them and can work with
them.</div><a name="1001056000278"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Love:</b></i> I would echo many of those comments. We have
long called for a better alignment of Ofgem&#146;s duties with
Government policy, particularly in these key areas. We have a huge
challenge of decarbonising the energy sector, and Ofgem has a key role
in that. One of Philip&#146;s points was that if these powers go
through unchanged, it will be vital for Ofgem to give the companies
some guidance on whether it is going to change its  views and,
if so, how it will change the balancing act between security of supply
and protecting customers and, in particular, the balance between
competition and intervention, which is in the
Bill.</div><a name="1001056000279"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
66</b><b class="B"><a name="1001056000542"></a>Mr.
Weir:</b> Picking up on some of these issues, the other part
is the market power licence condition. ScottishPower and Scottish and
Southern Energy have both had concerns about aspects of the balancing
charges. Do you agree with ScottishPower that it would be contrary to
consumers&#146; interests because it would put a significant question
mark on
investment?</div><a name="1001056000280"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr.
Keith MacLean:</b></i> We would certainly agree that as
drafted and without further clarification, the market power licence
condition could be unsettling. We covered in the first session the
concern that investors would have 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column32" />Column number: 32</div>about the natural spikes in price that are needed to signal investment
or to give an economic case to back- up generation to come forward. If
there was going to be intervention or there were concerns that high
prices might lead to the use of these powers, it would affect investor
confidence. We feel that in the explanatory notes, the Government have
made it clear what they intend the powers to be used for. However, as
it is put forward in the Bill, it is quite wide-ranging and has the
potential to impact on investor
confidence.</div><a name="1001056000281"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Mannering:</b></i> If I could pick up on that, a quick review
of the history of the market abuse licence condition illustrates why
companies are nervous about it. It was originally rejected by the
Competition Commission in 2001. Ofgem sought to reintroduce it as part
of the new electricity trading arrangements process and the Department
for Trade and Industry at that time rejected the attempt. In 2009,
following the Competition Act inquiry, Ofgem sought again to introduce
the licence condition. It presumably got a message from most of the
companies that they were not in favour of
it.</div><a name="1001056000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">At
that point, Ofgem had a number of choices: it could have gone back to
the Competition Commission to see if it had changed its view or it
could have handed a Competition Act case to the Office of Fair Trading
to see whether it could pursue it. It did neither of those things. It
went to the Government and asked for a market abuse licence condition.
The evidence is that the normal regulatory processes that are meant to
operate in this area, where a licence condition is not accepted by the
industry but goes to the Competition Commission&#151;there is
repeated evidence that Ofgem has not found favour in following that
approach. That therefore makes us nervous. The risks associated with
this clause on investment could be significantly attenuated if it was
clearly specified that it was addressed only at derogated transmission
boundaries.</div>
<a name="1001056000283"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001056000543"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I am trespassing on Charles Hendry&#146;s
time, but you wanted to ask a particular question, John, did you
not?</div><a name="1001056000284"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
67</b><b class="B"><a name="1001056000544"></a>John
Robertson:</b> I want to ask about the market power licence
condition itself, David Mannering. There is a really good case for
having it. We agree that there are abuses; we have noticed the system
is being abused by companies. The problem is that the Competition
Commission and all the other bits and pieces that we have put in place
do not work. Why should we not therefore have something like the MPLC
in place? After all, our job is to look after the customer and not only
the companies. It would seem that the companies want to look after
themselves; customer complaints and problems do not seem to be
addressed properly.</div>
<a name="1001056000285"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David

me.</div><a name="1001056000287"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Mannering:</b></i> We don&#146;t think that there are
abuses.</div><a name="1001056000288"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr.
Keith MacLean:</b></i> I certainly wouldn&#146;t accept
that position, but we are not saying that there shouldn&#146;t be an
MPLC put forward. All we are saying is that it should be quite clear
what it is being put in place to address.</div>
<a name="1001056000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">At the moment,
it is being put in place to address the enhanced constraints. They are
a temporary aberration that we have at the moment because of the
mismatch in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column33" />Column number: 33</div>investment in transmission and investment in
generation &#151;so let&#146;s do something specific to
deal with this temporary problem, rather than having something with
wide-ranging powers that has the potential to impact negatively on
investor confidence at a time when all of our companies are having to
look to third-party finance now. We have so much to invest in, and our
normal balance sheets are not capable of funding all of that, so we are
far more susceptible to the issues that investors have with these sorts
of interventions. So to be specific about it, we as a company would not
have a particular problem with it.</div>
<a name="1001056000290"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Love:</b></i> We also support a tightly focused temporary
granting of these powers to Ofgem to minimise what will be enhanced
costs for bringing on generation, particularly in
Scotland&#151;renewable generation in Scotland&#151;before the
transmission system is has been reinforced, as Nick Winser said this
morning. That will increase costs; there is no doubt about that. What
this is trying to address is any abuse of market power that results
from that. So there still will be an increase in
costs.</div><a name="1001056000291"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="1001056000546"></a>The

<a name="1001056000292"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
68</b><b class="B"><a name="1001056000547"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> We have heard from Dr. MacLean and Mr.
Davies about the pre-combustion projects that SSE and Centrica were
developing, which were dropped because of the way in which the rules of
the competition were set. Will you give us some guidance? Are you now
looking to revive those projects because pre-combustion has been
brought back, or are they lost for the foreseeable future as a result
of the initial
terms?</div><a name="1001056000293"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr.
Keith MacLean:</b></i> Our project with BP was lost because
the timing of it meant that BP had to close the fields that were going
to be used as part of the storage for it. That doesn&#146;t mean that
we have stopped looking at other opportunities, but that particular
project in that area was
lost.</div><a name="1001056000294"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Philip
Davies:</b></i> We were looking at a particular project, I
believe a couple of years ago. We maintain discussions with all our
commercial counterparties, so nothing is ever definitively dead, but
right now there are no live discussions, I would
say.</div>
<a name="1001056000295"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
69</b><b class="B"><a name="1001056000548"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> So it is therefore true to say that as a result of
the way that the competition was structured, active schemes were
lost.</div>
<a name="1001056000296"></a><div class="hs_Para">You also spoke
about investment in new plant and about the concern that there would be
a requirement to retrofit that part of the plant that did not have CCS
from the outset but perhaps not the financial support, which would make
that difficult to justify. How much would that be changed if there was
a floor price for carbon&#151;for example, in conjunction with the EU
emissions trading scheme&#151;that would therefore give you a
predictable price for carbon, looking forward to 2020 and
beyond?</div><a name="1001056000297"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Love:</b></i> The same factors that apply to CCS, once it has
been demonstrated, as would apply to, for example, investment in new
nuclear power stations. We think that the EU ETS is not giving the
correct costs for carbon and it certainly is not giving any long-term
signal. Any investment in these plants is going to be here for 50
years. If you are doing the investment appraisal, you need at least to
cut off the bottom of the worst scenarios for market price and carbon
floor support. Cutting those off would make your investment appraisal
both for CCS and new nuclear much more
acceptable.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column34" />Column number: 34</div><a name="1001056000298"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
70</b><b class="B"><a name="1001056000549"></a>Charles
Hendry:</b> Would you all support a permissive power for the
Secretary of State to introduce a floor price for carbon, and using the
Bill as a way of doing
that?</div><a name="1001056000299"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Love:</b></i> Certainly we
would.</div><a name="1001056000300"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr.
Keith MacLean:</b></i> The concern that the industry has
always had in this particular area is that we do not unilaterally want
to do something here in the UK, even if it were only in the power
sector, that makes progress at a European or international level less
likely. It is difficult at the moment to work out whether the failings
at Copenhagen make it more or less likely that we will need to
intervene, but I think that, in the past, we have said that as a last
resort there needs to be something done within the UK power sector at
some point in time. I do not think we are there yet. Perhaps there
would be disagreement across the panel as to the timing of when this
would need to be done. Our particular view is that we are not there
yet, so there would not be an immediate rush to put something into this
Bill.</div><a name="1001056000301"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Philip
Davies:</b></i> I think that an open clause of the type you
mentioned would be extremely helpful. There is clearly an issue that
needs to be addressed and there is an issue about international
co-ordination but, in many areas, the UK is choosing to go faster and
further, and it is providing leadership in this area. That might well
need to be the case again.</div>
<a name="1001056000302"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Mannering:</b></i> Before we make a decision to implement a
carbon floor, we should perhaps look at the alternative ways of
incentivising low-carbon generation. So, an alternative approach might
be to provide first mover incentives, as we are doing with the CCS
demonstration plant, perhaps to the first new nuclear plant put on the
system. That would be an alternative way of kick-starting low-carbon
generation
technologies.</div><a name="1001056000303"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
71</b><b class="B"><a name="1001056000550"></a>Simon
Hughes:</b> Dr. MacLean, do you have a planning projection as
to where in the world the first fully compliant CCS plant will be up
and running? What is the earliest date you are expecting to see in this
country or elsewhere a fully operating CCS
plant?</div><a name="1001056000304"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Dr.
Keith MacLean:</b></i> I really would be speculating in an
area in which I am not an expert, so it really depends very much on the
scale. The biggest challenge is going to be not the technical
viability, but the commercial viability. There are so many factors at
the moment around that; it really is the unanswerable part of the
question. Technically, I am sure it will be possible. Certainly, on a
smaller scale&#151;several megawatts&#151;we are hopeful of having
that within a relatively short period of time at our plant in
Ferrybridge, but that is very different from a 1 GW plant operating
with full commercial viability. There is a question mark over that. To
be honest, we do not know whether we will ever get
there.</div><a name="1001056000305"></a>

later this year will they be

Keith MacLean:</b></i> Once again, it is really sad that our
project with BP died the way it did, because enhanced oil recovery was
very much part of it. It makes sense to look at that. There are other
areas where I am still hopeful that we will get some synergy benefits
in respect of the North sea oil developments&#151;around offshore
wind and marine developments. There is a lot more that we can be doing
in that regard and a lot more we can do to attract investors to the UK
to set up the supply chains to support those developments. I hope that
we will be faster and more successful in that area this time
round.</div><a name="1001056000315"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David

that is a benefit that should be factored
