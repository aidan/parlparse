<H5>10.30 am </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Robathan </B>(Blaby): I beg to move,  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That during proceedings on the Referendums Bill the Committee  do meet on Wednesdays at half-past Ten o'clock and at half-past  Four o'clock. <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I find myself in the unusual position it may be unique  in my parliamentary career of sitting on the Front  Bench. I am not troubled whether it is unique, but it is  unusual for me to have the opportunity of introducing a  Bill to a Committee. I hope that the Committee will bear  with me if I occasionally seem less informed than the  Minister with his phalanx of civil servants in this case  four sitting behind him.  
<P>
I do not want to reiterate all the points made on Second  Reading, but it is worth reminding the Committee of some  of the most important issues in the Bill. First, whether we  like it or not, referendums are now part of the political  scene in the United Kingdom. The Neill committee clearly  said that referendums, along with other electoral practices,  were in need of regulation. I know that the Government  agree because they set up the Neill committee.  
<P>
I have said all along that I would be happy for the  Government to take over the Bill if I had an absolute  assurance that they would introduce similar provisions as  per the Neill committee's recommendations, before any  other referendum were called in this country. At least two  referendums may be called in the near future one on  economic and monetary union and another on the voting  system.  
<P>
The Bill is simple. It sets up an electoral commission  called the referendums commission. Neill referred to an  electoral commission because he was dealing with  elections in the wider sense. My Bill deals specifically  with a referendums commission, but I am not bothered  about the name. If the Government want to introduce a  Bill later, they can change the name of the commission,  if they so wish.  
<P>
There are two main provisions. The first is to ensure  that both sides in a referendum campaign are given the  same amount of money from public funds. that should  prevent what happened in the Welsh referendum, when  one side had a great deal of money and the other side  none. In a democracy, both sides must be heard. The  second major provision is that all sides have the same  access to the media particularly the broadcast media,  which is all that the Government can realistically  legislate on.  
<P>
As I said, the Bill is simple and has support across the  House. It enacts the Neill committee's recommendations.  It is important not to establish commissions Nolan or  Neill and then ignore what they say. The Bill should  have the support of all democrats.  
<P>
I have already said that I would welcome a commitment  from the Government to introduce these measures before  another referendum is held, but the commitment must be  made on the Floor of the House by the Secretary of State.  Nudges and winks are insufficient. I have been a Member  of Parliament for seven years some members of the  Committee have been Members for a great deal longer  and I have to say that I have a deep distrust of "not quite"	  commitments made by Governments.  
<P>
I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say.  I am concerned that one of the amendments would take  out one of the major provisions of the Bill, but we will  come to that later.     
<P>
<B> The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the  Home Department (Mr. George Howarth):</B> I welcome  you to the Chair, Mr. Stevenson. I know that, whatever  disagreements we may have during our consideration of  the Bill, you will be impartial and fair. I have known you  for some time, and you are always impartial except  when it comes to Stoke City football club. As you  reminded me, they were defeated by Oldham last night,  so I do not want to labour my point. However, I am sure  that your partisanship in that respect will not be reflected  in this Committee.  
<P>
I thought it might be helpful if I set out the  Government's position on the Bill. There is wide  cross-party support for the basic principle underlying it  and that is reflected in the all-party list of Members who  have put their names to it. We hope that it will be an  issue on which the house can move forward with a broad  measure of agreement. Indeed, I hope that that is true of  the Neill report as a whole. The hon. Member for Blaby  (Mr. Robathan) played it in aid in his speech. Certainly,  the debate that we held last November suggests that there  will be agreement.  
<P>
We have much ground to cover and it does not make  sense to proceed too hastily or in a piecemeal fashion.  There is no obvious advantage indeed, there is a real disadvantage in picking out one or two  recommendations on the conduct of referendums and  advancing with them while others are left behind.  
<P>
The Government do not regard the implementation of  the Neill report as unimportant; we give it a high priority.  We came into government with three manifesto  commitments on this subject. The first, which was to ask  the Committee on Standards in Public Life to consider  the issue, has already been implemented. The Neill report  fleshes out our two other commitments, namely, to require  the disclosure of donations to political parties of more  than £5,000 and to ban foreign funding.  
<P>
When the Neill report was published, my right hon.  Friend the Home Secretary said that we would publish a  draft Bill that would cover these issues and all the  important matters in the report before the summer recess.  That is still our intention.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Robathan:</B> I am grateful to have that intention  restated. When will the draft Bill become a proper Bill  and have its Second Reading?  
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I am not in a position to answer that  question. Governments are never able to answer such  questions. The hon. Gentleman, who supported the  previous Government, knows that it is not possible for  Ministers to say in advance of the Queen's Speech what  will be in it. However, a draft Bill will be published  before the summer, and it will give all interested parties,  including Members of the House and members of the  Committee, whose very presence here signifies their  interest in the topic, the opportunity to express their views  and to comment on how we might improve the  arrangements.  
<P>
The draft Bill will not be set in stone. We want there  to be wide agreement across the House. We want the  arrangements governing the way in which we conduct  politics to last for a long time. That is a serious point and  will form a strong part of my arguments. We have said  that we will legislate in time for the new arrangements to  be in place for the next general election. That remains  our intention.  
<P>
We all accept the Neill committee's basic proposition  that, in any referendum campaign, there must be a fair  opportunity for each side of the argument to be heard. If  we do not accept that proposition, there is little or no  point in holding a referendum. It would be a somewhat  unnecessary procedure. How we move from that principle  into practice is less clear cut.  
<P>
We have had 11 recommendations from the Neill  committee on referendums and many others in the report  overlap with them, including those on the electoral  commission, the reporting of donations by political  parties, the ban on foreign funding and the registration  of campaign organisations at elections. There is also the  possibility of going beyond Neill to provide for generic  machinery for the conduct of referendums. Those are all  serious issues that need serious consideration.  
<P>
The Neill report clearly states that all the issues are  interrelated and should be dealt with as such. Paragraph  2.34 emphasised that the committee's recommendations  had  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"been conceived as part of an overall integrated scheme for the  reform of the funding of political parties"	.  
<P>
</UL></FONT>  
<P>
It went on to say that there was  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"a direct linkeage between all the recommendations, which should  be viewed as a whole"	.  <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
As a Government we wholeheartedly concur with the  Neill committee's approach: this should be dealt with as  a whole rather than a series of small parts. What is to be  gained from setting up a referendums commission now  when there is no immediate prospect of another  referendum?     
<P>
<B>Mr. Oliver Letwin </B>(West Dorset): This may be an  opportune moment for the Minister to tell the Committee  something that is obviously vital to its further  considerations. Can he give us the answer that the Prime  Minister could not give me last Wednesday: in the light  of what he has just said, will the Government undertake  to hold no further referendums until they have at least  implemented the Neill committee's recommendations on  referendums?  
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> The hon. Gentleman is aware that a  number of issues are involved here. I know that he is  concerned about the referendum on whether to join the  euro. The Government's position on that has been and  remains that we will consult the British people when that  is in the best interests of the British economy and Britain  as a whole. I cannot say, and it would be wrong of me  even to speculate, when that will happen. I know of no  proposals for that to happen in the near future, but if all  those things come together at some point I cannot say that  it will not happen. I do not expect it to happen, but I  cannot give an absolute guarantee. The hon. Gentleman  will understand all the reasons why I cannot do that.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Does the Minister recognise that the  argument that he was making is clearly null and void?  The reason for having this piecemeal approach now is to  forfend against the possibility of there being a referendum  without rules, which he has just signally failed to rule out.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> If that bridge appears in front of us we  will have to discuss what arrangements will be used. The  principle that I am putting forward is that, before the  summer recess this year we will publish a draft Bill. It  follows, in direct response to the hon. Member for West  Dorset (Mr. Letwin), that if we have established in a draft  Bill some principles on the conduct and supervision of  referendums, even though there was not necessarily a  body in place, in the unlikely event of a referendum those  principles would have to be considered carefully.  
<P>
It is not quite as the hon. Gentleman described. There  is no trickery involved. We are quite serious, as is the  hon. Member for Blaby, in raising the issue. There are  practical considerations, which any Government would  have to take into account. Those are the considerations  that I have just described.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Robathan:</B> This is the nub of the issue. If there is  no trickery involved, fine, I genuinely accept the  Minister's good faith; it is not just a parliamentary  courtesy. However, it is not necessarily the Minister who  will take decisions on these matters. Therefore, as I have  said, the Bill would be meaningless if the Secretary of  State said to the House, "Before a further referendum is  held in the United Kingdom, under the aegis of the United  Kingdom Parliament, the provisions on referendums  recommended by Neill will be put in force in legislation."	  The Secretary of State could make such a simple, personal  statement this afternoon if he wished to do so. It would  be absolutely fair because we would know that he had  committed the Government to acting before another  referendum was called.  
<P>
I do not criticise only Labour Governments I know  what Conservative Governments did in the past because  they say one thing and not another   
<P>
<H5>10.45 am  </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman: Order. Will hon. Members please keep  their interventions brief?  </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> For reasons that I stated a few moments  ago, I cannot, with rock solid certainty, predict whether  there is likely to be a referendum before the new  arrangements under Neill are put in place, and neither  could my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary or any  other Minister, no matter how lofty for the same reason.  It is a nice try by the hon. Gentleman, but I shall not be  tempted along his flower-strewn path.     
<P>
I can, however, say with confidence that there is no  immediate prospect of another referendum  [Interruption.] That is probably my right hon. Friend the  Home Secretary calling to answer the hon. Gentleman's  question and I do not say that to be misleading or to  trick the House. It is simply the Government's stated  position, which reflects our view of matters as they stand.  
<P>
<B>Dr. Nick Palmer </B>(Broxtowe): Does my hon. Friend  agree that the Government's position is that it is desirable  to regulate referendums in a fair manner? A draft proposal  will be introduced as soon as possible; we shall also  consider this Bill, which will inform our future  deliberations, constructively. It is a practical matter how  quickly we can get good referendum regulations through  the House. We do not want a dangerous Referendums Act.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I dread to think what a dangerous  referendum might be. I concur entirely with what my hon.  Friend said, as no doubt do the hon. Members for Blaby  and for West Dorset. The Bill is helpful, although for  reasons that I shall explain, we do not want it to proceed  to the statute book. The Home Office officials and I have  been co-operative as the hon. Gentleman will concede  in drafting the Bill so that some of its proposals, apart  from the referendums commission, are workable. We  co-operated because we wanted consensus across the  parties and with Members, and because the Bill helped  us by clarifying our thinking. Officials had to consider  questions a little earlier than they would otherwise have  done. My hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe was right  to say that the process was helpful to us in constructing  the arrangements in a later Bill.  
<P>
<B> Mr. Andrew Miller (Ellesmere Port and Neston):</B> On  the consensual nature of the Government's approach, is it  not critical that, in a matter as important as this to our  constitutional future, we proceed with the widest possible  consensus, not only in the House but outside? Is not the  fundamental reason for having a draft Bill that it allows  the widest possible discussion outside the House before  legislation is enacted?  
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> My hon. Friend is right. The worst  possible conclusion that we could reach post-Neill would  be a set of arrangements that were conceived by the public  to be a political fix. Although I want to build consensus  in the House of Commons and the political system, I  stress that the most important consensus that we need is  with the British electorate, because if they do not trust the  arrangements and the means by which we reach them, the  process will, to some extent, have been a waste of time.  We are here because the British public do not entirely  trust politics as conducted for the past 18 to 20 years. That  is not necessarily a criticism of the Conservative party,  although it is partly that. It is a criticism of the conduct  of politics in this country over a long period, which has  led to the sad point where public confidence in the  political process is not as strong as all of us here would  like. That is what we are trying to engage with.  
<P>
We regard the draft Bill not as a device for delaying  implementation of Neill's recommendations indeed, far  from it but as the Government's opportunity to state  what we believe to be the best way of introducing them.  We are interested in the opinions of the wider public,  experts and politicians and, if we have got something  wrong, we are willing to consider modifying the  arrangements. That is how we intend to tackle the issue.  I say that as openly as I can because I think it important,  from Parliament's as well as the Government's viewpoint,  that we proceed in that way. that is our sincere intention.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Paul Flynn </B>(Newport, West): rose   
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I will give way to my hon. Friend the  Member for Liverpool, West Derby (Mr. Wareing) first.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Wareing:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his  neighbourliness in giving way to me first. Did I hear  right? Did my hon. Friend say that the Government are  not in agreement with the Bill reaching the statute book?  My point is that it is a private Member's Bill. I have  experience of a Whip being organised against my private  Member's Bill, although it was denied at the time. May I  take it that if the Bill passes all its stages and reaches  Third Reading, the Government will not do the same this  time, and that if a draft Bill is all that comes forward  between now and the next general election there is an  amendment proposing implementation by 2001 the  Government will implement the Bill in the absence of any  legislative proposals on the subject from themselves?  
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> The Government are not obliged to  implement every Bill that goes onto the statute book.  Indeed, the money resolution attached to this Bill went  through the House last night without any hinderance from  Government which is the convention. When a Bill has  had Second Reading, and a demonstration of support from  the House, we do not prevent the money resolution from  going through.  
<P>
I will explain the money resolution in a moment, and I  hope that my hon. Friend, whom I have known for many  years and hold in great affection, will understand what I  am about to say in that context.     
<P>
<B>Mr. Flynn:</B> Does my hon. Friend recall examples of  other Back-Bench attempts to improve parliamentary  systems? Failure to control national spending on elections  is a great weakness. In the past 15 years, there have been  at least eight private Member's Bills on that issue, two of  which I introduced. All kinds of promises have been made  in that period. However, no one ever opposes the  potentially damaging and unfair failure to control  spending on elections.  
<P>
The main attraction of the Bill is that it is a genuinely  Back-Bench measure that would make efficient use of  parliamentary time. Unfortunately, Back Benchers' time  is seen as set-aside parliamentary time, and nothing ever  comes of it. The Government's conceding that the Bill is  a serious measure would be a great boost to all Back  Benchers. We could then get the Bill through the  parliamentary timetable in Back Bencher time and, with  the help of hon. Members on both sides of the House,  could achieve consensus.  
<P>
<B> Mr. Howarth:</B> I shall cover that and my hon. Friend's  point about electoral expenses.  
<P>
  
<P>

<P>
The Government are determined to improve this  country's democratic arrangements. I will not go through  the arguments about devolution, as my hon. Friend  coming from Wales knows such arguments only too  well. An example of our seriousness about that subject is  the electoral procedures working party that I chair. The  Home Office services that working party, and  Conservative and Liberal Democrat Members belong to  it. There are two principles behind that working party.  First, we want to build as much consensus as possible  around the changes in electoral procedures mentioned by  my hon. Friend. Secondly, we want to establish proposals  that can be converted into legislation and that will be  unlikely to provide argument about how important they  are.  
<P>
In the past, attempts of that nature have been  problematic because consensus-building has not preceded  the discussion of ideas. We want to reverse that. I tell my  hon. Friend in all seriousness that we do not intend to  delay implementation of the work that we are doing. We  intend to build the widest possible consensus prior to  introducing a Bill. I hope that, before the end of this  Parliament, we will introduce measures that will improve  the conduct of elections in this country, which will  include some of the Neill recommendations. We can  achieve consensus on those important matters and  legislate on them as part of the wider process of building  confidence in this country's political systems. I am sure  that we all agree that that urgent task merits everyone's  attention.  
<P>
There would be consequences if we had no quibbles  about the Bill progressing and being enacted. First, the  Bill would be operating in a vacuum: the various  recommendations and other issues in the Neill report  would not be linked to the Bill in the way that we and the  Neill committee think that they should be. A referendums  commission operating in such a vacuum would not meet  all the concerns of the Neill committee and the  Government.  
<P>
Secondly, given that there is unlikely to be a  referendum before our Neill proposals are published, the  body would have nothing to do. It would be superseded  by an electoral commission shortly after it was  established. We would have gone through the whole  process for nothing. That does not seem sensible.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Robathan: The Minister seems to have  contradicted himself. He says either that the system will  operate in a vacuum or that it will never operate. It will  not operate in a vacuum; it will not operate at all should  there be no referendum before the Government make their  own proposals. That is the nub of the matter. It will cost  nothing to set up a committee that never meets. No civil  servants will be required. The Bill will sit on the statute  book until a referendum is called or until it is superseded  by a Government Bill.  </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> Those statements are not contradictory.  They are both consequences. First, if there is no  referendum one is unlikely it would have no work to  do. Secondly, considered in the context of the Neill  package, it would operate in a vacuum. I have already  explained that the other arrangements what the Neill  committee called a package will not have been put in  place. Consequences might be contradictory, but they  nevertheless remain consequences.  
<P>
There are some difficulties with the Bill's provisions,  some of which I pointed out on Second Reading on 19 March. We need a wider policy framework, and it is  the Government's intention to provide it. We are working  through the arrangements one by one, not to delay them  but to ensure that we get them right. We need to give  structure to the skeleton.  
<P>
The Bill was drafted with the best possible motives,  but, unintentionally, it was emaciated. It could be  compared with an early prototype; in that sense, it is  helpful. However, it will need further work before it can  go into production. It is not definitive. I urge the hon.  Member for Blaby to exercise patience I know him to  be a patient man and try to build something more  complete that would cover the wider issues and that would  stand the test of time.  
<P>
I promised the Committee that a draft Bill would be  made available before the recess. It will cover all the  important issues raised by the Neill committee. The Bill  will be available for comment during the summer. We  believe that expert opinion and the comments of Members  of Parliament and the public will assist us in producing  that draft Bill, and it will be informed by our debates on  the Referendums Bill.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Martin Bell </B>(Tatton): This is clearly a  non-partisan Bill. It is fair, and it has wide support among  members of all parties and, in my case, of none. The  Bill is a prototype that the Committee will proceed to  fiddle with it. Will the Minister then stop the prototype in  its tracks and build his own?  
<P>
<B>Me. Howarth:</B> The hon. Gentleman  uncharacteristically describes it in absolute terms. I see it  as part of a process. I am not being disingenuous when I  say that. The process was started by the Neill committee,  and it is in that context that I have difficulty with the Bill.  I am not worried about what it says, although, for reasons  that I have already explained, I think that it would be  somewhat unusual to set up a body that may never be  needed.  
<P>
Our deliberations are an important part of that process.  We have the opportunity to build up a prototype. To  answer the question directly, what we put in the draft Bill  will be informed by how the Referendums Bill is  constructed and what provisions it makes. The hon.  Members for Blaby and for West Dorset will concede that  we were more than happy to talk to them about how the  Bill was put together. That was helpful, and I consider it  to be part of a continuing process.  
<P>
The draft Bill will answer the concerns that have been  expressed. The Government feel strongly that we should  deal with referendums in line with the recommendations  of the Neill committee.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Adrian Sanders </B>(Torbay): The Bill, which I hope  we shall soon debate, is an important insurance policy. It  is not that one does not trust what the Minister says or,  indeed, what the Government say. However, events  dictate what can or cannot be done. The fear is that if the  proposal for a draft Bill were to slip, as many others have  slipped in the past two years, we will have lost the  opportunity to put the Bill on the statute book.     
<P>
Even if the Bill is not required if there are no  referendums for another five or 10 years and even if the  Government proceed with their own Bill, going ahead  with it will have cost nothing except the time of the  Committee. I agree with the Minister that we want wider  consultation and that we should involve voluntary  organisations, community groups, political parties not  represented here   
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I remind the hon. Member that  he is making an intervention. If he wishes to make a  speech, he can do so in the normal way.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Sanders:</B> I will sum up briefly, Mr. Stevenson. I  hope that the Minister will be able to answer the point.  We feel the need for an insurance policy; why will the  Government not accede to that?  
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I was about to conclude, Mr. Stevenson,  but I shall deal first with the assumption behind the hon.  Gentleman's question that if the Bill was enacted, it would  have no particular consequences. As I said, it would have  no work to do; it would eventually be superseded by an  electoral commission, and would therefore be  unnecessary. However, that is not the same as saying that  there will be no consequences. We should have to set up  a referendums commission. Even though a referendum  was not in prospect, the commission would be obliged to  investigate how referendums might be conducted.  
<P>
I have no estimates to hand, but starting that process  and setting up the commission would cost money. I do  not know how much it would be; I do not say that it would  be billions of pounds, but it would be something. I do not  oppose the Bill in bad faith; rather, I welcome the debate,  safe in the knowledge that we shall in the near future  publish a draft Bill that will answer those concerns.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Dominic Grieve (Beaconsfield) rose   </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> The hon. Gentleman is eager to  intervene, so I shall not discourage him.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I have been very quiet hitherto.  
<P>
If the difficulty is that the referendums commission  would have to be set up and start work at once, why not  introduce an amendment that provided that the  referendums commission would start automatically on the  date on which the Government announced a referendum?  That would prevent the commission from being set up  unnecessarily and would also guarantee that if a further  referendum were called before the new package were  introduced, the referendums commission would  immediately start operating and, in line with the  provisions in the Bill, be able to advise on the ensuing  referendum. So the insurance policy would work, without  having to pay too high a premium.  
<P>
<B> Dr. Palmer rose   </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I am besieged. I give way to my hon.  Friend.  
<P>
<B>Dr. Palmer:</B> I am sorry to intervene in the exchange. I  draw attention to clause 2(1), which does not refer to the  Government introducing a referendum, but sets down that  if any member of either House introduces a Bill providing  for a referendum, the whole process must be set in motion.  I do not know whether the Minister feels able to guarantee  that no member of either House will wish to bring forward  a referendum on any subject.     
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I feel an amendment from my hon.  Friend coming on which I am sure we will in due course  debate at great length.  
<P>
In the unlikely event of a referendum happening in the  meantime, I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for  Broxtowe (Dr. Palmer) would agree that even allowing  for the difficulties he described if we made provision in  the Bill for the referendums commission not be activated  unless a referendum were called, those would not be the  best circumstances in which to set up such a commission.  It would be reacting to events rather than taking a  longer-term interest in the subject by developing a set of  procedures and a more reflective role. Such circumstances  are not the best in which to establish a new body.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I take the Minister's point and have to  agree with him. Clearly, it must be desirable to achieve a  long-term consensus. Equally, it must be undesirable to  have a repeat of the Wales referendum, the handling of  which was subsequently seriously criticised by the Neill  committee; it suggested that the outcome might have been  different if proper rules had been in place. While I accept  that, on the basis of what the Minister said, the proposal  is imperfect, it seems much better than the existing state  of affairs, which has created a great deal of public  disquiet.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> The hon. Gentleman's argument would  have more force if there were likely to be a referendum  in the intervening period. I have repeatedly made it clear  that we believe that that is not likely and that no  referendum is in prospect. We reasonably expect,  although we cannot guarantee  [Laughter.] The hon.  Member for Blaby laughs in a good-natured way, but it is  a serious point. No Government can ever guarantee that,  even for the reasons to which my hon. Friend the Member  for Broxtowe referred, referendums will not take place;  we do not envisage it but we cannot give an absolute  guarantee.  
<P>
The Bill is a serious undertaking and I respect and  appreciate the way in which the hon. Member for Blaby  raised it. The debate that he has triggered will not be lost  on the Government and will contribute to the process that  I described to the hon. Member for Tatton (Mr. Bell) and  which was launched by the recommendations of the Neill  committee. That is a serious commitment. We are not  trying to wriggle out of it, but our principal position,  which we take from Neill itself, is that the connections  between all parts of that package should be recognised  properly in legislation.  
<P>
We intend to do justice to those recommendations and  deal with the package, initially in a draft Bill and, after  consultation, in a Bill that will be discussed on the Floor  of the House. That is the best way to proceed. I do not  want to dampen the debate; I shall listen to it with interest.  Dealing with Neil as a package is the only way in which  we can do justice to the issues it raises and also to the  public concern that gave rise to Neill in the first place.

<B>Mr. Miller: I beg to move, as an amendment to the  motion, to leave out.  </B><P>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"and half-past Four o'clock."	<P>
</UL></FONT>  
<P>
I am a bit green about such proceedings, as the hon.  Member for Blaby (Mr. Robathan) said, but it would be  sensible for the Committee to consider the amendment to  the sittings motion. Given the importance of the Bill and  the amount of research that must be done into it, I suggest  that the Committee meets on Wednesday mornings only.  
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am advised that the amendment does  not have to be seconded this is not a trade union  meeting! A debate on the amendment is in order, but I  remind members of the Committee that the sittings motion  was debated for 45 minutes. Along with members of the  Committee, I am anxious to get to the meat of the Bill.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Frank Cook </B>(Stockton, North): I am intrigued to  know what justification there can be for the amendment.  I am a simple-minded soul and am trying to grasp the  logic of my hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port  and Neston (Mr. Miller) in wanting the Committee to sit  only on Wednesday mornings. Will he elucidate on his  reason for the amendment?  
<P>
<B>Dr. Palmer:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Stevenson. Do  you object to members of the Committee removing their  jackets?     
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I have no objection to that.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Robathan:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Stevenson.  As a result of my greenness, I failed to welcome you to  the Chair, for which I apologise. I am thrilled that you  are Chairman.  
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> That is about the fourth time that I  have heard that.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Robathan:</B> Well, you get a lot. We oppose the  amendment and, as the hon. Member for Stockton, North  (Mr. Cook) said, there is no reason for it. We have had a  great deal of time to prepare for the Bill. After all, it was  discussed on Second Reading months ago.  
<P>
When asked if I would accept the Minister's  Parliamentary Private Secretary as a member of the  Committee, I said, "Of course"	 because I intended to do  everything to assist the Minister, but I hope that he will  not move any more foolish amendments.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Miller:</B> I am disappointed by that response. My  hon. Friend the Member for Stockton, North made a valid  point but, as he knows, I have come to the Bill somewhat  late in the day. He has raised some fundamental  constitutional issues that must be considered, as the hon.  Member for Blaby, and I want to examine them in great  detail. I would prefer to consider the Bill at a more  leisurely pace rather than it being forced through quickly,  hence the reason for my tabling some detailed  amendments.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> rose in his place and claimed to move,  That the Question be now put.

<B>The Chairman:</B> I am advised that there is a financial  resolution in connection with the Bill. Copies are  available in the Room. I remind the Committee that  amendments should be submitted in good time to be  considered for selection. As a general rule, I do not  propose to select starred amendments, including any that  may be reached at an afternoon sitting of the Committee.

<P>
<B>Mr. Miller:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 1, in page 1, line 8, leave out `four' and insert `eight'.     
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take  amendment No. 2, in page 1, page 10, leave out  
<P>

<P>
</UL></FONT>  
<P>
and insert  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`appointed by the Secretary of States'.  <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Miller:</B> The amendment has been tabled by me  and my hon. Friend the Member for St. Helens, South  (Mr. Bermingham). It will not have gone unnoticed that  my hon. Friend is unable to be with us today, but I am  sure that the Committee will agree universally on one  thing on sending our best wishes to my hon. Friend and  his wife, who is just about to produce a child. When we  consider his health in the not-too-distant past, our  congratulations should be sent speedily.  
<P>
These are probing amendments, intended to ascertain  the logic of the hon. Member for Blaby in choosing only  four people as the number of members of the commission.  Given that there is no definition in the Bill about the scope  and type of referendums that can be included under the  commission's remit, it could have a significant task to do.  
<P>
I know that the hon. Member for Blaby does not want  referendums to be used to conduct the affairs of parish,  borough or county councils, but the Bill refers to  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the introduction to parliament of any bill which provides the  holding of a referendum"	.  <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Such Bills could cover many subjects. Our future  relationship with the euro has already been mentioned,  which is controversial both between parties and within  them. One can envisage a host of other matters that  individual Members, the Government or future  Governments could introduce as possible work for the  commission. Opinions are split within and between parties  on many issues for which referendums might be  appropriate.  
<P>
I am not saying that I would agree with such a proposal,  but if a Member were to introduce a Bill that, for example,  necessitated a referendum on the abolition of a religious  education or religious denomination schools, it could  come within the scope of this Bill.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Wareing:</B> Is not a fundamental weakness in  discussions about referendums the fact that we have a  tradition of representative government in this country, and  representative government is at risk if we allow  referendums to occur on all sort of matters? for example,  some people might argue I certainly would not that a  referendum should be held on whether to restore capital  punishment. Representatives are there to lead as well as  to represent.  
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order I understand the temptation to  speculate about the matters that might be the subject of  referendums, but I remind hon. Members that the  amendments are specific. I hope that they will respect  that fact.  
<P>
<B>  </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Miller:</B> Thank you for your guidance, Mr.  Stevenson. I shall come to the specific point about  numbers. I agree with my hon. Friend's observation and  shall return to it in detail later. The fact that the scope of  referendums is not defined in the Bill could produce a  much larger work load than that envisaged by the hon.  Member for Blaby.  
<P>
We would not want to create an ineffective body that  simply could not meet its work load. However, the  number of members is inadequate. The Bill contains no  provision for subsets within the commission so that it  might consider regional matters. It contains no provision  to deal with illness or the unavailability of the  commission's members. There seems to be no place for  deputies in the structure. For those reasons, substantial  grounds exist to have more than four members.  
<P>
I suspect that all members of the Committee would  support the view that any such commission should not be  London-centred; it should be representative of the whole  country. taking the four logical units of the country  Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales and England would  mean having four members, plus a chairman. However,  hon. Members might think that inadequate to meet the  need to have a truly balanced commission that could  consider matters objectively, without party bias. From  time to time, the commission might need to consider  specific issues that, for example, affect only Wales the  Welsh referendum has been mentioned or other groups.  The commission's membership ought to reflect the United  Kingdom as a whole, so we should consider a number  that enables it to do so. I postulate eight as perhaps a  suitable figure.     
<P>
Referendums might be on subjects that interest only a  narrow part of the population, or on subjects that concern  a large part of it, such as one with greater impact on  women than men I note that we have an all-male  Committee today. A number as small as four is inadequate  to get the right balance of regional, gender and ethnic  identities in the commission.  
<P>
<H5>11.30 am  </H5>
</P>
<P>
Amendment No. 2 would leave out of clause 1, in page 1, line 10 there is an error on the amendment  paper, which reads "page 10"	 the words  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"`a Justice of the high Court' and insert `appointed by the Secretary  of State'."	  
<P>
</UL></FONT>  
<P>
There are several reasons for the amendment. In clauses  that we will deal with later, the spirit of the Bill shows a  relationship between the Speaker, who is traditionally  held in extremely high esteem, and a Secretary of State  promoting a Bill. It seems that those people, given the  constraints and benefits imposed by the Nolan report,  ought to give us the scope to find suitable chairmen for  the commission without their necessarily being High  Court judges. Justices of the High Court have a busy  schedule, and to impose another burden on them is to  consider the matter from too narrow a point of view.  
<P>
Given all the bodies involved, we should be able to find  suitable people. A senior member of the Chairmen's  Panel, or even the Speaker or a Deputy Speaker, should  possibly be considered, or perhaps the chairmen should  be from outside the House of Commons. Simply to probe  the thought process of the hon. Member for Blaby, I  would like to know why he considers a justice of the High  Court as appropriate. My amendment would open the door  a little and broaden opportunities to find a person  acceptable to the whole House and the whole public.  
<P>
I am not suggesting for a moment that a justice of the  High Court is not an appropriate person, but to narrow the  appointment of a chairman to that category of people is  too limiting. I made earlier comments about the need to  have balance in the referendums commission. It is obvious  that few justices of the High Court are women, though  that number is increasing. It may be impossible to create  the kind of balance necessary with a small number while  constraining ourselves to one category of person at the  head of the body.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B> Mr. Robathan:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman,  because both points are valid. I do not agree with all the  arguments behind them, although I shall not explore those  in detail. Eight people might be more appropriate than  four. I am not sure that sickness is the right reason for  that, but the smaller the Committee, the more quickly  decisions are arrived at, as we in this Committee might  discover ourselves. Some of his arguments are fair, and I  have no objection to increasing the number to eight if that  is the wish of the Committee; four is certainly a small  number.  
<P>
I am less happy about the hon. Gentleman's point  about not having a judge. We decided on a judge  because the natural vehicle especially if the Bill is  merely an insurance policy, as the hon. Member for  Torbay (Mr. Sanders) and my hon. Friend the Member  for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve) suggested, and as a judge  would have no work to do unless a referendum were  called would be Lord Neill himself. However, that  was in the back of our minds, and is not necessarily  essential.  
<P>
It would be wrong if the chairman were an active  politician. An active politician would have a party  affiliation, and could therefore not be an unbiased  chairman. I accept that that is not always the case; perhaps  the chairman could be an independent Member of  Parliament, of whom there are a unique number.  However, it would undermine the commission if it were  chaired by an active politician, as I think the hon. Member  for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Mr. Miller) would accept.  The accusation of political bias could always be made,  even though it might not necessarily be fair. The  commission might contain people from all parties and  from none.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Miller:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for  his observations. One of the strengths of our  parliamentary system that is poorly understood by the  public at large is the way in which we conduct ourselves,  with the Speaker and Chairs of the Speaker's Panel taking  an independent, non-partisan role during deliberations.  Does the hon. Gentleman think that there is strength in  that, and that we should try to move the concept outside  this place to encourage greater understanding of it?  
<P>
<B>Mr. Robathan:</B> I had finished, but I shall respond,  because the hon. Gentleman specifically referred to me.  Indeed, the point is moving the concept outside this place.  A judge is outside this place and is not, therefore, within  the remit of partisan politics that it is essential that an  electoral or referendums commission avoids.  
<P>
<B>Dr. Palmer:</B> I agree with the tenor of what both hon.  Members are saying. It is essential that the chair of a  referendums or electoral commission is seen to be  operating independently of the parties and of the  Government of the day. I worry that we are increasingly  delegating such work to judges, because in that direction  lies the American state of affairs, in which judges become  increasingly responsible for what are essentially political  decisions. The Speaker and the Speaker's Panel give us a  precedent for showing that we as politicians can run  bodies fairly. It would be rather embarrassing if we were  to say that unfortunately we cannot trust ourselves, and  must therefore find a judge.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Sanders:</B> Referendums are crucial, and when a  referendum is called, it is imperative that it be seen to be  fair. Therefore, the process that backs referendums must  also be seen to be unquestionably fair.  
<P>
We are all aware of opinion polls undertaken from time  to time that place journalists, politicians and estate agents  as the least trustworthy people, place the police near the  top and at the very top place judges, just above doctors,  as the most trustworthy. Given that context, the most  obvious person to chair such a committee would be  someone who is seen to be beyond doubt someone of  absolute trust.     
<P>
It is important that that aspect of the Bill remains intact;  it is crucial, deserves support and will receive widespread  support in the country. It says that we are prepared to give  power to someone else, whereas the amendment says that  politicians want to control the process. If the Bill is to  mean anything, someone beyond doubt must be the  chairman of the commission.  
<P>
<B>Dr. Palmer:</B> I fully accept the point that judges are  among the most trusted people in the country. However,  I put it to the hon. Gentleman that that is partly because  they are not normally expected to assume a partisan role.  In the recent Pinochet hearing, I was disturbed that  newspapers commented on the believed political views of  each of the judges who were to hear the case. That will  happen increasingly the more that we bring judges into  the political process, and will reduce the trust that people  rightly feel in judges. We should be careful about that.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Martin Bell:</B> I have had the odd experience of  moving from a profession that is held in low esteem  that of journalist to one that is held in even lower  esteem. We are talking about the reputation of the  political, and especially the electoral, process, and about  improving it, if we can. While I entirely accept that a  commission of eight members would be fine no one  would quarrel with that the chairman should be outside  this building. That is the reason for having a judge, and  we stand by it.  
<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> The Bill as drafted provides  for the referendums commission to consist of up to five  members, including the chairman. Amendment No. 1  would increase that number to nine, including the  chairman. The Neill committee report on funding of  political parties envisaged a membership of five for its  proposed electoral commission in line with the proposal  of the hon. Member for Blaby in the Bill. The  referendums commission will of course have much more  limited functions than would the electoral commission,  and so the more limited membership provided for in  clause 1(2) appears more appropriate.  
<P>
We are carefully considering the appropriate number of  members for an electoral commission. As I suggested,  much will depend on the range of functions that we give  the new body. It would appear sensible to build some  flexibility into the Bill in the number of commissioners to  take account of a cyclical work load, for example.  
<P>
In considering the composition of a referendums  commission, the Nairne commission examined a number  of options. It suggested that it could be modelled on the  multi-member boundary commissions, or could consist of  a single commissioner, similar to the Registrar of Political  Parties or the Parliamentary Commissioner for  Administration. It may be worth examining those two  models.  
<P>
The Nairne commission also pointed to possible  disadvantages of a multi-member body. It suggested that  it may not be easy to achieve a generally accepted balance  in the membership. Furthermore, a corporate body may  lack the decisive authority of a single commissioner.  However, in relation to the hon. Member for Blaby's  concerns about ill-health, if one person was responsible  and fell ill, the whole process could come to a grinding  halt. That may need to be weighed in the balance. The  breadth of responsibility given to the referendums  commission in the Bill suggests that a multi-member  body, which would enable a broad range of skills and  interests to be represented, may be more appropriate.     
<P>
The balance of opinion appears to be in favour of a  multi-member commission. That is not to say that the  commissioners will be full-time appointments. The Neill  committee envisaged part-time membership of an  electoral commission, but suggested that the chairman and  perhaps one or more members might work full-time  during the referendum or during an election campaign.  
<P>
I should like mildly to take issue with a contention  made by the hon. Member for Blaby, although I may be  wrong and I stand to be corrected. I understand that Lord  Neill is not a High Court judge. The hon. Gentleman said  that in the back of his mind he thought that Lord Neill  might be the proper person to chair the commission, but  his suggestion may not be appropriate. I seek not to make  a major point, but merely to say that I am not sure whether  the hon. Gentleman was right. Nolan was a High Court  judge, which may be where the mistake crept in.  
<P>
<H5>11.45 am  </H5>
</P>
<P>
I thought that it might be helpful to draw on  experiences abroad; sometimes it is useful to see how  other political systems deal with such problems. I had  some research done, but we could find no exact equivalent  body, or a referendums commission as such. We did,  however, find three Commonwealth examples. A brief  consideration of their composition may inform our debate.  
<P>
The Australian electoral commission has three  members, under Australia's Commonwealth Electoral Act  1918. They are the chairperson, who must be a judge or a  retired judge of the federal court of Australia, the electoral  commissioner per se, who is the chief executive officer,  and one other part-time non-judicial member. The  electoral commissioner is supported by a deputy electoral  commissioner, a first assistant commissioner responsible  for finance, three assistant commissioners and seven  electoral officers responsible for the management of  activities within individual states and territories.  Admittedly, the organisation is an electoral commission  rather than a referendums commission.  
<P>
Under New Zealand's Electoral Act 1993, its electoral  commission has four members: the Minister of Justice,  the chief judge of the Maori land court, one person  appointed by the Governor-General who is also appointed  chief executive of the commission and one person drawn  from the judiciary, appointed by the president of the  commission.  
<P>
In Canada, the functions of an electoral commission are  divided between two separate bodies. The chief electoral  officer has responsibility for administering elections and  is an officer of Parliament. The office has a single  incumbent, and I am not aware of any prescriptions about  the background of the holder of the office, which does not  appear to be designated for a High Court judge or other  such person. The commissioner of Canada elections is  responsible for ensuring that the provisions of Canadian  electoral law are enforced. Again, it would appear that  the office has a single incumbent. Those examples may  be helpful.  
<P>
Amendment No. 2, which was tabled by my hon. Friend  the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Mr. Miller), is  concerned not so much with size of the referendums  commission as with its composition. Clause 1(3) requires  the chairman of the referendums commission to be a High  Court judge. I think that the sponsors have drawn on the  precedent of the Parliamentary Boundary Commissions,  which used a similar arrangement. Under the Parliamentary  Constituencies Act 1986, the deputy chairman of each of  the four boundary commissions must also be High Court  judges, or, in the case of the boundary commission for  Scotland, a judge of the Court of Session. That reflects the  differences in the legal systems in Scotland and England  and Wales.  
<P>
The functions of a referendum commission would,  however, be very different from those of a boundary  commission, and I accept that. However, it is vital that  the chairman and members of such a body, be it a  referendums or electoral commission, are seen to be  scrupulously independent and free of party political bias.  If we are serious about addressing public concern, it is  important that people involved in the process are not seen  to be a part of it.  
<P>
Having established that principle, we need to look at  what the consequences for the composition of a  referendums commission might be. The Neill committee  concluded that the members of the electoral  commission the same is probably true of a referendums  commission should not, in the normal course of events,  have been previously involved in any substantial way in  party politics. Again, I see the logic of that. Unlike the  United States federal election commission, the United  Kingdom commission should consist, according to the  Neill committee, of independent persons, not party  representatives.     
<P>
Although the Neill committee was clear that the  electoral commission should not contain party nominees,  it did not otherwise offer a view on the nature of the  experience and skills required for such an appointment.  That is a legitimate area for concern. What background  and skills should someone carrying out such a function  have?  
<P>
The appointment of a High Court judge is one means  of ensuring independence, but it is not the only method  of ensuring that the commission is above party politics.  There is a danger, to which my hon. Friend the Member  for Broxtowe alluded, that by making such a stipulation  now, the field of possible candidates will become too  narrow. Being overly prescriptive might rule out people  with the necessary background, experience and skills.  That is not to say we should leave the door open to some  party hack, but to recognise that people with wide  experience, who may have something to contribute to the  process, might inadvertently be excluded.  
<P>
There will undoubtedly be people from a number of  different walks of life who would be equally qualified to  undertake this important role. Removing the qualification  in clause 1(3) does not exclude the possibility of  appointing a High Court judge but neither does it tie us  to such a person. Instead, it recognises that there may be  people with the necessary qualifications and experience to  carry out that function competently. The Neill committee  envisaged no such limitation. It would be as well, in these  circumstances, to accept its lead.  
<P>
An equally important factor in establishing the  independence of the referendums or electoral commission  is the method of appointment. The Bill provides for the  commissions to be appointed by the Secretary of State.  That is no different from the way in which any  non-departmental body appointment is made. The only  special provision in the Bill is to require the Secretary of  the State to obtain the agreement of the Speaker, prior to  making an appointment. That is an interesting safeguard,  and we shall certainly examine whether there is, in the  arrangements that we intend to take forward, a role for  the Speaker. There is an obvious connection there, and  expertise that could be well used.  
<P>
There may be other appropriate procedures that can be  built into the appointment process. For example, a number  of office holders, including the Comptroller and Auditor  General, who are appointed by Her Majesty following an  address presented by the House of Commons. It is  certainly worth exploring that procedure further. The  Government want to examine all those matters before  coming to a final view on the size, and composition of,  and method of appointment to, the proposed electoral  commission.  
<P>
The debate has been helpful in exploring some of the  issues and the available options, and I congratulate my  hon. Friend on raising it. I shall certainly give careful  thought to the points that were raised as we develop our  proposals for an electoral commission.

<P>

<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I shall be brief. It seems that there are two  issues. I am fairly open minded on the first, which is the  number of people to sit on the commission, but I think  that the Minister's comments on that were probably  correct and that, in view of the more restricted remit  proposed by the Bill and by the Neil committee report,  the smaller number is more appropriate. Whichever of the  two is chosen, however, I shall not lose sleep about it.  
<P>
The second issue is who should preside over the  commission as chairman. That would seem to be an  appropriate role for a High Court judge or a retired High  Court judge. The compelling reason for that is because  the actual issue that needs to be addressed is the framing  of the words of the referendum. If ever there were an issue  into which it would be sensible to have judicial input, it  is that. Framing is a narrow but crucial matter. There has  been criticism in the past it is argued that the words may  not have been framed correctly to reflect the true nature  of the referendum.  
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am sure that the hon.  Gentleman recognises that wording and framing are  matters to be discussed under the next group of  amendments. I should be grateful if he would take that  into account.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I apologise, Mr. Stevenson. I thought that  we were dealing with amendments Nos. 1 and 2 together.  
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Yes we are. I simply point out that the  wording and the construction of those words are covered  by the next group of amendments. I simply ask the hon.  Gentleman to take that into account.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I understand, Mr. Stevenson. I think that  there may have been a slight misunderstanding. I am  concerned with why it is appropriate for a justice of the  High Court to chair the commission. It seems that one of  the commission's roles will be to consider a referendum's  wording. If that is the case, the input that the chairman  can provide is crucial.     
<P>
If the chairman cannot be a High Court judge, at least  there should be a senior legal figure of some sort on the  commission. I do not think that that would be dragging  the judiciary into politics. As the Minister rightly said,  judicial figures already fulfil similar roles in the  Commonwealth and, critically, fulfil the same role on the  Boundary Commission, which deals with a politically  sensitive issue. It is precisely by having a High Court  judge that we will ensure that any discussion on issues is  kept within a narrow remit and that there is no tendency  to try to widen it into a more politicised discussion. I am  therefore in favour of having a High Court judge as  chair or, as a caveat, a retired High Court judge; I do  not object to that. There are compelling reasons why a  judicial or retired judicial figure should chair the  commission.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Frank Cook:</B> I find myself in a quandary. I  thought that we were deliberating the establishment of an  administrative device. We have heard that there is broad  political support for the principle of referendums,  although there are one or two hon. Members who are  exceptions in this Committee. But we have also heard that  there are concerns about party-political bias within the  administrative device, and that we therefore need to  increase the number of people who sit on it. If that is part  of the logic for increasing the number. I am bemused as  to why we should, in the same breath, seek to change the  chairman from a justice of the High Court to an appointee  of the Secretary of State. That runs counter to logic.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Miller:</B> I want to make it clear that that is not my  point. As regards amendment No. 1, the number should  be larger to ensure greater diversity of membership. I  specifically did not mention political balance when I  moved the amendment. Amendment No. 2 is, again, about  creating greater breadth of choice. I did not argue the  point that my hon. Friend suggested. If I catch your eye  again, Mr. Stevenson, I shall clarify the matter in response  to some of the points that the hon. Member for Tatton  rightly raised.  
<P>
<H5>12 noon  </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Cook: I am grateful for that attempt to clarify  matters, but I am still left with the impression that the  greater diversity was desirable out of a need for political  balance. In partisan terms, however, I would think that  the establishment of such a commission would not require  that. There still exists in my mind a contradiction between  the first amendment and the second. For that reason, we  should perhaps make the issue the subject of the  referendum of its own.  </B><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Does the hon. Member for Ellesmere  Port and Neston wish to speak? I was trying to rise slowly.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Miller:</B> I have to rise slowly, Mr. Stevenson.  
<P>
I want to clarify a couple of the points that have been  made. I hope that I did not suggest in my opening remarks  that I was concerned about political balance with a  capital "P"	 on the commission. My hon. Friend the  Member for Broxtowe made an important point about the  comparisons with the Pinochet argument. Certain bodies  in this country are, if one cannot divorce them from the  party-political machine, doomed to failure in terms of the  outside world's perception of them. The courts and  Speakers of this House certainly fall into that category.  That is an important consideration, which makes our  system work. It may not be the most perfect system, but  it happens to be the one that we have.     
<P>
The hon. Member for Tatton and I cross paths quite  frequently in Cheshire and we have our differences and  disagreements from time to time. However, I would never  suggest that public opinion should categorise him in the  way that it does regarding his previous or his current  occupation. That is true of the vast majority of hon.  Members in the House of Commons. It is unfortunate that  some of our procedures have resulted in such public  opinion over the years.  
<P>
It is less than helpful, however, to argue that just  because judges are held in higher regard than politicians  at present, we should accept that we will be at the bottom  of the pile for all time and, therefore, that we should not  suggest politicians as potential chairmen of the  commission. We could be talking about politicians with a  small "p"	 people who have divorced themselves from  the party-political machine by virtue of, for example,  being a Speaker of this House. I entirely agree that it  would be inappropriate to have a 24-hour-a-day party  hack as chairman. That would produce exactly the wrong  view among the public.  
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, West Derby  raised an important point, and I said that I would respond  at an appropriate time in the debate. I am concerned that  some of the steps that are being taken could diminish the  importance of the parliamentary democratic process. That  is why I want the Committee to consider how we can  keep Parliament as part of the process. Parliament will  determine whether a bill progresses and is referred to the  commission. Some form of link should be considered, and  I noted my hon. Friend the Minister's observation that the  Home Office is prepared to consider the point. I also  noted his observations about examples from other  countries such as Australia, which has a bigger  commission, New Zealand, which has a diverse  commission, and Canada, which has a single one. Perhaps  we should explore those examples further.  
<P>
In the light of what I have said, I intend to seek the  Committee's leave to withdraw the amendment. However,  I shall press amendment No. 2 to a Division.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Robathan:</B> I am interested by the hon.  Gentleman's remarks, and shall not oppose his desire to  withdraw amendment No. 1. However, the nature of the  debate suggested that Committee members believe that it  is important that the matter hinges on a judge, and should  not the hon. Gentleman therefore seek also to withdraw  amendment No. 2?  
<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth rose   </B><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am concerned that we are  going round the block again. I am sure that hon. Members  do not wish to do that.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> It is not my intention to delay the  Committee, Mr. Stevenson, but I should like to respond  to the point that was made by the hon. Member for  Beaconsfield.  
<P>
I entirely accept the hon. Gentleman's point that the  skills that a High Court judge develops in the course of  his or her career are likely to be readily transferred in this  context, and I can therefore see the sense in the proposal.  Having said that, several other occupations may involve  similar skills the Clerks of the House, for example, who  have to be seen to be politically independent. I can see  the Clerk to your left, Mr. Stevenson, warming to the  prospect as I speak. That example occurred to me as I  sat here. People with ombudsman roles may also acquire  similar types of skills.  
<P>
The more I think about it, the more I can see why my  hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe and my hon. Friend  the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston moved the  amendment. I do not want to open up the field too widely,  but merely to recognise that other occupations involve  similar or complementary skills. The matter will arise  again when we consider the electoral commission. Finally,  I reiterate that the Neill committee was silent as to  whether such a qualification should be attached to the job.  That tends to support my hon. Friend the Member for  Ellesmere Port and Neston in his argument.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Miller:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the  amendment.

<P>

<B>Dr. Palmer:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 4, in page 1, line 16, leave out from `on' to `matters' in line 18 and insert `any'.  
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss amendment  No. 5, in page 1, line 23, leave out `introduction to' and  insert `Second Reading in'.  
<P>
<B>Dr. Palmer:</B> I join the previous speakers in welcoming  you to the Chair, Mr. Stevenson. I am grateful for the  opportunity to serve on the Committee and to address  these issues. As a possible declaration of interest, I can  say that for many years I lived in Switzerland, where I  observed the referendum process at close hand. I am more  enthusiastic on the subject than some of my hon. Friends  may be. I shall try to address it in a neutral and British  way, as we would all wish.  
<P>
I offer a concrete example to illustrate the point that I  wish to make about these and later amendments. Let us  suppose that in two or three years' time there is to be a  referendum on membership of the euro. Let us suppose  also that three prominent groups would be involved in  the issue. One of the groups might be established by a  Government led by the present Prime Minister, another  by a Conservative Opposition led by the hon. Member for  Blaby after a leadership election. The third might be a  left-wing group with trade union support led, perhaps, by  my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, South (Mr. Simpson).  
<P>
Amendment No. 4 proposes that we eliminate clause  1(5)(a). At first sight, they may appear to suggest that  the wording of the question should not be addressed by  the commission. That is not what I am proposing  through the amendment. Were the amendment carried,  the subsection would read: "any matters which the  Commission believe require to be regulated in order to  ensure fair conduct."	  
<P>
If the wording is transparently biased, the commission  will find it necessary to intervene to overrule the  Government. As the clause stands, it will require the  commission to address the wording in any event. That is  an example of when a non-partisan commission might  have to take decisions that will inevitably be seen to have  a partisan import.  
<P>
The scenario that I suggested of a euro referendum can  provide an example. A Government might suggest a  wording such as, "Do you agree that Britain should end  its current isolation and join the successful euro project?"	  The commission would automatically feel in such a case  that it had to intervene because a Government had clearly  failed to conduct themselves fairly and to provide a  neutral question.  
<P>
A Government might instead propose the question, "Do  you agree that Britain should adopt the euro as its  currency?"	, or alternatively, "Do you agree that Britain  should adopt the euro as its currency and abolish the  pound?"	 Those two alternative formulations would be  identical essentially, and would be difficult to distinguish  formally, but would have a different spin if I may use a  modern term. One can imagine a pro-euro Government  proposing the first formulation and an anti-euro  Government, which nevertheless decide to consult the  people, putting the second formulation.  
<P>
What should be done in such a situation? Do we wish  to delegate to a non-partisan commission the decision as  to which formulation to use, although both can be argued  to be fair? Do we wish instead to assert that, in such a  situation, the Government should take the responsibility.  Whatever wording is used, someone is going to have to  carry the can. Judging from the experience of the Swiss  and others, there will always be arguments over the  wording. If the wording appears fair, it will pass under  the terms of the amendment. But if there is dispute  between two alternative formulations both more or less  fair it is reasonable for the Government to take  political responsibility.     
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm  </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin: The hon. Gentleman is putting forward a  serious and constructive argument. But has he noticed  that, under clause 1</B>(5), the commission is offering only  advice, so the Government will inevitably take  responsibility. We are not, after all, conferring on the  commission the duty to decide the wording.  
<P>
<B>Dr. Palmer:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a fair point.  The only problem is that, in the real world, the  Government of the day will feel almost compelled to  follow the commission's advice if the commission is  required to give it. If the independent referendums  commission advised that the wording should be different  and the Government insisted that they were going to stick  to the previous wording, that would cause outrage and  discredit the referendum. The opportunity should be  reserved for when the commission feels that the wording  is unfair, which is already covered by subsection (5)(b)  
<P>
Paragraph (b) covers fairness and paragraph (a) requires  the commission to take a view even when the question of  fairness does not arise perhaps on grounds of  completeness, far-sightedness or other criteria, which are  not the main reason for establishing the referendums  commission. That is the basis of my argument for  amendment No. 4.  
<P>
Amendment No. 5 deals with frivolous use of the  referendums commission. It is possible under the Bill for  an hon. Member of either House to introduce a 10-minute  Bill or a back-of-the-Chair Bill that requires a  referendum. For example, my hon. Friend the Member  for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn) might like to introduce a  referendum on cannabis, and I would be happy to  introduce a referendum on some aspect of animal welfare.  
<P>
Proposing a referendum could become, as with  10-minute Bills, a standard device for Back Benchers to  attract attention. Every time it happened, the machinery  of the commission would grind into motion and it would  invite individuals or bodies to apply to be a designated  referendum campaign. It would certify one individual or  body to be the designated referendum campaign and  further activity would then proceed.  
<P>
I see indications of assent from the Opposition, so I  shall not press the point further. I suggest, however, that  the amendment, by specifying Second Reading, would  effectively narrow the scope to serious attempts at a  referendum. It would still be possible for a Back Bencher  to press for a Bill for a referendum: if it passed Second  Reading, the machinery would be set in motion, which is  entirely appropriate. We should avoid the risk of frivolous  use, even though we know that all present Members of  Parliament are serious people who would never waste  time. However, it is possible that outside the House of  Commons there are people who are not as serious as we  are.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Robathan:</B> As I said, I am new to the Opposition  Front Bench, but I have noticed that Front Benchers on  both sides of the Committee sometimes get things wrong.  
<P>
I listened carefully to the hon. Member for Broxtowe,  who made a great deal of sense, although I would not  always say that about him. He is right; not every Member  of the House of Commons shares his enthusiasm for  referendums, but his words were wise, and I am happy to  accept his amendments.  
<P>
It is important that Parliament's intentions, as expressed  in debates, should be heard. There should be no bias in  the wording of a referendum; we all know that whoever  sets the question may, be able to determine the result.  However, it is entirely acceptable if the commission has  the right to determine whether a question is fair. What the  hon. Gentleman said is reasonable and understandable.  
<P>
On the matter of Second Reading, we had not  considered the frivolous nature of some Members of  Parliament God forfend that one might consider that any  Member of Parliament has a frivolous nature. As the hon.  Gentleman will know from previous debates in the  Chamber, I would not want a referendum on the use of  air guns, a subject close to the hon. Gentleman's heart.  Other members of the Committee might wish to argue  against the proposal, but I have nothing more to add.     
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I hope that when the Minister responds  he will resolve my remaining question. I originally  favoured my hon. Friend's proposal to link the moment  when the commission came into play with the  introduction of a Bill, rather than with its Second Reading.  I believed that there was a danger that a Government  might introduce legislation to enable them to hold a  referendum, hold it rapidly thereafter, and thus reduce to  the nugatory the Bill's effects. In the brief period between  introducing such a Bill and a referendum being held  weeks later, under the speculative hypothesis of an  emergency procedure in Parliament, it would be almost  impossible for the commission and the Government to do  what was necessary to ensure fair and equal funding,  access and so forth matters that we will debate in due  course.  
<P>
It was the original hope of some members of the  Committee that the rules might come into play as soon as  the subject was mooted in public. For example, at present  there are before the public at least two subjects to which  my hon. Friend referred: electoral reform and entry into  European monetary union, both of which are the subject  of popular debate Even as we speak, the Government are  spending large amounts of taxpayers' money on one of  those topics not yet on the other, I am pleased to say  officially on a campaign to inform, but really, some of us  believe, on a campaign to persuade. For those reasons we  originally wanted to push the clocking-in effect of the  commission back in time as far as possible it was the  Minister and his officials who pointed out that there was  gross difficulty about clocking in the commission when  no referendum was mooted and we therefore opted for  the first possible moment, namely, a Bill's introduction.  
<P>
The hon. Member for Broxtowe made a good and  convincing case for supposing that the Committee, in its  enthusiasm for the earliest moment, missed the point  about the frivolous use of referendums. Far be it from me  to suggest that the Bill should create an elaborate  machinery if, as an unintended by-product, that  diminishes the force of that machinery each time that  private Members make a silly attempt to gain publicity.  
<P>
A reassurance from the Minister would help. Even if it  had no legal force, it would have some political force.  Will he assure us that the Government do not intend to  act in such haste between the Second Reading of a  referendum Bill and the holding of a referendum that the  mechanics described in the Bill would become nugatory?  If such a reassurance appeared in Hansard, it would give  us some political levers to pull.  
<P>
I hope that the Minister will not continue to make the  false assumption that the Bill will necessarily fail simply  because the Government want it to fail. It has had its  Second Reading, and the Committee is meant to consider  this Bill and not future Government proposals. Therefore,  I hope that he will tell us what would happen if the Bill  were enacted. If the amendment tabled by the hon.  Member for Broxtowe were accepted, can the Minister  guarantee that he would not so accelerate the process that  the commission's role would become nugatory?

<P>

<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> As my hon. Friend the Member  for Broxtowe made clear, amendment No. 4 would  remove from the referendums commission the specific  duty provided in clause 1(5) to advise and to report on  the question in any proposed referendum. That is right. It  was not a role proposed by the Neill committee for the  Electoral Commission, and even the Nairne commission  recognised that the wording of the question in any  referendum was a matter for Parliament to decide. I  support that view, as would most members of the House  and possibly most members of the Committee.  
<P>
In any event, if, as the clause envisages, the  commission is to be given a broad advisory role in relation  to particular referendums, I do not see the case for  singling out the wording of the question for special  treatment. Therefore, the amendment, which my hon.  Friend so typically thoughtfully moved, is sensible.  
<P>
On amendment No. 5, I appreciate the case that my  hon. Friend made for the proposed change. There is an  argument for deferring any action by the referendums  commission, in respect of designation of referendum  campaign organisations, until one or other House of  Parliament has supported, on Second Reading, the case  for a particular referendum. However, once the  Government take a decision to hold a referendum, the  referendums commission or under the Neill scheme,  the Electoral Commission may need to move swiftly.  
<P>
For example, in 1975, there were only 71 days between  the introduction of the Referendum Bill in the House of  Commons and the date of the referendum. We recall that  campaign with varying degrees of horror, amazement or  delight, depending on one's point of view. The hon.  Member for Blaby has heard me say this before, but at  that time I was a young socialist in Huyton.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Robathan:</B> A what?  
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> A young socialist, as distinct from an  old socialist. Hon. Members will appreciate that the  Member of Parliament for Huyton at that time was of  course the late Harold Wilson, the Prime Minister  supporting the vote to stay in the common market which  the previous Conservative Government had taken us into.  The no campaign in Huyton a pretty forlorn group, I  might add consisted of me as secretary of the Huyton  young socialists, a Conservative couple who ran a dance  school   
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm  </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman: Order. I am listening with great  interest to the Minister's autobiography, but I am waiting  with equal patience for him to get back to the point he  wants to make.  </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> It is all to do with timing. The third  great force in this wonderful political movement was a  representative of the Communist party, a park keeper who  was well known for wearing jack boots. To this day I can  feel their imprint on my backside as a youngster in that  park. I therefore have some experience of this, although I  will not press that point any further.  
<P>
<B>Dr. Palmer:</B> Clause 2 states that  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the Commission shall invite individuals or bodies"	   
<P>
</UL></FONT>  
<P>
that will be as soon as possible after Second Reading if  the amendment is carried. There is nothing to prevent it  from doing so anyway if it is clear that a serious attempt  is being made to have a referendum for instance, that  the Government have announced their intention to do so.  Any serious-minded commission would leap immediately  to that task, knowing that once Second Reading had come,  it would be bound to do so anyway.     
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> My hon. Friend is right. The point that  I was making before I allowed myself to be so  inappropriately diverted was that there were only 71 days  between the introduction of the Referendum Bill in the  House of Commons and the date of the referendum. The  problem is that it would barely allow enough time to  invite and consider applications for designation as a  referendum campaign organisation. that is an  administrative problem that could have political  ramifications if it was not handled properly.  
<P>
If the starting gun was not fired until the Second  Reading a number of valuable days would be lost. On  balance, therefore, there may be some slight advantage  in going with the date of introduction. The amendment  highlights the need for this provision to be more carefully  drafted and thought out. I do not mean that as a criticism  of the hon. Member for Blaby; it is just that my hon.  Friend the Member for Broxtowe has made an interesting  and important point.  
<P>
Perhaps we could look at making a distinction between  Government-sponsored Bills which, as my hon. Friend  says, are a serious statement of intention, and a  referendum which might be introduced through one or  other of the private Member's procedures and which  could have a serious chance of becoming a referendum  issue or could simply have been a Bill presented "behind  the Chair"	. We would need to make that distinction.  
<P>
It may be wrong to use the word "frivolous"	, but there  are issues on which an individual Member may feel  passionately. He may try to move it forward through some  private Member's legislation for which there would be  little, if any, support in the rest of the House. That would  be an inappropriate starting signal too. Perhaps we should  make the distinction between serious attempts those  which a Government intend to move to a referendum  and less serious attempts made through private Member's  legislation. It is a good point, well made by my hon.  Friend the Member for Broxtowe and it is one that I  would want to reflect on.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Flynn:</B> I am glad that the amendment has been  proposed. I was delighted to hear that the hon. Member  for Broxtowe has lived in Switzerland and is well used to  the many referendums held there. I look forward to future  debates with him. Although I support the amendments, I  do not entirely agree with the reasons that the hon.  Gentleman gave for tabling them, or the distinction  between a serious or frivolous subject.  
<P>
Who decides whether an issue is serious or frivolous?  Many people would say that capital punishment is a  serious subject. If it were put to a referendum, there would  almost certainly be a call for capital punishment to be  restored, which would be an impossible choice for  Parliament and any British Government. We could not  stay in the Council of Europe. We would be on the level  of Ukraine, which is teetering on the brink of expulsion  from the Council of Europe on that issue.  
<P>
How do we equate that with other issues and useful  reforms on which the Government are at odds with public  opinion? I believe that the Government are being cruel  and unfair to seriously sick people by denying them one  of the world's most ancient medicines. They have not  only denied the medicine, but have put two people in jail.  Many of us would regard that as an outrage, and a matter  fit for a referendum. We shall have to grapple with these  serious problems when we consider the issues that have  been covered by referendums.  
<P>
Wales is committed to the possibility of having a  referendum every 10 years on the opening of public  houses. There have been referendums in the past, and  there will be referendums in the future which are specific  to the separate nations of Great Britain. We may find that  we are unable to distinguish in our own subjective  judgment between frivolous and deeply serious issues.     
<P>
<B>Dr. Palmer:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Members who  have commented on my amendments. I apologise for  inadvertently introducing the concept of frivolous  legislation which, as my hon. Friend the Member for  Newport, West said, is a subjective matter. The point that  I was trying to make was that there may be some hon.  Members who are so opposed to referendums that they  set out deliberately to bring the process into disrepute by  suggesting having one after another. We have to protect  ourselves against that happening. Even if it did not happen  immediately, it could happen in the future.  
<P>
As a humble Back Bencher, I am not entirely  enthusiastic about the distinction suggested by my hon.  Friend the Minister between serious Government  legislation and less serious private legislation.  
<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> I was merely using that as an  illustration. I was not saying that that should be the only  consideration.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Before the hon. Gentleman continues, will  he react to the suggestion that we could distinguish  between a mandatory obligation and permission, enabling  the commission to introduce the mechanics earlier, but  making it mandatory only at Second Reading?  
<P>
<B>Dr. Palmer:</B> The hon. Gentleman reads my mind. I  was thinking along those lines. There are two ways of  addressing the issue. We are all aware that there are some  proposals for referendums that have a serious chance of  happening, and some that do not. We are trying to  formulate a way that is neither offensive nor unrealistic.  An option is to leave the proposal as it stands and take  account of the fact that there is nothing in the Bill that  prevents the commission from taking action earlier, if it  wishes to do so. All the preliminary activities of  identifying groups and selecting one for each possible  outcome could be done without significant expenditure by  the commission and without requiring fresh authority to  do so, so that it would be ready to go after Second  Reading.  
<P>
An alternative provision, which would have to be in  the form of an amendment perhaps introduced on Report,  would be to change the wording "As soon as possible  after Second Reading"	 to "As soon as the Commission  may consider it appropriate"	. The commission could then  decide whether to take such action in respect of a  particular referendum. I realise that I am straying on the  fringes of the permissible, but could such a provision be  considered as an alternative to the amendment?  
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I have had the advantage of receiving  advice from my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield.  There are at least grounds for doubt whether, in the  absence of a further change, the amendment would not  make it ultra vires for the commission to act early. That  problem must be addressed.

<B>Dr. Palmer:</B> I am grateful for that clarification. I bow  to colleagues with greater legal experience than me, but  if the Government attempted to rush through a  referendum, as the hon. Member for West Dorset  suggested, the referendum would be illegal because all the  requirements laid down under later clauses could not be  implemented in the time required. For example,  apparently it would be illegal for the BBC and other  broadcasting services   
<P>
<B>The Chairman :</B> Order. I am listening with great care  to the hon. Gentleman's contribution to the debate, but he  must not pre-judge what will happen under later clauses.  
<P>
<B>Dr. Palmer:</B> I am grateful for your assistance, Mr. Stevenson. The best course of action is for me not to  press amendment No. 5 to a Division, but to invite  members of the Committee to consider introducing an  amendment on Report.  
<P>
Amendment No. 4 has received consent from those  members of the Committee who have spoken so far. The  provision concerning  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the wording of any question"	  
<P>
</UL></FONT>  
<P>
is an appropriate area that the commission might wish to  consider in respect of a particular referendum if it felt  that fair conduct was being prejudiced. Otherwise, as the  Minister suggested, the wording is usually a matter for  Parliament to decide.  
<P>
International experience suggests that if the movers of  a referendum put forward wording that was clearly unfair,  they would seriously prejudice their chances of getting it  through. Such matters backfire easily. I ask for permission  to withdraw amendment No. 5. I should be grateful for  your guidance, Mr. Stevenson, on how to proceed.  
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I shall inform the hon. Gentleman of  the procedure if, and when, we come to amendment No. 5.  
<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> I wish to make two points, the  first being that of invitations being issued to campaigns  only after Second Reading and the seriousness of any  contacts that are made prior to that. That raises a  difficulty. I can imagine that a commission, whether an  electoral commission or a referendum commission, could  have informal contact before the Bill is debated on Second  Reading, but the invitation to any such preliminary  discussions would inevitably be seen as being part of a  process that could lead to the award of public funds to  campaigns. There would need to be some statutory cover  for that process or it would create the problem of  something that began as informal becoming more formal  and the prelude to the awarding of public funds. That  would cause people difficulty.  
<P>
There would also be difficulty in making a commission,  no matter how serious, well-established and well-led,  decide whether a referendum proposal were frivolous or  serious. I say that for two reasons. I have already got into  hot water with my hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe  by having to reconcile what I said with what I intended  to say, and were I to attempt to define frivolity and  seriousness, I would surely get into further difficulties;  clearly, such a definition is not an easy one. Secondly  this is a serious point that we should not disregard to  devolve such a power to a commission or individual  would be to give away the sovereignty of Parliament  itself.  
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm  </H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve: I have been trying to think about when it  would be appropriate for the commission to swing into  action. I take the Minister's point; one wants to avoid  the imprint of the commission being seen as somehow  sanctioning a referendum campaign and its role thereby  being politicised. Might one approach it by saying that  any referendum proposed by the Government is likely to  be serious and that we could, as has been suggested,  therefore keep the Second Reading trigger point while  giving the commission discretion to cut in earlier on a  Government-sponsored referendum Bill?     </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> That is an interesting way of looking at  things; the hon. gentleman demonstrates that we are  engaged in a process, not all of which has been fully  worked out. I want to give more thought to that before  we make a final decision on how the electoral commission  18 to function. The debate has raised some interesting  points that need careful consideration. We need to decide  whether to accept the amendments of my hon. Friend the  Member for Broxtowe, what arrangements are appropriate  for Parliament and the commission and what is or is not  a serious referendum. Those are difficult areas, as our  debate has amply demonstrated.  
<P>
<B>Dr. Palmer:</B> The debate has shown that the original  drafting and my amendments are incomplete solutions to  the problem. The proposal of the hon. Member for  Beconsfield could provide a way forward. I feel unease  about distinguishing in legislation between Government  and other Bills, because Parliament is sovereign and the  origin of a Bill should not be relevant. However, I am  happy not to press amendment No. 5.  
<P>
Amendment agreed to.  
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand  part of the Bill.  
<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> The Government accept that it  is appropriate to look carefully at the role of referendums  and to decide whether any new machinery is needed. The  case for doing so is undoubtedly greater now, given the  part that referendums play in our conduct of politics.  
<P>
The Government were elected with a commitment to  make a number of constitutional reforms. We used  referendums on the question of devolution in Scotland and  Wales, on the establishment of the Greater London  authority and on the acceptance of the Good Friday  agreement to ensure that those major decisions were made  with the support of the people affected. Our manifesto  committed us to hold further referendums on the single  currency, the introduction of regional government in  England and changing the voting system for elections to  the House of Commons. Indeed, when the latter was  debated in the House recently, my right hon. Friend the  Home Secretary was elusive, expressing doubt about  where he stood on the subject.  
<P>
Given that agenda, clause 1, in which the hon. Member  for Blaby sets out the arrangements that he would like to  put in place, raises important issues that need to be  addressed. The increasing use of referendums is a good  reason to establish a new and settled machinery for their  conduct. A strong case can be made for giving a separate  and independent body the clear role of ensuring that a  measure of distance exists between the Government and  the regulations covering the conduct of referendums.     
<P>
The difference between the hon. Member for Blaby and  the Government is whether to deal with Neill as a  package, which implies setting up an electoral  commission and implementing others of the Neill  committee's recommendations, or whether to create a  body dedicated only to referendums a body that the hon.  Gentleman accepts might disappear once the Neill  recommendations are fully implemented.  
<P>
A forceful case has been made by the Nairne  commission; I know that, in drafting the Bill, the hon.  Member for Blaby gave great consideration to its work,  particularly its report of November 1996, and the work of  the Nolan Committee on Standards in Public Life on the  funding of political parties. The two bodies differ little in  their prescriptions. Neill recommends the creation of an  electoral commission with a range of functions, including  administering controls on political parties' income and  expenditure, the review of electoral law and responsibility  for ensuring the fair conduct of referendums.  
<P>
The Government have stated our intention to legislate  for the establishment of an electoral commission. We are  giving careful consideration to the scope of its functions.  We see no advantage in establishing a new public body  with the remit set out in the Bill. That is not because the  proposed functions of the body are themselves  objectionable. I think that I have made it clear that that is  not so. Some of the Bill's proposals are welcome, but its  provisions are narrow, and limited in their effect.  
<P>
As the Neill committee argued, an effective regime for  the fair conduct of referendums, including the public  funding of campaign bodies, should fit seamlessly into a  broad and coherent scheme for regulating the funding of  the political process generally. The Government do not  wish to legislate for any part of any scheme in such a  way as only to complicate the business of implementing  the rest.  
<P>
Furthermore, in the absence of an imminent  referendum, the regulation of referendums seems no better  a candidate for immediate legislation than any other part  of the Neill committee's recommendations. For example,  why are we not debating limits on published donations,  or on campaign spending?  
<P>
<B> The Chairman:</B> Order. I realise that this is a clause  stand part debate, but I am worried that the Minister is  moving to wider issues.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I am grateful for your guidance, Mr.  Stevenson. I merely wanted to say that, in the absence of  another suitable body, the interim arrangements, as set out  in the part of the Bill that relates to functions, create a  body with a narrow purpose and that, as there is no  immediate prospect of a referendum, a problem arises  with the logic of that.  
<P>
On the detail of the clause, subsection (2) provides for  a commission comprising a chairman and up to four other  members appointed by the Secretary of State. In other  words, it would be a standard non-departmental public  body, examples of which can be found throughout  Government Departments. The Neill committee  recommended that the electoral commission should be an  independent, impartial body selected by a non-partisan,  impartial procedure. It stressed that it should be  independent of Government. It would be difficult, given  the political sensitivities of an electoral commission's  functions or, for that matter, those of a referendums  commission, to disagree. For most public bodies it may  be appropriate to leave appointments in the hands of  Ministers, but we may have to use a different approach in  this case. Whether it is appropriate for Ministers to have  that flexibility is open to question.  
<P>
The requirement in subsection (4) for the agreement of  the Speaker to any appointments to the committee might  go some way to delivering a body that will be seen to  be independent, but not enough of the way. Again, Neill  suggested much greater distance between the body and  the Government of the day than is implicit in the  arrangements.  
<P>
Doubt about the extent of the body's independence is  not lessened by the fact that the Bill does not contain a  provision relating to how the budget for the referendum  commission would be set, or for it to be drawn on a  departmental vote. I assume that the intention is that the  referendum commission's budget should form part of the  Home Office vote. However, Neill stated clearly that the  independence of an electoral commission would not be  well served by the sort of arrangements implied by that,  and that consideration should be given to setting up a  body on the model of the National Audit Office.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am looking at the clause with  great care, but I see no reference to the budget or the  National Audit Office, and so on. I again make a plea to  the hon. Gentleman to stick to the clause.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I am grateful for that ruling, Mr. Stevenson, but the National Audit Office model might  be suitable for the hon. Member for Blaby and the  Committee to consider later.  
<P>
It is also usual for a Bill to establish such a body to  make provision for the conditions of service and  remuneration of the commissioners, the appointment and  conditions of service of support staff, or provisions  relating to its procedure. There is no provision for that in  the hon. Gentleman's Bill.  
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am having a problem with  this and I am sure that the Minister will want to  accommodate me. He should not refer to matters that are  not in the clause. That is a fair point to put to him.  
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> Absolutely, Mr. Stevenson. I am  grateful for your guidance.  
<P>
My concern is that we have debated some issues in the  Bill relating to the number of people who would serve on  the referendums commission, and the type of people who  might be appointed to act as chairmen, but I do not think  that we have resolved them satisfactorily. The debate has  been useful. I have listened with care to every word. I do  not think that I have left the Room once. But more matters  need to be considered before we can be satisfied that  clause 1 is the final
