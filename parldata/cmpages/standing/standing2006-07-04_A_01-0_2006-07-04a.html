Chairman:</b> I remind the Committee that there is a money
resolution in connection with the Bill, copies of which are available
in the room. As a general rule, adequate notice should be given of
amendments. I and my fellow Chairman do not intend to call starred
amendments, including any that may be reached during an afternoon
sitting of the Committee. Given the weather forecast for today, hon.
Gentlemen may remove their jackets. I call the Minister to move the
programme

to serve under your chairmanship, Mrs. Humble. The Committee has the
privilege of considering a Bill that will make a real difference to the
charities and people of this country. As I said on Second Reading, it
has been well researched, having been the subject of the strategy unit
report of 2002 and well examined by the Joint Committee. I welcome the
fact that the programme motion will allow 20 hours of debate in
Committee.</div> <a name="06070467000013"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government will approach the Bill in a charitable spirit, listen to
arguments that are made by hon. Members on both sides of the Committee
and take on board those suggestions that make sense and which will
contribute toward a better Bill. I am delighted to be ably assisted by
my hon. Friend the Member for Erewash (Liz Blackman), the Government
Whip. As a former teacher, she will ensure good order and
behaviour&#151;at least on our side. The Bill&#146;s scrutiny will
be improved by the Opposition spokesmen, the hon. Member for Cheltenham
(Martin Horwood), who has direct experience of working in some of our
major 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column3" />Column number: 4</div>charities, and the hon. Member for Isle of Wight (Mr. Turner),
who is well known for his diligence and attention to
detail.</div><a name="06070467000014"></a><div class="hs_Para">We also have a
wealth of wisdom and expertise on the Government Benches, including
that of my right hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth
(Alun Michael), the former deputy Home Secretary, and my hon. Friend
the Member for High Peak (Tom Levitt), the chair of the all-party group
on the community and voluntary sector, and many other talented
Members.</div> <a name="06070467000015"></a><div class="hs_Para">We all agree
that the proper scrutiny of the Bill is an important service that
Parliament owes to the charities of this country, so we on the
Government side will keep our contributions short and to the point, so
that all clauses of the Bill can be considered
properly.</div><a name="06070467000016"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06070467000355"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Andrew Turner</b> (Isle of Wight) (Con): Mrs. Humble, it is a
pleasure to serve under your chairmanship. As the Parliamentary
Secretary said, the Bill is important and presents a huge number of
opportunities for charities. We shall do our best to scrutinise it in
an effective manner and not waste time. We are anxious to ensure that
it is examined in an even fashion, not least because part 3 was not as
vigorously scrutinised in another place as some other parts have
been.</div> <a name="06070467000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">As a former
teacher, I assure the Parliamentary Secretary that that qualification
does not enable anyone to impose discipline on anyone else. It is far
more a matter of personality than of former occupation. However,
Opposition Members will do their best to scrutinise the Bill in the
expected
manner.</div><a name="06070467000018"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070467000358"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b><b class="B"> </b>Mrs. Humble, I echo the comments of the
other Front-Bench spokesmen and express my gratitude for your
chairmanship, which I am sure will enlighten what may in some respects
be a heated debate. I congratulate the Minister on the tone of his
introduction to our proceedings and on his approach to the Bill
generally. It is much appreciated. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column4" />Column number: 5</div>Like the hon. Member for Isle of Wight, I think that, although members
of the Committee will undoubtedly disagree on certain matters, the
general tone of the debate will be constructive and intended to improve
the quality of the
Bill.</div><a name="06070467000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 70
would remove subsection (2), which seems to lock inconsistency into
charity law. That raises a general issue for many charities,
particularly those membership and fundraising organisations that often
confer minimal benefits, such as newsletters or membership of a scheme,
in return for otherwise charitable donations, and which in the past
have struggled with numerous definitions of what is and what is not
charitable.</div> <a name="06070467000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
example, let us suppose that a membership organisation or another
organisation wished to launch a fundraising scheme&#151;not a formal
membership drive, but a fundraising scheme that is designed to attract
members and which offers in return some modest benefit, such as visits
to premises or a newsletter. The mere fact that it is a charitable
organisation would not in the past have been sufficient to convince the
Inland Revenue or Her Majesty&#146;s Customs and Excise that the
proposed scheme was fully charitable. It would have been necessary for
the charity to go through another set of hoops to satisfy the Inland
Revenue and qualify for gift aid, and through another, different set of
hoops to persuade Customs and Excise that it should not carry
VAT.</div><a name="06070467000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">The merger of
Customs and Excise and the Inland Revenue into Her Majesty&#146;s
Revenue and Customs seemed to offer the prospect of ironing out that
type of inconsistency. That was an encouraging sign of joined-up
government, but I talked to a fundraiser the other day who said that,
if anything, the situation seems to have got worse since the merger.
There is clearly an issue for the Government to address, if not through
the amendment then by other means, and I would be grateful for the
Minister&#146;s
comments.</div><a name="06070467000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No.1, tabled by the hon. Member for Isle of Wight would
insert:</div><a name="06070467000279"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the promotion of
the efficiency of the police service or the advancement of welfare for
police officers or former police offers and their
dependants;&#148;</div> <a name="06070467000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is a
worthy cause, which should be regarded as charitable and which deserves
our complete support. My only slight reservation is that we already
have 13 heads of charity. If we added everything that we can think of,
we could end up with a list that is hundreds
long.</div><a name="06070467000030"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06070467000359"></a><b class="B">Alun
Michael</b> (Cardiff, South and Penarth) (Lab/Co-op): How
would the hon. Gentleman support that amendment? As he said, it seems
worthy of support, in theory and at first blush, but how would he deal
with firefighters, those who man lifeboats and members of similar
professions that provide a distinct and special
service?</div><a name="06070467000031"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070467000360"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> That is a reasonable point. However, part of one
of the new heads of charity is &#147;the saving of lives&#148;,
which might encompass both of the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s
suggested examples. On the one hand, the amendment might seem to be
over-egging the pudding somewhat, but on the other hand, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column5" />Column number: 6</div>this is probably the last opportunity that anyone has to add to the list
of 13, and I have no problem with making it a list of 14. I would be
happy to see the amendment made: it seems harmless if not entirely
necessary, given that provisions for analogous charitable purposes
might well have allowed the subject of the amendment to pass through as
a charitable
purpose.</div><a name="06070467000032"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06070467000361"></a><b class="B">Tom
Levitt</b> (High Peak) (Lab): I am intrigued as to whether we
are going to have two weeks of debate on amendments promoted on the
basis that they are harmless, albeit not entirely necessary. Will the
hon. Gentleman clarify that that is not the approach he will be taking
to the Bill as a
whole?</div><a name="06070467000033"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070467000362"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that
intervention, which I am sure was made in the friendly spirit of the
debate. In general, we should not seek to add unnecessary provisions,
but as I said, this is the last opportunity to add to the list of 13. I
see no problem with adding what the amendment proposes.</div>
<a name="06070467000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 2 is much more
serious. It would replace the hard-negotiated provision that emerged
from another place, which does not seek to define religion but does at
least say that religion includes:</div>
<a name="06070467000280"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;(i) a religion which involves
belief in more than one god,
and</div><a name="06070467000281"></a><div class="hs_brev">(ii) a religion which does
not involve a belief in a
god&#148;.</div><a name="06070467000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is quite an
important and thoughtful provision in the Bill as it stands. The hon.
Member for Isle of Wight wishes to replace it with what seems to be an
attempt to define religion&#151;a brave thing for a politician to do.
However, there are many examples of religions that might not pass the
test set out in the amendment.</div>
<a name="06070467000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">Belief in a god is not the only
critical factor in a religion. Many religions regard the universe and
everything in it, including any beings such as gods or deities, as
within nature and one part of a whole. Theravada Buddhism, Taoism and,
arguably, many disciplines within Hinduism might present their beliefs
as &#147;all within nature&#148;, so to them the idea of anything
being supernatural would be meaningless. Amendment No. 2 would
therefore be difficult for many eastern religions to accept.</div>
<a name="06070467000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">I suspect, however, that the
amendment is aimed not at eastern religions but at those people who
have no belief in God. The important element of the amendment may be
its removal of the reference
to</div><a name="06070467000282"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;religion which does
not involve belief in a god&#148;.</div>
<a name="06070467000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">In other words, it is aimed at those
secularists and humanists who have religious instincts but do not
believe in a deity. According to the last census, 17 per cent. of my
constituents fall into that category. It is not for us, using the
Charities Bill, to say that according to our definition such people do
not have a religious belief. Humanists have strong ethical and moral
positions on many issues and canons of conduct derived from moral and
philosophical beliefs. To deny that they are religious in the same
sense as people who happen to believe in a deity is insulting to their
beliefs. They have a sense of awe and wonder at the universe and the
natural world and take great inspiration from the majesty of nature and
its processes. That they do not fall into the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
category of having</div>
<a name="06070467000283"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;belief in a supernatural
principle&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column6" />Column number: 7</div><a name="06070467000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">does not mean that they are not religious
in the sense that the Bill is trying to
suggest.</div><a name="06070467000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">Even some
parts of the Church of England might have a problem with the amendment.
Some dioceses might take issue with having to believe in a god as
defined in the Bill. I can imagine a diocese losing its charitable
status one day after the bishop reflects on his theology course and
decides that he does not believe in God after all, or at least not in
the sense that is popularly
intended.</div><a name="06070467000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many
organisations, including devout religious organisations such as the
Association for British Muslims, are perfectly happy with the current
phraseology. The association wrote to me and, I suspect, to other hon.
Members to say that the clause will remove the requirement that
religion, in charity law, necessarily involves worship of a supreme
being and will open the way for religion to be interpreted broadly and
on international human rights principles. Before the Bill left the
House of Lords, Lord Bassam accepted that worship was not a necessary
component of religion in charity law. According to the Association for
British Muslims, that appeared to be a satisfactory conclusion to the
definition question, and the association went on to query the Charity
Commission&#146;s intentions in respect of implementing the clause
sufficiently liberally.</div>
<a name="06070467000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause, which has commanded
widespread support, was the subject of thoughtful negotiation. We
should not overturn it hastily in favour of the idea of a supernatural
principle, which is open to a lot of
interpretation.</div><a name="06070467000043"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06070467000363"></a><b class="B">James
Duddridge</b> (Rochford and Southend, East) (Con): I am
unclear whether the hon. Gentleman&#146;s main problem is with the
deletion of lines 26 and 27, or with the insertion of the wording
proposed in the amendment. The wording comes from Australian law, where
it is used quite satisfactorily.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070467000364"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> One is probably intended to achieve the other.
There is clearly a problem with trying to define religion using the
term &#147;supernatural principle&#148;, which may well not apply
to many religious traditions, whether they involve belief in a god or
not. There is also a problem with taking out those two lines, which
were thoughtfully negotiated and would guarantee charitable status for
traditions that do not involve belief in a single
god.</div><a name="06070467000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not
attempting to demonstrate that my view on religion or the definition of
religion, my interpretation of humanism as religion or even my
interpretation of Theravada Buddhism or Taoism is absolutely correct. I
am simply pointing out that the issue is a minefield into which
politicians should not stray. The hon. Member for Isle of Wight would
be wise to withdraw his
amendment.</div><a name="06070467000325"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070467000365"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> I am of course grateful for the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s unsolicited advice, but does he really mean it when
he says that humanism is a form of
religion?</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column7" />Column number: 8</div><a name="06070467000047"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070467000366"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> The existing charity law allows charitable status
to the British Humanist Association, so I hesitate to contradict our
learned judges in their judgment that humanism counts as a religion.
There is an organisation that I believe calls itself the organisation
of religious humanists&#151;I do not remember the exact
name&#151;which has sought to attach to humanism certain ceremonials
and rituals and some of the outward forms of traditional religion. The
concept is a moveable feast, therefore, and we should hesitate before
defining things too closely in the Bill. Existing charity law has been
quite adequate in this respect and the new draft Bill provides
satisfactory
clarification.</div><a name="06070467000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are also considering amendment No. 3, which appears to be intended to
remove the clause that would make charitable purposes and public
benefit retrospective. I need to listen to the arguments of the hon.
Member for Isle of Wight before passing judgment on that. I suspect
that amendment No. 53 is the chess amendment, which seeks to remove the
requirement for physical exertion in schools as part of the definition
of sport. I have a lot of sympathy with that. It might also apply to
other, motorised forms of sport that might also pretty clearly count as
sport. The Bill&#146;s requirement of physical exertion seems
slightly unnecessary, although if the brain is an organ and is exerted
in the process of playing chess, that may be physical exertion of a
kind.</div> <a name="06070467000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">We could
consider an amendment that would define sport as anything that ever
appeared in the old BBC programme &#147;Grandstand&#148;, which
seemed to cover just about everything, but I suspect that the lawyers
would not like that. However, I am sympathetic to the amendment and I
look forward to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s supporting
comments.</div><a name="06070467000050"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070467000367"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> I shall come to the amendment proposed by the hon.
Member for Cheltenham at the end of my remarks, because it ties in well
with my amendment No. 3. It is appropriate to start, however, with
amendment No. 1, as he has offered his somewhat qualified support for
it. It proposes the inclusion of the promotion of the efficiency of the
police service and welfare of police dependants as a specified
charitable purpose.</div><a name="06070467000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am grateful to the Police Dependants Trust for giving me information on
the amendment. The trust spends something like &#163;1.9 million a
year in support of police officers, former police officers and their
families. It helps some 5,000 families, a number which the trust
estimates to be approximately one fifth of the number of families that
could be registered and that should perhaps be helped. It was set up
after the tragic death of three police officers in Shepherd&#146;s
Bush in 1966, which I think was the first occasion when the murder of
police officers made an impact on my growing intellect. My intellect
may not have grown very far, but that event impacted on it at the time.
The trust is a small and efficient organisation that was set up to
support the welfare departments of a number of constabularies. However,
other organisations would benefit from the amendment as
well&#151;many constabularies have their own police
charities.</div> <a name="06070467000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
proposing the inclusion of the provision because there has been some
concern in the trust that it may be excluded if it is not specifically
included in the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column8" />Column number: 9</div>definition in clause 2(2). Its argument is that police officers occupy a
unique position in British society as officers of the Crown, whose
daily responsibility is to put themselves in harm&#146;s way. I do
not for a moment exclude those other representatives of emergency
provisions, such as the fire service, the ambulance service and the
Royal National Lifeboat Institution to which the right hon. Member for
Cardiff, South and Penarth (Alun Michael) referred a moment
ago.</div><a name="06070467000053"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070467000368"></a>Alun
Michael:</b> Is not the answer the same in respect of the
police as it is in respect of those organisations and professions, in
that there is no obstacle to charitable registration under the Bill, as
drafted? Indeed, is it not the case that the Police Dependants Trust is
registered as a charity and there is no suggestion that it would cease
to be so if the Bill were
enacted?</div><a name="06070467000054"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070467000369"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> I suspect that the same argument could be advanced
in respect of clause 2(2)(l), which was added to the Bill in another
place for the
promotion</div><a name="06070467000284"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;of the
efficiency of the armed forces of the
Crown&#148;</div><a name="06070467000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">to be considered a
recognised charitable purpose. That seems to represent a similar
recognition of the particular role of the police in serving the
community and putting themselves at
risk.</div><a name="06070467000056"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070467000370"></a>Alun
Michael:</b> Is not the argument that, having extended the
provision to one particular activity, where do we stop? The hon.
Gentleman seeks to extend matters in the same way. We could argue that,
in another place, they went further than they needed to although a
tradition in both Houses that goes back to almost the first Act of
Parliament required that people practise with bows and arrows so that
they were ready when they were called to the armed services. We could
say that there is a long-standing tradition in the armed services that
needs to be treasured in the same way that we treasure arcane and
out-of-date legislation, and that it should stay rather than seeming to
dilute and diminish the category that was added by their
lordships.</div><a name="06070467000057"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070467000371"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> Perhaps we need to reinstate a charitable purpose
that had been a charitable purpose until the beginning of the 20th
century in respect of the practice of defending oneself and
one&#146;s family by the use of arms. That charitable purpose has
somewhat disappeared in recent years, but I do not believe that a
distinction can be drawn except on the basis of antiquity. One of the
things that the Bill is meant to do is to bring charity law up to date,
so it would not do any harm to include the welfare of police officers
and their dependants, particularly because the Home Office and the
police force seem to be withdrawing from becoming involved in such
work. That is not because of any malice, but because they want to focus
their funds and resources on front-line policing. The funding of police
welfare and its provision have suffered and there is a need for a
charity such as that to remain
involved.</div><a name="06070467000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of the
worries that has been drawn to my attention is that the charity
commissioners have inspected some police welfare funds and advised them
that they are in danger of not being recognised as 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column9" />Column number: 10</div>charitable organisations. That is on the basis of those
funds&#151;those charities&#151;making what they consider to be the
best decisions about the deployment of their resources in the interests
of their beneficiaries. The problem may be the application of the
public benefit test that we shall come to later in our debate rather
than clause 2, but I am worried&#151;as is the Police Dependants
Trust&#151;that too tight a definition of the purpose of the charity
could restrict the activities of the trust. It says that its chairman,
Norrie Flowers, repeatedly approached the Parliamentary
Secretary&#146;s predecessors who were responsible for such matters
and those at the Home Office for support for the amendment, but they
did not agree with
it.</div><a name="06070467000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">The letter that I
have received from the Charity Commission on its treatment of the
Police Dependants Trust and similar charities&#151;I am referring to
a similar charity in this case&#151;tells me that charities have
certainly received formal reviews from the Charity Commission. The
commission tells me that such visits are not inspections, but that they
are designed to ensure compliance with the legal framework and to
advise on good practice. The commission says that it was picking up on
the charities because they did not apply a particular test when
allocating resources in the interests of needy dependants of police
officers and former police
officers.</div><a name="06070467000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
worrying that the Charity Commission is imposing such a restrictive
test that the Police Dependants Trust and other charities fear that
they may be squeezed out. Clause 1(1) states that</div>
<a name="06070467000285"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147; &#145;charity&#146; means an
institution
which&#151;</div><a name="06070467000286"></a><div class="hs_brev">is
established for charitable purposes
only&#148;.</div><a name="06070467000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is why I
believe that it is appropriate to include the Police Dependants Trust
and other such organisations within the definition: they have been
advised that giving a Christmas bonus to police widows is not a
charitable purpose, because it does not involve an assessment of need,
and that is why the trust has asked for the amendment. I think that it
is frankly silly of the Charity Commission to be so pernickety in the
way that they advise, inspect and review small charities, and to expect
charities to be so pernickety as well. Nevertheless, that is the advice
that the commission has given, and that is why I want the Bill to be
amended.</div><a name="06070467000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the hon.
Member for Cheltenham said, amendment No. 2 is designed to introduce a
clear definition of religion. Contrary to what he said about clause
2(3) being negotiated and agreed, the Committee that scrutinised the
draft Bill said that more needed to be done about the definition of
religion. The Committee made some proposals, but the reason for my
definition is that confusion arises from the Charity
Commission&#146;s treatment of
charities.</div><a name="06070467000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">At present,
the charity law definition of religion is inconsistent. On the one
hand, case law generally indicates that the term refers to philosophies
based on belief in, and worship of, a deity. In 1999, the Charity
Commission rejected the Church of Scientology&#146;s application for
registration on that basis. On the other hand, it has registered
organisations that promote multi-deity religions, such as Hinduism, and
no-deity religions, such as some schools of Buddhism. I have no
particular complaint about what is in clause 2(3); my complaint is
about what is not in it, which is why I am proposing what I consider to
be a better definition.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column10" />Column number: 11</div><a name="06070467000064"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070467000372"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b>
Modestly.</div><a name="06070467000065"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070467000373"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> The reason I can do so modestly is that it is not
my
definition.</div><a name="06070467000066"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070467000374"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> If the hon. Gentleman is not concerned about what
is already included in paragraph (a), why is he not proposing his
amendment by way of addition rather than
substitution?</div><a name="06070467000067"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070467000375"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> The reason is that I believe the amendment
includes what is in paragraph (a). Technically, it deletes the
paragraph, but the words of the amendment are inclusive of the
definition in the paragraph. Not all religions believe in a god, or a
supernatural being, but they do believe in a supernatural thing or
principle. The hon. Gentleman suggested that humanism is a religion.
That seems to me to be contrary to the tenets of most humanists,
although I accept that there may be some who define humanism as a
religion. The current definition, however, does not clarify what a
religion actually is&#151;we are left with a complete void on that.
The amendment, as my hon. Friend the Member for Rochford and Southend,
East (James Duddridge) said, is based on the Australian definition and
defines religion
as</div><a name="06070467000287"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;belief in a
supernatural principle, being or thing and acceptance and observance of
certain canons of conduct to give effect to those
beliefs.&#148;</div><a name="06070467000326"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11
am</div><a name="06070467000068"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070467000376"></a>Alun
Michael:</b> I am not sure that it does. Surely the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s wording requires the impossible. It is essentially
philosophically unsound and confuses beliefs and principles. One cannot
give effect to a belief; one either believes something or does not. It
is possible to act consistently with a belief or a set of principles
based on a belief, but not to put a belief into practice. Therefore,
his wording is entirely
useless.</div><a name="06070467000069"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070467000377"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> The right hon. Gentleman is clearly cleverer than
the whole band of Australian lawyers and judges who found it a
perfectly adequate definition. I congratulate him on his imaginative
argument. He would probably be paid well at the Australian Bar for
promoting it. Putting one&#146;s principles into action is something
that politicians try to do every day. I suspect that those with
religious beliefs try to do so as
well.</div><a name="06070467000070"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070467000378"></a>Alun
Michael:</b> The hon. Gentleman has missed my point. Of course
we try to put principles into action, but his wording requires beliefs
to be put into action. A belief cannot be put into action; one either
believes something or does not. Principles are put into action, as he
reflected in the wording of his response to
me.</div><a name="06070467000071"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070467000379"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> As I said, the right hon. Gentleman might do well
if he were looking for a career at the Australian Bar. It is my
view&#151;to avoid using a difficult word&#151;that the definition
is broad enough to cover polytheistic and atheistic religions and to
indicate the boundaries of religion by requiring a belief in something
supernatural.</div><a name="06070467000072"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070467000380"></a>Tom
Levitt:</b> As a non-believer, I am trying to come at the
issue objectively, but I do not see how one can have an atheistic
religion. It seems to me that a belief system must be based on some
belief, but how will that be proven? If I adhered to a religion that I
claimed 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column11" />Column number: 12</div>included a belief in a supernatural principle, how would the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s amendment test whether the principle that I believed
in was
supernatural?</div><a name="06070467000073"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070467000381"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> The hon. Gentleman goes down an interesting path.
As a believer, I also find it difficult to believe that one can have an
atheistic religion, just as I find it difficult to believe that one can
describe humanism as a religion. I cannot answer his question, but I
can say that the definition has served other common law jurisdictions
well. It would have the advantage of allowing religious charities to
carry out charitable activities in the practical expression of their
belief, whether it is a belief in one god, many gods or indeed no god
but another supernatural thing or
being.</div><a name="06070467000074"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070467000382"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> As I said in my opening remarks, it is not just a
question of belief in a god. It is also a question whether there is
anything supernatural&#151;outside or above nature. What does the
hon. Gentleman regard as the supernatural principle in Theravada
Buddhism?</div><a name="06070467000075"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070467000383"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> I am not sufficiently well acquainted with
Theravada Buddhism to answer that question. It would be a question for
interpretation by the charity tribunal or the courts. I think that they
will be inclined to take the natural understanding of the word
&#147;supernatural&#148; in England at the time, and that most
people would come to the same view of what is meant by it, although I
accept that a minority might have a different
view.</div>
<a name="06070467000076"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070467000384"></a>Tom
Levitt:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman intend it to be his
amendment&#146;s purpose to exclude what we might call the
non-religious religions&#151;those with humanistic, agnostic or
atheistic
views?</div><a name="06070467000077"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070467000385"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> As charities with charitable purposes, certainly
not. However, it is my intention that they should continue to be
recognised under what has been called the catch-all phrase rather than
under subsection (2)(c). Let me make it absolutely clear that that is
my intention because it is curious that on the one hand, one should
claim that one is humanist and therefore does not believe in religion
and yet, on the other hand, claim that humanism is, of itself, a
religion.</div> <a name="06070467000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">The British
Humanist Association has made the case on human rights and other
grounds for the equivalent treatment, within the same words, of
humanism and religions. The Bill allows an equivalent treatment within
the same clause and within the same section of the same clause. All it
does not do is permit an equivalent treatment within the same
subsection of the same clause because religions are under subsection
(2)(c) and non-religions are included within subsection
(2)(m).</div> <a name="06070467000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">The British
Humanist Association has said that:</div>
<a name="06070467000288"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;putting humanism or any
comparable beliefs under the catch-all head is not only insulting and
discriminatory but is damaging because it gives religion its own head
while relegating non-religious belief systems to the residual head,
implying that they are not equivalent in kind or
value.&#148;</div> <a name="06070467000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is no such
implication. They are both charitable purposes; that is what clause
2(2) says. All they are is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column12" />Column number: 13</div>charitable purposes of different kinds. Asserting that they are
equivalent and therefore must be treated by the same words is no
different from asserting that sport is a kind of religion and therefore
it is insulting to the followers of football that that should be
covered by subsection (2)(g) rather than subsection (2)(c). Therefore,
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will understand that I have no
particular down on humanism or humanists but it is curious that they
should be described as
religious.</div><a name="06070467000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, I
come to the point raised by the hon. Member for Cheltenham in respect
of the letter from Mr. Rosser-Owen. That is an interesting letter
because it clearly sets out the problem, which is that the Charity
Commission&#146;s interpretation of religion is inconsistent with
case law. That is why we have to have something in the
provision.</div><a name="06070467000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">Normally, I
would be happy to allow the common law to develop. Later on, I am sure
that I will be telling the hon. Gentleman that he ought to allow the
common law to develop. However Mr. Rosser-Owen has drawn our attention
to the fact that the Charity Commission has said that they will
continue to apply the old test, not withstanding the clear intention of
the new provision. Its commentary on the religious head of charity says
that:</div><a name="06070467000289"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
advancement of religion includes many different faiths and belief
systems involving belief in one supreme being, many or none, including,
for example, Christianity, Judaism and Islam as well as Hinduism and
Buddhism.&#148;</div>
<a name="06070467000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">That letter has been sent to
hon. Members. That is reflected in the Charities Bill&#151;I know
because I have three copies&#151;that states that the term religion
includes</div><a name="06070467000290"></a><div class="hs_brev">(i) a
religion which involves belief in more than one god, and</div>
<a name="06070467000291"></a><div class="hs_brev">(ii) a religion which does not
involve belief in a god.</div>
<a name="06070467000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">The criteria that we use to
decide whether or not an organisation is advancing a religion, as that
is understood by charity law, include the following. Do adherents have
a belief in a supreme belief&#151;that is a question that is
addressed by my amendment&#151;do adherents worship the supreme
being? There is no obligation for worship in my amendment. Does the
organisation advance the religion and is the organisation established
for the benefit of the public? It is my view that the Charity
Commission&#146;s statements in paragraph 10 are contradictory with
the case law and with the law as it is set out in the
Bill.</div><a name="06070467000085"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070467000386"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman and I
hesitate to accuse him of selective quotation but that is what he is
doing. The letter from Mr. Rosser-Owen specifically supports the
existing phraseology in the Bill. Therefore to use it in support of his
amendment, which removes that wording, is perverse, is it
not?</div><a name="06070467000086"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070467000387"></a>Mr.
Andrew Turner:</b> The problem is that the Charity Commission
is not applying the wording in the Bill. Despite the fact that the
wording in the Bill is meant to be based on case law, as it has been
established, the Charity Commission does not appear to be applying it.
That is why it would be better to have a clearer definition of religion
in the Bill.</div> <a name="06070467000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">I accept
that we may be arrogant, unwise, incautious and hasty to attempt to
resolve the problem. We may 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column13" />Column number: 14</div>be arrogant, unwise, incautious or hasty to attempt to resolve this
problem. However, this is what we are paid for; not to be arrogant,
hasty, incautious or unwise, but to try to clarify the law where it is
confused. That is my only purpose in tabling amendment No.
2.</div><a name="06070467000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am grateful for
the hon. Gentleman&#146;s support for amendment No. 53, which deals
with a pre-eminent absurdity in the Bill. Clause 2(2)(g) defines the
advancement of amateur sport as a charitable purpose and subsection
(3)(d) attempts to define what is meant by sport, which
is,</div><a name="06070467000292"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;sport which involves
physical skill and
exertion&#148;.</div><a name="06070467000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">Hon. Members
will recall that on Second Reading the hon. Member for Birmingham,
Northfield (Richard Burden) asked the Chancellor of the Duchy of
Lancaster about the inclusion and exclusion of certain activities and
whether those constituted sport within the definition in the Bill. He
said:</div><a name="06070467000293"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A number
of activities which common sense indicates are sports are often
excluded from the definition of being sports by the Charity Commission,
including angling, ballooning, billiards, pool, snooker, crossbow
shooting, rifle shooting, pistol shooting, flying, gliding, motor
sports and
parachuting.&#148;</div><a name="06070467000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">He then
declared an interest as a participant in one of those sports. The
Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster answered, saying that the Charity
Commission</div><a name="06070467000294"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;will be
willing to consider any representations on what exactly the addition to
charitable purposes will mean.&#148; &#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>,

appreciate that mountaineering may require more physical exertion than
parachuting&#151;I understand that it is more difficult to go up than
to come down, as some mountaineers have discovered to their
cost&#151;but the principle of the requirement to exert oneself in
the interests of sport appeals to Victorian Corinthian attitudes that I
thought were out of date in the modern Conservative party, not to
mention the Labour party. The definition of &#147;sport&#148; is a
little bit narrow. It would be better to leave a broad definition to
the Charity Commission so it can apply the common understanding of
sport.</div><a name="06070467000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not play
chess because it involves far too much mental exertion. In my view,
other activities, such as rifle shooting and clay pigeon shooting,
involve physical exertion as well as mental exertion, but the Charity
Commission has a different view. Judging by the shape of many of those
involved in darts, it does not involve much physical or mental
exertion. <i class="I">[Interruption.]</i> I apologise to any hon. Members

Conservative club darts team on the Isle of

explanatory notes. <i class="I">[Interruption.]</i> I have been struck with
inspiration, but not necessarily enough to answer. I am not convinced
that there is sufficient meat in the explanatory note; if there had
been, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster would have quoted it on
Second Reading. I shall revert to the hon. Lady&#146;s question when
we discuss clause 5, if I catch your eye, Mrs.

is a genuine probing amendment to find out exactly what clause 2(7)

amendments are intended to make it absolutely clear that references to
charitable purposes, or to institutions with charitable purposes in any
enactments and documents, are to be taken as having the meaning given
by the Bill in clause 2(1). The amendments are belt and braces
measures, and do not change the law.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official
Report, House of Lords,</i> 28 June 2006; Vol. 673, c.
150.]</div><a name="06070467000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments appear to oppose amendment No. 70, to which the hon. Member
for Cheltenham spoke at the beginning of the debate on this group of
amendments. One of the amendments says essentially that there is no
change in the definition of &#147;charitable purpose&#148; and
other says that there is a change to the definition of
&#147;charity&#148;. Will the Parliamentary Secretary explain how
clause 4(6) and 4(7) on page 3 work alongside clause 1(2) on page 1?
Perhaps he will also reflect on the advice given to me by the Charity
Law Association, which is contained in Mrs. Hills&#146;s enclosure
number three in the letter of 13 June that I believe was sent
to all Committee
members:</div><a name="06070467000297"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
canons of statutory construction state that a statute is always
presumed to effect a change in the law. Thus, where there is expressed
on the face of the Bill a statement which might appear to set out no
more than the existing law, it is assumed to change the
law.&#148;</div><a name="06070467000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">Lord Bassam did not
appear to be aware of that principle when moving his amendment No. 7
on 28 June 2005. I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary can
help us with
that.</div><a name="06070467000101"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070467000390"></a>Alun
Michael:</b> This interesting group of amendments
demonstrates, to a great extent, the care that we need to exercise in
seeking to amend the existing legislation and the Bill. It is not so
surprising that it has taken a considerable time for the Bill to be
advanced, because the greatest risk that we face is that slight changes
that appear to have no great effect now will have unintended and
devastating consequences further down the
line.</div><a name="06070467000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">I object
strongly to the amendments on religion. I am sorry to disappoint the
hon. Member for Isle of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column15" />Column number: 16</div>Wight, but I am neither an avid student of Australian law, nor have I
been called to the Australian Bar, and I have not read about how its
legislation is phrased, although I suspect that it may have been done
differently. I object to the amendment because it would be a major
change to measures that are believed to reflect to a great extent the
present law and mean that we are not to have unintended consequences. I
suspect that there would be considerable unintended consequences were
we to accept the amendment, with changes that we could not entirely
predict for a variety of organisations recognised by the existing law
as engaging in religious
activities.</div><a name="06070467000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">My main
point is that words are important. Even John Humphrys agrees&#151;so
it must be true&#151;that it is essential that people take notice of
the way in which they express themselves and the way in which they use
grammar and words. The phraseology that the hon. Gentleman has proposed
is logically and philosophically unsound. One does not put beliefs into
practice; one acts consistently with beliefs. Principles for behaviour
might be based on belief, particularly on the belief that there is a
divine being who has expressed views about how believers should behave,
whether on tablets of stone or in other ways. The fact that the
phraseology asks people to put beliefs rather than principles into
practice means that it is fatally flawed and therefore cannot have the
consequences suggested by the hon. Gentleman unless we ignore the fact
that it is philosophically and linguistically
unsound.</div><a name="06070467000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">On amendment
No. 70, if we override other legislation in a Bill, we must be very
careful to ensure that there are no unintended consequences. Most of us
in the House have sought during debates over the years to deal with one
principle adequately in one Bill so that the Bill overrides others and
there is no doubt about what the law says. It is a temptation to
anybody involved with a particular piece of legislation, but I advise
against it. There is case law not only on charity law but on the
definitions provided in other legislation, and the danger of unintended
consequences is
considerable.</div><a name="06070467000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">I agree
entirely about the need to avoid bureaucracy. The Charity Commission
and Departments involved in charity, whether the Treasury or others,
should simplify their behaviour and make it more consistent, but that
is not simple to achieve. It is certainly not simple to put it into a
piece of legislation and think that a requirement of uniformity has
been brought
about.</div><a name="06070467000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">The issue seems
to come down to one particular organisation, the Police Dependants
Trust. The hon. Gentleman explained the valuable work done by the trust
and smaller charities in a variety of police force affairs. As a former
police Minister, I endorse entirely what he said about the unique
position of the police in society, the value that they provide and the
need to ensure that charities that assist police officers&#146;
dependants can operate adequately, but again, we must be careful not to
bring about unintended consequences. What things might those charities
want to do that are not charitable according to the Bill?</div>
<a name="06070467000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">That was the argument against
including a specific clause on the armed forces. Because of their
operation abroad, the historic circumstances in which they have been
involved and indeed the increasing complexity of their international
involvement, it was decided in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column16" />Column number: 17</div>another place to put the blindingly obvious into the Bill. Occasionally
we must do so, but it should be resisted wherever possible, because it
appears to exclude other possibilities. I am concerned that if we
include the police, we might exclude references, which the hon. Member
for Isle of Wight conceded are comparable, to organisations for
firefighters, lifeboat personnel and other rescue
workers.</div><a name="06070467000108"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070467000391"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> The right hon. Gentleman asked what activities
were deemed not to be charitable. The Charity Commission told me in a
letter on 13
May:</div><a name="06070467000298"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Amongst
other activities, the charity gave an automatic gift to members of the
force who were away from work on sick leave for more than two weeks and
Christmas gifts of &#163;50 to widows and orphans within the police
community. These gifts were made without reference to the circumstances
of the recipient. Although the object of the charity was to relieve
need, the charity did not assess the extent of that need. The trustees
of the charity were advised they must review their procedure for the
award of such gifts to ensure that they fulfil a charitable
purpose.&#148;</div><a name="06070467000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">The charity was
doing wrong by giving a present to people at
Christmas.</div><a name="06070467000110"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070467000392"></a>Alun
Michael:</b> We do not know enough about the mischief that the
Charity Commission was trying to tackle. I accept that if the
circumstances are entirely and exclusively as he described them, it
sounds a little bit odd. However, I suspect that there is more to it
than that. I assume that the group of charities would have an
intelligent conversation with the Charity Commission, which we all
agree should be independent and able to undertake those discussions
rather than Government Departments. His amendment would not change the
situation one iota because the Charity Commission&#146;s regulation
of charities needs to be consistent. To have defined those bodies as
charitable in terms of the 14 items would not mean that specific action
could be undertaken by them without their having to account to, and be
regulated by, the Charity Commission. The one mischief that the hon.
Gentleman explained clearly in respect of the letter would not be
affected by the
amendment.</div><a name="06070467000111"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070467000393"></a>James
Duddridge:</b> Does the right hon. Gentleman agree that,
rather than dealing with a specific case, the matter highlights a
general anomaly? It might be that other public sector individuals
should be bought within a definition. The hon. Member for High Peak
asked whether we should cancel that if it clearly does a disservice. He
was making the point that we cannot add a 13th, 14th or 15th. Perhaps
we are talking about the wrong 13th, but there should be a 13th
category.</div>
<a name="06070467000112"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070467000394"></a>Alun
Michael:</b> No, the hon. Gentleman has missed my point
entirely. Each of those additional categories is within the existing
category, so there is not a problem in that regard. If the particular
example cited by the hon. Member for Isle of Wight applied to police
charities, there would presumably be a similar objection. By that I
mean, the giving of gifts without the regard to need and that would
apply to a variety of other charities under the 13 existing
definitions. The hon. Gentleman is chasing the wrong rabbit down the
hole or the rabbit down the wrong hole, depending on 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column17" />Column number: 18</div>what view is held. Such a process would not have the desired
consequence. It is not
necessary.</div><a name="06070467000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am sure
that we agree with the hon. Gentleman on two points, the first of which
is that the police are an extremely important group of people and that
support should be possible. The Parliamentary Secretary can correct me
if I am wrong, but the police would be covered entirely under the
regulations. I am sure that my hon. Friend would have made himself
available to satisfy the worries of police representatives. I am
worried about the unintended consequences, what is included and what
seems to be excluded. If we are accepting the reference to armed
forces, we have gone far enough for the variety of international unique
circumstances that
apply.</div><a name="06070467000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">As for the
couch potato amendment No. 53, I counsel great care when redefining
sport. Having spent considerable time discussing what is defined by
some as a sport&#151;the hunting of live animals&#151;I have become
well aware of all the arguments about whether activities are on one
side or another of a particular line. The other sort of activities that
have been referred to might qualify, as suggested by my hon. Friend the
Member for Bishop Auckland (Helen Goodman), under educational,
citizenship and community development or one of the other headings, but
the definition of sport seems entirely sensible. It is surely
reflective of the common usage of the word outside the
media.</div><a name="06070467000115"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06070467000395"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Peter Bone</b> (Wellingborough) (Con): Does the right hon.
Gentleman agree that chess is a sport? If so, it would fail the
definition.</div><a name="06070467000116"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070467000396"></a>Alun
Michael:</b> If the hon. Gentleman takes it that I am making a
personal reaction&#151;it is up to the Charity Commission to
interpret the law&#151;I should not have thought that chess was a
sport. However, it contributes considerably both to educational and
community development activities. Therefore, an organisation that
promotes chess would not be ruled out from being regarded as a charity.
Such an activity does not need to be defined as a sport in order for
the charity legislation to deal adequately with it. That makes my
point.</div><a name="06070467000328"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.30

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070467000397"></a>James
Duddridge:</b> I shall speak primarily to amendments Nos. 1
and 53. I support amendment No.1, not simply because the cause with
which it deals is a worthy one, but because it highlights a potential
inconsistency that has not been fully considered. I have come across
further inconsistencies during the debate.</div>
<a name="06070467000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thought that, in the
amendment, we had a good example of a public service group coming
together and supporting a public service. The right hon. Member for
Cardiff, South and Penarth (Alun Michael) produced two more good
examples: the fire service, which would indeed be within the public
sector, and lifeboats, which are unfortunately not within the public
sector. I had been thinking of urging the Minister to consider a
specific provision covering not only police charities, but public
sector charities to help people who have worked in the public sector.
That would provide a great public benefit. I would specifically exclude
companies that seek to get around pension arrangements by providing
benefits through a charitable body. I support the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column18" />Column number: 19</div>amendment because it provides a good example, although I do not wish to
see a 13th, 14th or 15th addition to the
list.</div><a name="06070467000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am aware that
there are a large number of definitions of sport. Having done a sweep
through the internet, I am further confused about what is and is not a
sport. I am surprised that the Bill contains a definition of sport that
refers directly to &#147;sport&#148;. I presume that one reason why
clause 2(3)(d) states
that</div><a name="06070467000299"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;
&#145;sport&#146; means sport which involves physical skill and
exertion&#148;</div><a name="06070467000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">is that there
are many activities that involve physical skill and exertion that are
not sport and that are difficult to define. I think most hon. Members
would agree that sex, for example, involves physical skill and
exertion, but clearly most people would not consider it a sport, or
propose that it be subject to charitable relief&#151;at least I would
not. That highlights a problem of definition. Chess is a useful example
because it shows that physical exertion is a factor, but not the only
one&#151;it is perhaps low on the
scale.</div><a name="06070467000121"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070467000398"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman accept that a helpful
definition might be that a sport involves a winner and a loser? That
might exclude sex.</div>
<a name="06070467000122"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070467000399"></a>James
Duddridge:</b> I hesitate before speaking about sex, but I am
more than happy to speak outside of the room. I understand that in some
cases sex qualifies and in some cases it does not. I think I should
move on before I trouble things further, because my wife pays due
attention to what I say in the House.</div>
<a name="06070467000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are a number of sports.
Snooker and hang-gliding are out. Mountaineering is in but climbing is
out, or perhaps it is the other way round&#151;other hon. Members may
be able to explain. It does not make an awful lot of sense, and I
believe that it would make more sense to delete the provision entirely
and leave the matter to the Charity Commission. It seems sensible that
there be a variety of definitions of sport&#151;sport as defined by
the Olympic authorities would be very limited and would be different
from sport as defined by charities and by local government, whereby
certain areas are left aside for sporting activities. Although a sport
might not be appropriate for the Olympics, or an appropriate use of
public land, it might be appropriate for a
charity.</div><a name="06070467000124"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070467000400"></a>Tom
Levitt:</b> I was going to intervene earlier but I thought I
would let the hon. Gentleman dig himself a little deeper. He has now
passed the sensitive part of his speech. He will be aware that sport is
defined elsewhere in law besides in charity law. The Government have
introduced the concept of community amateur sports clubs, which receive
tax relief akin to, but different from, the tax relief that charities
receive. Is he happy for sport to be defined in different ways, or is
he asking for the question of what constitutes sport in the context of
community amateur sports clubs and their tax relief to be re-opened as
well?</div><a name="06070467000125"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070467000401"></a>James
Duddridge:</b> I was unaware of that initiative and therefore
am not asking for that question to be reopened.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column19" />Column number: 20</div><a name="06070467000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">I simply want to achieve a
degree of clarity in the Bill and deleting paragraph (d) as amendment
No. 53 proposes would create greater clarity by leaving that definition
up to the Charity Commission rather than seeking to define it&#151;in
a cack-handed way&#151;in terms physical skill and exertion only.
Motorsports is not covered by that definition: Michael
Schumacher, who loses 2 litres of water in a race&#151;I
realise that he operates in a professional motorsporting
environment&#151;would disagree with that. The definition does not
make any sense and I therefore support amendment No. 53, which would
remove that definition and leave it up to the Charity Commission to
decide.</div><a name="06070467000127"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070467000402"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> We have had an illuminating, even entertaining,
debate. For the benefit of the Committee, let me deal with the
amendments as they appear in the amendment paper.</div>
<a name="06070467000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">The first amendment in the
group is amendment No.70, tabled by the hon. Member for Cheltenham. We
urge the hon. Gentleman to withdraw it. The effect of subsection (2) is
that where an enactment other than the Bill has its own definition of
charity, that other definition is preserved. The problem with removing
the subsection is that it would introduce uncertainty, for tax purposes
in particular. Section 506(1) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act
1988 contains its own definition of a charity, as
follows:</div><a name="06070467000300"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;&#145;charity&#146;
means any body of persons or trust established for charitable purposes
only;&#148;</div><a name="06070467000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">The important
point about that definition is that it applies throughout the UK,
whereas the Bill applies only to England and Wales. If we made the
Bill&#146;s definition apply to the 1988 Act, which removing
subsection (2) would do, the effect would be to exclude charities in
Scotland and Northern Ireland from the tax benefits that would exist.
Charities in those territories would no longer qualify as charities
under the definition in the 1988 Act. That is obviously not the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s intention, but give that that would be the effect of
his amendment, I hope that he will withdraw it. I will deal later with
the point that the eagle-eyed hon. Member for Isle of Wight made about
the possible contradiction between this clause 1(2) and clause
2(7).</div><a name="06070467000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 1,
which stands in the name of the hon. Member for Isle of Wight and his
hon. Friends, is about the police. The whole Committee agrees that
police charities do an enormous amount of good work for police
officers, ex-police officers and their families, and all of us want
that work to continue. It is important to state that at the
outset.</div><a name="06070467000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purposes
of the Police Dependants Trust are covered by clause 2(2)(m), which is
a catch-all provision, and clause 2(4)(a) in combination. It is already
charitable to provide welfare services which meet the identified needs
of serving or former police officers or their dependants. We are
confident that it will remain so.</div>
<a name="06070467000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">When my hon. Friend the Member
for Wythenshawe and Sale, East (Paul Goggins) was the Minister in
charge of the Bill, he received a letter from Mr. Norrie Flowers, the
chairman of the Police Dependants Trust, urging the Government to table
an amendment such as 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column20" />Column number: 21</div>amendment No. 1. Mr. Flowers listed some of the services that the Trust
was thinking of providing and sought reassurance that they would be
charitable under the Bill. However, those services were not described
in detail, so my hon. Friend was not, at that point, able to state
definitively whether they would remain charitable. As I understand it,
Mr. Flowers was offered a discussion with the officials working on the
Bill, which has not yet happened. However, I am keen to meet
representatives of the Police Dependants Trust to discuss their
activities; I also want to ensure that they meet my officials and
Charity Commission officials for further discussions.</div>
<a name="06070467000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that it would be much
better to avoid an amendment that would add a new category to the list
of 13&#151;a list that has already grown by three or four since the
strategy unit recommendations. The main case has been made by my right
hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth: if we include
the Police Dependants Trust or its activities in the Bill&#151;worthy
though they are&#151;we shall inevitably face calls to extend the
list to all kinds of other categories. I take the point made by the
hon. Member for Rochford and Southend, East that one could have a
catch-all public services category, but I fear that that would only
provoke further calls for the inclusion of other categories and provoke
further definitional problems.</div>
<a name="06070467000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">We want to ensure that the
Police Dependants Trust can continue its activities. I have not seen
the letter from the Charity Commission but we shall consider it along
with the specific issue raised by the hon. Member for Isle of Wight.
The trust&#146;s activities are obviously beneficial and important,
but charity is about pursuing purposes to meet needs, and it is
important that the Charity Commission&#151;it is a job for that
body&#151;is satisfied that an activity is occurring to meet needs,
and not for other purposes. I have no reason to believe that the
activity the hon. Gentleman mentioned is not intended to meet needs and
for genuine purposes, but we should examine that and I am happy to
report back on Report. I hope that on that basis the hon. Gentleman
will not press his amendment.</div>
<a name="06070467000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 2 provoked an
interesting and learned discussion. Let me deal first with what may be
called the Australian red herring, because I have news about Australia
that is important for the Committee. In 2003, the Australian Government
published draft legislation for charity law reform, and there was a
clause on religion that set out not a definition of religion such as
the hon. Gentleman seeks, but a number of matters to which regard
should be had in deciding whether or not a belief amounted to a
religion. Those matters included the substance of the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s amendment. After a public consultation, however, the
Australian Government decided not to proceed with the legislation, so
there is not necessarily an Australian example for us to
follow.</div> <a name="06070467000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">It may be
helpful if I explained to the Committee the current charity law
definition of a religion and some of the implications of the Bill. For
a belief system to qualify as a religion it must have essentially two
features: the first is a belief in a supreme being or beings, and the
second is the expression of that belief through worship of the supreme
being or beings. My understanding is that humanism is not included
within the scope of religion, and that that will remain so after 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column21" />Column number: 22</div>the legislation is passed. Humanism is covered by the charitable
purposes in the catch-all provision, clause 2(2)(m), and societies for
humanism are given charitable status on the basis that they contribute
to the moral and spiritual improvement of the community. The Charity
Commission ruled out the Scientologists, who have been mentioned in the
debate, because apparently they do not have an act of
worship.</div> <a name="06070467000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">Part of the
confusion about the Bill arises from clause 2(3)(a), a provision which
was amended following recommendations of the Joint Committee. The
suggestion was that religion should
include</div><a name="06070467000301"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a religion which
involves belief in more than one god, and...a religion which does
not involve belief in a
god&#148;.</div><a name="06070467000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">That does not
include the humanists. That was put into the Bill in response to the
Joint Committee&#146;s worries that, otherwise, some of the nine
major world religions, in particular, Jainism&#151;because it denies
the existence of God&#151;would not be covered. The provision was
drafted partly in response to concern about that, but it has caused
some
confusion.</div><a name="06070467000329"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.45
am</div><a name="06070467000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member
for Isle of Wight asked how the Charity Commission was interpreting
legislation in that area. It is my understanding that the Bill will not
fundamentally change the definition of religion as it will be applied
by the commission. Perhaps that is why it seems to the hon. Gentleman
that the plan is to continue to implement the existing law. The purpose
of the Bill in to clarify the law&#151;to make clear the definition
of religion and what is or is not included. That is the basis of the
provisions on
religion.</div><a name="06070467000140"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070467000403"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> It would be unfair of me to ask the Minister a
question that I could not answer if he asked it of me, so I shall not
ask him, but I should like someone to tell me what is the supreme being
in which Jains believe if it is not a god, which qualifies Jain
organisations to be charities.</div>
<a name="06070467000141"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070467000404"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> The hon. Gentleman is completely right. I do not
know the answer to that
question.</div><a name="06070467000142"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070467000405"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> Having spent a year in India, I might be able to
assist the Minister. In several Indian religions, including Jainism,
great respect is paid to prophets and to those interpreters of the
world who are not divine, just as Buddha in Theravada Buddhism is
regarded as having achieved nirvana or enlightenment, not
divinity.</div><a name="06070467000143"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070467000406"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> That certainly satisfies me. I am grateful to
the hon. Gentleman for that
explanation.</div><a name="06070467000144"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070467000407"></a>Tom
Levitt:</b> My hon. Friend will be aware from a previous
conversation that my concern about the clause was not philosophical,
but mathematical. Subsection (3)(a)(i) includes polytheism and
subsection (3)(a)(ii) includes atheistic religions; there is, however,
no specific mention of monotheistic religions. Am I right in thinking
therefore that, when the clause says that &#147;religion&#148;
includes those definitions, it does not exclude other
definitions?</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column22" />Column number: 23</div><a name="06070467000145"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070467000408"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> My hon. Friend is right. It important to say at
this early stage in proceedings that the Bill will be built upon the
common law definitions of a charity that have been built up over more
than 400 years or so. The confusion in Committee might
sometimes arise from the fact that we are building on that foundation.
In the case my hon. Friend raises, a belief in the supreme being or
beings and the expression of that belief through worship of a supreme
being or beings is part of the common law definition of religion in
terms of charitable
purposes.</div><a name="06070467000146"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070467000409"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> Is the Minister saying that nothing will really
change in relation to religion in the Charity Commission&#146;s
administration? If so, why are we bothering to add the extra
definition?</div><a name="06070467000147"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070467000410"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> It would be wrong of me to say that that thought
has occurred to me at any point during the past eight weeks when I have
been learning the details of the Charities Bill. The answer to the hon.
Gentleman is that we are undertaking a Herculean task, which is to set
out a list of charitable purposes that can take forward the
implementation of charitable status in the coming decades. We need to
set them out as best we can in the Bill. His understanding is correct
in that the definition of religion for charitable purposes has been
established under law and it will not change
materially.</div><a name="06070467000148"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070467000411"></a>Helen
Goodman:</b> One of my constituents, the former Bishop of
Durham, said famously that the resurrection is not simply a trick with
a bag of bones. My concern about the amendment tabled by the hon.
Member for Isle of Wight is that he is trying, by including a reference
to a supernatural principle, to come to a precise theological position
on religion. It is not appropriate for the Committee to do that.
Notwithstanding the fact that the Church of England is the established
national Church in England, does my hon. Friend the Parliamentary
Secretary agree that it is not appropriate for us to present
definitions of religion that are too
theological?</div><a name="06070467000149"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070467000412"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> I
agree.</div><a name="06070467000150"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070467000413"></a>Tom
Levitt:</b><b class="B"> </b>Surely, the purpose of the Bill&#151;the
biggest review of charity legislation in the past 400
years&#151;is seen in clause 2(2) and the other provisions are
subservient to it. Clause 2(2) contains a list, established through
case law and other sources, that will form the definition of a charity
for the Charity Commission and others to use. The value of clause 3 is
that it helps to define one of the words used in clause
2(2)&#151;&#147;religion&#148;&#151;the meaning of which has
changed fundamentally over the 400 years since the concept of charity
law was first produced. For the first 350 or so of those years, there
would have been a narrow definition of the use of the word
&#147;religion&#148; in the common law on charities: it would have
meant Christianity and nothing
else.</div><a name="06070467000151"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070467000414"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> My hon. Friend makes an important point. We are
trying to strike a balance between setting out principles that will
take us forward 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column23" />Column number: 24</div>and are flexible enough to accommodate changes in social circumstances
over time. I hope that we are striking the right
balance.</div><a name="06070467000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">A number of
concerns have been raised about the amendment tabled by the hon. Member
for Isle of Wight. We are concerned that it would significantly widen
the definition of &#147;religion&#148; when that is not necessary,
and there is a risk of including some beliefs that perhaps ought not to
be included. During a debate on a similar amendment in another place,
my noble Friend Lord Dubs referred to &#147;&#145;nutty&#146;
religions&#148;. However, we are more worried about irrational,
bizarre beliefs of other sorts and about some perfectly respectable
beliefs that, nevertheless, ought to have no place in religion. For the
benefit of the Committee, the dictionary definition of
&#147;supernatural&#148;, is that which is attributed to or thought
to reveal some force above the laws of nature, or is magical, occult or
mystical. Any belief founded on a principle of that sort could
potentially qualify as a religion under the amendment. I am not
convinced that that would be a good way for us to go. Palmistry,
horoscopy and tree worship might qualify as religions under the
amendment, although I am sure that that is not the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s intention. There is a danger that the breadth of the
amendment might allow all kinds of practices to claim religious status.
I hope that, on the basis of our full debate, including the exposure of
the Australian red herring, the hon. Gentleman will not press his
amendment.</div><a name="06070467000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
amendment No. 53, also tabled by the hon. Gentleman, I am sympathetic
to the idea that there are all kinds of sports and that people have
different predilections for sport and those should be accommodated in
the law. However, by defining sport in the terms that we have used, we
are retaining in essence an approach that has already been established
by the Charity Commission. Chess is not allowable under the
&#147;other sport&#148; category, but, having said that, chess
organisations can come into charitable status in all kinds of other
ways. More than a dozen chess charities are registered as charities,
mainly under the advancement of education heading. For the benefit of
the Committee, the other sports that are not considered to be covered
by the definition are angling, ballooning, billiards, crossbow and
rifle shooting, flying, gliding, motorsports and parachuting.</div>
<a name="06070467000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given the debate, we should
reflect on the argument that has been advanced. I am not convinced that
simply taking out the relevant subsection is the right way forward, but
I do take seriously what hon. Members have said. As my right hon.
Friend the Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth said, we must avoid
unintended consequences. We must not start a new argument about
hunting, for example, or anything like that. We will go away and, in
the spirit of charity, reflect on the matter and report back on
Report.</div> <a name="06070467000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Isle of Wight, a former teacher, set me an exam question on
amendment No. 3: he asked me explain the consistency between clause
1(2) and clause 2(7). The purpose of clause 2(7) is to ensure that
wherever there is reference to charitable purposes in primary or
secondary legislation or in any document, charitable purposes is to be
construed in accordance with clause 2(1). A document includes, most
importantly, the written constitution of every charity. Subsection (7)
makes that apply to legislation 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column24" />Column number: 25</div>and documents passed or created before the Bill, except where the
context requires
otherwise.</div><a name="06070467000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purpose
of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendment, which is acknowledged is
probing, is to ensure that the Bill&#146;s definition of charitable
purposes applies only in legislation and documents passed after the
Bill. Let me give a few examples to illustrate the way in which the
amendment would not be helpful. The first is to do with references to
charitable purposes in legislation. Many pieces of legislation refer to
charitable purposes, including the 1988 Act to which I referred
earlier, which gives exemptions to charities from income and
corporation tax on the income that they spend for charitable purposes.
The difference between clause 1(2) and clause 2(7) is that the
exception in clause 1(2) caters to, for example, tax laws applying to
charities throughout the UK, whereas clause 2(7) is about achieving a
common definition of charitable purposes. That is the distinction
between them. I hope that clears up the confusion.</div>
<a name="06070467000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are seeking a common
definition of charitable purposes&#151;as clause 2(7) ensures.
However, we also want to accommodate the situation in which a different
definition of charity applies in law and we might want to keep that
definition. We are concerned that the reference to charity in the 1988
Act applies across the United Kingdom, but the Bill applies only in
England and Wales. We do not want the charitable benefits to be removed
from charities in Scotland and Northern Ireland. I hope that clears
that point up for the hon. Gentleman and that I have successfully
answered his exam
question.</div><a name="06070467000158"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070467000415"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his
answer. We must assume from his answer that the words
&#147;charitable purpose&#148; do not appear in the 1988 Act and
the word &#147;charity&#148; does. Otherwise, I do not see how what
is appropriate for England in subsections (6) and (7) can be
appropriate for the whole United Kingdom under subsection (2). Is the
Minister saying that a charity whose charitable purposes are defined as
its objective in its constitution will have to change its constitution
to fit the definition in clause
2(1)?</div><a name="06070467000330"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12
noon</div><a name="06070467000159"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070467000416"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> Yes, but I am afraid that the hon. Gentleman was
not correct on his original point. As I said earlier, section 506(1) of
the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1998 says
that</div><a name="06070467000302"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;&#145;charity&#146;
means any body of persons or trust established for charitable purposes
only&#148;.</div><a name="06070467000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">It contains both
the word &#147;charity&#148; and the phrase &#147;charitable
purposes&#148;.</div><a name="06070467000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
trying to explain, not very eloquently, that there will now be a common
definition of &#147;charitable purposes&#148;, as the Bill will
change the definition in the 1988 Act. The definition of
&#147;charity&#148; in the 1988 Act is a UK-wide
definition&#151;importantly so, because taxes are a reserved and not
a devolved matter&#151;and must remain so. It must not come into line
with the Bill&#146;s definition of &#147;charity&#148;, because
if it did so, it would apply only to England and Wales, depriving
Scotland and Northern Ireland of the benefits of charitable
status.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column25" />Column number: 26</div><a name="06070467000162"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070467000417"></a>Tom
Levitt:</b> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for the clarity
and consistency of his summary. He sets a high standard for the rest of
the Committee. I am particularly grateful that he has rejected what we
might call the Cheltenham principle throughout&#151;the idea that a
harmless but not entirely necessary proposal should be included simply
on that basis. I hope for similar consistency throughout the
Committee.</div><a name="06070467000163"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070467000418"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> I thank my hon. Friend for his kind remarks, and
I hope that the hon. Member for Cheltenham is not too
wounded.</div><a name="06070467000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">To make it
clear why we hope that the hon. Gentleman will not press his amendment,
I shall give a second example involving charitable purposes and
documents, including charities&#146; constitutions. If an
organisation is an existing, grant-making charity, its constitution
might say that it can make grants to one or more charitable purposes as
the trustees may from time to time determine at their discretion. It is
important that that definition of &#147;charitable
purposes&#148;&#151;I think that he referred to this&#151;is
consistent with the Bill and not some other definition. That is the
purpose of the clause under scrutiny. I hope that I have satisfied him
on this rather difficult and arcane area, and that he will not press
his
amendment.</div><a name="06070467000165"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070467000419"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for his explanation
of the legal implications of amendment No. 70, and am therefore content
to withdraw it. However, I hope that he will take account of the spirit
of the amendment and the implication behind it, as well as the
explanation that he gave to the hon. Member for Isle of Wight about his
amendment. There is a risk that inconsistency will spread and
proliferate throughout the legislation, making life complicated for the
administrators and treasurers of
charities.</div><a name="06070467000166"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070467000420"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> I meant to cover the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
point about the Inland Revenue and the way that it administers the
definition of &#147;charitable purposes&#148;. It is clear from my
explanation to the hon. Member for Isle of Wight that there will now be
a common definition of &#147;charitable purposes&#148;, which
should be consistent in its
administration.</div><a name="06070467000167"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070467000421"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I am grateful for the Minister&#146;s reply,
but I will be extremely surprised if that is the practical result,
because I suspect that the different definitions used by the different
wings of Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs will still exist.
However, I am content to let him investigate that in his own
time.</div><a name="06070467000168"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070467000422"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> From his intervention, the Minister seems to be
saying that the definition of a &#147;charitable purpose&#148; will
be the same in Scotland as in England and Wales, although perhaps I
shall be told that I have got that wrong. I certainly understood that
the purpose of the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Cheltenham
was to bring the definition into line with that in Scotland. I accept
that the Minister may be saying that the definitions are already in
line, but as the issue of fee-charging charities is clearer in Scotland
than in England, I do not see how they can be the same.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070467000423"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> The hon. Gentleman slightly misses the key point,
which is that there are different definitions of &#147;charitable
purpose&#148; and &#147;charity&#148; in different pieces of
legislation that apply to the same territory. It is that inconsistency
to which I am trying to draw the Minister&#146;s attention, and I
hope that he will address it in due course, even if not through the
Bill.</div>
<a name="06070467000170"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070467000424"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> I was not going to intervene on the hon. Gentleman,
but the Minister has taken me by surprise with his statement that, for
the purposes of Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs,
&#147;charitable purpose&#148; will have a common definition. I am
sure that there will be a different interpretation for tax law; I
should be very surprised if there were
not.</div><a name="06070467000171"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070467000425"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I suspect that the hon. Gentleman is correct and
that the Minister may not be quite right. There is room to iron out
some of the remaining inconsistencies, particularly those on the
application of tax
relief.</div><a name="06070467000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn to the
amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Isle of Wight. He is on safer
ground when talking about sport and policing than about theology. The
general principle that he has advanced for some categories but not
others is that the Charity Commission, the charity tribunal and the
courts should be left to give the detailed definitions of some of the
ideas and concepts. We should do that for religion as for sport, so I
oppose the hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendment No. 2, which seeks to
insert what I think is a flawed definition of religion. On the same
principle, I support his amendment No. 53, which would remove an
equally flawed definition of sport. Under that principle, I hope that
we would leave a bit more latitude to the court, the Charity Commission
and the tribunal to deal with the detail.</div>
<a name="06070467000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">At the risk of incurring the
rapier-like wit of the hon. Member for High Peak, I should say that
there is some value in taking a clause that might be contested in the
courts in future&#151;the hon. Member for Isle of Wight suggested
that that was possible in the case of the charity for the police and
their dependants&#151;and putting it beyond doubt in the Bill. That
seems reasonable. It would be no great sacrifice for us to add a 14th
type of charity to the 13 already mentioned, especially as there will
not be a great opportunity to add dozens more and we shall not open a
can of worms in that respect. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

should like to raise what is almost a point of order. We submitted two
different amendments that have emerged as one. The first part of the
amendment, which clearly relates to public benefit and the insertion of
the Scottish guidance on its implementation, was separate from the last
subsection (2A). I shall deal with that second provision
first.</div><a name="06070467000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our new
subsection (2A) is intended to close what I think is a loophole in the
Bill, so that the preservation of, or concern for the welfare of,
species or elements of the natural environment, which cannot
automatically be assumed to be for the public benefit, would
nevertheless be considered charitable. Charities that are for the
protection of the environment clearly qualify under clause 2, under the
heads of charity. However, under the Bill, by contrast to previous
charity legislation, they must also now pass the public benefit test.
It is not clear to me how the preservation of an area of wilderness,
such as the Antarctic or the Arctic, would be easily defined as for the
public benefit. Likewise, we can imagine that the work of a charity
such as St. Tiggywinkles, which looks after the welfare of hedgehogs,
has no great implications for biodiversity or pet care that might
indirectly benefit the public. What I wanted to achieve by the
provision was to put the issue beyond
doubt.</div><a name="06070467000180"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070467000427"></a>Helen
Goodman:</b> I am most sympathetic to the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s arguments. In a sense, to go back to the discussion
that we had about religion, he is saying that we have moved on from the
idea that the world is here simply for our pleasure and that we can
exploit and use it. He is right if he is talking about whether all the
value of the natural environment is to be measured in terms of the
pleasure that we derive from it. Is that the point that he is
making?</div><a name="06070467000181"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070467000428"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Lady, who has made the
point far more eloquently than I was doing. She is entirely right. The
amendment is also intended to reflect the simple humane instinct to be
charitable, which is relevant to the simple care of animals such as
hedgehogs, where not even environmental benefit is at
stake.</div>
<a name="06070467000182"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070467000429"></a>Alun
Michael:</b> I am interested in the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
response to my hon. Friend, because it seems to me that the list in
clause 2(2) very much reflects the developments that he was referring
to. Paragraph (i), for instance, refers to</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column28" />Column number: 29</div><a name="06070467000304"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the advancement of environmental
protection or
improvement&#148;</div><a name="06070467000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">and I also
particularly welcome, as I did on Second Reading, the inclusion of
animal welfare. It is clear that animal welfare cannot directly be the
welfare of people. Is not it essential, however, that there should be a
test to prevent an organisation&#146;s simply saying, &#147;We
exist to serve the arts&#148;&#151;to take the arts as an
example&#151;&#147;and therefore we are charitable&#148;? There
must be a test of whether the organisations will operate for the wider
public benefit, and that is what the public benefit test is about.
However, clause 2(2) surely covers the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
point.</div><a name="06070467000184"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070467000430"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> The right hon. Gentleman is right up to a point.
The point about the list in clause 2(2) is that it is necessary but not
sufficient to achieve charitable status. A charity must fall within it
and be for the public benefit. Falling within the categories listed in
subsection (2) and being for the protection of the environment is not
sufficient for the achievement of charitable status. However, I agree
that it is right that there should in addition be a public benefit
test. Indeed, the rest of the amendment clearly shows that I should
like a stronger public benefit test. I am simply trying to put beyond
doubt certain categories of charitable activity that would not
immediately show themselves to be for the public benefit, and to make
it clear in the Bill that they are to be treated as being for the
public benefit. I hope that that reassures the right hon.
Gentleman.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070467000431"></a>Alun
Michael:</b> Yes, I think that there is not a great difference
between us, but we need to be careful about amending the Bill, because
inclusion in clause 2(2) suggests that there is a public benefit in
improving the environment and in animal welfare and so on. We regard
those as part of what my hon. Friend the Member for Bishop Auckland
called those we share the planet with. That brings those activities
specifically within the ambit of charitable activity. We must not go
the further stage of saying that because environmental benefit or any
other aspect of the amendment is presumed, someone would be treated as
a charity and no more questions would need to be
asked.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070467000432"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. May I take this opportunity to remind all
Members that interventions should be
brief?</div><a name="06070467000187"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070467000433"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I take the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s point,
but the point is worthy of an amendment to clarify it and to put it
beyond doubt. I shall leave it at
that.</div><a name="06070467000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">The larger part
of what has ended up as the amendment would insert into the Bill word
for word the definition that has been adopted by the Scottish
Parliament in the Charities and Trustee Investment (Scotland) Act 2005.
That has a number of things to recommend it, as I said in my speech on
Second Reading. First, there is the obvious benefit of consistency. The
point was made in that debate that, with the devolution of powers, we
do not have to have consistency&#151;it is not necessary or
compulsory in any sense&#151;and I quite agree with that. I am a
great supporter of the decentralisation of power and would 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column29" />Column number: 30</div>not seek to impose either the English definition of public benefit on
Scotland or vice versa. Nevertheless, there is an advantage to
consistency where it can be adopted.</div>
<a name="06070467000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">Since Scotland has gone through
that process and adopted what seems to me to be a good set of guidance
on how public benefit is to be implemented by the Office of the
Scottish Charity Regulator, it would be an advantage to charities that
operate both north and south of the border to have the same definition
and guidance reflected in our Bill. There is also an argument in
principle in favour of the Scottish test. I shall not repeat everything
that I said on Second Reading, but I would like to make it clear that
some of the attacks made on the clause at the time were not
justified.</div> <a name="06070467000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
measure certainly does not seek to attack private schools or other
institutions that might be seen to be subject to it more than charities
in general. It is about encouraging the best possible practice. That
became clear in the Scots debate, when Donald Gorrie MSP set out the
desired outcome, which I would recommend as well. He
said:</div><a name="06070467000305"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
position that I take, and which Liberal Democrats and, I hope, other
people take, is that it should not be a blanket yes-or-no question as
to whether fee-paying schools can be or must be charities. Each
fee-paying school should have to demonstrate...that, in all the
various ways in which it works, it provides a genuine public
benefit&#151;through its scholarships, through use of its facilities,
through the training that it gives trainee teachers and through the
work that it does in the community as a
whole.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Scottish Parliament Official
Report</i>, 9 March 2005; c.
15113.]</div><a name="06070467000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those sentiments were
echoed by Labour Members and Ministers in the Scottish Parliament and
were clearly not intended as an attack on the sector as a
whole.</div> <a name="06070467000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">Now that the
Scottish Act is law, OSCR has issued guidance on the public benefit
test and its interpretation of it. That guidance makes it quite clear
that the amendment is a moderate and reasonable proposal. It
states:</div><a name="06070467000306"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It is
worth noting that the Act draws a distinction between disbenefit and
unduly restrictive conditions (including any charge or fee). The mere
imposition of charges or fees is therefore not to be considered a
disbenefit: rather, the level of charges or fees must be considered in
the context of the provision of benefit to a section of the public and
the relative impact such fees, charges or other restrictions
have.&#148;</div><a name="06070467000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">It goes on to
say:</div><a name="06070467000307"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The Act,
in stating that a condition may not be unduly restrictive, accepts that
there may be a certain level of restriction. The issue is whether any
condition is unduly restrictive: in other words, whether it is
excessively restrictive or restrictive in contradiction of moral or
legal standards. The fact that a (prospective) charity provides
benefits that will be charged for and will be provided mainly to people
who can afford to pay the charges does not necessarily mean that the
organisation is not set up for and does not operate for the benefit of
the
public.&#148;</div><a name="06070467000194"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070467000434"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> Can the hon. Gentleman tell me whether he thinks,
in view of the fact that there is a reducing number of applications for
higher education, that the fees charged by higher education
institutions are unduly restrictive according to the definition that he
has just read out?</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column30" />Column number: 31</div><a name="06070467000195"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070467000435"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I think that I have spotted the trap that the
hon. Gentleman has laid for me. I am not in favour of top-up fees of
any description in higher education, but I did not say that they
contradicted moral or legal standards in the way that OSCR describes.
Top-up fees would certainly not exclude a British university from
charitable
status.</div><a name="06070467000196"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070467000436"></a>Edward
Miliband:</b> The hon. Member for Isle of Wight asks an
interesting question, and the hon. Member for Cheltenham has given his
answer. Perhaps he could say why he believes that top-up fees are not
unduly
restrictive.</div><a name="06070467000197"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070467000437"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> That is something that I happily leave to the
court, the Charity Commission and the tribunal.</div>
<a name="06070467000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purpose of the amendment is
clearly simply to set a higher bar for the public benefit test. In a
briefing to its members, the Independent Schools Council gives exactly
the kind of advice that I would have wanted it to give on that point.
It says that that is not actually a great risk to private schools that
are seriously attempting to promote public benefit, and
says:</div><a name="06070467000308"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Commission is primarily there to help charities stay within the law,
rather than to penalise charities which are having difficulty
delivering enough public benefit. If the Commission considers that a
school is not delivering enough public benefit its first course will be
to advise the trustees. The aim will be to repair the public benefit
deficit within a reasonable timescale, and the Commission will advise
the trustees in this
process.&#148;</div><a name="06070467000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">It goes
on:</div><a name="06070467000309"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Loss of
charitable status is very much the last resort. In most cases it would
require two sets of intransigent trustees (which is hardly likely) for
the Commission to invoke this ultimate
sanction.&#148;</div><a name="06070467000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is clear
that the Independent Schools Council, while lobbying against that
stricter definition or guidance on public benefit, acknowledges in its
advice to its members exactly what we are saying: that a stricter
public benefit test will result in more public benefit, and in
organisations such as public schools seeking to advance the public
benefit more obviously and
demonstrably.</div><a name="06070467000201"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070467000438"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> How would the hon. Gentleman view this extract
from the Charity Commission&#146;s document, &#147;Public
Benefit&#151;the Charity Commission&#146;s approach&#148;? Where
charities are not delivering public benefit, the commission says more
or less the same thing as the Independent Schools Council, but the
document goes on to
say:</div><a name="06070467000310"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;However,
in extreme cases, where the trustees are co-operating with us but the
organisation simply cannot in all the circumstances provide public
benefit, our action might include removing the charity from the
register and making a legal scheme where necessary to ensure that any
charitable assets of the organisation will in the future be applied for
other charitable
purposes&#148;.</div><a name="06070467000202"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070467000439"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I am surprised by what the hon. Gentleman has
read, and it would be useful to know the context of the extract, but
presumably it applies to the law as it stands now. Is that
correct?</div><a name="06070467000203"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070467000440"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> I certainly assume so&#151;save, of course, for
the important distinction that the hon. Gentleman 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column31" />Column number: 32</div>is supporting the abolition of the presumption of public benefit in
education, which I find somewhat more
difficult.</div>
<a name="06070467000204"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070467000441"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I do not think that the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
quote from the Charity Commission necessarily invalidates what I have
been saying. In fact, there are plenty of quotations&#151;from the
National Council for Voluntary Organisations, various representatives
of the voluntary sector and, indeed, other commission
documents&#151;to suggest that there is still confusion under the
current law; that, if the new public benefit test changes things at
all, that confusion will remain and perhaps increase; and that
therefore much more clarity is needed in the Bill. It is that clarity
that I seek to provide through this
amendment.</div><a name="06070467000205"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070467000442"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> This is an interesting amendment, not least for
the fact that it has two separate elements. When I read clause 3, I
must say that I found it hard to believe in light of what the hon.
Gentleman said on Second Reading. He asked
me:</div><a name="06070467000311"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Am I right
in thinking that the hon. Gentleman is therefore retreating even from
the position of his noble Friends in another place? They said that
&#145;all charities&#146; should &#145;have to meet a public
benefit test, no matter what their purposes
are&#146;.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>, 26 June 2006; Vol.
448, c. 38.]</div><a name="06070467000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">I misunderstood the
hon. Gentleman completely because I thought at the time that he was
concerned because he thought I was wrong to resist the abolition of the
public benefit presumption. Now I know that it was not that he objected
to the public benefit presumption&#151;indeed, he is in favour of it
in the appropriate circumstance&#151;but that he was merely concerned
about my welfare in the junior ranks of the Opposition Front Bench, in
case I might inadvertently have stumbled and disagreed with my noble
Friend Lord
Hodgson.</div><a name="06070467000207"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070467000443"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I think the hon. Gentleman is getting his
presumptions mixed up and I apologise for the poor drafting of the
amendment if that is the case. The presumption that I was attacking on
Second Reading was a presumption that attaches to any specific one of
the 13 heads of charities. I do not suggest that, under this amendment,
any of them should not have to pass a public benefit
test.</div><a name="06070467000208"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070467000444"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> I am not sure that that statement is consistent
with the amendment, which
states:</div><a name="06070467000312"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It is
presumed that a charity established for the benefit of the natural
environment, or the living species within it, exists for the public
benefit.&#148;</div><a name="06070467000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is exactly
the public benefit presumption&#151;<i class="I">[Interruption.] </i>The
Parliamentary Secretary makes my point more quickly than I could.
It&#146;s a fair cop. I am pleased that the Liberal Democrats have
gone away from their assumption that all presumption is bad
presumption.</div><a name="06070467000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">If I may
assist the hon. Member for Cheltenham in answering the right hon.
Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth who intervened in his speech, the
mere fact that there is a presumption does not mean that that is the
end of it. It means that it is the beginning of it; if a charity
misbehaves, it can lose the benefit of that presumption as I believe
happened at the Finsbury 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column32" />Column number: 33</div>Park mosque. I am very pleased indeed that the hon.
Gentleman has accepted that there is nothing wrong with presumption. I
would find it difficult&#151;he is shaking his head, so presumably I
have misunderstood
him.</div><a name="06070467000211"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070467000445"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> The hon. Gentleman has misunderstood me. I know
there is a slight temptation when in a hole to stop digging, but I will
attempt to explain the difference to him. If the amendment were
accepted, a charity that qualified under clause 2 (2)(i), which refers
to</div> <a name="06070467000313"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the advancement of
environment protection or
improvement&#148;,</div><a name="06070467000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">would still
have to prove that it passed a public benefit test. It is the term
&#147;public&#148; that my amendment sought to clarify, not
&#147;to unduly
restrict&#148;.</div><a name="06070467000213"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070467000446"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b><b class="B"> </b>The lawyers would have a field day when
they tried to tie up the words in the amendment with the words uttered
in Committee. I suspect that the words in the amendment would take
precedence, which is the normal
procedure.</div><a name="06070467000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was about
to say that many charities and organisations in the Isle of Wight are,
in my view, entitled to charitable status&#151;for example, the Isle
of Wight donkey sanctuary and the Isle of Wight bat
hospital&#151;which may not be charities, but which deliver exactly
the kind of benefits, whether public or otherwise, that the hon.
Gentleman seeks to secure. I am very glad that he does so and were the
two parts of the amendment separate, I would be happy to support him. I
hope he will be happy to support me when we come to amendments Nos. 4
and 54.</div><a name="06070467000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would like
clarity about what the rest of the amendment means. First, I assume
that &#147;members&#148; in the phrase &#147;members of the
body&#148; in the amendment does not mean the same as members in the
sense of members of a company, but I am not quite sure. The members of
a company are the directors; the members of a charity are the
trustees.</div><a name="06070467000216"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070467000447"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I am grateful for the intervention, but the hon.
Gentleman is wrong. Members are not equivalent to trustees. There are
membership organisations&#151;such as the Alzheimer&#146;s Society,
the Multiple Sclerosis Society, the Royal Society for the Protection of
Birds or the National Trust&#151;whose membership is substantial but
is not at all the same as the trustees, who are the governing body of
the organisation. That is the
distinction.</div><a name="06070467000332"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.30
pm</div><a name="06070467000217"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070467000448"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> That was exactly why I raised the issue. I was not
sure whether the hon. Gentleman meant members in the sense of the
members of a company, who are the directors of the company, or members
in the sense of members of the National Trust, who pay their five
shillings or whatever and receive a glossy magazine every couple of
months. Now I understand what the hon. Gentleman means by
&#147;members&#148;. The amendment goes on to
say</div><a name="06070467000314"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;or any other persons
(other than as members of the
public)&#148;.</div><a name="06070467000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that he
is saying that the Charity Commission should consider, in relation to
whether a body is providing a public benefit, whether the members of
the body gain more than other persons&#151;that is, members of the
public.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column33" />Column number: 34</div><a name="06070467000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Gentleman argues that
the Charity Commission should also
consider</div><a name="06070467000315"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;disbenefit
incurred, or likely to be incurred, by the public in consequence of the
body exercising its
functions&#148;.</div><a name="06070467000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
introducing the amendment, he did not really say anything about that. I
wonder exactly what kind of disbenefit he has in mind. What kind of
disbenefit can a charitable nursing home confer on the rest of the
world? What kind of disbenefit does a school confer on the rest of the
world? Perhaps he could go into more detail. He said on Second Reading
that he would be quite generous towards the independent sector, and I
am trying to work out what exactly is covered up by the words
&#147;disbenefit&#148; and &#147;compares with the benefit
gained, or likely to be gained, by the public in that
consequence&#148;.</div><a name="06070467000221"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070467000449"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I can reassure the hon. Gentleman that there is
no cover-up. In fact, a very public document, the guidance from the
Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator, explains the matter in
enormous detail. I shall not test your patience by reading it out now,
Mrs. Humble, but perhaps in my closing remarks I can quote any passage
that the hon. Gentleman is interested in that explains exactly how
disbenefit is to be
interpreted.</div><a name="06070467000222"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070467000450"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> I look forward to that, as I am sure the rest of
the Committee does. With any luck, we will then be ready for lunch.
Before then, however, I would like to raise some other issues relating
to the amendment, because the behaviour of the Charity Commission, the
National Council for Voluntary Organisations and one or two other
organisations in respect of this principle has been pretty odd. They
started by saying that amendments were not needed. They now seem to
have gone head over heels&#151;I think that is the polite
phrase&#151;and decided that there is a reason for the
principle.</div><a name="06070467000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the
Committee that scrutinised the draft Bill on 9 June 2004,
Lord Foulkes, who was then a Member of this House, said
that</div><a name="06070467000316"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;you have not
suggested any definition of public
benefit&#148;.</div><a name="06070467000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">Mr.
Etherington, for the NCVO,
said:</div><a name="06070467000317"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Because
there is an established common-law definition of public benefit in
relation to the four existing heads of
charity.&#148;</div><a name="06070467000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">Mr. Foulkes, as
he then was,
said:</div><a name="06070467000318"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;But that
has been discredited&#148;</div><a name="06070467000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">and
Mr. Etherington
said:</div><a name="06070467000319"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I do not
believe it has been
discredited.&#148;</div><a name="06070467000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">Later,
under question 59, Mr. Etherington said
that</div><a name="06070467000320"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;my own view is that
public benefit established through case law has worked well in relation
to the fourth head of charity. It is a flexible mechanism, it is a
common-law mechanism and it prevents the common law from becoming
sclerotic&#148;&#151;</div><a name="06070467000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">that
is a lovely word for someone who has lost their
teeth&#151;</div><a name="06070467000321"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;provided
that there are adequate appeals mechanisms against which to check
it&#148;.</div><a name="06070467000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
interested in why the NCVO and the Charity Commission have changed
their position. I understand, of course, that one of their functions is
to give advice, but it is odd that they are giving advice without
explaining why they have changed their position in an 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column34" />Column number: 35</div>area that is clearly the subject of substantial controversy. It would be
helpful if they had explained why they changed their position.
Initially, the Charity Commission took the view that the reversal of
the presumption of public benefit would have no effect and then they
changed their position.</div>
<a name="06070467000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand that there was a
memorandum agreed between the hon. Member for Slough (Fiona
Mactaggart), who was then a Home Office Minister, and the Charity
Commission, which set out in some detail that the current law on public
benefit would be preserved by the draft Charities Bill. It explained
something else that I found particularly interesting, which was that
the test of public benefit is not the same for each of those categories
in clause 2(2). Where there is already a presumption of public benefit,
is it the case that a new public benefit test has to be created? If
not, what is the public benefit test given that it is not necessarily
the same as the other public benefit tests? That may be why the Charity
Commission has changed its position. The problem is that it does not
say so. It says that the law on public benefit will evolve and develop
over time.</div> <a name="06070467000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Charity Commission also says in the memorandum
that</div><a name="06070467000322"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the principles in
<i class="I">Re Resch</i> are sufficiently clear to enable
them&#148;</div><a name="06070467000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">&#151;that is,
the Charity Commission&#151;to determine whether a particular
educational charity is charitable. It then changes its position and we
all get confused. Therefore, will the hon. Gentleman, in his summing
up, speculate as to why the Charity Commission has changed its
position?</div> <a name="06070467000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was most
disappointed that a circular letter was sent round that the Red Cross
signed. I thought that the Red Cross was above politics and political
controversy, but Sir Nicholas Young signed that controversial document.
At least, I thought it was controversial until the Liberal Democrats
supported it. Now I realise that there is unity across the rest of the
Committee and that it is probably not controversial at all. However, it
sets out a position that few hon. Members appear to support, which is
that we need a tighter definition. I speculate as to why that might
be.</div><a name="06070467000234"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070467000451"></a>James
Duddridge:</b> The hon. Member for Cheltenham has tried
several times to explain his complete inconsistency over putting
forward a public benefit test, but has failed to do so in my mind. I
will not be supporting the amendment. I would support it if it was part
of a broader agreement by the Liberal Democrats to include the
presumptive benefit for poverty, religion, education and health that
previously existed. However, as they are throwing out those, I see no
reason to bring in a public benefit test specifically for the natural
environment, however worthy it
is.</div><a name="06070467000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
has been much debate about large fees. In every case, there has been a
leap from fee-paying to schools and education. I am interested to know
from the Minister whether any significant organisations outside the
education sphere will also be covered because I have not seen any real
debate about fee-paying institutions above and beyond the education
sector.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070467000452"></a>Tom
Levitt:</b> I may have looked as though I was raising my hand,
but I was indicating that only one Labour Back Bencher made the
argument that the hon. Gentleman is
describing.</div><a name="06070467000238"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070467000453"></a>James
Duddridge:</b> I forgive the hon. Gentleman. I have got
<i class="I">Hansard, </i>but<i class="I">&#151;</i>I thought the hon. Member for Stroud
(Mr. Drew) and another hon. Gentleman made the point and they referred
referring to a larger level of support. However, I am more than happy
to look at <i class="I">Hansard </i>and talk to the hon. Member for High Peak
after the debate.</div>
<a name="06070467000239"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070467000454"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> Have not the Government missed a trick? Should they
not be encouraging private education rather than restricting
it?</div><a name="06070467000240"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070467000455"></a>James
Duddridge:</b> I agree. Given the wonderful new Labour phrase
&#147;direction of travel&#148;, it is entirely inconsistent that
there should be a blurring of the lines between the public and private
sectors but that more is not being made of the charitable sector in
independent schools and in the health sector. My hon. Friend makes a
good point; the Government seem to be going in the opposite
direction.</div><a name="06070467000241"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070467000456"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> The hon. Gentleman continues to portray the
amendment as an attack on private schools, despite my assurances to the
contrary. Will he explain why the head teacher of Dean Close school in
my constituency, whom I quoted on Second Reading, supports stricter
guidance on public benefit and says that his school has nothing to fear
from
it?</div><a name="06070467000242"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070467000457"></a>James
Duddridge:</b> I welcome that intervention, but I speak for
myself not for the head teacher of a particular school. I am aware that
the Independent Schools Council has taken a certain view. It has
written to hon. Members saying:</div>
<a name="06070467000323"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;For each &#163;1 of
fiscal benefit, schools give back &#163;3 in help with fees and other
charitable giving, plus a further &#163;2 in irrecoverable
VAT&#148;.</div><a name="06070467000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">All that is on top
of some &#163;2 billion that the Government would have to spend to
educate people in the public sector. Although I am not a lawyer, re
Resch touched upon that issue. It seems that public schools have a
clear public benefit, and the biggest benefit is that &#163;2
billion.</div><a name="06070467000244"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070467000458"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> I have never spoken to the head teacher of Dean
Close school, but I recall that when the hon. Member for Cheltenham
mentioned that institution on Second Reading, the public benefit
appeared to be the use of its theatre. Similarly, the public benefit to
be gained from other independent schools appears to be the use of their
sports facilities&#151;or even the rowing trenches that were built at
huge expense near Slough. Is not the really important public benefit
that is to be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column36" />Column number: 37</div>derived from public education that people are taught and that they
learn&#151;and that they and the nation are better as a
result?</div><a name="06070467000245"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070467000459"></a>James
Duddridge:</b> My hon. Friend makes the point incredibly well.
I agree that that is the overwhelming public benefit. However, that is
not to say that there are not other public benefits.</div>
<a name="06070467000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">I congratulate the Government
on their general push to encourage fee-paying charitable organisations
to demonstrate greater public benefit. Withdrawing the presumed public
benefit is not right; there are other methods over and above the
presumed public benefit that could encourage, if not compel, those
schools to be more involved in the community. A number of points were
made in the Chamber on those questions and what I have described would
be a much better way forward than withdrawing the presumption of public
benefit.</div>
<a name="06070467000247"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070467000460"></a>Tom
Levitt:</b> I was fascinated by the suggestion of the hon.
Member for Wellingborough (Mr. Bone) that, because a group of
organisations pays tax, they contribute to the public benefit. He said
that the money that private schools contribute to the economy should be
regarded as a public benefit. I therefore look forward to being
classified as a charity because I too pay tax, although not to the same
extent. The hon. Gentleman would extend public benefit rather further
than do the clauses on charitable purpose that we have already
considered.</div> <a name="06070467000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">During
the 20 minutes of that six-and-a-half hour Second Reading debate that I
was out of the Chamber, my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud spoke. I
therefore accept that two Labour Back Benchers were expressing that
view, not one. Another, whom I heard loud and clear, was my hon. Friend
the Member for Selby (Mr. Grogan), although we seemed to reach some
sort of compromise in our exchange. I shall return to that in a
moment.</div>
<a name="06070467000333"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.45
pm</div><a name="06070467000249"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070467000461"></a>James
Duddridge:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that Labour Back
Benchers are pressuring the Government to do more in their attack on
independent schools? That is one reason why the Parliamentary Secretary
would be so clear, forthright and assertive towards that sector. Indeed
a number of people hold similar
views.</div><a name="06070467000250"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070467000462"></a>Tom
Levitt:</b> The hon. Gentleman should not believe everything
that he reads in the newspapers. Certainly there are people who are
opposed to public schools in principle. I was disappointed by the
number of my colleagues who set their face so firmly against trust
status arrangements for local authority schools, but I do not think
that there is a one-to-one correlation between those two points of
view.</div> <a name="06070467000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said on
Second Reading, I have been in the Labour party for 30 years and I am
uneasy about the idea of private education. It seems to be intended to
bring about privilege rather than pure educational value. That
privilege is bought in a way that others cannot afford. Teachers who
are very often trained at the public expense are then taken out of the
state 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column37" />Column number: 38</div>system and used in the private sector. Those are things that have
worried people in principle on our Benches since time immemorial. But
we are where we are. In the big church that we advocate on the Labour
Benches we take many views on board.</div>
<a name="06070467000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">Indeed, the private education
system has produced some excellent and senior members of the Labour
party. I am sure that it will continue to do so. But that does not mean
that we all have had Pauline conversions. I accept that the private
sector, especially in the field of special education, provides
facilities that the state sector then buys into. That is very valuable.
I think in particular of institutions such as the Mary Hare school in
Berkshire that are provided on a scale which it perhaps would not be
cost effective for the state to fund. The state then buys in so that
people whose special needs necessitate it can be educated in the
private sector. We are seeing the same in health with operations being
bought from the private sector in order to fulfil public need and on a
public service basis. In other words it is at no cost to the
individual.</div> <a name="06070467000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">All those
examples of partnership are valuable. This part of the Bill had a
hugely disproportionate amount of scrutiny when it was in another
place. I hope that we will not spend the same proportion of our time
discussing public benefit. But this Bill is not about the status quo as
far as public schools are concerned. I believe it is right to end the
presumption that anything that has education in its purpose is
automatically a charitable purpose. There has to be a demonstration of
public benefit. I pay tribute to those schools in that sector that have
already started taking those moral responsibilities seriously. Some
public schools are allowing and encouraging the joint use, community
use or shared use with other schools of drama facilities, sports
facilities or wider school facilities. It may be for summer clubs
during the holidays or to help students on pre-university courses. I
welcome those examples of partnership.</div>
<a name="06070467000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the Bill goes further along
the road of promoting those partnerships and making sure that the use
of those facilities which have hitherto only been the prerogative of
the few and the wealthy few, by and large, it is, dare I say it, almost
socialist in action and is therefore to be welcomed. The Bill is right
that where the public benefit cannot be demonstrated and where there is
total exclusion of the public from the use, then charitable status
should be withdrawn. But I note that even if every public school were
to fail on the public benefit criterion, only something like 4 per
cent. of the income of public schools would be removed from
them.</div> <a name="06070467000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">While 4 per
cent. is useful for them to have and encourages them into the
partnerships that we are advocating, it is not a death blow to them
should it be removed. Nevertheless, it is important to have the
opportunity to say that there is no public benefit from an institution
and that its charitable status should therefore be
removed.</div>
<a name="06070467000256"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070467000463"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I am enjoying much of what the hon. Gentleman is
saying and I agree with a great deal of it, but he might have been
wrong on one point of detail. If a public school were by any chance to
lose its charitable status, that would be a much more serious matter
than just losing 4 per cent. of its income, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column38" />Column number: 39</div>because, as a non-charitable institution, it would not be able
to use the charitable assets that it had accumulated. Charitable assets
must remain charitable.
</div><a name="06070467000257"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070467000464"></a>Tom
Levitt:</b> Yes, I had not thought of that aspect. I do not
know what happens to an organisation&#146;s assets when it loses its
charitable status or whether they are affected in that way, but I am
willing to take the hon. Gentleman&#146;s word for it. I am not
advocating that we should remove the 4 per cent., but that schools
should behave in a way that guarantees that they continue to get
it.</div> <a name="06070467000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">On this issue, I
regard the Bill as progressive. I shall not dismiss the amendment
tabled by the hon. Member for Cheltenham as upholding the Cheltenham
principle, because it is important that we air these matters. Although
we should not adopt the words that he has proposed, we have had a good
debate on this subject. We should acknowledge the fact that the issue
has undergone particular scrutiny in the other place, adopt the clause
as it stands and move on.</div>
<a name="06070467000259"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070467000465"></a>Alun
Michael:</b> I am grateful for the opportunity to make a
couple of brief points, and I hope that we can use the debate to
clarify beyond doubt the issue of the public benefit test. There has
been a great deal of scrutiny of the provisions, and I hope that the
Minister will be able to confirm my understanding of what is happening
in them.</div><a name="06070467000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand
why the hon. Member for Cheltenham has tabled the amendment.
Essentially, he is saying that having included environmental benefit,
for instance, in the list in clause 2(2), there is a danger that the
consideration given to the public benefit might lead to it being ruled
out again. I can see the point of that, and if we deal with these
issues in everyday language, there would appear to be such a
danger.</div> <a name="06070467000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, my
understanding is slightly different. We are muddling up two issues.
First, there is a series of specific benefits, which are recognised in
the list of charitable purposes in clause 2(2). Environmental benefit,
animal welfare and so on are clearly understood as charitable purposes.
The public benefit test, therefore, must be a test of the extent to
which those purposes are delivered and of whether the way in which the
charity is acting is appropriate to delivering them.</div>
<a name="06070467000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, it would be
wrong&#151;this is the fear that the hon. Gentleman is
expressing&#151;to return to the list and say, &#147;You cannot
identify individuals and groups in the community that get that benefit,
so we can overturn its inclusion in the list.&#148; That cannot be
right and it cannot be the intention. The public benefit test does not,
and cannot, allow the Charity Commission to question whether the
charitable purposes listed in clause 2(2) are indeed charitable. From
this point on, that must be a given.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column39" />Column number: 40</div><a name="06070467000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">The public benefit test relates
to the extent to which the charity delivers charitable purposes
consistently and appropriately, as against all the other tests of what
is charitable, which is very clear, having been set out in previous
legislation and in case law.</div>
<a name="06070467000264"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070467000466"></a>Mr.
Turner:</b> Perhaps the right hon. Gentleman will correct if I
am wrong, but he is saying that if a cause occurs under clause 2(2), it
is not only a purpose that has the potential to be charitable if it
demonstrates that it is to the public benefit, but affects the way in
which the Charity Commission will test whether it achieves the public
benefit. The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster has said that there
has always been a view that public benefit ought to be able to be
demonstrated. How does the hon. Gentleman think that the charity
concerned could demonstrate that it is to the public benefit in this
purpose; that is, to the advantage of environmental
protection?</div><a name="06070467000265"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070467000467"></a>Alun
Michael:</b> Let me put it in terms of animal welfare, since
that has been the subject of debate over many years. The argument
against animal welfare would be that it does not produce a public
benefit, because it does not benefit people. The other side of the
argument is that there is actually a public benefit to being concerned
about the welfare of those with whom we share the planet. Therefore, a
public good comes out of animal welfare that may not benefit human
beings individually or as a group. That also applies to some of the
charities on Isle of Wight, to which the hon. Gentleman referred
earlier. Surely, by listing animal welfare, the definition has put
beyond doubt the fact that there is a public benefit in pursuing
it.</div><a name="06070467000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">Similarly, there
could be consequences in terms of the environment and national parks,
with people going out for recreation and enjoyment, and so on, but the
environment is mentioned in clause 2(2), which puts it beyond doubt
that landscape and environmental benefit is a charitable purpose.
Therefore, it cannot be said, using the test of public benefit, that
that is not charitable. It would be wrong to have a presumption that
any organisation that sets itself up, saying, &#147;I am
environmental&#148;, is not subject to question through the
&#147;public benefit&#148; test. Such organisations have to be
asked, &#147;Are you pursuing that charitable purpose appropriately
and efficiently and have you passed all the other tests that are
traditionally accepted as the ones that check whether a charity meets
its
purpose?&#148;</div><a name="06070467000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments may result in a danger that clause 2(2) could be
revisited and overturned by the public benefit test. Surely, that
cannot be the purpose. I am discussing the matter in that way because I
hope that my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary&#146;s response
might help us kill off that fear, which has created an enormous amount
of the debate that took place in another
place.</div><a name="06070467000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">Debate
adjourned.&#151;<i class="I">[Liz
Blackman.]</i></div><a name="06070467000269"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Adjourned
accordingly at two minutes to One o&#146;clock until this day at Four
o&#146;clock.</i></div>
