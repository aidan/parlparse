Alexander</b> (Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey)
(LD): I beg to move amendment No. 204, in
clause 3, page 3, line 30, leave
out paragraph (b).</div><a name="06101944000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will be relatively brief. I am grateful to the Association of British
Insurers for drawing to my attention a potential problem with
subsection (3)(b). The ABI is concerned that, unless action is taken to
amend the provision, many thousands of people with long-term health
problems could be at risk of seeing the income from their former
employment dramatically
reduced.</div><a name="06101944000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the
Committee will know, income protection insurance provides people on
long-term sickness absence, for example, with a regular monthly payment
to keep their overall income at just below the level that it would have
been had they been in receipt of wages. In setting the premiums that
people pay for such insurance, the insurance industry currently takes
the levels of incapacity benefit into account. That is because a person
whose employment has not been terminated and who receives incapacity
benefit and payments under income protection insurance purchased for
them by their employer, does not have their incapacity benefit reduced
by the amount of their income protection insurance. However, there is
concern that the way in which the clause is drafted will mean that that
insurance will be taken into account. That could raise premiums,
discourage people from taking out income protection insurance and, in
particular, discourage employers from taking out such insurance on
behalf of their staff. I hope that the Minister can offer some
reassurance on that point.</div>
<a name="06101944000021"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101944000190"></a>The
Minister for Employment and Welfare Reform (Mr. Jim
Murphy):</b> Thank you, Mr. Hood, for chairing our
short proceedings this morning. From talking to hon. Members on both
sides of the Committee, I know that there is an eagerness to make
progress and to reach the later clauses that contain much of the
substance of the Bill. I shall therefore take some encouragement from
the hon. Gentleman and seek to be relatively brief in this response
and, where possible, in others this morning.</div>
<a name="06101944000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that I can reassure the
hon. Gentleman on the point that he has raised. As he knows, the
amendment would change the definition of &#147;pension
payment&#148; by 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column89" />Column number: 90</div>removing the reference to insurance payments that would be deducted from
contributory employment and support allowance. The current legislation
on IB allows certain insurance payments to be deducted, and the Bill
allows for regulations setting out which insurance payments will be
deducted from contributory benefit.</div>
<a name="06101944000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">The regulations under the
existing provision draw a distinction between payments that are made
under insurance in respect of long-term ill health or disability, which
are made while the person is still employed and are, therefore,
equivalent to a form of sick pay, and payments that are made after
employment has ended, which are more like a pension payment. Only the
second type of payment will be deducted, and I hope that I can reassure
the ABI on that through the hon. Gentleman. We shall not seek to deduct
insurance payments funded by the employer and paid to an employee whose
employment has not come to an end.</div>
<a name="06101944000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before the rule was introduced
into incapacity benefit, the principle was discussed with the ABI,
which agreed that it was sensible, and we intend to bring the rule
forward into the new benefit. The regulations under the clause will
have exactly the same effect as the current rules, and we do not intend
to extend the provision to other types of insurance payments or to
payments made while a person is still in employment. With that, I hope
that the hon. Gentleman will consider withdrawing the
amendment.</div>
<a name="06101944000025"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101944000191"></a>Danny

ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div>
<a name="06101944000026"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment, by leave,
withdrawn.</i></div>
<a name="06101944000027"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question proposed,</i> That
the clause stand part of the
Bill.</div><a name="06101944000028"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06101944000192"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Tim Boswell</b> (Daventry) (Con): Good morning, Mr.
Hood. I need not detain the Committee long on this issue, but I just
want to pause on one aspect on which I have not tabled an amendment. In
a sense, it follows on from the exchanges that we have just had about
the definition of what are and what are not pension payments. You would
certainly not thank me for extending the debate to cover wider issues,
such as the set-off of pension payments and entitlements that former
employees may receive before they reach retirement age and whether
those should be partially stopped for incapacity benefit. On the other
hand, as our earlier exchange indicated, there are concerns about what
constitutes a pension
payment.</div><a name="06101944000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again, I do
not need to give the Committee an elegant essay on the changing
definitions. I happen to be an avid listener to Classic FM when I am in
the car and it has a number of advertisements that talk about
annuities. Clearly that word has modified from its 16th century origins
as annual payments to repay money that had been lent to the king.
[<i class="I">Interruption.</i>]</div><a name="06101944000030"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101944000193"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I may as well remind hon. Members that I
will not tolerate any comments from a sedentary
position.</div><a name="06101944000031"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101944000194"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> I am grateful, Mr. Hood. I promise
that I will not try the patience of the Committee. I am merely making
the point that words and definitions change over time. Like
&#147;annuity&#148;, the word &#147;pension&#148; 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column90" />Column number: 91</div>has changed. If we were having this debate in the 18th century it would
be regarded as a somewhat derogatory term because it would be money
that the sovereign of the day often paid to people, to use the modern
jargon, of working age whom he wished to reward for services rendered.
It had nothing at all to do with their retirement. I appreciate that
that does not happen now and I would not wish to suggest that we return
to that former approach. Nor would I wish to suggest to the Committee
that the Department has failed to consult both on the coverage of the
disallowances for incapacity benefit, or on these
benefits.</div><a name="06101944000032"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101944000195"></a>Mr.
Murphy</b> <i class="I">indicated
assent.</i></div>
<a name="06101944000033"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101944000196"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> I see the Minister nodding. But my keen eye,
which perhaps should have led me to an amendment, leads me to
subsection (3)(c):</div><a name="06101944000163"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;such
other payments as may be
prescribed&#148;.</div><a name="06101944000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is a
wonderful catch-all for authorities to say that they are going to
disallow in any case where they think it appropriate. I do not argue
with the principle of that. I doubt whether even the present
Government&#151;but I will not inflame them&#151;would wish to
introduce arbitrary provisions without consultation. It would be useful
if Ministers could indicate more or less whether there is any precedent
in mind. I have a specific point to mention in this
connection.</div>
<a name="06101944000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection (1) refers to
&#147;pension payments&#148;, &#147;PPF periodic payments&#148;
and</div> <a name="06101944000164"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;payments of a
prescribed
description&#148;,</div><a name="06101944000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">which we
have already debated. There is clearly within the envelope of this some
distinction between pension payments and those paid by the Pension
Protection Fund in compensation for the absence of a pension. There is
also a financial assistance scheme, which is separate from the Pension
Protection Fund and is not specified in the clause. I certainly do not
wish to pick on the financial assistance scheme or its victims&#151;I
regard many of them as victims&#151;who have lost pensions. The
common view of the Committee would be that most of them have suffered
enough. I am simply concerned about the equity between PPF recipients
and FAS recipients. I am anxious to ensure that neither category is
treated unfairly.</div>
<a name="06101944000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">This may be a class with no
members. There may be nobody who would be sufficiently affluent,
because of the limited amounts that the FAS has paid out, to suffer in
one of these ways. The answer could be&#151;the Minister and his
officials may be sharper on this than I am&#151;that no FAS payment
would be paid out until after the statutory retirement age. I highlight
that as an example of the importance of being fair within the
categories. We will not argue<i class="I"> </i>the overall issue about
disallowance. We simply want to ensure that the Bill is fit for
purpose. Perhaps the Minister would like to reflect on that if he
cannot answer it
now.</div><a name="06101944000038"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101944000197"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> I wonder whether, in an attempt to make some
progress this morning, I can respond relatively briefly to the detailed
points that the hon. Gentleman raises. As he knows, these rules
replicate what currently happens under incapacity benefit. Throughout
the consultation process, the Green Paper and the build-up to the
publication of the Bill there was 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column91" />Column number: 92</div>no significant concern about how the present rules operate, apart from
the matter raised in the amendment, which we have already dealt with.
We will continue to consult on any future
changes.</div><a name="06101944000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have sought
reassurances and I can allay the hon. Gentleman&#146;s concerns in
respect of the Bill&#146;s ability to take account of changes in the
pensions market, in the nature of working life, in Government schemes
and in what is available in the private sector. That flexibility is
contained in clause 3(2)(b) and (3)(b). I assure the hon. Gentleman
that in drafting those subsections it was our intention to give the
Bill the flexibility to respond to the evolution of the pensions
market. Of course, if, in Committee or on Report, he wishes to identify
proposals that he does not think have sufficient flexibility, we shall
be happy to discuss them with him.
</div><a name="06101944000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">In respect of
payments from the financial assistance scheme, we take account only of
those payments made over the pensionable age, which I think covers the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s very fair point.</div>
<a name="06101944000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have responded to questions
this morning rather than reiterating the excellently crafted speech
earlier.</div> <a name="06101944000042"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101944000198"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 151, in
clause 4, page 4, line 15, after
&#145;prescribed&#146;, insert</div>
<a name="06101944000164"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#145;including such premiums as are
applicable under paragraphs 11 and 12 of Schedule 2 to the Income
Support (General) Regulations 1987&#146;.</div>
<a name="06101944000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again, I will be brief. I
tabled the amendment in order to probe some significant issues of
principle and some practical issues which relate to the implications of
the proposed abolition of the disability premium for income
support. First, I want to clarify the Government&#146;s rationale for
abolishing the disability premium and, secondly, to clarify the
implications of that abolition for people who may receive it on grounds
that are not related to
incapacity.</div><a name="06101944000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I
understand it, the disability premium for income support that was
introduced in 1987 will be absorbed into either the support or the
work-related activity components of the employment and support
allowance. In a previous Committee sitting we talked briefly about
questions arising from benefits implications, about the implications of
moving towards a single working-age benefit and about the distinction
between benefits that are designed to meet people&#146;s extra costs
and those that are designed to compensate for lost income.</div>
<a name="06101944000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">My understanding is that the
disability premium for income support was, at least in part, designed
to help to meet the extra costs faced by people with disabilities.
However, the implication of the change proposed in the Bill is that for
the vast majority of recipients it will be replaced with a payment that
will be conditional on work-related activity, as it will be a
work-related activity premium in respect of the employment and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column92" />Column number: 93</div>support allowance. I should be grateful if the Minister set out, briefly
but clearly, the Government&#146;s rationale for making such a
significant conceptual change in the purpose of the
payment.</div><a name="06101944000048"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101944000199"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the Minister
might like to share with the Committee his thoughts on the likely
coverage of the proposal? It is not only the definition but the effect
in practice that will interest the many people
involved.</div><a name="06101944000049"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101944000200"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I am not sure that I can comment on what the
Minister might like to do, but I would certainly like him to do
that.</div> <a name="06101944000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">Moving on from
that principle and rationale, there are some practical implications,
particularly for people who are currently, or may in future be in
receipt of the disability premium on grounds not related to incapacity.
I would be grateful if the Minister clarified briefly the implications
of that change. First, will people on means-tested employment and
support allowance still be able to receive the disability premium if
they qualify for it on other grounds, for instance, if they are
registered blind or receiving disability living allowance? Currently,
about four in 10 people on incapacity benefit also receive disability
living allowance.</div>
<a name="06101944000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, will employment and
support allowance recipients be entitled to a disability premium for
their housing or council tax benefit? For employment and support
allowance recipients, what will happen to the currently more favourable
treatment for people receiving the disability premium such as access to
linking rules in relation to benefit, being able to study
full-time&#151;returning to a debate we had earlier in
Committee&#151;and having a higher earnings disregard, which is
&#163;20 rather than
&#163;5?</div><a name="06101944000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">The last
question I should like the Minister to address is: will people on other
benefits such as means-tested jobseeker&#146;s allowance, or carers
or lone parents on income support&#151;in other words, those not in
receipt of ESA or IB at the moment, or ESA in the future&#151;still
be able to receive the disability premium? In other words, will it
still exist for those other classes of benefit recipient? I would be
grateful if the Minister clarified those
matters.</div><a name="06101944000053"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101944000201"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> I shall seek, of course, to respond briefly so
that we can move the proceedings
on.</div><a name="06101944000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">As we have
discussed in Committee already, employment and support allowance is a
different way in which to provide financial support to those whose
medical condition has been assessed objectively and who are entitled
therefore to the new employment and support allowance, either at the
work-related activity rate or support group rate. The Committee has
spoken about that at some length
already.</div><a name="06101944000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that
the hon. Gentleman has acknowledged in previous contributions that ESA
cannot be compared directly to past systems, in respect of incapacity
benefit. When a claimant meets the personal capability assessment
threshold, the new benefit will allow a work-related activity component
or support 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column93" />Column number: 94</div>component to be payable after the initial 13-week assessment
phase&#151;on the fourteenth week of the claim. That is considerably
earlier than in the current arrangements in which the higher benefit
rates are payable after a year of incapacity. That is an important
change and deserves to be highlighted. It will provide financial
support for people away from work for
longer.</div><a name="06101944000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new
structure will support better those for whom we aim to provide that
financial support and encourage those with a limited capability for
work to engage in work-related activity, where appropriate of course.
Current customers will have their benefit levels protected at their
existing rate, and new customers will have their ESA set above the
long-term IB rate.</div><a name="06101944000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman is correct to say that the disability premium does not
form part of the new ESA for reasons that we have discussed in
Committee already. However, I can confirm that if those on ESA meet the
qualifying conditions, they can qualify for the severe and enhanced
disability premiums. That is how I understood his questions. The new
system will be based on those
criteria.</div><a name="06101944000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
that explanation has reassured the hon. Gentleman about what people

receipt of means-tested employment and support allowance will still be
able to receive the disability premium if they qualify for it on other
grounds, such as those not related to
incapacity?</div><a name="06101944000060"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101944000204"></a>Danny

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101944000205"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b><b class="B"> </b>I beg to move amendment No. 5, in
clause 4, page 4, line 19, leave
out subsection
(3).</div><a name="06101944000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment is
designed to probe the Government&#146;s intentions. Paragraph 59 of
the explanatory notes to the Bill gives a comparison by citing
paragraphs 7 and 8 of schedule 7 to the Income Support (General)
Regulations 1987 that prescribe nil amounts of benefit for certain
classes of people. The examples given in the explanatory notes cover
certain prisoners and members of religious orders who are fully
maintained by their order. I agree that, in both cases, a nil amount
would certainly make sense. However, the Bill contains an open power
that could be used in many ways. It places no restriction on how the
nil-amount regulation could be used in practice.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column94" />Column number: 95</div><a name="06101944000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should be grateful if, in his
response, the Minister could confirm that the categories of prisoners
and members of religious orders fully supported by their order that
were given as examples in the explanatory notes were the only
circumstances in which he foresees the power being used. If not, can he
give the Committee an idea of how the scope for the use in practice of
the regulations would be limited? It is important that that is made
clear for the
Committee.</div><a name="06101944000066"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06101944000206"></a><b class="B">John
Robertson</b> (Glasgow, North-West) (Lab): Will the hon.
Gentleman clarify his argument? If his amendment were successful, would
he be happy that that would allow prisoners to receive support and
allowances?</div><a name="06101944000067"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101944000207"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> No. I am grateful for the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s intervention as it allows me to clarify my point.
The examples of when to allow a nil amount to be prescribed are
reasonable. The purpose of the amendment is merely to probe the
Government&#146;s intentions as to whether they want to use the power
in a wider class of
cases.</div><a name="06101944000068"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101944000208"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> Clearly, I support the hon. Gentleman in his wish
to probe such matters. I wish to make two points&#151;one narrow in
application and one that is more general. The narrow argument has been
emphasised by my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge
(Mr. Hammond) in several parliamentary questions. It is that
the Department for Work and Pensions has, to put it mildly, not a good
record at capturing, recovering or stopping the payment of benefit when
persons are in prison. I accept that we should not debate that issue
today, but I hope that the Minister will bear it in
mind.</div><a name="06101944000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">As for my
general point, it would be helpful if the Minister could communicate at
leisure with members of the Committee about foreign entitlements. I do
not wish to signal a negative view about such matters. I have a neutral
view. Many foreign people of working age come to this country because
they are from countries that are now members of the enlarged European
Union. Many of those people seek work, although it is unlikely that, in
respect of those from Romania and Bulgaria, they shall be able to
obtain it without separate work permits. I am not clear about their
entitlement under the arrangements. The issue has not been widely
rehearsed. It would be useful if the Minister could take that point
away, reflect on it and advise members of the Committee about who would
be entitled to claim such benefits. I am not talking about people who
are in prison, but the wider class of people. Will he say in what
circumstances that would be curtailed and withdrawn? It is easy for
people to go into the saloon bar and share views about such matters,
but it important that the matter is
clarified.</div><a name="06101944000070"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101944000209"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> In the spirit of this morning&#146;s sitting, I
shall respond briefly to the specific points that have been raised so
that progress can be made. I was relieved on behalf of the hon. Member
for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey (Danny Alexander) when he
sought to emphasise early in his comments that this is a probing
amendment. Giving prisoners the vote is bad enough, but giving them
benefits would be even worse. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column95" />Column number: 96</div></div><a name="06101944000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman is on the right of his party, so I have no idea whether
he speaks for the whole of it. In an uncharacteristic way for current
Liberal Democrats, he seems to be at least tempted by some sense of
responsibility as well as an enormous sense of enhancing rights in
legislation. He knows that I say that in a jovial manner. Unusually for
a Liberal Democrat, he comes close to trying to balance the demands for
ever-extending rights with at least a modicum of extending personal
responsibility. All Committee members should be grateful for that. We
are relieved to hear that the Liberal Democrats do not appear to be
advocating benefits for
prisoners.</div><a name="06101944000072"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101944000210"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I do not wish to clarify my position within my
party, because that is a matter for others to speculate about. However,
just for the avoidance of any further doubt, I make it clear that I am
not advocating that prisoners should have benefits. I would have hoped
that the Government press officer who briefed one of the newspapers to
pass questions on about this issue would have sought, in the same
manner that the Minister has, to be generous about the intentions
behind the
amendment.</div><a name="06101944000073"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101944000211"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> None of us will speculate where the Liberal
Democrats will end up on this issue. I guess that they will end up in
all sorts of different places, as they do on many other issues.
However, I suspect that your patience will run out shortly if we
continue along this line of debate, Mr. Hood.</div>
<a name="06101944000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">We use the current power in
legislation in relation to members of religious orders, where they are
fully maintained by that order, prisoners and people from abroad.
People in those situations are provided for by other means and should
not get an income-related benefit such as income support or
income-related employment and support allowance. The amendment would
have the opposite effect by removing our ability to act. Without this
power, we could not prevent people in the circumstances that we have
alluded to in the explanatory notes from receiving
ESA.</div><a name="06101944000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">I can confirm
that the examples that the hon. Gentleman cited, in addition to the one
raised by the hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell), are
the areas where we wish to use this power: in relation to religious
orders, prisoners and those from abroad who have no entitlement and
meet no qualifications in respect of ESA.</div>
<a name="06101944000076"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101944000212"></a>Danny

that, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101944000213"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> I have no difficulty with this clause. These are
sensible administrative provisions, and the idea of having at least the
chance to notify an award in advance, before it comes into effect, is a
good one.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column96" />Column number: 97</div><a name="06101944000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should like to take a moment
of the Committee&#146;s time to re-emphasise a point that I made in
our opening debates on Tuesday about the importance of information. The
clause paves the way for somebody whose applicable amount may rise
after the assessment period when they get, for example, a work-related
activity supplement or a support component, then to reach the
qualifying zone and receive the benefit. There is nothing wrong with
that, but it means that they will, in effect, get a piece of paper that
says, &#147;From X, you will get Y&#148; before either they are
entitled to Y or that payment is made. The problem is a wider issue
with which the Minister will be familiar&#151;changes in
circumstances. Circumstances may well change in the intervening time,
but I am anxious to avoid a situation in which changes in circumstance
during the lead-up period become more likely, giving rise to confusion
and the clawback of
benefits.</div><a name="06101944000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">We could
have a wide debate about the circumstances in which the Department must
move against individuals to whom it has overpaid benefits. As a
constituency MP, I get a fair amount of traffic&#151;almost the
greater proportion of my traffic on departmental affairs&#151;from
people who might not have explained that their circumstances have
changed. That might be entirely innocent and not at all fraudulent or
malicious, but when the Department gets wind of it, it seeks to claw
back the
benefit.</div><a name="06101944000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">Nobody wishes
to caricature the situation by saying that people have a charter to
fail to notify the Department or that they should be allowed to pocket
the benefit if they have been careless. I am simply flagging up to the
Committee what is, in my view, a slightly enhanced risk. As the award
will be conditional and made before the decision comes into reality, it
might happen in some circumstances. I doubt that it is unprecedented.
It occurs to me that lots of people are told what their pension
entitlement will be before they receive it, and a change in
circumstances&#151;the death of a spouse, the arrival of a dependant
or whatever&#151;might alter that.</div>
<a name="06101944000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given that the match between
what people should get and what they actually get is quite difficult to
find, I should like the Under-Secretary&#146;s reassurance that this
sensible provision will not make that situation more likely. To put it
another way, in framing the regulations and drawing up the operational
forms, will Ministers make them as clear as possible to avoid any
embarrassment to the people
involved?</div><a name="06101944000085"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101944000214"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions
(Mrs. Anne McGuire):</b> Mr. Hood, I add
my congratulations to you on chairing the proceedings along with your
colleague Mr. Amess. I have known you for many years to be a
fair man, and I hope to know you for many years longer as one. I am
delighted to be with my colleague the Minister for Employment and
Welfare Reform. If we may reflect on a little past glory, I think it is
fair to say that we had two of the sensational wins in 1997 that put us
on this side of the room rather than that
one.</div><a name="06101944000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also offer a
courtesy to the hon. Member for Daventry for an interesting question
that is fair in the circumstances. I shall not waste the
Committee&#146;s time, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column97" />Column number: 98</div>because the clause is fairly straightforward, but I assure him that we
are very aware that information needs to be clear and accessible at
various points in the process. When people are notified of their
entitlement, they will be informed of any changes in circumstance that
would make their benefit decrease, or perhaps increase, and need to be
reported.</div><a name="06101944000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are dealing with a shorter time scale than that of incapacity
benefit&#151;13 weeks, which in many respects is more manageable for
changes in circumstances. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would
recognise that we try to obtain decisions quickly on changes in benefit
entitlement. That is not to say that it always happens, but we always
try to minimise disruption to an individual&#146;s financial
circumstances. I hope that he will be satisfied by those
assurances.</div><a name="06101944000088"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101944000216"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> I shall be even briefer. The provision is
entirely sensible. I have looked at the explanatory notes and the
helpful graphs, and my feeble mind concludes that the Government
intend&#151;I hope&#151;to give people the best outcome from the
income-related and contribution-related allowances. The better sum will
come out on top, and if necessary, one will be made up to the other, as
the graphs indicate. If the Under-Secretary will confirm that
conclusion, we need detain the Committee no

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101944000217"></a>Mrs.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101944000218"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> One could reasonably describe the clause as small
but perfectly formed. Again, I shall take no more than a moment of the
Committee&#146;s time, but it is worth pausing for thought. As I
understand the clause, it will prevent separate payments when the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column98" />Column number: 99</div>entitlement is less than 10p a week. If the entitlement is paid in
conjunction with another benefit, such as the disability
premium that we have discussed, the amount could be more. The provision
appears to hark back to legislation introduced under the previous
Government&#151;ours&#151;in 1992. Will Ministers reflect on the
number of such payments that would be made in theory, and on whether
the payment continues to be appropriate? No one wants to take money
away from vulnerable people, but some of them may consider payments of
10p a week to be insulting.</div>
<a name="06101944000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">I wonder whether it is a de
minimis provision that will need sensible revisiting in due course. If
the payment were 50p a week, would it make the slightest difference? I
would not rush to put my head on the block by saying that we should
change it now because the value of money and the cost of postage have
changed. We should not reopen the whole benefit payment issue, but will
the Under-Secretary share her thoughts?</div>
<a name="06101944000099"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101944000219"></a>Mrs.
McGuire:</b> The hon. Gentleman has raised an interesting
issue. It is about getting the balance right. The de minimis level of
10p is appropriate, but I hear his comments, and I am sure that we will
reflect on them. However, we see no reason why we should increase the
de minimis amount from 10p. He has been around longer than I have in
some respects, and he may have seen the value of money decrease or
increase over the years. The point is well made, but we will
hold to 10p.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101944000223"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> On the face of it, the amendments are relatively
simple. They are based on the question of whether it would be possible
to combine the assessment for limited capability for work, as described
in the clause, with the assessment for limited capability for
work-related activity in clause 9. The amendments would make possible
not only one single assessment, but the removal of clause 9.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column99" />Column number: 100</div><a name="06101944000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">Mr. Hood, I wonder
whether you will allow me some latitude in my explanation of why we
tabled the amendments. They touch on one of the two most important
themes that I wish to draw to the Committee&#146;s attention in all
our 16 sittings. It concerns the fundamental thinking behind the Bill,
which is that if we are going to make it easy for disabled people to
re-engage in the world of work, two things have to be
considered.</div><a name="06101944000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">The first
is the welcome provision in the Bill that gives people additional help
to deal with their health conditions and to deal with the challenges
that they may face in entering or re-entering the labour market. There
are lots of excellent things in the Bill, which have been presaged by
the successfully piloted pathways programme. I commend the Government
not only on presenting the Bill to the House but on the pathways
programme, which has given Opposition Members a great deal of
confidence that roll-out can occur practically and
successfully.</div><a name="06101944000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is a challenge, however, and it is the complexity of the system. The
current benefits system for disabled people is extraordinarily complex,
and these amendments attempt represent a small step towards simplifying
the processes&#151;not just the complexity of different available
benefits, but the assessment processes as well. The report that was
published last year&#151;&#147;Improving the life chances of
disabled people&#148;&#151;gives an example of a hypothetical
person called, I think, Kelly, who becomes disabled in her twenties. It
lists all the benefit applications that she would have to make. They
include applications to the wheelchair service, to the local council
for a disabled facilities grant, and to Access to Work for help in
modifying her computer and her desk. There would also be applications
for help with housing allowance, to social services for help
with a personal assistant, and to the independent living fund, if the
PA were going to cost more than a certain amount. The report does not
mention that, on top of that, she would have to apply for the
disability living allowance, or&#151;if she were not in
work&#151;incapacity
benefit.</div><a name="06101944000111"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101944000224"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> Could my hon. Friend not add to his list the
question of passported entitlements&#151;for example, to free
prescription charges&#151;that might apply on receipt of certain
benefits but that would not be
automatic?</div><a name="06101944000112"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101944000225"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> Yes, indeed&#151;that is an excellent point. There
are so many applicable benefits. I have read that the Minister
is apparently the only member of the Government who can name

<a name="06101944000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">Why is that a challenge? The
reason is something that the Government often talk about, and
which&#151;to their credit&#151;they understand. It is the link
between disability and poverty. We know that the proportion of disabled
people in poverty&#151;nearly a third of them are of working
age&#151;are in income poverty, and the level has risen during the
last 10 years, which is of great concern on both sides of the House. It
is poverty of that nature that makes the benefits system so vital to
some of the most vulnerable and disadvantaged people in
society.</div> <a name="06101944000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">The problem
with the current system is that it is like an onion with many different
layers. If one is disabled, one is completely dependent on it, and one
is likely to be dependent on it in one form or another for the rest of
one&#146;s life, so one does not wish to risk one&#146;s
entitlement to some or all of the benefits. That is why it is dangerous
to countenance making the system even more
complex.</div><a name="06101944000119"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101944000230"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> My intervention is supportive, and it will be the
last that I shall make, because I agree with my hon. Friend&#146;s
line of argument. Does he agree that the Department&#146;s report
entitled &#147;Opportunity for all&#148;, which was published this
week, indicates not merely the coincidence between disability and lack
of employment and poverty, but the knock-on effects on families and
children? Typically, children growing up in families where one of the
parents is disabled suffer directly in the face of poverty and are most
difficult to help.</div>
<a name="06101944000120"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101944000231"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> As ever, my hon. Friend makes an important point.
One of the advances that the Government could make to be more
successful in meeting their child poverty targets would be looking at
the link between child poverty and disability issues. We should like
there to be a specific strategy to make that
happen.</div><a name="06101944000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">Returning to
the poverty issue, because it is important, the Minister and the
Under-Secretary will know that the Joseph Rowntree Foundation has tried
to quantify the additional costs of being disabled netted out from the
additional benefits that people receive. Disabled people face an
additional &#163;200 per week in costs, ranging from the fact that if
they are in a wheelchair, they will not be able to shop around as
easily to get the best deals in the shops, as other people can, to the
additional costs of laundry, adaptations and so on. Because of those
extra costs and the link with poverty, the complexity of the benefit
system makes many disabled people fearful of risking the package that
is so vital for
them.</div><a name="06101944000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have to be
careful with this Bill, because although the extra help that it is
providing is to be welcomed, it also makes the benefits system even
more complicated by replacing incapacity benefit with a new benefit
with two elements&#151;a support element and a work-related activity
element. I should like the Minister to consider whether anything can be
done to simplify the assessment processes.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column101" />Column number: 102</div><a name="06101944000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should have preferred to
debate a much bolder Bill dealing with the transfer to a single
working-age benefit, because that would be a huge step towards
simplicity. However, the measures that we are talking about have much
to commend them, which is why we support the Bill in principle.
However, the Minister should consider not just the complexity of the
benefits system, but the complexity of the assessment procedures and
whether it would be possible to move towards a single assessment
process that would be passportable across different benefits so that
disabled people did not have continually to go for different
assessments for various
benefits.</div><a name="06101944000124"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06101944000232"></a><b class="B">Natascha
Engel</b> (North-East Derbyshire) (Lab): We considered the
simplification of benefits in Select Committee and came across the big
problem of complexity in disability itself. It is not just a matter of
disability being physical or mental; if the benefits system were
simplified too much, it would not capture people&#146;s disabilities
and people with different disabilities would be
disadvantaged.</div><a name="06101944000125"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101944000233"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> The hon. Lady makes an important point. It is
important that any simplification of the benefits system&#151;the
purpose of which, as in this Bill, is to make it easy for people to
transfer in and out of work of work depending on their personal
situation&#151;reduces the barriers that make them concerned about
transferring into work, particularly if they are out of work. She is
right; nothing that we do must make it more difficult for us to react
appropriately in the benefits system to the extraordinary range of
complexity of disabled people&#146;s conditions. If there were a
thorough single assessment process considering every aspect of
someone&#146;s disability, it would lead to a definitive report that
would, in my ideal world, be used by all organs of the state without
that person being required to go through the process time and
again.</div><a name="06101944000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">A Mencap report
says that 37 per cent. of severely disabled children have to deal with
eight or more different professionals from different services, often
asking the same questions. Although simplification would not be a quick
win for the Government&#151;it is rather complicated to get
Departments to talk to each other&#151;it would be an easy win in the
sense that it should be a measure that saves money, rather than costs
more. The assessment processes are expensive and there would be, on the
face of it, an enormous saving to the Government if it were possible to
have one single assessment that could be transferred
across.</div><a name="06101944000168"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10
am</div><a name="06101944000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">Mr.
Hood, you have given me some latitude, for which I am most grateful,
but let me return to the specific amendment. I hope that the Minister
might consider it. He might have some good reasons as to why it is not
possible to combine those two assessments and we will listen carefully
to those reasons.</div>
<a name="06101944000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">Would it not be possible to
have one assessment that&#151;as I understand it&#151;is an
assessment of the level of someone&#146;s disability and if that
disability is above a certain level so that they have limited
capability for work, they are entitled to ESA and if it is above a
higher level, they are entitled to the support element under the Bill?
Would it not be possible to do that in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column102" />Column number: 103</div>one assessment, therefore simplifying the process for disabled people,
saving the Government money and speeding up the process for everyone
concerned?</div><a name="06101944000129"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101944000234"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I have considerable sympathy with the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s remarks in support of his amendments and want to
press the Minister to explore a number of issues on those points. I
agree that the benefit system facing disabled people is complex. The
hon. Member for North-East Derbyshire (Natascha Engel) is right to
point out that disability is complicated and many faceted. Nevertheless
the complexity of both the benefit system and the assessment process
can create considerable hurdles for many disabled people.</div>
<a name="06101944000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">For example, one of my
constituents, having had an injury at work, was faced with going to the
same medical testing centre in Inverness on three separate occasions
over eight weeks to be asked slightly different questions by the same
doctor&#151;one visit for incapacity benefit, one for disability
living allowance and one for industrial injuries disablement benefit.
Such repeated exposure to what&#151;no matter how hard those people
who are doing the assessment attempt to make it an easy process and one
that people feel comfortable with&#151;can feel like an intimidating
and intrusive experience. That is something that, if we can in the
course of this Bill, we should try and make simpler if possible. That
is not to decry the point about the complexity of disabilities that
people face and that one is trying to understand and assess, but to
look at whether the assessment process can be made more
simple.</div><a name="06101944000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">That captures
the point made by the hon. Member for South-West Surrey (Mr.
Hunt) about poverty faced by disabled people, particularly disabled
children and their families. In his earlier remarks in Committee, the
Minister referred to how he wishes to see the provisions of this Bill
used to help address the question of child poverty. That is something
that should be in our minds throughout our proceedings&#151;both the
complexity of the system and the assessment process and whether that
may or may not act as a disincentive to people to take part. Therefore,
we need to look at the justification for having separate assessments
for limited capability for work and limited capability for work-related
activity.</div> <a name="06101944000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">The draft
regulations for clause 9 set out the descriptors for the assessment of
limited capability for work-related activity&#151;which we will no
doubt come to when we debate clause 9 in more detail. They have many
common factors with the list of descriptors set out in the
&#147;Transformation of the Personal Capability Assessment - Report
of the Physical Function and Mental Health Technical Groups&#148;
document published by the Department for Work and Pensions about a week
ago. The list of descriptors are different in some respects, but
similar in many
respects.</div><a name="06101944000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore,
even if it is not possible to consolidate all the assessments, it must
be possible to create some type of core assessment that would not just
inform limited capability for work-related activity but disability
living allowance and industrial injuries disablement benefit
assessments. It could also inform assessments for assess-to-work
funding. The Bill could be improved if the assessment that people get
when they are applying 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column103" />Column number: 104</div>for benefit carried with it an understanding of what level of
access-to-work funding someone might be entitled to or what type of
adjustments they might be entitled to funding to
support.</div><a name="06101944000134"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101944000235"></a>John
Robertson:</b> I have listened intently to the hon. Gentleman
and I have great sympathy with what he says. Does he agree, however,
that part of the problem is not just the amount of assessment but the
people who are doing the assessing and that we can have three different
assessments with three different outcomes? It is not the people who are
being assessed who are the problem, but the people doing the
assessment.</div><a name="06101944000135"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101944000236"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I agree with the point that has been made and I
would like to table further amendments that I hope we will be debating
later today in relation to training for the people who carry out the
assessments. With regard to some mental health conditions in
particular, lack of training and lack of awareness are a real barrier
to getting accurate assessments of the conditions and barriers to work
that people face when they have certain conditions or
impairments.</div> <a name="06101944000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would
like to hear from the Minister whether he thinks it is possible to
combine these core assessments. I raised this issue with
representatives of Atos Origin, which carries out the assessments on
behalf of the Government, when I had a very useful visit to its testing
centre in Inverness in August. I got the impression that having to make
different assessments for different benefits, often for the same
people, is sometimes a source of frustration for them as well. This may
simply be due to the fact that they have to make different appointments
with the same person over a period of weeks. It would be easier for the
individual concerned if someone only had to come into the office once,
even if they had to undergo a slightly longer
assessment.</div>
<a name="06101944000137"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06101944000237"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Ruffley</b> (Bury St. Edmunds) (Con): Does the hon.
Gentleman agree that the hon. Gentleman the Member for Glasgow,
North-West (John Robertson) raised a key point when he said that
different assessments could give rise to a large number of appeals? The
complexity of this new regime is not just bad for the claimant, but
could result in many more
appeals.</div><a name="06101944000138"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101944000238"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I certainly agree with that point and we may
wish to debate this later as we go through this clause and clause 9, as
I am particularly concerned about the way in which the Government
propose to test the new personal capability assessment, which relates
particularly to clause 8 on limited capability for work. My
understanding is that the testing proposal is simply that the new
assessment should be run in parallel with the old assessment. There
should be some medical assessors looking at how it works and there
should be a study of the outcomes of the two different assessments.
</div><a name="06101944000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">Unless the Minister
can clarify this point, I think there that there will be serious
questions about whether the criteria that will be used are better. If
we consider whether the outcomes are the same&#151;the point that the
hon. Members for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Ruffley) and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column104" />Column number: 105</div>for Glasgow, North-West (John Robertson) made in relation to the outcome
of assessments and appeals&#151;we see that, in many cases, the
current assessments do not work very well as they result in numerous
mistaken assessments that result in many appeals, many of which are
successful. If all we are doing is seeking a new assessment that is as
good as that, our ambitions are very low indeed.</div>
<a name="06101944000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would like to see a much
longer period of study for the proposed new personal capability
assessment to make sure that it works properly, and I would like that
to be carried out by an independent body. Having the company that is
responsible for the assessments making the judgment as to whether the
new one works better or not is not
desirable.</div><a name="06101944000141"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101944000239"></a>Natascha
Engel:</b> To return to our investigations at the Select
Committee, one of the dramatic differences between the personal
capability assessment that is now proposed and the medical assessments
that are carried out today is the massive cultural shift away from
assessing someone&#146;s incapability to do something to considering
someone&#146;s capacity to do something. That cultural shift from
incapacity to capability will make an enormous difference in the way
that people are assessed and will give a far more holistic approach to
the way the medical profession view someone who is to be
assessed.</div>
<a name="06101944000142"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101944000240"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I should have made it clear that, having
studied the documentation in relation to the transformation of the
personal capability assessment, it seems to me that a great deal of
progress has been made in rethinking the way the assessment works. My
point is not that the thinking that has gone into it is not good or
that progress has not been made, but rather that the evaluation of this
new assessment should be more robust and more independently led than
the fairly brief assessment that the Government are
proposing.</div><a name="06101944000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given that
the Bill is proposing two separate assessments, one for limited
capability for work and one for limited capability for work-related
activity, which on the face of it seem to be quite similar even though
they are intended to reach different decisions, what are the
Government&#146;s intentions as to how these two assessments should
be carried out? What will be the claimant&#146;s experience? Do the
Government intend a claimant to be invited for an assessment for
limited capability for work to determine whether they are entitled to
ESA and then, once that decision has been made, for another, separate
assessment to determine their limited capability for work-related
activity? That second assessment would determine whether the
person was entitled to the support component or the
work-related activity component. How will the claimant experience those
two different assessments in practice?</div>
<a name="06101944000144"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101944000241"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> On that point, is it the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
understanding&#151;it is my understanding, although this is not dealt
with in the Bill&#151;that the two assessments will be done at the
same time, by the same person, in the same room and on the same
day?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column105" />Column number: 106</div><a name="06101944000145"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101944000242"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> Although it is not in the Bill, that is my
understanding. A claimant would go to the medical assessment office,
sit down and have their assessments for limited capability for work and
work-related activity. At the end of those assessments, the person
would leave the room and a decision would be taken about whether they
were entitled to the support component or the work-related activity
component. Depending on that decision, the person might or might not be
invited back into the room for a further, work-related, health-focused
assessment to determine the work-related activity to which they were
entitled.</div> <a name="06101944000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the
Government are proposing that the two separate assessments described in
clauses 8 and 9 take place seamlessly&#151;at the same time, in the
same room and with the same person&#151;I fail to see why they should
be subject to two separate sets of regulations. In practice, that could
allow a future, perhaps less well-intentioned Government to separate
the two assessments and invite someone back to the room on a subsequent
day or in a subsequent week or subsequent month for a different
assessment to do the same thing. I would be grateful if the Minister
could clarify that point and I look forward to his
response.</div>
<a name="06101944000147"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101944000243"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> We all look forward to the Minister&#146;s
considered reply, and I should like to hear his response on one final
point. Although the issue is not dealt with in the Bill, we understand
that the two assessments will be done at the same time or sequentially,
within an hour or so of each other, by the same assessor and probably
in the same room. Does the Minister agree, however, that there could be
a potential conflict in what the assessor teases out from the claimant?
A claimant will try to demonstrate that they are unwell enough not to
be able to work and that they are eligible for the employment and
support allowance, and they know that the first assessment will test
their level of unwellness. However, in a very real sense, the next
assessment will test something at the other end of the spectrum: what
the person can do&#151;their capability.</div>
<a name="06101944000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">There seems to be an in-built
tension in that arrangement. The first assessment shows unwellness, and
the claimant will want to show that they are unwell, because they will
want and need the allowance. However, a few minutes later, they will,
given that they will be acting in good faith, have to demonstrate some
level of functionality, if they have it. That will determine whether
they are eligible for the support component or whether they have to go
on to the work-related activity component. In the mind of the claimant,
that will compromise their responses. I thought about this when I first
saw the Bill and it has been confirmed by what some disability and
support groups have told me. Claimants will think that if they show too
much &#147;capability&#148; in the second assessment, it might
compromise their eligibility under the first test about whether or not
they get the
allowance.</div>
<a name="06101944000169"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.15
am</div><a name="06101944000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not, in
any way, say that this is slack drafting or that having two assessments
is a ridiculous proposition, because I know that officials and
Ministers have put a lot of thought into this during a fairly serious
period of consultation since January and the Green Paper. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column106" />Column number: 107</div>We must make that clear and I must put it on record. There are questions
to be asked. We will get to the issue of how much work has gone in, and
will go in, to get the new testing regime right, and we will have a
debate about piloting. Let us put all that to one side, because it is
for another day.</div> <a name="06101944000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">Much
thought has gone into the clauses, but I should sum this up again
because I feel strongly about it: someone who is asked to show
capability in the second test might think, and get worried, that it
will compromise what has been decided on the first assessment about
whether they get the allowance.</div>
<a name="06101944000151"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06101944000244"></a><b class="B">Kali
Mountford</b> (Colne Valley) (Lab): It is dangerous to try to
put ourselves in the mind of another. My experience is contrary to that
mentioned. The people I see making claims for current benefits do the
opposite of what the hon. Gentleman is saying. They usually
underestimate the difficulties and challenges that they face. They
generally put forward the best case of the best day. They do not say,
&#147;This is the worst day&#148; and give a proper assessment of
their own capacity and incapacity. Perhaps it is time to examine in a
more holistic way how an individual operates, not just on a specific
day but over a period of
time.</div><a name="06101944000152"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101944000245"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> The hon. Lady makes a good point. I know that she
had much experience of these matters in her former life. I just want to
clarify something. I am not suggesting for a second&#151;I know that
she was not putting these words in my mouth&#151;that those who apply
for the new allowance will be looking to make a bad fist of it and to
exaggerate their illness. She makes the point that claimants will, in
good faith, say, &#147;I am not well enough to work and I need the
support of this allowance&#151;or incapacity benefit, as it is
now&#148;. We all agree on that. She has given examples where
claimants will underestimate how unwell they are. That would be
assessed in the first test, which is the subject of the
clause.</div> <a name="06101944000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have also
heard a contrary view, which might involve a minority of cases and the
hon. Lady might be referring to the majority of cases. I wonder whether
a minority of claimants might be stressed. We know that 40 per cent. of
claimants currently on incapacity benefit have mental or behavioural
conditions. It is at least likely that in a minority of cases there
might be an inbuilt tension between showing unwellness and then having
to show functionality and capability in the second assessment. People
might get a bit confused by that, for perfectly understandable
reasons.</div> <a name="06101944000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not
suggesting that this is driving a coach and horses through the
proposition that Ministers have put forward in this clause and the next
one. However, on the basis of both the evidence that I have been given
by outside groups and my intuitive reading of the way the clauses are
constructed, for what it is worth, it is at least worthy of a
response.</div>
<a name="06101944000155"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101944000246"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> I shall not detain the Committee to prevent the
Minister from responding. I just want to say that the hon. Member for
North-East Derbyshire was on to a substantial and good point: we are
changing the whole conceptual basis to encourage people to emphasise
the positive rather than highlight 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column107" />Column number: 108</div>the negative. That must be welcome, and is across the Committee. We need
to be able to deliver it. My concerns are twofold and congruent with
what has been said, which I need not repeat.</div>
<a name="06101944000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">My first concern is about
friction in the process. We must hammer home the point that those
people are non-expert, sometimes inarticulate, vulnerable, confused and
worried about their situation. Many people come to us as constituency
MPs with problems about medical assessments, and with stories that are
sometimes well founded, sometimes not. Undoubtedly, the process is
stressful, and the more it is simplified and made acceptable to them,
the better. One assessment is in principle better than two, and if it
is necessary to move from one phase of that assessment to the other,
that may be a reasonable compromise.</div>
<a name="06101944000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">My second concern is with legal
friction, embedded in a clause that I drafted, new clause 6, which we
shall debate later. It is about the hat that the assessor wears at any
one time, about whether it is clear and fair to the claimant, and about
whether the assessors are properly trained. We have all heard stories
about doctors who have had an off day. That is not to subvert the
system of medical assessment, but to say that there are difficulties.
It applies legally, too. With that structure, carefully constructed
though it is, there may be huge evidential arguments about whether the
assessment was carried out under the terms of clause 8 or clause 9,
while the poor claimant says, &#147;I don&#146;t care. All I know
is that I went to my doctor, and I didn&#146;t get my
benefit.&#148; That is the human side and the legal side.</div>
<a name="06101944000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, there is the
conceptual issue. Clauses 8 and 9 bear on the capability for work or
for work-related activity. They are not tests about whether work has
been carried out or whether work-related activity will be carried out,
but prospective tests about a person&#146;s capacity for them. I find
it increasingly difficult as I reflect on the issue to see the logical
distinction between work and work-related activity. There may be some
functional differences, and the Minister will talk to them, but I
cannot see the essential difference. If that links into the operational
factors, the claimant&#146;s concern, and the difficulty with
producing a harmonised and coherent structure whereby it is clear at
all times who is doing what to whom and whether the procedure is
appropriate, the Committee should at least reflect on whether we have
created an unnecessary complication in our effort to help
people.</div>
<a name="06101944000159"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101944000247"></a>Natascha
Engel</b> I understand that the hon. Gentleman is to visit the
Derbyshire pathways to work programme in my constituency. It has been
fantastic. He will hear some stories that the Select Committee, and
myself as a constituency MP, have heard. The staggering part about the
individual human stories that he has discussed is the shift
from a tick-box medical assessment of what cannot be done to a
more employer-based, support and training-oriented capability
assessment. That is exactly what the Bill is about: to ensure that we
focus on the job that a person can do, get them job-ready through
condition-management programmes, and give them the skills that
