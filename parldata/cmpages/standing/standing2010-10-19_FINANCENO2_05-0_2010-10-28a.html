                           </span> Good morning, Mr
Caton. Whatever happens, this is our last day in Committee. We shall
debate from clause 27 to clause 33, as well as the new clause tabled by
my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham East, and I hope that we shall
make progress as speedily as we
can.<a class="bkMark" name="10102824000018">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
Opposition have no problem with the policy objectives of clause 27, but
I would like to test the Minister, because the clause gives him and the
Treasury wide powers to implement provisions at a future date.
Subsection (2)
states<a class="bkMark" name="10102824000019">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Will
the Minister say which day and which time the Treasury might by order
appoint for implementation of the said provision following Royal
Assent? I ask that because the clause gives him a wide implementation
power.<a class="bkMark" name="10102824000020">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

(3)

                        </p>
                        <p>That,
too, gives the Minister a wide power to reflect on the issues and bring
in, at different times, provisions relating to the specified purposes
under clause 27. I would welcome an outline of his thinking on
implementation of the
clause.<a class="bkMark" name="10102824000022">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Subsection
(4) is also a very wide provision, so the Minister needs to put on
record his approach to the issues. The subsection
states:<a class="bkMark" name="10102824000023">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“The

                        </p>
                        <p>I
know that it is probably common practice to put in place such a wide
power, but it is important that the Minister gives some indication of
the circumstances in which he would exercise it. In the event of the
clause receiving the approval of both Houses, we will be giving him
great power to vary the penalties for failure to  pay
tax.<a class="bkMark" name="10102824000024">&#160;</a>

                        <p>This is a fairly strong
Henry VIII power. It is incumbent on the Minister to explain the
circumstances in which he would use it, in the same way as, when I was
a Minister, I had to explain the circumstances in which I would use a
power. I remind the hon. Gentleman of that because I served for 13
years as a Minister in the previous Government and on numerous
occasions, in relation to numerous Bills that granted similar powers,
Opposition Members questioned me on exactly how I would use the powers
downstream. Therefore, it is only fair that I give the Minister the
opportunity to reflect on these matters
accordingly.<a class="bkMark" name="10102824000026">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                        <p>It
is important that we know whether the Minister believes that such a
statutory instrument would be subject to the affirmative procedure.
Alternatively, would the Opposition be required to pray against the
instrument if we want to examine matters in a more detailed way? Again,
we have no objection to the clause in principle, but we want
clarification on certain
points.<a class="bkMark" name="10102824000028">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
do not wish to cause the Minister too much grief on the principle of
the clause. We support it, because penalties for failure to pay tax are
important. Schedule 56 to the Finance Act 2009 is important; it was
passed by the previous Government. Given the wide-ranging nature of the
powers that we are seconding to him, however, will the Minister give
some indication of how he might choose to exercise
them?<a class="bkMark" name="10102824000031">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Before
dealing with clause 27, I return briefly to schedule 2, which we
considered earlier in our proceedings. We did not debate the schedule,
and as a consequence I have failed to mention something that could be
usefully put on record: the changes to venture capital schemes
introduced under that schedule will made through a commencement order,
and it is our intention to bring in the changes from next April. I hope
that the Committee will forgive me for digressing.<a class="bkMark" name="10102824000033">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I now turn to
clause 27 and the points made by the right hon. Member for Delyn. As we
heard, the clause is part the ongoing review of Her Majesty’s
Revenue and Customs, and it marks the completion of the third stage of
penalties reform under the review. There are currently a variety of
different penalties for late payments across different taxes, and some
have no sanction for late payment. The changes before us add 15 further
taxes and duties to the new aligned structure that was legislated for
last year. As with the changes made in clause 26, these new taxes are
all indirect taxes or excise duties. The new penalty structure will be
more effective in influencing behaviour, as well as fairer and more
proportionate. It is important that HMRC makes every effort to support
taxpayers in meeting their tax obligations, but it is equally important
that the consequences for failing to meet those obligations are made
clear.<a class="bkMark" name="10102824000034">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                        </div>
                        <p class="tabbed">An extensive
series of consultations led to the first tranche of legislation in the
Finance Act 2009. Following that Act, HMRC published a draft of the
current provisions on 9 December 2009 and invited comments. We listened
to the many responses from key stakeholders and representative bodies
and made changes as a result. For example, we refined the VAT payments
on account mechanism to be as easily understood as possible. Throughout
the consultation, the reforms were broadly supported by key
stakeholders and representative bodies.<a class="bkMark" name="10102824000035">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The new
penalty structures and safeguards will require changes to HMRC’s
IT systems and business processes. It will also require substantial
advance publicity to taxpayers and their advisers to ensure that people
are ready for the changes. That is why the schedule is to be brought
into force by Treasury order, which will allow for implementation in
stages. HMRC plans to implement the changes as and when resources
permit and when sensible opportunities arise. That touches on one of
the questions raised by the right hon. Gentleman.<a class="bkMark" name="10102824000036">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The right
hon. Gentleman also asked when the changes in clarification to the law
will come into effect. For amendments that relate to last year’s
enactments, which have already come into effect, HMRC intends to lay an
appointed-day order before the House shortly after Royal Assent. The
changes will mainly affect the operation of late payments penalties for
pay-as-you-earn, which came into effect on 6 April 2010. However, as
they are based on an annual appraisal of an employer’s payment
obligations, penalties will not start to be issued until May
2011.<a class="bkMark" name="10102824000037">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The right
hon. Gentleman also raised the question of Henry VIII clauses. He said,
quite fairly, that he frequently had to defend such clauses as a
Minister. In a spirit of candour, it is fair to say that I often
queried them when I was an Opposition spokesman.<a class="bkMark" name="10102824000038">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
harmonisation of penalties requires the untangling of a great deal of
old and complex tax legislation, and the clause is designed purely to
enable HMRC to make necessary amendments, savings or repeals easily.
Given the nature and scale of the changes, the broad power of amendment
is needed to facilitate accurate consequential amendments or
transitional provisions, as it is not possible to predict what changes
to the current law will be required in the future. An identical
approach was taken under the Finance Act 2009 in respect of measures
that introduced the basic structure for the alignment of penalties, and
I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will appreciate that the powers
relate clearly to that specific area and not more
broadly.<a class="bkMark" name="10102824000039">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
right hon. Gentleman asked whether the orders will be subject to the
affirmative procedure. They will be made under the negative procedure,
which is consistent with what has been done elsewhere within the
penalties regime. As always, HMRC will publish a draft order in
advance, which is particularly important if the statutory instrument
amends primary legislation. The Government will make sure that there is
proper consultation on changes of the law. I hope that he will accept
my assurances on that
point.<a class="bkMark" name="10102824000040">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
provisions have been subject to thorough consultation. They were well
supported by most respondents and have been refined to reflect their
comments. The result is a major step forward in modernising and
aligning penalties. It is important that HMRC supports taxpayers to
meet their tax obligations, but it is equally

			Column number: 136<a class="bkMark" name="Column136">&#160;</a>
                           </div>important that the consequences of failing to meet those obligations are
clear. Effective and proportionate penalties will tackle late filing
and reassure the compliant majority that the system is fair. I
therefore hope that the Committee will support the
clause.<a class="bkMark" name="10102824000041">&#160;</a>

in principle for similar reasons that applied when it had its genesis
under the previous Labour Government. I have no general problems with
it. However, it is fair that I outline to the Committee the concerns
expressed to me by the Chartered Institute of Taxation about several
matters relating to the clause and schedule 12 so that the Minister
will have an opportunity to consider and respond to them

                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Chartered Institute of Taxation states that it is unclear why proposed
new paragraph 34C(2) of schedule 10 to the Finance Act 2003
excludes paragraph 6, which covers the responsibility of partners, and
paragraph 8, which includes representative partners under
schedule 15 to the Finance Act 2003, and introduces a new
concept of relevant persons as claimants for partnerships. Relevant
persons are defined under proposed new paragraph 34C(5)
as<a class="bkMark" name="10102824000047">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“(a)
any person who was a partner in the partnership at an effective date of
the transaction, and…(b) the personal representative of such a
person.”<a class="bkMark" name="10102824000212">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>That
differs from the definition under paragraph 6 of schedule 15 to the
2003 Act, which defines responsible partners in respect of anything
required to be done under part 2 of that Act as<a class="bkMark" name="10102824000048">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“(a) the persons
who are partners at the effective date of the transaction,

the effective date of the
transaction.”<a class="bkMark" name="10102824000213">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Chartered Institute of Taxation’s worry about that misty new
definition is that the meaning of “relevant person”
mirrors the definition of “relevant partner”, but it is
unclear why there is a departure from the provisions of part 2 of the
2003 Act. The institute believes that that will add complexity to the
administration of stamp duty land
tax.<a class="bkMark" name="10102824000049">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
should welcome the Minister’s view on that because the institute
has ultimately to work with the legislation and advise people on stamp
duty. It believes that there is a difficulty with the definition of
“relevant person”, and that there are differences in the
Bill between the schedule and the Finance Act 2003. I should be
grateful if the Minister would comment on that and I hope he can
clarify the measure so that those who read our proceedings and
interpret them will understand the intention of the schedule and
clause.<a class="bkMark" name="10102824000050">&#160;</a>

                        <p>and
it has highlighted the word “may”. However, sub-paragraph
(3)(b) states that a
claim<a class="bkMark" name="10102824000052">&#160;</a>

tabled an amendment to that effect because I did not feel strongly

                           </strong> Clause 28 introduces schedule 12, which amends the
existing relief for mistakes in stamp duty land tax returns, and error
or mistake relief for petroleum revenue tax. That is part of the
modernisation of error or mistake relief provisions, which introduces a
single route to recover overpaid tax. It extends the scope of the
current relief and excludes common law claims in respect of overpaid
tax.<a class="bkMark" name="10102824000056">&#160;</a>

a final opportunity for taxpayers to reclaim overpayments subject to a

measure simplifies  the process for reclaiming overpayments. It
reduces the administrative burden for taxpayers and HMRC, and provides
greater certainty regarding public finances. The changes will take

invited responses to the draft legislation in January and February, and
when the draft Finance Bill was published in July. We have received
comments from the Chartered Institute of Taxation—the right hon.
Member for Delyn referred to those and raised a couple of points about
them. First, on to the concept of relevant persons as opposed to
responsible partners, in the matter of deciding who can make a claim,
responsible partners include the current members of a partnership and
anyone who was a partner at the date of the transaction. Responsible
partners are responsible for making a tax return and for other
administrative matters. However, it is the partners at the date of the
transaction alone who are jointly and severally liable for the tax that
is due.<a class="bkMark" name="10102824000058">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Overpayment
relief allows those who have overpaid an amount of tax in respect of a
land transaction to reclaim that sum. Relevant persons are those who
were liable to pay the tax or their personal representatives. Therefore
it is those persons who must decide who among them should make the
claim, which explains the introduction of the concept of relevant
persons in this context.<a class="bkMark" name="10102824000059">&#160;</a>

                        </p>
                        <p>rather
than that it shall be made. It is worth pointing out that it is not
mandatory for anyone to make a claim. Someone who thinks that they have
overpaid stamp duty land tax must decide whether they want to claim
overpayment relief, which is why the measure states that the claim
“may be made”, not that it shall be made.<a class="bkMark" name="10102824000061">&#160;</a>

land tax has been paid in respect of a partnership land transaction,
all the partners involved, or their personal representatives, must
agree who is to make a claim, and the provision ensures that there is
agreement between the partners before a claim is made. I hope that that
provides some clarity about the thinking behind the provisions to the
right hon. Gentleman and those who read our debates with interest, and

                        <p class="tabbed">Although this
is not one of the more contentious Finance Bills, we are still required
to scrutinise it. I want the Minister to address the concerns that have
been raised with me and other members of the Committee by the Chartered
Institute of Taxation. I accept that there has been consultation and
that these points have been made, but in its submissions to me the
institute raised concerns about the need for adequate safeguards in
relation to the powers under the compliance checks. It is concerned
that the safeguards provided are inadequate. I am not making a judgment
on that, but it is important that the Minster should reflect on it and
consider whether there is merit to those
concerns.<a class="bkMark" name="10102824000068">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
Chartered Institute of Taxation believes it would be helpful for there
to be guidelines and advice to the officers who will deal with the
implementation of the measure, and I would welcome the
Minister’s reassurance about that. When officers use the powers
that deal specifically with the exercise of subjective judgments, those
powers should be reflected in published information about how and on
what those judgments were made. The institute believes that the
Treasury should accept recommendations to ensure that guidelines for
officers are published and that when subjective and marginal decisions
are taken, the officers themselves should be open to
scrutiny.<a class="bkMark" name="10102824000069">&#160;</a>

examine in detail the previous recommendations and release draft
guidance to the officers who are going to implement the judgments
before the powers come into effect. I raise the issue so that the

downstream, at the coal face of taxation issues. If she does not wish

Thank you, Mr Caton. It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship
on this final day of the third Finance Bill of the

                        <p class="tabbed">Clause
29 introduces schedule 13, which amends provisions covering excise
compliance checks. HMRC has been reviewing powers and safeguards for
checking compliance. Previous Finance Acts introduced a modernised and
aligned checking framework, which now applies across HMRC’s
other taxes and duties. Schedule 13 completes that
work.<a class="bkMark" name="10102824000072">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Excise
is a specialised type of regime. The key risks are in the goods
themselves, and therefore access to those goods is crucial. Excise
fraud in alcohol, tobacco and oil is a major risk to the Exchequer, to
legitimate businesses and to consumers. For that reason, the Government
have taken a different approach to the powers and amended them rather
than align excise within the framework that applies to other
taxes.<a class="bkMark" name="10102824000073">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As the right
hon. Gentleman said, the proposals have been subject to two full formal
consultations since July 2009, and draft legislation was published in
January and again this summer. The responses received were broadly
positive across all excise trade sectors, including those from the
Association of Chartered Certified Accountants, the Chartered Institute
of Taxation—I will come shortly to the points that it
raised—the Institute of Indirect Taxation, the National Casino
Industry Forum, the Scotch Whisky Association and the Tobacco
Manufacturers Association. They all recognise the need in future to
tackle the illicit market more strongly than we have been able to in
the
past.<a class="bkMark" name="10102824000074">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
changes complete the work so far done on modernising compliance checks.
They provide useful new powers that will ensure that HMRC can continue
to be effective in tackling the fraud that pervades the excise arena.
On the additional powers and the published guidance, I can assure the
right hon. Gentleman that, as this measure introduces amendments to
existing legislation, the current guidance will be updated to take
account of the changes.<a class="bkMark" name="10102824000075">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As was
promised in the response document issued in March 2010, HMRC will be
exposing the guidance for comment, which is in line with the approach
to previous changes to compliance-checking powers. We will ensure that
the guidance is updated, which will avoid the risk that the powers
being changed by the clause might be
misapplied.<a class="bkMark" name="10102824000076">&#160;</a>

                           </div>tax regime for registered pension schemes. As members of the Committee
will know, NEST is a new pension scheme that has been established by
the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions under section 67 of the
Pensions Act 2008. The NEST provisions, which had their genesis under
the last Labour Government, will ensure that pension entitlement is
provided to individuals across the sector, and that such people are
helped to save for their pension with the support of employers and of
the state as a
whole.<a class="bkMark" name="10102824000081">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
changes will have effect from the date on which the Bill receives Royal
Assent. In December 2006, the then Labour Government published a White
Paper outlining their workplace pensions reform—including the
NEST proposal, which was previously called the personal accounts
scheme. That led to the pensions reform set out in the 2008 Act, the
contributions for which will be phased in over a period of time. In one
way—I will return to this in a moment—I am pleased that
the new Government have committed themselves to implementing, broadly,
the provisions that the previous Government had put in
place.<a class="bkMark" name="10102824000082">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
provisions introduce automatic enrolment as an effective means of
increasing pension savings. The “Making Automatic Enrolment
Work” review was announced on 24 June 2010 by the Government,
who wanted to look at the commitments of the previous Labour Government
to the NEST scheme. The review examined such matters and has concluded,
publishing its recommendations on 30 September. Last week the
Government confirmed that they would go ahead with the scheme, which I
again welcome. The clause ensures that the NEST scheme comes within the
existing tax regime for registered pension schemes, and so we welcome
it.<a class="bkMark" name="10102824000083">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
scheme will ensure that between 5 million and  9 million more
people will be saving into a pension from 2012 onwards. It will largely
consist of part-time employees, which is particularly welcome for
women. It is also welcome for mobile, temporary and contract staff, and
for the 70% of individuals from ethnic backgrounds who are not
currently saving into a pension. The scheme will bring many more people
into pension schemes in future, ensure that their employers contribute
to such schemes, and help people to save for their retirement in a much
more practical way. That is why the tax regime under the clause is
welcome.<a class="bkMark" name="10102824000084">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
Minister will know that there is some controversy concerning the
provision. The <em>Daily Mail</em>, which I was reading in the Tea Room
this morning, says that some small employers are concerned about the
impact of the scheme. I hope that the Government will hold firm on the
matter and will not back up on the general scheme; I hope that the tax
regime that the clause refers to will reflect the scheme that has been
announced and that they will not backtrack on that for small employers.
The issue is particularly important for those employed by small firms,
because they have just as much right to ensure that they have pension
entitlement as those who are employed by the state, or by multinational
companies.<a class="bkMark" name="10102824000085">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The scheme
has been introduced, but I am concerned about some small but
significant changes that the Government have made as part of the
review. The 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 141<a class="bkMark" name="Column141">&#160;</a>
                           </div>changes relate to the taxation regime in the clause to date and are
still important matters that need to be
considered.<a class="bkMark" name="10102824000086">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Hon. Members
will know that the previous Labour Government proposed that the
threshold for enrolment into the scheme would be in the region of
£5,035 per employee income per year. The review of the scheme
has increased that by some £2,000—to £7,475 before
individuals will be automatically enrolled into the pension scheme. My
colleague Brendan Barber, the general secretary of the Trades Union
Congress, has raised two points about that, which reflect on the
taxation regime under the clause and also concern the wider scheme. I
would welcome the Minister’s comments on that.<a class="bkMark" name="10102824000087">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Brendan
Barber is concerned that the two issues relating to that increase will
have a detrimental effect, particularly on part-time women workers and
those on low incomes. In relation to the clause, the hon. Member for
Thornbury and Yate (Steve Webb), the pensions Minister, has proposed
that there will be a higher salary level of £7,475 before
automatic enrolment into pensions, rather than the previous
Government’s proposal of £5,035. Also, there will be a
three-month waiting period before auto-enrolment takes place for those
on that higher salary. Whatever we say about the scheme and however
much I welcome it, there is a big difference between having to earn
just over £5,000 a year before being auto-enrolled and having to
earn £7,475 a year before that
happens.<a class="bkMark" name="10102824000088">&#160;</a>

should not be a nanny state, but does my right hon. Friend agree that
it is important that people have the opportunity to be pensioned?
Perhaps he remembers, as I do, when the state earnings-related pension
scheme was abolished, and people had more freedom—I certainly
did—concerning their pensions. I had a secretary who was fairly
typical in saying that she wanted to come out of it. Twenty-plus years
on, such people would be much better provided

                           </strong> My hon. Friend makes an important point. I
emphasise that under the scheme’s taxation regime, individuals
are on higher incomes, of £7,475, before being automatically
enrolled, rather than on the previous Government’s proposal of
£5,000. That means that there are people earning between
£5,000 and £7,000 who would have been enrolled in the
scheme automatically, but now will not be.<a class="bkMark" name="10102824000090">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Those people
are likely to be part-time women workers or people on low incomes who
might not know their rights at work or be trade union members. If, as
the front page of today’s <em>Daily Mail </em>shows, small
employers do not generally support the scheme, they are not likely to
advise their employees who earn between £5,000 and £7,000
that they can enrol themselves in the scheme rather than being enrolled
automatically, because that will cost the employers contributions
towards the scheme.<a class="bkMark" name="10102824000091">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There are
significant changes. The Labour Government’s proposal would have
ensured that people on the lower income, rather than the slightly
higher income of £7,500, were enrolled in the scheme
automatically. Again, that is a small but significant change. It means
that from 2012, people who earn less than £7,475 will have to
enrol themselves in the scheme to get the benefits. That means that
they will have to know about the scheme and their rights, and know how
to exercise those rights.<a class="bkMark" name="10102824000092">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Part-time
women workers and people on low incomes might not know about such
matters or have access to the available information, and their
employers might not tell them. The scheme might not be widely taken up.
The taxation regime might not deal with such matters in the same way
that it would have if changes had been made appropriately in the NEST
scheme, as originally envisaged by the previous Labour
Government.<a class="bkMark" name="10102824000093">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
wanted to put those important issues on the record. I have two points
to make. We recognise and welcome the clause. It establishes, under
section 67 of the Pensions Act 2008, that the scheme proposed will be
subject to the provisions of the Bill. We have no problem with that and
will support the clause, but it is incumbent on the Minister at least
to liaise with her colleague, the pensions Minister, to reflect the
Opposition’s concerns that the revised scheme will disadvantage
lower-paid, predominantly female part-time workers, who would have
benefited under the Labour Government’s original
proposals.<a class="bkMark" name="10102824000094">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I hope that
the Minister will also use this opportunity to support her colleague
the pensions Minister in giving an indication, to the small firms
generating a <em>Daily Mail </em>campaign against the NEST scheme, that
she fully supports his proposals, as I know she does, and that she
believes that small firms should not be exempt from the scheme and that
those who work for small firms have just as much right to a pension as
those who work for the state, mid-sized firms, larger firms or
multinationals.<a class="bkMark" name="10102824000095">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I would
welcome such a commitment on paper today, for those outside to
read—not least the authors of the <em>Daily Mail </em>article. It
would give an assurance that the tax regime will reflect the need for
small employers to play their part. Will she also explain why she is
short-changing part-time women workers and others who would have
benefited from the scheme had the Labour Government been
re-elected?<a class="bkMark" name="10102824000096">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> As we have heard, clause 30 provides that the
National Employment Savings Trust—NEST, as the right hon. Member
for Delyn called it—is to be regarded as an occupational pension
scheme for tax purposes. That, in turn, will allow NEST to be
registered for tax purposes, another requirement of the Pensions Act
2008. Without the clause, it would not be possible for NEST to start
enrolling members in April 2011, as we all want.<a class="bkMark" name="10102824000097">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As the right
hon. Gentleman explained, the background to the clause is that the
Pensions Act 2008 required the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions
to establish a pensions scheme that could be registered for tax
purposes. NEST has been set up to meet that requirement. It was
established on 5 July 2010 as part of the workplace pensions reforms
and has been designed specifically to meet the needs of low to medium
earners.<a class="bkMark" name="10102824000098">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Although the
Pensions Act 2008 provides that NEST is an occupational pension scheme,
without this clause it would not qualify as one for tax purposes. As a
result of the clause, members of NEST will be able to benefit from the
tax reliefs available to registered pension schemes on contributions
and investment growth.<a class="bkMark" name="10102824000099">&#160;</a>

we looked at the threshold, it made sense to align it with the level at
which the employees start to pay tax, because that will simplify how

pensions Minister will come forward with more details about how the
precise communications strategy will work. The decisions that we have
made about the threshold are sensible; even the right hon.
Gentleman’s party leader discussed the need to support small
businesses earlier this week. As a Government, we are absolutely
committed to doing that, which is why, rather than going ahead with an
increase in the rate of small companies corporation tax, we chose to
bring forward reductions and why, rather than going ahead with rises in
employers’ national insurance, we also brought forward
reductions.<a class="bkMark" name="10102824000105">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In many
regions of our country, those setting up new companies, which have the
fewest employees at the start, will be getting additional national
insurance holidays for extra employees whom they support. We are
committed to ensuring that small companies will be able to play their
role in boosting economic growth and employment in our country. Clause
30 means that there is a far better chance that employees in these new
companies will get the benefit of an occupational pension
scheme.<a class="bkMark" name="10102824000106">&#160;</a>

                           </div>speaking, because that can ruin the flow of proceedings. A couple of
questions arose from what she said. She mentioned that lifting the
level at which people started to be automatically enrolled in NEST was
intended to align that level with the point at which people started to
pay tax. She said that that would save on bureaucracy. That is easy to
say, but hard to measure.<a class="bkMark" name="10102824000109">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">What work has
been done to clarify how much that would save in bureaucracy? Will she
say a little more about why? What costs are we talking about and what
scale of administration will be saved? If, on the grounds of savings in
bureaucracy, we are depriving core groups with very low incomes of
automatic enrolment, it would benefit all the Committee to understand
that more. I would be grateful if the Minister said something about
that. It concerns me that we might be acting too quickly and I would
like to know more. Why will the process be simpler and more
straightforward?<a class="bkMark" name="10102824000110">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">My
second point is about the communications strategy. I have worked in
communications and am aware that an achievable target is mapped out
carefully and clearly before any communications plan goes ahead. Then
its impact is measured. The history of pensions policy can be broadly
characterised as people trying to communicate the long-term benefits of
having a pension and the public, by and large, not always paying
attention. I do not believe that the public are aware of any pensions
communications strategy that has been as successful as we hope this one
will be.<a class="bkMark" name="10102824000111">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The Minister
has just said that the issue is the responsibility of the Department
for Work and Pensions but, again, it would benefit the Committee
greatly if we heard a little more about the sort of targets that the
communications strategy is expected to play to. In my experience, that
is the sort of thing that should be planned out very early on; we would
have a sense of the scale of behavioural change that the Government are
trying to achieve. I would be grateful if the Minister made some
remarks about both those points.<a class="bkMark" name="10102824000112">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                           </strong> To go back to my earlier comments, small
employers in particular will have fewer ongoing admin costs in terms of
setting up these schemes during the first year of establishment and, of
course, in terms of the ongoing administration involved in running the
schemes once they are in place. The cost savings to employees will
probably be around £10 million in reductions in first-year
administration and £6 million on an ongoing basis in reduced
administration. That shows that we are talking about real
money.<a class="bkMark" name="10102824000113">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">If those who
run small companies were here representing themselves directly, they
would probably say that the time they spend on bureaucracy literally
costs money; it is time that they could have been spending on the phone
to suppliers and new customers. Unnecessary bureaucracy has very direct
consequences, perhaps for smaller companies more than larger companies.
We have sought to strike the right balance in the proposals, and I
think that we have achieved
that.<a class="bkMark" name="10102824000114">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The

their employees. They are the main target of the measure. I assure the
hon. Lady that a communications strategy has been worked on.

any such trusts, or plans to create them, that could create an anomaly
in the treatment of the two sets of trusts that would be dealing with
the same issue: individuals who have asbestosis or who are dealing with
asbestos-related disabilities, injuries and illnesses. Such an anomaly

to it would not be the same as those that would apply to trusts

be established before the likely date of Royal Assent? Finally, does he
have a view on the tabling of an Opposition amendment—or, if
such an amendment would, as usual, be technically deficient, a
Government amendment—on Report to reflect my desire to ensure
that no trusts are disadvantaged by the fact that the date in the

                           </span> First, I apologise for my
lateness this morning, which was down to a diary clash. My right hon.
Friend talks about conditions that cause asbestosis. He will be aware
of an ongoing campaign to compensate those victims who have pleural
plaques and scarring of the lungs. Does he think that the scheme should
also include such people?<a class="bkMark" name="10102824000132">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I raised the issue because I know that my hon.
Friend takes an interest in these matters, given the nature of his
constituency. It is for the Minister to expand on what paragraph 21 of
the explanatory notes means in practice. It
states:<a class="bkMark" name="10102824000133">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“Asbestos
related condition is a condition that arises as a result of contact
directly or indirectly with
asbestos.”<a class="bkMark" name="10102824000218">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>That
is fine; I accept that as a reasonable definition. The condition is not
defined further in the Bill, but the notes say that it<a class="bkMark" name="10102824000134">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“includes
conditions that are recognised by the courts…such as
asbestosis.”<a class="bkMark" name="10102824000219">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>That is my concern. If
the background note did not state, “such as asbestosis”,
I might accept the wide definition. The moment “such as
asbestosis” is included, however, one must ask, if it is not a
condition “such as 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 147<a class="bkMark" name="Column147">&#160;</a>
                           </div>asbestosis”, what is it? There could be a future debate about the
relationship between the definition of asbestos-related conditions and
the establishment of the trusts prior to 23 March or, as under my
amendment, after  23 March. I would welcome the
Minister’s consideration of that date and a short comment about
the background note and definition.<a class="bkMark" name="10102824000135">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> It might be helpful for me to say a word or two
about the background to clause 31 and schedule 14. As we have heard,
the schedule concerns the taxation of trusts set up in certain
circumstances to compensate victims of asbestos. The inhalation of
asbestos fibres can cause a number of diseases of the lungs, and
prolonged exposure to asbestos exacerbates the risk of contracting such
a disease.<a class="bkMark" name="10102824000136">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It has come
to the Government’s attention that trusts set up in certain
circumstances to compensate asbestos victims have been unable to access
tax-efficient structures. Consequently, such trusts are facing tax
liabilities that will reduce the funds available to asbestos victims
who are eligible for compensation. For example, if a trust is set up
across more than one national legal jurisdiction, which can happen
where compensation arrangements are complex, it can be difficult to
rearrange trust structures. Trusts might not be able to obtain
charitable status if they are set up specifically to compensate certain
victims.<a class="bkMark" name="10102824000137">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">To help
victims of asbestos, the changes set out in schedule 14 will remove
past and future inheritance tax, income tax and capital gains tax
liabilities from asbestos compensation settlements. The change was
announced by the previous Government, and we are happy to confirm it.
Many years often elapse between exposure to asbestos and the emergence
of symptoms of asbestos-related illnesses. We need to address that
point.<a class="bkMark" name="10102824000138">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The right
hon. Member for Delyn asked about the sort of asbestos-related
conditions to which the schedule will apply. As he mentioned,
asbestosis is given as an example, but that is not an exhaustive list.
It could apply to other diseases and illnesses related to asbestos. It
is likely to apply to trusts making payments to those with an
asbestos-related condition, which might include those who were engaged
in the manufacture, distribution, sale and installation of asbestos
products, or the mining of asbestos. The terminology has been kept
deliberately wide to allow flexibility in such circumstances. The hon.
Member for Islwyn asked whether the list would include pleural plaques.
It does; our intention was not to be
prescriptive.<a class="bkMark" name="10102824000139">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
want to turn to the very fair point that the right hon. Member for
Delyn raised about his amendments, which would change the latest date
by which a trust would have to have been established to benefit from
tax relief under the schedule. He proposes that the date should be
changed from 24 March 2010 to the day of the Bill’s Royal
Assent.<a class="bkMark" name="10102824000140">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The date of
24 March 2010 was the date of the first Budget this year, when the
measure was first proposed, and it was chosen as the cut-off date by
the previous Government. It is my understanding that that was to
eliminate any risk of avoidance—however small—due to new
trusts being set up to exploit the rules. Of course, the Government
would consider representations from 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 148<a class="bkMark" name="Column148">&#160;</a>
                           </div>trusts in similar circumstances that were set up after that date.
However, to answer the right hon. Gentleman’s question directly,
I should stress that we have not received any such representations. We
do not know of any trusts in similar circumstances to those set out in
the schedule that have been established after 24 March 2010, and we are
not aware of any plans for such trusts to be established.<a class="bkMark" name="10102824000141">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It is also
worth pointing out that a specific exemption, as we have with the
clause and the schedule, is not likely to be necessary in most cases
for most trusts in these areas. Generally, when trusts of this nature
are set up, exemptions are already available.<a class="bkMark" name="10102824000142">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Consequently,
although I understand the intention behind the amendment, and while I
think that the right hon. Gentleman was absolutely right to ask his
questions, it is not necessary that we amend the Bill as he proposes
because doing so might leave open an opportunity for avoidance. I
therefore ask him to withdraw the amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="10102824000143">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am grateful for the Minister’s comments.
As I indicated, the amendment was probing, first to find out the
definition of “asbestosis” and, secondly, to ensure that
the Treasury had researched whether there were trusts that had been
established after 23 March 2010 or that were due to be established. I
was sure that the Treasury could research that more easily than me, as
my efforts were limited by having only one researcher. Given that the
Minister has assured us that there are no trusts in that position, I
beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="10102824000144">&#160;</a>

claim total credit for the new clause. I want to thank the Chartered
Institute of Taxation’s low incomes tax reform group for
highlighting the issue of the definition of an “incapacitated
person”. Digging back, it appears that this issue has been
raised from time to time during the consideration of Finance Bills over
several years. On this occasion, however, pretty much most of the
arguments against making the change proposed in the new clause have
been well and truly exhausted.<a class="bkMark" name="10102824000150">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">For the
benefit of the Committee, especially those who have not been members of
Finance Bill Committees before, section 118 of the Taxes Management Act
1970, which is still extant, defines incapacitated persons

                        <p>Clearly, those are
almost laughable definitions. In fact, they are highly insulting and
derogatory to the individuals to whom they refer, and in many ways
inaccurate and outdated. Those forms of description were essentially
incorporated into the 1970 Act from the 19th century lunacy Acts of
days gone by. However, for a variety of reasons the provisions have
never been updated or modernised. On the basis that this is not a party
political matter but a drafting issue, we thought it was important to
be constructive and to bring this new clause before the Committee in
the hope that the Government would accept it.<a class="bkMark" name="10102824000152">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Section 72 of
the Taxes Management Act 1970 provides that an incapacitated
person’s tax liabilities should apply to the trustees,
guardians, tutors, curators or committees of that incapacitated person
as if he were a non-incapacitated person. We are in an era of tax law
rewrites, and tax law rewrite Bills come along every decade or so, but
it is necessary to make this modest change now.<a class="bkMark" name="10102824000153">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">This simple
and discrete new clause would replace and modernise the definition so
that it aligned with the more appropriate meaning set out in the Mental
Capacity Act 2005, which defines incapacitated persons in a far better
and more sensitive way. The 2005 Act provides that someone lacks
capacity in relation to a matter if at the material time they are
unable to make a decision for themselves<a class="bkMark" name="10102824000154">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                        </p>
                        <p>That is a much better
definition, and we hope that it will also encompass the arrangements on
trusteeship that have accrued since 1970. For instance, it would cover
donees, the power of attorney and Department for Work and Pensions
appointees.<a class="bkMark" name="10102824000155">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The arguments
against our approach have fallen away over the years. The all-party
group on mental health highlighted the fact that UK law still includes
this anachronism of using offensive and potentially discriminatory
language to describe people with mental health problems. In 2003, the
low incomes tax reform group called for the provision to be updated.
Such action was pressed for in previous Finance Bills, including that
of 2006. Indeed, Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs fully
accepted the case for change four years ago. However, the planned
rewrite of the 1970 Act fell by the wayside for various unrelated
reasons, so the provision remains on the statute book.<a class="bkMark" name="10102824000156">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We believe
that this is a good opportunity to update the provision. The new clause
would make a minor change. It is discrete and free-standing, and it has
no Revenue implications. As I said, we have been promised rewrites by
various Governments in times gone by, but they have not been delivered.
There is clear evidence that people feel insulted or hurt by these
definitional vestiges of a bygone age, and I hope that the Minister
will accept the new
clause.<a class="bkMark" name="10102824000157">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> As we have heard, new clause 1 seeks to change the
definition in the Taxes Management Act 1970 of an “incapacitated

the Act better reflected the modern understanding of an incapacitated

                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">A
definition is required to ensure that the obligations of the 1970 Act
properly fall on those acting for children or those with mental health
problems. The existing definition can be traced back to at least 1880,
and I entirely agree that the wording—it includes words such as
“lunatic” and “idiot”—appears more
appropriate to the Victorian age than to today.<a class="bkMark" name="10102824000159">&#160;</a>

change has been requested for some time by the Low Incomes Tax Reform
Group. It pressed the previous Government on the matter from 2003, and
I believe that it was promised a consultation on the matter in 2005,
but we still have the old definitions. I have a great deal of time for
the group; it has been most helpful to me, both in opposition and in
government, and I recognise the valuable role that it plays.<a class="bkMark" name="10102824000160">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Before
addressing some of the technical points in the new clause, I would like
to reassure Opposition Members that I broadly welcome the fact that the
subject has been raised. It is a change that I will ask my officials to
consider. However, I do not think that the new clause would achieve its
intention, or that it is an appropriate way to make that change. It
seeks to link the definition of an incapacitated person from the Taxes
Management Act 1970 to the Mental Capacity Act 2005. The initial
amendment referred to section 1 of that Act, but I believe that it has
been revised to refer to section 2, as that provides a specific
definition. However, referring to section 2 would mean omitting
children, and I am sure that Opposition Members do not intend to
restrict the definition.<a class="bkMark" name="10102824000161">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Although the
new clause could be changed in an attempt to address that definitional
point better, I believe that there is a better way to do what is
intended. As Members will be aware, the Treasury launched at the time
of the June Budget a new approach to tax policy making. We wish to
avoid the previous experience of making reactive and piecemeal policy
announcements that are unexpected and insufficiently thought through.
Instead, we believe that appropriate consideration should be given to
changes and that opportunities should be provided for those affected to
comment and to have certainty about our decisions. Any change to the
measures that we are discussing should go through that process, not
least to prevent any group of people from being inadvertently moved in
or out of any new definition.<a class="bkMark" name="10102824000162">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I am sure
that Committee members appreciate that it would be inappropriate for me
to give a definitive timetable at this stage. None the less, I can
assure the Committee that we are keen to address the issue. Any changes
will be undertaken in the open and transparent way that we have set
out. I appreciate the hon. Member for Nottingham East raising that
important point and agree entirely with the sentiments behind the new
clause, but I ask him, for the reasons I have outlined, not to press it
to a Division. I am sure that he will engage with us on how to make the

                           </strong> I am grateful to the Minister for his comments,
although I take issue with them slightly. I do not want to make a party
political issue of the matter, 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 151<a class="bkMark" name="Column151">&#160;</a>
                           </div>because clearly the previous Administration did not make that change;
however, the Minister and his advisers still appear to be a little bit
in that groove. I have a couple of points to make. I do not think that
we are in a position to talk about “reactive and
piecemeal” changes, given the number of years we have been
debating this matter, and having pored over it from time to time. I was
interested to hear the technical point about whether the reference in
the Mental Capacity Act 2005 does not include children; perhaps I
should have spoken with the Minister before tabling the new clause to
ensure that we covered those points.<a class="bkMark" name="10102824000164">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Having been a
Minister, I know that it is tempting for both officials and Ministers
to get into a habit of resisting all amendment at all costs, no matter
what they are. Having a clean Bill go through Committee might be
regarded as a feather in the cap. However, I think that it would
reflect well on the Department in general, and on the Minister in
particular, if we were able to amend the law by the time the Bill is
enacted, particularly as we are talking about one, non-contentious
issue. If he gives me an assurance that, on Report—we have
plenty of days before then in which to look at changing the provision
in respect of children—he will bring forward a new clause on the
subject, we will be more than happy to praise him and accept that
arrangement. That would be a good way of doing it.<a class="bkMark" name="10102824000165">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">If the
Minister makes such a commitment today, which is within his
power—that privilege is what being a Minister, albeit a junior
one, can be about, and I am sure that the Chancellor is more than happy
to concede on the matter—we can all agree on the issue and go
away happy. Otherwise, we will try to bring the matter back on Report.
I do not think that it would help anyone if we were to divide on the
new clause today, so I hope that we can talk about the issue outside
Committee and bring forward an amendment on Report, perhaps in his
name.<a class="bkMark" name="10102824000166">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Let me assure the Committee that I would have no
reluctance in accepting the new clause if we thought that it was
technically right, and if there had been sufficient consultation and
the opportunity to examine that technical area. The issue was first
raised in 2003 by the Low Incomes Tax Reform Group, and a promise was
made in 2005 to address it. It is very important, when we examine tax
law, that we ensure that we get it right. Too often, under Governments
of both colours, we find, in Finance Bill deliberations, that we are
debating clauses that amend measures that were passed only the previous
year, or two years ago, because something has come to light. That is
why it is very important that we have a consultative and deliberative
process in making tax law. I accept that the issue is not entirely new,
but it is important that officials and outside bodies, as well as the
LITRG, can examine the
matter.<a class="bkMark" name="10102824000167">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
am not able to give the assurance that the hon. Member for Nottingham
East, quite reasonably, asked for—that we will come back by
Report with a solution—because I cannot confidently state that
we will be in a position to do so. In any event, we believe in
consulting more fully, as we have done with the Bill across the board.
However, he raises an important point, and I can assure him that the
Government are determined to address it. The terminology in the current
law is archaic

                           </div>and offensive. We want to solve the problem, but in  such a way
that there are no inadvertent, unexpected consequences, which requires
a more deliberative

                        <p class="tabbed">I
am sorry, but much as I respect the intentions behind the new clause,
that is why I cannot accept it. I hope that we do not divide on it,
because hon. Members on both sides of the Committee want to work
constructively to address the issue. It would be a pity if the issue
proved to be a dividing line between the parties when we recognise that
the hon. Member for Nottingham East has raised a very fair point, and
we want to find the right way of addressing
it.<a class="bkMark" name="10102824000169">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I hear what the Minister says and I accept his
honourable intentions in respect of the change. I know that it would be
very difficult to make a decision on a potential Government new clause
by as early as next week, perhaps, or whenever we come to the final
stages of the Bill on the Floor of the House, but the argument about
further consultation and more rounds of deliberation has pretty much
run its course by now, given the number of years we have pored over the
issue.<a class="bkMark" name="10102824000170">&#160;</a>

that reason, I will not withdraw the new clause but will press it to a
Division, in the hope that when we return on Report, either I will
table a technically correct version of the new clause or the Minister,
on reflection, will table that new clause himself. That is still my
hope. On the Floor of the House, when there are far more people
watching, it would be far more embarrassing to have Divisions, but for
now, I really feel that we need to take the issue to the next stage,

the officials from Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs, the

have repeatedly inspired me when I have been clutching for the right

work and dedication provided the means for the Government to present
our views in the Bill, as well as the means to help those who will
benefit from it. As the Committee will be aware, this is the first time
that we have consulted on all a Finance Bill’s clauses in draft.
It is part of our new approach to tax policy making. I thank all the
representative bodies and other interested parties who came forward
with suggestions for improving the legislation. They have demonstrated

                        <p class="tabbed">Although
this is a technical Bill covering a range of minor measures, the
Committee has managed, through determined probing, to draw some
surprising themes from the Bill. We have travelled far and wide in our
deliberations. Although our departure was slightly delayed, we soon had
the wind in our sails. We have gone to the cold waters of the North sea
in considering both the mackerel wars and the possible red herrings
involved in seafarers’ earnings deductions in clause 4. I
thought that we risked descending into fish-based
puns—<a class="bkMark" name="10102824000196">&#160;</a>

                           <strong> </strong>Yes, this is not the plaice. I know
that some hon. Members put their heart and sole into discussing the
issue, maybe with the advice of John Whiting. We considered the
aircraft affected by clause 21, the plans for a hydrogen-powered ferry
in Bristol harbour, and the cross-country travels of the post bus. We
even made

                        <p class="tabbed">However, it
would be wrong to think that we have not considered important and
difficult issues, from the tax treatment of carers in clauses 1 and 2
to the impact of asbestos exposure in clause 31 and the definition of
incapacity in new clause 1. Hon. Members approached those issues in a
constructive and non-partisan way, showing the value of these
considerations.<a class="bkMark" name="10102824000199">&#160;</a>

number of new Members are now dealing with Finance Bill matters. I
congratulate the shadow Front-Bench Members, who have taken a robust
and considered approach on their first outing on the shadow Front Bench
in a Finance Bill Committee. I thank them and other Opposition Members
for their dedication and constructive opposition. Despite a shaky
start, the hon. Member for West Ham and my hon. Friend the Member for
Scarborough and Whitby have helped ensure that the Committee ran
smoothly alongside other business in the House, for which I thank
them.<a class="bkMark" name="10102824000200">&#160;</a>

hon. Friends, I see exactly how the coalition Government can benefit
from both parties being involved. I wish my hon. Friends the Members
for Elmet and Rothwell, and for Dover, well in kicking their smoking
habits with the assistance of the hon. Member for Bristol East. I also
thank my hon. Friends the Members for Bristol West, for Solihull, and
for Reading West, and all my hon. Friends, including my hon. Friend the
Member for Putney, for their support. Finally, I thank you for your
help, Mr Caton, and I also thank Mr Chope and the Clerk, Mr
Patrick. I look forward to further debates on
