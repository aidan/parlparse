<B>The Chairman:</B> Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. It may be for the comfort of the Committee if I say that in view of the spring weather which means, of course, that the heating has been turned up gentlemen may remove their jackets.

<H4><center>School organisation committees</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster </B>(Bath): I beg to move amendment No. 20, in page 21, line 17, after "area", insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"to act in an advisory capacity for the local education authority".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Thank you for your ruling, Mr. Gale.
<P>
I thank the Minister for sending members of the Committee the helpful note on school organisation. I welcome the Government's decision to reconsider school organisation arrangements and to allow greater determination at local level. We support the broad thrust of the Government's proposals, but we do not believe that they have got them absolutely right.
<P>
It is vital that the current arrangements for school organisation are changed significantly. I am sure that all members of the Committee are aware that the current procedure is extremely lengthy, bureaucratic and unsatisfactory. It requires a local education authority to hold a review on an issue and to produce a consultation paper containing several proposals, not just one. The LEA must then hold public meetings involving staff, parents, governors and other interested parties. It must produce a report on the consultation process and consider the proposals in the light of the representations that it has received, and then decide on the appropriate action to take.
<P>
The LEA must then, in effect, go through the whole procedure again. It has to issue public notices and wait two months in case objections are made. If there are no objections, the LEA can go ahead but if 10 or more objections are received, and if the LEA still wants to go ahead, it must send its proposals and the objections and comments on them to the Secretary of State. Finally, the Secretary of State will make a decision, but, under the current arrangements, there is no pressure on him to do so quickly. The process will be long-winded and the procedure will have to be gone through twice.
<P>
We must ask ourselves whether we are in danger of replacing one monster with another monster and whether the Government's proposals are unnecessarily cumbersome and bureaucratic. Will the procedures be subject to sufficient democratic accountability? Would it not be better, as our amendment proposes, to accept the need for reform of the current system and improve the consultation arrangements, but to do so without the loss of democratic accountability?
<P>
I am sure that all members of the Committee have a number of concerns about the proposals. I wish to touch on one or two to give the Under-Secretary an opportunity to respond, because the Committee will be interested to know the Government's thinking and more about the details that are covered by the Minister of State's helpful note. It is suggested in the note it is not what appears in the Bill that five different groups of people will be represented on the school organisation committee. For example, the guidance note makes it clear that the schools will be represented by serving school governors, which is eminently sensible. However, the note states that that group will include
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"governors from a primary, a secondary, and a special school (and a middle school where appropriate). It should also cover community, foundation and voluntary schools (other than those maintained by the Church of England or Roman Catholic dioceses)."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The note also refers to the need to cover special educational needs provision in both mainstream and special schools.
<P>
By any way of counting, that group will already have at least seven members, yet the note also says that the Government
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"expect community, foundation, and non-diocesan voluntary schools to be represented in the group in proportion to the number of pupils in the LEA that attend their schools."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is difficult to see how all those legitimate interests can be represented by the seven people comprising that group on the school organisation committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stephen Dorrell </B>(Charnwood): I agree with much of what the hon. Gentleman says about the unsatisfactory characteristics of the process. He said that the guidance note sets out the Government's expectation that there will be five groups, but that is not how I read it. The note states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Each committee will include groups representing"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
those five categories. The Government must make it clear whether that list of five headings is intended to be exhaustive, or whether those five headings are illustrative and that those who establish the school organisation committees will determine how many groups there will be.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman, who anticipated my next comment. The Bill lists only three possible groups, but the guidance note lists five possible groups. I have already said that it will be difficult for one group to include all the legitimate interests described in the note. Problems will arise if it is intended that other groups of people should be represented. The schools group will undoubtedly need all seven members, so if all five groups listed in the Bill want a matching number of people, school organisation committees will have 35 members. If other groups are to be included the body will become unwieldy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tony McNulty </B>(Harrow, East): I may be wrong, but the Bill is not prescriptive in allowing only three groups. It says nothing of the sort; it states that a school organisation committee should include
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"at least one person within each of the following categories".
<P>
The hon. Gentleman's point about whether it is a definitive list or otherwise is well made, but to say that only three groups are listed in the Bill is entirely wrong.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Foster:</B> I think that the hon. Gentleman misheard me. I said that only three are referred to in the Bill. I acknowledge that the Bill makes it clear that there could be other groups. My point is that the number of potential groups is increased to five in the guidance note, but that no ultimate limit has been put on the number of groups. Indeed, the note implies that there could be more than five groups.
<P>
My next question is about the status of the school organisation committee. Will it be a committee of local government? If so, will it be covered by local government law and all that follows from that? If not, what will be its legal status? Will it be democratically and legally accountable, and will individuals and groups be able to challenge its decisions?
<P>
I am also concerned about the position of the adjudicator to whom the statutory body the SOC will be accountable. From my reading of the Bill and the note, the adjudicator for decisions on school organisation appears to be the same person as the adjudicator on school admission appeals. There will be a conflict of interest if one individual is responsible for both the organisation of school places and admissions appeals. Clarification about that matter would be helpful.
<P>
Another matter that is unclear in the Bill and the guidance note concerns the groups involved. The note says that the LEA group will comprise "elected members". However, when we debated clause 9 a couple of weeks ago, the Committee, against my advice, voted for elected school governors with voting rights to sit on local authority education committees. Will those elected parent governors be considered suitable to be members of the LEA group?
<P>
I said earlier that my concern about the proposal is whether, in abolishing one monster, it will create a new one. Having a statutory committee rather than, as my amendment proposes, an advisory body may build in inflexibility and delay. The guidance note sensibly says that the school organisation plan will be a five-year rolling plan, reviewed annually. However, that raises the question of what will happen when new circumstances intervene after the annual agreement of the school organisation plan by the school organisation committee.
<P>
During the past few days, I have been talking to various people around the country about such circumstances, and they have raised a large number of questions. For example, what will happen when a school organisation plan has been agreed, but before the next review is due the head teacher of an infant school retires and the local education authority wants to use that as an opportunity at least to consider the benefits of an amalgamation of an infant and a junior school? That will not have been covered by the school organisation plan.
<P>
What will happen when, as has recently happened in several places, there is a sudden decision by the American air force to change the arrangements for its air bases? Those bases have a huge impact on the provision of education in an area. It might be decided to close an air base or, as happened recently at St. Mawgan's, to change the base into a family air base, which gives rise to a sudden large influx of children into the area. It is unclear how such events will be handled.
<P>
What will happen when, as happened in my area, an independent special school closes at short notice and the children have to be catered for?
<P>
Another issue of concern is the whole bureaucracy of the SOC as described in the note. That bureaucracy will incur a cost. What will be the cost of operating the SOCs?
<P>
<B>Mr. David Jamieson </B>(Plymouth, Devonport): Socks?
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> That is the name given in the Minister's note.
<P>
Where will the money come from? Will additional funds be given to LEAs to pay for the SOCs? What would happen in the interesting case which may arise in which a SOC proposes a budget to the LEA and the LEA refuses it? Who will make the final decision about the budget?
<P>
Under the Bill, LEAs will still have to undertake their own detailed consultation on the development of the school organisation plan. They will then hand those plans to school organisation committees, which will also have to go through their own consultative machinery. It appears that the current two-tier system will be replaced by another two-tier system, but, in fact, it is rather worse than that there will be a three-tier system because LEAs will have to consult. Ultimately, if there is a dispute, the LEA will consult, the SOC will consult and finally the adjudicator will take a decision. The Government are not replacing a two-tier system with another two-tier system; they are replacing a two-tier system with a three-tier system.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>

<P>
The matter is not even as simple as that there might be a four-tier system. In announcing the proposal in general on Second Reading, the Government said that decisions on school organisation would be returned to the local level. However, under the Bill and the guidance note, the Secretary of State will still have a major role to play. The note makes it clear that he can still make proposals on shortages of school places or excess school places. If he makes such proposals over the heads of the LEA and the SOC, the adjudicator will be required, according to the note, to hold public inquiries so a two-tier system will be replaced with a four-tier system.
<P>
The proposed four-tier system raises a question of democratic accountability. SOCs will be given considerable power, but no responsibility. For example, if a SOC decides not to close a small, uneconomic school, it will not have to live with the financial consequences, whereas the LEA, if it is unhappy with that decision, will have to continue funding that school.
<P>
What will happen if a SOC decides not to take what might be difficult, controversial decisions? Sadly, that has often been true of LEAs, which have sometimes not been prepared to bite the bullet. If an LEA does not take a difficult decision, it is democratically accountable; but if an SOC does not, it is not accountable. That presents a problem.
<P>
By all means let us find ways of slimming down the existing procedure, let us introduce a much more effective consultation system on reorganisation proposals we might call it a citizens' jury or an SOC but it is crucial that LEAs are responsible for taking decisions on the proposals that SOCs put forward under the consultation arrangements. The SOC could investigate and report to the LEA, but the democratically elected body should take the decision.
<P>
The Government's proposals contain problems of accountability, reduced democracy and excessive bureaucracy. If the SOCs are advisory bodies, we can ensure that they genuinely do what we all want establish informed public debates on long-term needs. Such advisory bodies could produce some significant, desperately needed improvements to the system without losing democratic accountability or creating unnecessary bureaucracy.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I remind the Committee that it is my custom to consider the licence that I afford in debating amendments when considering whether there should be a stand part debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I agree with much of what the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) said about the shortcomings of the structure for school organisation plans and many of the detailed criticisms that he made. However, I shall not ask hon. Friends to support the hon. Gentleman's amendment because its implication is that these decisions should all be made by the LEA, which is consistent with the line that he and his hon. Friend the Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough (Mr. Willis) have taken throughout the Bill's consideration. For reasons that I have already stated, that is not an attractive proposition, so I cannot commend the detail of the hon. Gentleman's amendment, although I commend his line of argument. He was right to say that there is an implicit danger in the Bill. I acknowledge that the system that currently prevails is unsatisfactory, but it will be replaced by a system that is, if anything, even worse.
<P>
I think that the hon. Gentleman was wrong about the excess places provision I do not see that as a fourth tier. However, it is certainly true that the provisions will replace what is currently essentially a two-tier system, with power that is over-centralised in the hands of the Secretary of State, with a three-tier system, which at best will create three different tiers of equal authority to the Secretary of State and which will take even longer to reach a decision. They will prove to be ornaments that do not substantially change the present position because every significant or controversial decision will simply ricochet up to the adjudictor the same official who currently makes recommendations to the Secretary of State on the decisions that are announced in his name. Therefore, the Bill will deliver nothing substantial.
<P>
In an age when it is not uncommon to have management reorganisation in both the public and private sectors with the objective of delayering reducing the number of layers in the management chain it is positively perverse to introduce a management change to add a layer that did not previously exist. I look forward to a response from the Under-Secretary that sets out clearly the purpose of the convoluted structure. What value will be added to the process?
<P>
The hon. Member for Bath is right to say that the Bill will place on the LEA a responsibility to develop a plan that will then be subject to a decision-making process by the school organisation committee. That will take the power out of the hands of the LEA, but will make it responsible for delivering a policy that it knows does not make the best use of resources and offer the best quality education for children in that area.
<P>
I found it instructive to consider the matter in the context of institutions in the European Union, with which every member of the Committee is much more familiar. The Commission has the unique power to promote legislation; the Council of Ministers disposes such legislation. An unelected body proposes legislation to a vaguely accountable body, in the form of the Council of Ministers. However, the Bill proposes almost exactly the opposite. The body with the democratic mandate the LEA will propose measures to a completely unelected and rather obscure body the school organisation committee. It is as though the Council of Ministers had the power to propose legislation to the Commission, for the Commission to dispose. The measure is a rather perverse way of distributing responsibility within the system.
<P>
I should be grateful if the Under-Secretary would explain the thinking behind the structure of the school organisation committee and the idea that there should be an indeterminate number of groups on the committee, each of which has one vote. The hon. Member for Bath did not mention the requirement that the committee should reach its decisions by unanimity. By definition, many of the decisions that such committees will be asked to make will be controversial. To require the members of such committees a membership that seems to expand every time we sit down to think about it to reach a unanimous decision has other echos from the EU. It is almost calculated to make it an even more long-drawn-out and expensive process. What is the thinking behind having those different groups represented on the committees? Is the list in the guidance note intended to be exhaustive, or will other groups be welcome to sit on the committees? Who will decide how many groups, which groups and who constitutes the groups on an individual school organisation committee Why is there a rule of unanimity, which will prevent decision making and virtually guarantee that every controversial decision will go straight up the system to the adjudicator, who is presumably the same official who currently makes recommendations to the Secretary of State?
<P>
I hope that the debate will prove an opportunity for the Government to set out their thinking behind their proposals. I know that the guidance note says that a trend towards more local decision making has been welcomed and I would welcome it too, if it were the result of the proposals but the reaction that I have had to them is almost unanimously hostile. School organisation committees are seen to be unnecessarily complex and expensive. They will obstruct rather than assist sensible decision making. I hope that the Under-[Mr. Dorrell]
Secretary will set out with greater clarity why she believes that the proposals will constitute an improvement on the admittedly unsatisfactory system that currently prevails.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment (Ms Estelle Morris):</B> I am pleased that both the hon. Member for Bath and the right hon. Member for Charnwood (Mr. Dorrell) accept as a starting point that the current system is unacceptable. It does not work well and there is room for improvement.
<P>
The Government's underlying philosophy is that one of the unacceptable aspects of the present system is that many decisions about local school plans closures, expansions and so on are taken centrally in Westminster by the Secretary of State. At present, about 300 proposals a year are determined centrally. That figure can vary, depending on what is happening in local authorities. Therefore, our underlying principle is that it is better if such decisions are taken at local level.
<P>
When we move on from that starting point and work out a mechanism for decisions to be made locally, we have the challenge of ensuring that all the bodies responsible for providing education locally feel that their interests are guarded by the new structure. That is why we are introducing a school organisation committee and an adjudicator. I accept that the hon. Gentleman's amendment is a probing one, but if we were to accept it, the local authority would become the body responsible for making decisions on a range of changes that affect schools in all sectors, including the foundation and voluntary-aided sectors. The school organisation committee be merely an advisory body. That is not acceptable. As the right hon. Member for Charnwood said, we would, in effect, be handing to the local authority power far in excess of what it currently has. I assure the hon. Member for Bath that that would not be acceptable to the Churches. At present, decisions about changes to voluntary schools are taken centrally by the Secretary of State. If we were to move to a system of local decision making, where the interests of voluntary schools were not protected, and where, in effect, local authorities took decisions about what would happen to them, the schools would not approve of local decision making.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> It may help the Under-Secretary and save some of the Committee's time if I say that I accept her point. She is absolutely right. My amendment is a probing one, although I would prefer there to be an advisory, consultative body rather than powers being given to the SOC. I want to change the system, but, to make it workable, other measures in the Bill would have to be changed.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. We had to create a local structure for such decisions to be taken, but one where all the parties held equal sway. That is why we reached the decision to require unanimity in the voting on the SOC. Not to have that would mean that the interests of an important group could be ignored.
<P>
By having unanimity in the voting on the SOC, a group within the partnership could veto the plans of another group. That power will offer protection to each of the important groups within the partnership. In the majority of cases, the local SOC will reach a unanimous decision. We must not forget that the LEA will still have the power to determine any proposal that it has published and about which no objections had been made. At present, that runs to several hundred a year. The LEA will still have the right to take decisions about its published proposals if no objections are received.
<P>
<B>Mr. Phil Willis </B>(Harrogate and Knaresborough): This point is at the heart of the issue. Under the current structure, an LEA that makes a non-contentious decision attracts no problems because everyone agrees with that decision. However, the difficult decisions will be about, for example, proposed school closures. Such issues will be controversial and, under the Bill, decisions will have to go before the adjudicator in effect, the committee will be impotent.
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> I am not sure that the hon. Gentleman is right, but it is difficult for me to prove that. To some extent, the proof of the pudding will be in the eating. Members of the school organisation committee will have a vested interest in making the system work, as well as defending their own interest within the committee. I am not as pessimistic as the hon. Gentleman about the effect of discussion, given the background of the school organisation plan. It will have been submitted by the local education authority and it will give the demographic background to the issue and the overall plans for the area in terms of numbers and pattern of provision. It is not impossible for agreement to be reached. However, the hon. Gentleman is right in that there will be occasions when agreement will not be reached at which time the adjudicator will be brought in.
<P>
That brings me to the point made by the right hon. Member for Charnwood, who referred to a later amendment that he has tabled. The adjudicator will be more locally based than the Secretary of State. I am not pretending for a moment that contentious issues will not go to the adjudicator that will happen, which is why we made provision for an adjudicator to be in place. However, the adjudicator will not be able to impose a solution on the SOC. The committee will be the final determinant in its discussions.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mrs. Angela Browning </B>(Tiverton and Honiton): The Under-Secretary said that the adjudicator will be locally based. An amendment on the matter has been tabled to a later part of the Bill, but nowhere in the Bill does it state that adjudicators will have specific geographical areas of responsibility.
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> Many adjudicators will be locally based. We will not accept the amendment to which the hon. Lady referred for reasons that I shall explain. Adjudicators will not be sitting in Whitehall; the process will be similar to a local planning inquiry, where a local planning officer takes a decision in the name of the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions. Locally based adjudicators are likely to have greater knowledge of an area than the Secretary of State, given the latter's many extra responsibilities.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> For the benefit of the Committee, will the Under-Secretary tell us the true state of affairs? She told the Committee that local education authority decisions not objected to would go ahead straight away. According to the Bill, that is not so. Clause 25(4) states that, even if no objections are made during the consultation process, the whole school organisation plan, which will contain the vast majority of proposals, specifically has to be approved by the SOC.
<P>
Will the Under-Secretary also confirm what she forgot to add when responding to my hon. Friend the Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough (Mr. Willis) that a local education authority has to ensure widespread consultation on the plan and other proposals before the SOC can undertake its own consultation?
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> I shall take the opportunity to clarify that point and another matter that the hon. Gentleman raised when moving his amendment.
<P>
Plans will have to go to the SOC. I referred to proposals on individual schools that may not have been objected to, and said that they could be determined by the LEA. The plan is an important document; it is a blueprint for the pattern of provision of places in the local authority area and will affect everyone involved in the SOC. It is right that the plan should go before the school organisation committee. I make it clear that the local authority will be able to carry out its own proposals for individual schools if no objections are received.
<P>
I wish to make it clear that the plan will not name individual schools; proposals for individual schools will be made separately. The plan deals more with demographic information, such as the number of four-year-olds expected, and the age range of places needed. We would not expect school organisation plans to name individual schools. Those proposals would be separate. The plan is very much a blueprint.
<P>
The membership of the committee is important. The hon. Member for Bath and the right hon. Member for Charnwood accepted that the Churches are named in the Bill because they are important and special partners in the provision of education. It is right that they should have a place in the Bill. Other groups are not mentioned in the Bill because they may not be found in some local authority areas. For instance, an LEA may have no foundation schools. I cannot imagine any of the other groups not existing. Although voluntary schools may exist that are not Catholic or Church of England schools, we did not want to put them in the Bill because it would create a nonsense.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> Will the Under-Secretary give way?
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> I want first to deal with paragraph 9 of my hon. Friend the Minister's note. It states that informal arrangements or local circumstances may exist that make it sensible for the membership of a school organisation committee to be different from the five categories that we have discussed. That is fine. Let us talk about it; let us hear about it. The provisions of the clause do not require those five groups to be represented on the SOC. The membership of the SOC will be subject to regulations, and the regulations will be the subject of widespread consultation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> The Under-Secretary said in passing that some local authority areas may have no foundation schools. That could easily be the case, but the foundation schools are not identified as one of the five groups in the list. Is the implication of the Under-Secretary's remark that she would be happy for foundation schools to be listed as a specific, identified group? That is certainly how I took that remark.
<P>
Secondly, will the regulations set out an exhaustive list of groups, or will it ultimately be for the LEA to decide the definition and number of groups on an SOC?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. That question relates to the next group of amendments. I am perfectly happy for the Under-Secretary to answer it, but on the understanding that we will not discuss the matter twice.
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> Thank you for that guidance, Mr. Gale.
<P>
Paragraph 10 of the note that my hon. Friend the Minister circulated yesterday makes it clear that we would expect the membership of the group of governors to reflect the type of school provision in each area. It would be unacceptable if the group representing school governors in a local authority area that had foundation schools did not include governors of foundation schools. We do not want to exclude foundation schools; they must not feel excluded. SOCs will work only if the partners feel that they have an opportunity to make their points and to defend their interests, as well as to consider wider provision.
<P>
As you said, Mr. Gale, the matter is covered by the next group of amendments, but we would not want foundation schools to be excluded. Because the number of schools in each category varies so much between local authority areas, we have included in paragraph 8(e) representatives of schools
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"drawn from serving school governors"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
so that local provision will be reflected. We would expect the membership of groups on SOCs to be decided according to regulations, but we will consult widely on such regulations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I want to pursue the question asked by the right hon. Member for Charnwood. I think that the Under-Secretary has now given a fairly clear answer, but so that it is clear and on the record, does she expect I understand that this may change after consultation an exhaustive list to be drawn up of the groups that can serve on an SOC?
<P>
If I may, I shall illustrate in a slightly light-hearted way why I ask the question. If you were minded to take my view of local education authorities [Interruption.] Sorry, I mean the Committee, Mr. Gale although you might well be so minded. If the Committee were minded to take my view that LEAs should have a greater say, an LEA might create a category of friends of the LEA, which would have voting rights.
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> No, I do not envisage LEAs creating a group consisting of friends of the LEA. I would not want to draw up regulations that were sufficiently loose[Ms Morris]
as to allow that to happen. However, we ought to wait for the results of consultation on the regulations.
<P>
We have, as always, to perform a difficult balancing act we want to be clear about what we expect the SOC to be and yet make allowances for local patterns, customs and established procedures. That is why we intend to consult.
<P>
We have included the five categories in the guidance because they represent our current thinking. We think that in most local authority areas most of the partners providing education could be accommodated in that structure. I hesitate to give a definitive answer I do not want there to be some sort of Gestapo saying, "You've got to fit into this group." However, equally we do not want any abuse or stacking of the Committee in favour of one set of interests or another.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Theresa May </B>(Maidenhead): With your indulgence, Mr. Gale, I want to pursue the issue of categorisation. I note that paragraph 11 of the document refers to the need for
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"access to appropriate SEN expertise"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
rather than specifying that where there are special schools in an area, they shall be represented within the schools group.
<P>
I also note the Under-Secretary's comments about flexibility and consultation, but two specific groups that will be represented on LEAs are not included in the five groups identified in the document teachers and parents. Does the Under-Secretary expect teachers and parents to be involved in SOCs as well?
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> The question of special schools is important and it is crucial that their interests are represented on school organisation committees. If the hon. Lady glances at paragraph 10, she will see that special schools will be included in category (e). Paragraph 11 states that committees should have access to expertise on special educational needs.
<P>
One of the ways of doing that will be to ensure that special schools are represented in the school's group of the school organisation committee. Other ideas might emerge during consultation about how that group can have access to expert information on special schools. I have an open mind about that, and if a proposal helped the committee to take fully into account special needs within its area, the Government would happily consider it. However, I make no commitment about what the reaction might be. We have pondered the matter and included paragraph 11 for that reason.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
There is no reason teachers cannot be one of the governors because head teachers can be governors of the school. There will be no ban on that happening, if it is thought fit in the local circumstances. On a point that the hon. Member for Bath made, we expect the members to be elected, not parents who have been elected to the education committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> The hon. Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May) made an important point, but she concentrated on special schools. If I understand the Under-Secretary correctly, the Government's policy is to have far more inclusive education for children with special needs. We support that proposal. However, this is a specialist matter which affects every school. Although, under the present guidance, there might be a governor from a special school on the SOC, there might be no representation from mainstream special education. If that is the main thrust of the Government's policy, which we support, there is surely a need to specify that someone on the SOC has special expertise, rather than relying on an adviser.

<P>

<B>Ms Morris:</B> I take the hon. Gentleman's point; we have given thought to it and want to make that happen. Before the hon. Member for Guildford (Mr. St. Aubyn) jumps down my throat, I should say that we do not envisage LEAs having no special schools. I know that he fears that we are about to close them all. In most LEAs, there is likely to be a special school, even though we are moving to inclusion. That is why paragraph 11 is there.
<P>
Paragraph 11 states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"it is important that committees should have access to appropriate SEN expertise."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Before that, the paragraph refers to the
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"relation to provision for SEN both in mainstream schools and in special schools"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
To some extent, we have not closed the door on how that will happen. We are stating that, as a minimum, special schools will be represented in the group that represents schools, but we shall listen to what people have to say about how their interests can be best represented. We are in a period of flux and change with SEN.
<P>
The school that the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough headed has an excellent tradition of inclusion and is a model for other schools to follow, so I take his comments seriously. Although we are gradually moving to inclusion and we are unsure about what the pattern of inclusion will look like in future, it is important that our ears are open to what is happening so that those needs can be properly met. We shall return to that after consulting on the regulations. I assure the hon. Gentleman that all of us in the Department want to ensure that the needs of those children are not ignored.
<P>
The financial memorandum to the Bill states that the setting-up cost will be about œ1.2 million and, thereafter, œ1 million per annum. Of course, that extra money will be reflected in the standard spending assessment for local authorities.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> There was another related question, to which there might be a simple answer if so, I am sure that the Committee would be interested to hear it. Under the Bill, an SOC could make a recommendation to the LEA about its budget that the LEA is not prepared to accept. What does the Under-Secretary think will happen in such circumstances?
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> I will take guidance if I am wrong, but I understand that the LEA will be obliged to meet the costs of the budget if not, it will be referred to the Secretary of State.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> In that case, does the Under-Secretary intend to table an amendment? The Bill merely states that the SOC will put propositions to the LEA.
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> The SOC will propose its budget to the LEA. The hon. Member for Bath is talking about circumstances when the local authority refused to meet it. The local authority is an important member of the SOC, which is crucial to the smooth running of education in its area. If the SOC does not meet and does not exist because it has no budget, there will be deadlock between the schools and the local authority.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bath is being imaginative in his vision of local authorities not approving budgets. The SOC will propose a budget, the local authority will consider it and I am sure that it will make the funds available.
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> This is an important point. The Under-Secretary said that the SSA will reflect the extra costs of the school organisation committee. There is no guarantee, however, that that will be supported by a grant. The local authority will have to dig into the rest of its budget to find the sums to provide for the SOC. A local authority could say that it does not approve of the setting up of an SOC and that it cannot take away funds from schools to fund that extra level of bureaucracy.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I have allowed the Committee a fair degree of licence on the amendment. It has proved the strong case for the abolition of the clause stand part debate and the introduction of a purpose of the clause debate at the start of a clause. Nevertheless, there is a limit to even my patience and it has just been reached.
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> It is my understanding that the local authority will not refuse to meet the reasonable expenses of the SOC. If I find out otherwise on re-reading the Bill, I shall let the hon. Member for Bath have such information.
<P>
Our discussion on the provision of places has been wide ranging. Securing sufficient places for children within schools is important. The Bill is an attempt to move the decision-making process to a local level, which is a better way to make such important decisions. I hope that the fears of the hon. Member for Bath have now been allayed and that he will withdraw the amendment. If he does not, I shall invite the Committee to vote against it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> As I said earlier, I intend to withdraw the amendment but not for the reasons advanced by the Under-Secretary. She implied that my fears have been allayed. Although she has given me some helpful information about how the clause will operate, she has done nothing to allay my fears that we are replacing one unnecessary bureaucratic system with another system which, from what we have heard over the past hour or so, will be even more bureaucratic.
<P>
Were we to move to what the amendment proposes, which is a consultative role for the SOC on a non-statutory basis, there would be no question whatever of the LEA not being willing to meet the costs of that consultative work. My argument concerns who will pay for the SOC if the LEA decides not to go ahead with its establishment. I hope that we can pursue that issue on the clause stand part debate but, if you, Mr. Gale, do not allow such a debate, we shall want to return to it at a later date.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman may find an opportunity to do so when we discuss clause 25.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I am most grateful for your guidance, Mr. Gale. The Government are right to change the existing cumbersome procedure. However, they are proposing to replace it with a system that is equally, if not more, cumbersome. We shall be voting against clause stand part but, for the reasons that I explained earlier, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 21, in page 21, line 21, leave out "includes" and insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"shall have a majority of members of the local education authority and shall include".<P>

<P>
No. 53, in page 21, line 26, leave out "and".
<P>

"(d) a person nominated by voluntary aided schools other than Church of England or Roman Catholic.".
<P>
No. 176, in page 21, line 28, at end insert 
<P>
"(d) A foundation school representative.".
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Foster:</B> I suspect that we stretched your patience, Mr. Gale, in our previous debate. As you said in an earlier ruling, some of the issues covered by this group of amendments about the role of the LEA and membership of SOCs have been referred to in detail. Clearly, if my amendment were left as it stands, a large number of additional amendments would be needed for it to make sense. It would be inappropriate for the LEA to have a majority of members in the SOC without altering the voting procedures. A majority of members from the LEA, with only one vote, would not make any difference to the Government's proposal.
<P>
That raises the issue of the voting arrangements. The Under-Secretary is confident that the unanimity requirement will create no problem. When the right hon. Member for Charnwood drew attention to EU parallels, my mind moved to the voting arrangements in the EU. The Under-Secretary may wish to consider a system of qualified majority voting, which the Government support in Europe. That would be relevant to my amendment because, as I said, it would not make much sense otherwise.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> The hon. Gentleman might like to consider how the local authority world would adjust to the use of the Luxembourg compromise.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> It would be dishonest of me to say that that was a helpful intervention.
<P>
My other amendments in the group refer to representatives who should be included in the[Mr. Foster]
membership of the committees. We have already had some assurances from the Under-Secretary, but I am sure that other hon. Members want to raise issues about the membership of school organisation committees.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> I wish briefly to touch on amendment No. 176, which the Under-Secretary has already suggested she does not intend to accept. However, I must press her again because the failure to include a foundation school representative on an SOC is remiss, not least because her hon. Friend the Minister said in our 10th sitting last week that the Government wanted to extend group foundations. It is, therefore, possible that a considerable number of foundation schools will exist. The idea that there is no place for them in statute is wrong. The Under-Secretary said that she did not want them to feel excluded, but they will feel that way if they are not included in the Bill. She said that there may not be foundation schools in some areas, and I accept that. If none exist, one would not expect representation within the SOC.
<P>
However, I ask her to reconsider our reasonable request. If the Government truly believe that there is a role for foundation schools, which should be expanded into groups of foundation schools, clearly they should be represented.
<P>
<B>Ms Estelle Morris:</B> Many of the arguments just advanced were debated in the previous group of amendments. The Committee will be pleased to hear that I shall resist talking about European legislation and decision making.
<P>
I do not think that there is a great deal of difference between hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton (Mrs. Browning) and the Government. Of course, foundation schools must be represented, but the question is whether they should be included in primary legislation or in regulations. I assure her that regulations will protect their interests. On this occasion, I think that the very special place that Churches play in education is properly recognised in the BIll. I hope that the hon. Lady will accept that. We do not want to hide anything or to squeeze foundation schools out; we want to reassure the Churches, which have a long and honourable tradition of schooling, that their interests will be protected. It is our intention that the interests of groups that cannot be found in every local authority area should be guarded by recognition.
<P>
I must tell the hon. Member for Bath that the argument that I made in a previous debate, about not giving local authorities more power than the Bill gives them through the SOC, still stands. If we put the LEA in the majority, it will be difficult for others to defined their legitimate interests. We want to ensure not only that their interests are defended, but that they are seen to be defended.

<P>

<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> As the Under-Secretary rightly says, we have already debated many of the issues surrounding this amendment. When debating an earlier amendment, I said that it would be a problem if the maximum number of members of the school group was to be seven. Taking account of other matters, including what my hon. Friend the Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough said about special educational needs, it will be difficult with a maximum of seven to represent all those interests including, for example, voluntary-aided schools other than Church of England and Roman Catholic Church schools, mentioned in amendment No. 111 the latter is covered in paragraph 10 of the guidance note. How will all those groups be squeezed in to that relatively small pot?
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> The hon. Gentleman has created a worst-case scenario, with a local authority that has a huge variation of provision and where nobody seems to agree about anything. In that group, non-Church schools will be represented. It may be a more cohesive group than the hon. Gentleman suggests. Seven is a maximum number. We did not want the group to be too large, and thought that the various interests could be represented with a maximum of seven although a group may not be that large. There will be one vote per group in the SOC, and unanimity will be expected.
<P>
The membership of the SOC has been given good coverage. I hope that the hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton accepts that it is not our intention to squeeze out the legitimate interests of foundation schools and that regulation is a better way for those interests to be protected.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<H4><center>Schedule 4</center></H4>
<H4><center>School organisation committees</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I beg to move the amendment No. 180, in page 104, line 41, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"if reached within three months of the beginning of consideration".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment is simple. It addresses directly the unanimity rule set out in paragraph 5 of schedule 4 as one of the principles on which school organisation committees are supposed to work.
<P>
I do not find the Under-Secretary's arguments persuasive. I understand the principle that the committees are supposed essentially to be a meeting place for different interests and to allow agreement to be reached between different interested local groups. The Under-Secretary has argued that a proposal should proceed only when all local interests are unanimously agreed on it. I agree with the argument made by the hon. Member for Bath during our last debate that that is likely, in the great majority of cases, to mean that any controversial decision will go directly to the adjudicator.
<P>
The purpose of the amendment is to confine the extent of the delay implicit in the process. As I read the Bill, the school organisation committee can continue to argue about the local education authority's proposals more or less indefinitely. That will not only incur a cost, but cause an unacceptable obstruction of the flexibility necessary to any system. The amendment would set a time limit within which the school organisation committee would have to reach agreement, so that we could then proceed to the next stage of this already top-heavy process.
<P>
History is replete with examples of organisations that sought to reach unanimous decisions and did not proceed until they had been reached. If that formula is not limited or truncated in some way, it will become a recipe for inaction and for difficult decisions not to be faced. If we accept, for the purposes of argument, that the structure is to be put in place and that decisions must be reached unanimously, let us require the process to be completed within three months. Otherwise, we will build in delays that will be expensive and potentially damaging to children's educational interests.
<P>
I hope that the Under-Secretary will accept either the amendment I suspect that that is a long shot or at least the principle that a time limit on the process of achieving unanimity is a desirable discipline.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> We support the principle enunciated by the right hon. Member for Charnwood. It is most damaging to schools when an organisational problem drags on and on. It is in everyone's interest to introduce discipline to proceedings. It is important that the Under-Secretary gives a considered response to the time schedule proposed.
<P>
<B>Ms Estelle Morris:</B> I am happy to give the assurance sought. I agree entirely with the comments made by the right hon. Member for Charnwood and the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough. Delay is the worst possible scenario. In education, everything runs year by year, so that if the year's start is missed by one month, we end up with a 12-month delay.
<P>
I think that we included in the note that my hon. Friend the Minister circulated yesterday the requirement that school organisation committees must make decisions within two months. If that is not in the note, it will be set out in regulations. Committees will have two months to make a decision, at which point, if they have not reached a unanimous decision, the matter will be referred to the adjudicator, for the reasons that the right hon. Gentleman mentioned. Delay and sitting around waiting for unanimous agreement is not in the best interests of children. That time pressure will encourage committees to perform their job quickly and to reach the best possible decision.
<P>
I hope that the right hon. Member for Charnwood is satisfied by that assurance and will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> In view of the Under-Secretary's assurance that she intends to write such a provision into regulations, it would be churlish not to seek the Committee's leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"each adjudicator having a designated area.".</UL></FONT>
<P>
Again, the Under-Secretary has said during this sitting that she is not inclined to accept this amendment, but I should like to press her to reconsider her decision. We have heard much about the adjudicator this morning. In the guidance note, adjudication is a stand-apart issue, yet the matters that the adjudicator considers will often vary around the country, depending on their geographic nature. LEAs vary, as will the decisions that the adjudicator must take on the grouping of schools and on the ethos of education in that part of the country.
<P>
Under the amendment, there would be an adjudicator for a specific geographic area, which could be defined as a grouping of specific LEAs. If that adjudicator has to make a series of adjudications, it is important that he or she considers the locality for which each decision is taken. Therefore, in appointing adjudicators, the Secretary of State should designate them either to a grouping of LEAs or a geographic area, perhaps based on the regions. There would then be consistency, not just in each decision that an adjudicator takes, but over a period within a geographic area. That seems to be a reasonable request and I therefore ask the Under-Secretary to reconsider her view.
<P>
<B>Ms Estelle Morris:</B> I have some sympathy with the amendment, as I have said. However, I shall explain why we shall not accept it. The hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton has used the consistency argument. It would be better not to have locally based adjudicators because consistency will be produced throughout the country if adjudicators operate in several geographical areas. That is an argument for having people who move out of a geographical area, but it is not the main reason for wanting to reject the amendment. I hope that the adjudicators appointed will live in different areas of the country. It is not our intention to appoint only adjudicators who are London based.
<P>
The truth is that there is no way of predicting the number of proposals that will come from each local[Ms Estelle Morris]
authority or each region in any year. Last year, five times as many applications came from the south-east and London region than from other regions, but that is not necessarily the pattern of either preceding or future years.
<P>
For example, Warwickshire has undertaken a massive reorganisation in the past five years. I would suspect that an adjudicator covering Warwickshire in the past five years would have been inundated. We do not want to build in a time delay. We want the flexibility to use the adjudicators where they are needed, which will encourage consistency.
<P>
I entirely accept what the hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton said about the need for local knowledge. In some ways, local people might have more respect for a decision if the person taking it is from the area and understands it. I hope that that will be possible in many cases. However, if such a provision were included in the Bill, logistical problems could be created owing to the difficulty of predicting the number of proposals that would need adjudication in an area. I cannot offer assurances in regulation or legislation, but I can offer an assurance of intent. It is out intention to recognise the special contribution that local adjudicators can offer to decision taking.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> I am somewhat encouraged by the Under-Secretary's concluding remarks. Clearly, we are concerned that an urban perspective will be taken, especially on rural areas where schools are spread out. However, in the circumstances, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I seek much greater clarity from the Under-Secretary on what the Government intend the adjudicator service to look like. One of the great uncertainties hanging over the Bill is what kind of beast the service will be. Who will be the adjudicators? Are they likely to be those officials in the Department for Education and Employment who had previously offered advice to Ministers on school organisation proposals? In other words, will they be career civil servants who will spend a certain time acting as adjudicators as part of their careers?
<P>
The Under-Secretary used the analogy of the planning inspectorate system. Will the adjudication service be a specialist discipline? If so, I find it hard to understand how it will work. It has been implied that it will become a relatively large service and big enough to offer people career prospects and so on.
<P>
What kind of individuals will the adjudicators be? Will they have to have teaching backgrounds? Will they be drawn from Ofsted and the inspectorate world? Will they be civil servants or teachers? What kind of background do the Government want the adjudicators to have? Should they be relatively obscure and anonymous or should they be named individuals who will be reported in the newspapers under their own names as having been responsible for certain decisions? What idea do the Government have for the service?
<P>
Was the hon. Member for Bath right when he said that the same individual who makes the decisions as adjudicator under the provisions on school organisation will make the decisions on admissions? How do the Government envisage the adjudicator service working? Given the parallel used by the Under-Secretary of the planning inspectorate, does she envisage that the school organisation proposals will be subject to public hearings? How will evidence be presented to the adjudicators? Will it be public evidence? Will the adjudicator publish conclusions with reasons? Will the adjudicator be under an obligation to state the reasons for each decision made on both school organisation and admissions?
<P>
I hope that the Under-Secretary can give the Committee a clear view of what is envisaged. The Government have certainly not yet done so. How many adjudicators will be employed? The financial memorandum to the Bill says that the whole cost of the school organisation committee process, including the adjudicator service, will be œ1.2 million in the first year and œ1 million thereafter. It does not sound like a service that will have local roots, as the Under-Secretary told my hon. Friend the Member for Tiverton and Honiton that she wanted. It does not sound as though the service would be able to make informed decisions about individual children from Carlisle to St. Mawgan down to your constituency I use the term correctly on this occasion, Mr. Gale in north-east Kent. How can such a service be delivered for œ1 million?
<P>
I hope that the Under-Secretary will use the opportunity of the clause stand part debate to answer my questions. If she cannot do so at present and would prefer to set out to members of the Committee and the public a clearer view of her intentions for the adjudicator service, perhaps she will publish a document outlining the Government's intentions in due course.
<P>
<B>Ms Estelle Morris:</B> The only people who will be excluded from being adjudicators will be Members of Parliament. That will come as good or bad news for members of the Committee, depending on their plans after the next general election.
<P>
We do not envisage the adjudicators as career civil servants on secondment. That is not our intention. The posts will be advertised under the open appointments procedure as Lord Nolan requested. They will be appointed in the name of the Secretary of State, but I do not envisage the Secretary of State sitting in his or her office making all the appointments. It is likely that the adjudicators will be appointed on a part-time basis, salaried and paid a daily rate. People will not be taken from existing civil service jobs.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Charnwood mentioned that the adjudicators will be the same people as are now advising us on our proposals. Such an idea had not entered my mind. I am not saying that some of those people, in another life, might not apply to become adjudicators, but it is not our plan to second them.
<P>
When advertising for the post, we will make clear what sort of background we are looking for. I expect that a background in education would be welcome. I cannot be prescriptive, because we have not yet reached the stage of drawing up job advertisements. Adjudicators will be part time, and will not be seconded. They will have a background in education. They will be paid a daily rate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I hope that the Under-Secretary will answer some of my other questions. It had not crossed my mind that adjudicators would be part timers; perhaps she sees the service as another version of the magistracy. If so, I hope she will develop her argument.
<P>
The Under-Secretary is seeking the power from Parliament to set up a new service. It is incumbent on the Government to be rather clearer in their view than simply saying, "We will dream up a job advert when we have the authority to fill the places."
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> We do not see it as a magistracy. I am not sure whether magistrates are paid part-time; it may have changed since I last inquired. We do not see the service as being a voluntary commitment by members of the community.
<P>
We will make clear I shall do so at a later stage, if the Committee thinks it appropriate exactly what the appointments procedure will be and what we shall be looking for in adjudicators. Today, however, we are seeking permission to appoint adjudicators to fulfil an important role in school organisation committees. They will make decisions when the SOC cannot reach unanimous agreement. I hope that I have at least managed to allay the fear expressed by the right hon. Member for Charnwood that they will be the same people as are currently advising us but in a different guise. Clause 24 is important and it should stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I am sorry, Mr. Gale, but I want to pursue the matter with the Under-Secretary. I do not find her answer persuasive. I make the point again. The Government are seeking statutory authority to set up the service. The Under-Secretary did not answer my question about whether this is the same adjudicator 
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> Yes, it is.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> Yes it is: fine. The Government need to set out clearly what sort of service it is intended to be. During my opening speech, the Under-Secretary said under her breath that she envisaged there being 12 adjudicators.
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> No.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> No. I am wrong. How many will there be?
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> About 20, perhaps a few more.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> We are talking of about 20 part timers. The hon. Member for Bath has re-entered the Room, no doubt from important business outside; he will be interested to hear that.
<P>
We are talking about establishing a new service under clause 24. Twenty people will be engaged a few part timers but we do not quite know what background they should have. The Minister assures us that, before the advertisements are published, consideration will be given to the qualifications needed.
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> The adjudicator is a key person. I do not want the Committee to be unhappy, or to be suspicious about how we wish to appoint them. I thought that I had assured the Committee that they would be open appointments, that the posts would be advertised, that we would be looking for people with a background in education, that they would be paid on a daily rate, and that we would be looking for about 20.
<P>
I ask the right hon. Gentleman to let me reflect on whether to offer further information to allay his fears. I shall ensure that he and other members of the Committee have the result in writing. I shall take the opportunity also to put in writing a summary of the proposals that I have listed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for that clear statement of what she expects from the adjudicator service. On that basis, I am happy to proceed to a vote.

Schedule 5 agreed to.

<H4><center>School organisation plans</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 181, in page 22, line 18, leave out "adjudicator" and insert "Secretary of State".
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss the following amendments: No. 182, in page 22, line 31, leave out "adjudicator" and insert "Secretary of State".
<P>
No. 183, in page 22, line 39, leave out "adjudicator" and insert "Secretary of State".
<P>
No. 184, in page 22, line 42, leave out "adjudicator" and insert "Secretary of State".
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> The amendments seek to change the provisions of clause 25 for school organisation plans.[Mr. Dorrell]
For reasons that have already been made clear, I am sceptical about the benefit said to be introduced into the system by the adjudicator. The effect of making the Secretary of State the individual who decided school organisation plans if they could not be agreed by the school organisation committee would be to introduce a set of circumstances that, broadly speaking, would be not unlike the present system.
<P>
I acknowledged in an earlier debate that the system is capable of improvement. However, until a better system is proposed the Government have not done that we can say of the present system at least that it makes clear who is accountable and that, although it is slow and cumbersome it is reasonably familiar to those who seek to operate it. As we said when debating clause 23, the problem with the school organisation planning process set out in clause 25 is that it introduces new layers of bureaucracy. I do not see the extra value in having those different tiers.
<P>
The other problem with the new structure is that, to the extent that planning decisions are taken at a higher level than the LEA, they are taken by people of whom the public is and will remain almost entirely unfamiliar. We are told that the school organisation committee will meet at least once a year. The Under-Secretary said that she recognised that the post of adjudicator was important and that she was prepared to set it out in more detail, but it remains a fact that we are talking about 20 individuals working part time. It is unlikely to be a high-profile and accountable body. Yet its plans will contain important proposals for school organisation. If planning decisions are to be made other than by the LEA, it will not be sufficient for the Secretary of State to say that although the proposals were controversial a decision had been taken by the adjudicator.
<P>
If my constituents were told that the adjudicator had decided to change the pattern of provision of primary education in rural Leicestershire in a way which was controversial and with which local people were unhappy, they would not support that. They would say, "Who is the adjudicator?" We would reply that he was an estimable part-time person such as we discussed in our debate on the previous clause. They would then say, "Who is he accountable to?" We would reply, "He is appointed by the Secretary of State to take wise decisions." They would say, "Where do we find the adjudicator?" We would reply, "He is probably busy pursuing his day job at the moment, so you will find it difficult to find him."
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
The process will not be accountable to people for delivery of the service that they want for their children. I am fully alive to the inadequacies of our present system, but at least it focuses accountability on a public official whom the public know. If we tell people that a decision has been taken by the Secretary of State, they know where they must send their letters and with whom they must seek meetings. The Under-Secretary no doubt has to conduct meetings on such subjects in the name of the Secretary of State, as did her predecessors. Who will conduct meetings on behalf of the part-time adjudicator when he is off doing his day job? The public will want to challenge decisions that affect them and to hear the reasons for those decisions.
<P>
The reason that the amendments write the Secretary of State back into the clause is that accountability to the people who use the service is not properly safeguarded under the clause. In the absence of a viable and convincing improvement on the present system, I would prefer us to retain the essential accountability of the present system through the person of the Secretary of State.

<P>

<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I lend Liberal Democrat support to this group of amendments. We lost the vote on the previous clause, but the amendments return us to that ground because they remove the role of the adjudicator.
<P>
We support the amendments for exactly the reason that the right hon. Member for Charnwood explained: the Secretary of State is properly accountable. He has been appointed by the Government; he is an elected official, and people can get their hands round his throat. They cannot get their hands round a planning inspector, with due respect once he leaves an inquiry, he goes off and people are left in limbo. For that reason, we support what may be an imperfect system but is certainly better than what the Government propose.
<P>
<B>Ms Beverley Hughes </B>(Stretford and Urmston): I had wanted to rise during discussion of this issue on previous clauses, but I saved myself for now. I shall be brief, but I would like to make some observations on the points made by Opposition Members.
<P>
It is confusing to hear Opposition Members arguing for a status quo that they freely agree and volunteer is not working. If they are to move amendments, there is an onus on them to propose an alternative to preserving the status quo.
<P>
Throughout our discussions, we have heard arguments against what Opposition Members have seen as increased centralisation of decisions with the Secretary of State. This morning, we have heard arguments against increased bureaucracy and lengthy decision making, yet the amendments would not only return to the Secretary of State important decisions that should be taken locally, but would make the decision making process more bureaucratic and lengthy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> The amendments would not return any decisions to national level that would, under the Bill, be taken locally. They would transfer decisions from an adjudicator, who will be an unelected, unaccountable official, to the Secretary of State, who is elected and accountable. Perhaps the hon. Lady would address that point.
<P>
<B>Ms Hughes:</B> Yes, I certainly will. The right hon. Gentleman is missing the principle behind the clause, which is to devolve to a more local level responsibility for planning the blueprint to which my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary has referred for school organisation and for places, not in individual schools, but in general.
<P>
We must remember that the adjudicator will be called into play only when the various members of the SOC representing local interests cannot agree. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary has promised to flesh out some of the detail, but she has made it clear that adjudicators, while not representing a region or locality, will by virtue of the way they operate and are appointed be more accessible to local people and be required to have local knowledge.
<P>
Knowing that decisions on disputes are referred to someone locally will make people feel different from how they feel at present, when decisions fly up to London, to the Secretary of State in Whitehall, and disappear into the stratosphere. Decisions come back down which people feel that they have had no opportunity to influence. The principle behind having a person acting on behalf of the Secretary of State let us be clear, adjudicators will be appointed to act on behalf of the Secretary of State is to institute an independent, objective arbitrating and problem-resolving function at a more local level than the Secretary of State.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> Does the hon. Lady accept that all members of the Committee agree with half of what she says that we need to take decisions more quickly and locally? That means getting rid of the two-stage process; it also means improving consultation, perhaps by appropriate regulations. We all agree with that.
<P>
We are discussing those hopefully rare occasions when there is local disagreement about a proposal. In those circumstances, however much we improve local decision making, someone ultimtely has to take the decision. The choice that the Committee faces is whether that should be an elected person with democratic accountability or an unelected person with no democratic accountability. The hon. Lady is advocating that it should be the latter an unelected, democratically unaccountable person. The Opposition are arguing, that it should be a democratically elected person. In the past, the Labour party was against quangos and their unelected heads, such as Cedric Brown. Who would the hon. Lady rather have taking decisions Cedric Brown or the Secretary of State?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Hon. Members must make their interventions brief. If the hon. Member wants to make a speech and tries to catch my eye, I am quite likely to see him.
<P>
<B>Ms Beverley Hughes:</B> Thank you, Mr. Gale.
<P>
Theoretically, the argument about democratic accountability is serious; I would not deny that. However, the democratic accountability of the Secretary of State to a local authority for decisions on school organisation is unreal. It does not feel real; it feels as if decisions are being taken by an inaccessible person in government.
<P>
Appointing adjudicators to act on behalf of the Secretary of State the procedures by which adjudicators will have to abide will be regulated by the Secretary of State and they will be required to be familiar with a code of practice, and so on will make local people feel that the process is more accountable to them.
<P>
The amendments would require the Secretary of State to become involved in the local planning process for school organisation, when the principle behind the Bill is to bring decisions down to the local level.
<P>
<B>Ms Estelle Morris:</B> This is one set of amendments that has been widely discussed already, but I shall try to respond to the specific issues that have been raised.
<P>
There is no reason why an adjudicator should be anonymous and his or her name should not be known. In many cases, the adjudicator will make a decision based on written representations, but there is no reason why the decision should not occasionally be based on oral representations. That may be possible under the guidance that we shall issue. Members of Parliament who have access to Ministers sometimes make assumptions about how much access the average man or woman in the street has to Ministers: not everyone has the same access as Members of Parliament. We are trying to ensure that the adjudicator is locally based and is able to receive written or oral representations so that local people feel that they have access to the person making the decision.
<P>
We must bear in mind the fact that the job of the adjudicator is to make a decision from the options that the SOC has considered, not to fabricate something new that no one has considered. We are trying to make the process more locally based. We have put in place the SOC to consider the school organisation plans and proposals and, where there is a difference of opinion, to decide whether to consider the Secretary of State which would require use of centralised power, against which Conservative Members have been warning or a local adjudicator.
<P>
We have decided that, in the interest of local decision making, the local adjudicator will be best placed to make such decisions, so I advise hon. Members to oppose the amendment because a local adjudicator will be crucial to the decision-making process.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> The Government's approach to the adjudicator is rather worrying. I made it crystal clear when I moved the amendment that I do not pretend that the present system is perfect or incapable of improvement. I do not propose to table a massive number of amendments to restructure the Bill because it would require redrafting of substantial chunks of the Bill.
<P>
The Government propose to abolish a decision-making process that culminates in the Secretary of State and to replace it with sensitive, controversial decisions being made locally. Such decisions will not be viewed as local decisions any more than a planning inspector's decisions at a planning inquiry are viewed as local decisions. The Under-Secretary drew the parallel between adjudicators and planning inspectors. The justification that is often advanced for the planning system is that an outsider can make difficult decisions better than a local person. Under the Government's model, decisions are intended to be made by people whose names may be known, but who will ultimately be faceless people, proceeding mainly by written representations and unable, therefore, to receive delegations of the kind that the Under-Secretary and her predecessors have always been able to receive.
<P>
The Under-Secretary says that we should not exaggerate the accessibility of Ministers. I understand that point, but the reality is that it is not that difficult for a local Member of Parliament who feels sympathetic to[Mr. Dorrell]
a local cause c\ael\gebre to bring a delegation to meet a Minister and thereby ensure that local views are expressed face to face. I held that brief as a junior Minister in the Department of Health and the same applies to junior Education Ministers. We all know that the system is less than perfect, but I am convinced that in terms of accountability and flexibility it is better than vesting these decisions in part-time, retired head teachers, which is what the adjudicator service amounts to.
<P>
<B>Ms Beverley Hughes:</B> The right hon. Gentleman may feel that he is making a valid point, although his constant desire to centralise everything is [Hon. Members: "Worrying."] Yes, worrying. Does not he accept that such comments trivialise the issue? My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary has already made it clear that an adjudicator is essential to the process envisaged. Adjudicators will be credible; they will have stature; and their decisions will be regarded by local people as valid. In his constant trivialisation of them as being part-time, retired head teachers, the right hon. Gentleman is not fully entering into the debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> With all respect to the hon. Lady, I do not agree. I am the first to concede that retired head teachers are people with authority.

<P>

<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for that remark.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I am sure that the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough was pleased to hear it. I am not belittling their status in the community; I am saying that part-time, retired head teachers who do not have a mandate from the electors as the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough has do not have the standing and authority to make the sort of decisions that will have to be made.
<P>
The hon. Member for Stretford and Urmston seems to believe that adjudicators will, in the public mind, have authority and independence, and will develop a capacity to make hugely controversial decisions on behalf of local schools. I do not believe that such a result is in prospect from what we have heard both about the adjudicator service and the way in which the supporting infrastructure will work. The hon. Lady says that I am trivialising the matter, but I think that I am humanising it by reminding the Committee of the type of people who are likely to emerge to do the job.
<P>
When I asked the Under-Secretary about the qualifications that adjudicators would have, she said that they would probably have a background in education. If we are looking for people with a background in education who have independent standing to do a part-time job, and if we are not going to have employed head teachers, a retired head teacher seems to be not a bad vignette of the sort of person who is likely to emerge. Therefore, I simply invite the Committee to decide whether he or she will be better able to respond to local concerns than the system that exists now.
<P>
<B>Ms Estelle Morris:</B> I just want to clarify a point about adjudicators having a background in education. The right hon. Gentleman repeated something that I said, but out of the context in which I said it. In the previous debate, the right hon. Gentleman asked whether adjudicators would have an education background, to which I responded that those with such a background would make good applicants for the post. However, I do not want anyone to think that the only people who would be eligible for the job are those with education backgrounds or who are retired head teachers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I am sorry; I was not seeking to misrepresent what the Under-Secretary said. I want to draw the Committee's attention to the sort of person who is likely to emerge, such as the retired head teacher, the lawyer, the person with experience in the LEA, or, indeed, someone with experience the Under-Secretary left the door open of decision making in the DFEE. The people involved could come from a number of backgrounds, but they will not be people with a specific elected mandate to carry public authority in resolving difficult and controversial local problems.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> As my right hon. Friend has expanded his argument, he has covered people who, it dawned on me with horror, might fill the post. Given the Under-Secretary's criteria, if they are not head teachers, they could be educationalists. Have we not had enough of them in the education system?
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> There are a number of people who have a specialism in education, who hold wildly different views about how education should develop, and who agree about one thing they do not like being called educationalists.
<P>
<B>Ms Joan Ryan </B>(Enfield, North): The right hon. Gentleman expresses deep concern about accountability and elected representatives. That does not reflect the Conservative Government's attitude over 18 years as they created many quangos that had a great deal of power and money, to which no one was elected. All their chums who had been thrown off local authorities piled on to those quangos. The right hon. Gentleman put an interesting contradiction to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I invite the hon. Lady to determine which side of the argument she wants to come down on. If I am changing sides as she says well, so is she.
<P>
Occasionally, we gave vested powers to the Secretary of State that had previously been vested locally. I acknowledge that it is a challenge for those planning schools organisation to want to make decisions more locally accountable than they had traditionally been. I have argued consistently, however, that the structure proposed by the Government does not rise to that challenge. The process by which decisions on controversial matters are made ultimately by an adjudicator does not even constitute a quango, but whatever emerges when a quango is reduced to one unelected and largely invisible person.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> A quan.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> Yes such a structure would not even attain the status of a quango. It is on that basis that I want to press the amendment to a Division.

</FONT>Question accordingly negatived.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I wish to express one or two general concerns about the school organisation planning process. Many of my worries about the clause are reminiscent of those that I expressed earlier about education development plans and where responsibility rests and should rest within the system. The whole approach of the school organisation plan is to put emphasis on the rather obscure bureaucracy that we have been discussing to make plans about the provision of school places and its framework for a particular area.
<P>
The implicit assumption under which our discussion has proceeded is that it is the responsibility of the bureaucracy to provide institutions for a local community. Part of my answer to the challenge posed by the hon. Member for Stretford and Urmston about how that could be improved would be to increase the responsibility of the individual school to develop itself as an institution to meet local needs. One of the striking things about the provisions on school organisation planning is the extent to which responsibility is vested in the local education authority, the school organisation committee, the adjudicator and the Secretary of State. The question is which of those bodies should determine how a school's provision in a particular area should develop.
<P>
When I read the Bill and consider the balance between the different parts of the bureaucratic process, I ask myself what role is played by the head teachers and the governors of the school? Where have they got to? Concern is often expressed in our surgeries about local schools provision. Surely the first rung on the ladder should be the responsibility of the head and the governors to ensure that schools develop in a way that reflects local need and local parental preference.
<P>
Where two or three schools serve a village or small town, surely the responsibility to develop the infrastructure whether it be classrooms, playing fields, laboratories or the different elements necessary to respond to emerging needs should rest with the people who understand best what is happening in the local community, who are best placed to respond, and those who have day-to-day responsibility for running the school.
<P>
The Under-Secretary's response might be to say that individual schools are represented on school organisation committees I concede that they are and that diocesan bodies and LEAs have an overview. Why cannot we pursue a policy that places more responsibility for the development of local institutions on those who know about local needs, especially the foundations that will be responsible for running more than one school? That is a challenge for the Government.
<P>
The moment the premise is accepted that a foundation can contain more than one school, surely exactly the sort of local focus for school development and planning that I suggest is created. Such foundations are well placed to develop the service not a grand, strategic overview, although such an overview is probably still needed. However, the provisions contain no bottom-up element to meet the top-down element.
<P>
School organisation planning suffers from the planner's mentality of looking at a matter from a bird's eye view without taking adequate account of the interests, ideas and enthusiasms of different schools. Schools will not only have views about different needs, but different ideas about how those needs can be met. It is important to allow those different ideas to be thought through in conversation with local people, but that is almost entirely lacking in the Bill. I am interested to hear the Government's response on involving local head teachers and governors more directly in the planning process for school provision.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> Given the beginning of the right hon. Gentleman's speech, I thought that I would almost totally oppose him. He was basically suggesting a return to the days when individual schools worked as an entity without regard to other schools and, therefore, planned their provision on that basis. Those of us who have worked in education although we might be part time or have other futures when we are not re-elected 
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his admission that he will not be re-elected.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I was just looking beyond the next 25 years.
<P>
One of the issues affecting the education service over the past 18 years has been the emphasis on division and setting schools apart. However, the right hon. Gentleman ended his speech much more positively and suggested ways in which schools could co-operate. Nowhere is there a clearer example of why school must co-operate.
<P>
I shall return to a theme that I shall play throughout our debates: special educational needs. The Green Paper, "Excellence for all Children", stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"All Government policies for schools will include an explicit assessment of the implication for children with special educational needs."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Few would disagree with that statement, yet clause 25 does not contain that explicit statement. In fact, a school organisation plan can make scant reference to special educational needs.
<P>
Such matters are important in planning places because location is more important to children with special educational needs than to any other child. Perhaps the brightest children in the land can travel great distances to school, but for children with special[Mr. Willis]
needs especially those with learning difficulties or physical and sensory impairments it is crucial to their development that they be educated as locally as possible.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Selective schools in an area block the opportunity for many children with special needs to attend them. I know from experience that if places are planned in terms of maximum capacity, many schools would not take children with statements or specific special educational needs because they would be full or would not have the right facilities they certainly would not have the capacity to take on particular units. The physical state of buildings often negates the opportunity for children with physical impairments to access their local school. It is crucial that when an LEA is proposing its plan it takes such issues into account.
<P>
If the right hon. Member for Charnwood has his way, that would not be the case. Individual schools would draw up their own plan and to hell with the rest. They would not accept children with particular needs. I also know from experience that head teachers and governors have deliberately excluded children with special needs because they would affect the profile of schools and their league table position.

<P>

<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> The hon. Gentleman said that, if we went down the road that I advocated, it would make the position of children with special needs more difficult. I do not accept that for one moment; it certainly would be the opposite of what I intended. If he wanted to make specific provisions that dealt with that problem, that further element could be added. I hope that he will consider the need to have the school's view taken into account in the planning process, otherwise a school's organisation plan is decided above school level and is simply received in the school without its perspective being taken into account.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I accept that schools must play an important role within the planning process. Equally, it is important to look at the whole of the provision. I am arguing strongly that the plan for children with special educational needs must take them into account on an authority-wide basis. If it fails to do so and if there is no such provision in the Bill or in the regulations, I wonder how those children will be included in our education service. We must not go back to the system under which some local authorities and some schools can deliberately choose to exclude them for nefarious reasons.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick St. Aubyn </B>(Guildford): I have listened to he debate with interest. As a new Conservative Member, I hope that I can deflect the charge that Conservative Members are trying to centralise everything. Conservatives have always believed in devolved power, but the reason why we found ourselves in such a difficult situation in the 1980s is the same reason why we regard the clause in the way that we do. The cat was let out of the bag earlier in our proceedings, when the Government said that they would describe one of the clauses as the Hackney clause because of the problem of failing school standards in predominantly Labour-controlled authorities.
<P>
It is clear that the interaction between the school organisation plan and the education development plan is to create a framework outside the control and influence of local education authorities, which are predominantly Labour-run and which have failed the people whom they are supposed to serve.
<P>
There is a corollary and I sympathise with the problem. We found Labour-controlled local authorities failing in many different respects when were in power. We had to set up quangos to get some local decision making that reflected the needs of local people, even if that pre-empted the power and authority of small groups of local Labour councillors who were elected on a small minority. In those terms, I can well understand why the Government are introducing school organisation plans and giving power to appointed adjudicators.
<P>
I shall be interested to hear how the Government propose the school organisation plans to interact with the development plan. When we debated that issue, we said that the Department for Education and Employment would be able to enforce its view over that of the education authority and could impose detailed policies that local people disagreed with generally. We were told, "Oh, no. It is all right because the education development plan is all about targets. We will not get involved in the details of running the area." Yet, we now see how the other mechanism of the organisation plan could be used by the DFEE, through the agency of appointed adjudicators, to spell out in precise detail how the objectives agreed for an area will be delivered.
<P>
The organisation plan can be used as a way of circumventing the democratically accountable and democratically expressed wish of local people through their local authority. We want reassurances from the Minister. The White Paper refers to the Government wanting to move towards more devolved decision making, but how do we know that that will happen under the proposed structure?
<P>
We oppose centralisation of power in principle because it tends to ossify the decision-making process, entrenches the established view and does not allow new ideas and views to develop. The hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough spoke earlier about the conflict caused by the previous Government's education policies. They caused conflict because we introduced new and radical ideas that the education establishment opposed. A few years on, we hear from the Under-Secretary about the success of grant-maintained schools. We even heard this morning how more and more primary schools are taking up the idea of testing every year. That idea was proposed by the Conservative Government and was vigorously contested by teachers. Yet, we read in today's papers that the idea of annual testing will now be taken up with enthusiasm and used as a sound basis for improving education standards.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It would be helpful if we could return to the subject of school organisation plans.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I am happy to do so, but all this seems to be related. [Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. This hon. Gentleman may think that, but I do not. He must return to the subject of the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> We are concerned that, by the sound of it, the adjudicators are likely to be well entrenched in their opinions about the education system. That, coupled with the top-down approach that is exemplified by the interaction between the education development plan and the school organsiation plans, means that the education system will be stultified. Obstacles will be placed in the way of new ideas that may come from, for example, Conservative LEAs. As I demonstrated on Thursday, Surrey county council has come up with an excellent partnership idea between the private and state sectors and we have plenty more ideas up our sleeve. However, those ideas will be blocked by the interaction of the education development plan and the school organisation plan, which put so much of the decision-making process outside the scope and influence of the LEA.
<P>
<B>Ms Estelle Morris:</B> I hope that the Committee will forgive me if I answer only those questions relevant to clause 25, rather than answering the debate on grant-maintained status, testing and so on. It will be a short speech.
<P>
The school organisation plan is about ensuring both sufficient school places across a local authority area and that the pattern has some cohesion. It is not about raising standards or targets; it has nothing to do with the education development plan and there will be no conflict between the two. The education development plan deals with the responsibility of local authorities and schools to raise standards. Quite separate from that is the obligation and the need to plan for education provision in the local authority area.
<P>
In his amendments, the right hon. Member for Charnwood has moved from suggesting that the Secretary of State rather than the local adjudicator should have the power to decide, to saying that each school should decide for itself. That is nonsense. The hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough was right it would be a recipe for disaster and confusion, well used in previous Education Acts, to let each school decide whether it should open or close, whether it should expand or contract, whether it should have a nursery, and whether or not it should have a sixth form.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Charnwood seems to think that an acceptable alternative. He started the morning by saying that he did not think that what we had was very good. He spent the intermediate part of the morning saying that he did not think that what we proposed was much better. He ends the morning by saying, "Let's leave the planning of local places to every head teacher." It is nonsense.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> The Under-Secretary grossly distorts what I said. Her comments bear no resemblance to what I said. Will she deal with the serious issue? Is she saying if so, she is feeding my doubts that the views of head teachers and governors are of no importance in deciding the planning of school places? That is what she seems to be saying. That is equally absurd.
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> The right hon. Gentleman is being disingenuous. Of course we are not saying that. We spent a good part of the morning saying that heads would be represented in the school organisation committee. At the moment, in foundation schools and voluntary schools, it is not the head who makes decisions but the Secretary of State. This part of the Bill is about moving power from central Government to the local level and ensuring that all the key players are properly represented.
<P>
The notion that a school system need not plan its provisions across a geographical area is the biggest recipe for disaster that I have ever heard. We have got it right. We have moved away from the central principle. We do not want local schools making their own decisions about expansion and contraction and so on. We seek a happy medium. The local authority's obligation is to set out a school organisation plan giving crucial demographic and other information that the school organisation committee will need in order to make decisions. Those decisions will reflect a host of local views.
<P>
Clause 25 is essential to the Bill. It is the mechanism by which the sensible local provision of plans and patterns of schools within a local authority areas will take place.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I simply observe that after four weeks of debate, we now see the Government in their true colours no ifs, no buts; it is a collective planning process. The Under-Secretary barely paused in her tirade to recognise that heads and governors have a role in the development of the schools system, or to recognise the importance of schools as institutions.
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> This is an important point. We cannot allow anyone to spread the myth that we are not letting schools have a say in their future. Schools are there to raise standards. Head teachers will spend their time ensuring that they raise standards for the children whom they educate. For the first time, they will also have a say in the decision-making process of the school organisation committee. Under the Bill, we shall give more power and influence to heads than they now have.

<P>

<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> The Under-Secretary is spinning round on the subject so quickly that it is hard to see at any moment which way she is turning. First, she says that the planning process is essential.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jamieson:</B> The right hon. Gentleman has lost.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> The Government Whip declares that his party has won. Given the Government's majority, that is probably one of the more predictable conclusions.
<P>
First, the Under-Secretary says that a collective planning process is necessary so that institutions do not go off in different directions in conflict with one another. I then said that she leaves no role whatsover for individual institutions to develop their own ideas, and she leaps to her feet to assert that the Government think that the planning ambitions of individual schools are a key part of the process. It is all very well for the Under-Secretary to say that; it is not included in the Bill.
[Mr. Dorrell]
<P>
The Under-Secretary said that individual schools are represented on the school organisation committee, and I acknowledged that in my speech. Individual schools constitute one of five blocks, as is revealed in the document that the Government have issued. That is inadequate to allow individual schools to plan their own institutional development or to test different ideas.
<P>
As the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough recognised in his speech and as I hope that I have made explicit, I seek a process that welcomes and embraces a diversity of views from schools and reconciles them to ensure proper provision in an area. The Under-Secretary offers a collective view without taking adequate account of the different perspectives of schools. That is why I find the school organisation planning process unconvincing.

<B>The Chairman:</B> This is a convenient moment to remind the Committee that interventions are supposed to be just that. I address my remarks to all members of the Committee, including those on the Front Benches. If Members wish to catch my eye, it would be helpful if they would indicate that during the previous speech. That makes easier the job of the Chairman in allocating time to Members. In that way, all those who wish to speak will be heard.
<H4><center>Clause 26</center></H4>
<H4><center>Power to require committees or adjudicators for Wales</center></H4>
<P>
Amendment made: No. 151, in page 23, line 34, leave out "or VII". [Mr. Hain.]
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I would hate to think that the Under-Secretary of State for Wales had made the journey to the Committee but was to be denied an opportunity to set out his views. This is another example of Wales providing itself with the capacity to opt out of the provisions that we have spent the entire morning debating.
<P>
I hope that the Under-Secretary of State for Wales will set out his vision of how Welsh Ministers intend to use the powers accorded them by the clause. In particular, I should be interested to hear how he envisages the use of those powers by the Welsh Office in relation to the new Welsh assembly and what role the assembly will have in offering advice.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Peter Hain):</B> I cannot but rise to the bait, so I shall grace the Committee with a minute or two of my observations.
<P>
The hon. Member for Guildford treated us to his rich sense of humour which will stand him in good stead in the years of opposition that stretch ahead for him when he said that Conservative Governments had always believed strongly in devolving power. No one in Wales would agree with that; I am sure that the same is true for the regions of England.
<P>
In response to the question of the right hon. Member for Charnwood, the clause is about devolution. Exactly the same provisions in respect of school organisation committees, adjudication arrangements, and so on as exist for England may be introduced in Wales by the National Assembly for Wales. When the assembly comes into being in the summer of next year, the Secretary of State's powers will be devolved to the assembly; that is what the clause is about.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> If the Under-Secretary understands the need for devolution apparently the other Labour members of the Committee do not and agrees that it is right for the Welsh assembly to have such devolved powers, why should not it be right for county councils in England to have similar powers devolved to them?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hain:</B> Perhaps I should point out to the hon. Gentleman that county councils are not equivalent to the National Assembly for Wales and do not have powers in line with those currently devolved to the Welsh Office through the Secretary of State.
<P>
The National Assembly for Wales will probably start sitting at the end of May 1999. The proposals for school organisation committees and adjudication arrangements will come into force in September 1999. It is in line with the principle of devolution that we should allow the assembly to debate the necessary regulations and to consider whether minor changes might be appropriate for Wales. That is all that the clause provides.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> Can the Under-Secretary tell the Committee whether the regulations provided for under the clause must secure the consent of the Welsh assembly to come into force, or whether they can come into force following the advice of the Welsh assembly, whatever that advice proves to be?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hain:</B> It is our intention to enable the Secretary of State's powers, once they are taken over by the assembly, to be exercised by the assembly, and not to pre-empt the assembly. We could have pre-empted the assembly, but, given that, as I have already explained, even if we proceeded to implement the regulations in line with England, the assembly would come into being several months before we had done so, it appeared absolutely right in accordance with the principle of devolution to allow the assembly to be consulted and to take a decision.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> If I understood him correctly, the Minister said that the Government intend to accord to the assembly the powers allocated in the clause to the Secretary of State. If that is the Government's intention, why cannot we write that into the Bill?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hain:</B> The assembly does not exist yet. The people of Wales would have preferred that it had during the past 18 years, but I shall not go down that route.
<P>
The National Assembly for Wales as defined in the Government of Wales Bill is equivalent to the Secretary of State in respect of powers over secondary legislation and regulations, such as those covered by the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> Is the Under-Secretary therefore saying that under the terms of the Government of Wales Bill the power will automatically be vested in the assembly, rather than in the Secretary of State?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hain:</B> Yes, I am. That is precisely what the clause is designed to achieve. I am grateful that my hon. Friend the Minister of State has agreed with the principle of devolution, which the Conservative party never did in government, and clearly still does not, by allowing Wales to examine how the principles can be implemented by the National Assembly for Wales, which will be an elected body.
<P>
Clause 26, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 27</center></H4>
<H4><center>Proposals for establishment or alteration of community, foundation or voluntary school</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 55, in page 25, line 26, at end add
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"and any opinion expressed by the governing body.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I trust that we can deal with this uncontentious amendment quickly because I am sure that the Government will accept it in its entirety. The amendment relates to clause 27(12), which refers back to clause 27(1)(b) and a local authority making
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"prescribed alteration to a community school".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Subsection (12) refers to the regulations that may
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"be framed by reference to the opinion of the local education authority".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
However, clause 27(2)(b) refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the governing body of a foundation or voluntary school",<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
but the regulations referred to in subsection (12) will not be framed by reference to its opinions. The amendment would add the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"and any opinion expressed by the governing body".
<P>
I am sure that the omission was a mistake and that the Minister will support the amendment.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mrs. Browning:</B> I rise briefly to support the amendment. Clearly, it must be an omission, as the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough said. The governing body has a role and a view, which must be taken into account.
<P>
<B>The Minister for School Standards (Mr. Stephen Byers):</B> I can understand the concern expressed by both the hon. Members for Harrogate and Knaresborough and for Tiverton and Honiton because of the wording of the clause, which is not helpful in understanding the intention lying behind it.
<P>
Hon. Members need to cross-reference to section 35(2) of the Education Act 1996, which I am sure most members of the Committee have conveniently to hand. It is a technical point. Usually LEAs will need to publish proposals. However, there is one exception to that rule, relating to the condition and state of the existing school buildings, requiring the need to move to a new site. In those circumstances, the opinion of the local education authority is key, because it will be best placed to determine the position.
<P>
The clause reflects the provisions in section 35(2) of the 1996 Act that it is the opinion of the local education authority that is important. It is an unusual situation whereby, because of the condition and inadequate standard of the school building, it is necessary to relocate to another site. In those circumstances, it would not be the opinion of the individual governing body that is key. The LEA will be responsible for finding an alternative site.
<P>
It is for those reasons alone that we need to exercise the power. Having clarified the position and the relatively unusual circumstances in which the regulation is likely to be used, I hope that the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough will withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I am very grateful to the Minister. I am glad that civil servants are writing his briefs, rather than my hon. Friend the Member for Bath. I confess that I did not read the 1996 Act over the weekend [Hon. Members: "Oh!"] but I shall go away and do so now.
<P>
The Minister's response was inconclusive. To say that the governors cannot be involved when a school has to move to new buildings, is a tame response. However, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 27 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Gale. In a previous sitting, the Minister said that he intended to publish material ahead of the Committee's debates. I seek his assurance that when we come to discuss the admissions clauses 
<P>
