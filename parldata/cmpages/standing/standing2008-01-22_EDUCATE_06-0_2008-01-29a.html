							<b class="B">Mr.
Nick Gibb</b> (Bognor Regis and Littlehampton) (Con): Thank
you for coming today, it is very much appreciated. My first question is
to  the British Youth Council. Your briefing says that the
British Youth Council strongly opposes raising the participation age to
18 and the potential criminalisation of young people who choose not to
participate. Could you expand on those views
please?</div>
					<a name="08013010000011"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								James
Cathcart:
							</b>
						</i> Yes, it is fair to say that there is a
principled opposition to the raising of the age as an approach to
engaging 17 and 18-year-olds in education and training, particularly
because of the consequences if you do not participate&#151;being
taken through the sanctions that are outlined in the Bill. That is our
general position.</div>

							<a name="08013010000388"></a>Mr.
Gibb:
						</b> You did a survey of young people. Can you tell us
what the young people that you contacted said about this
proposal?</div>
					<a name="08013010000013"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								James
Cathcart:
							</b>
						</i> Yes, 45 per cent. of young people disagreed
or strongly disagreed with the proposal for the participation age to be
raised. That was a survey that we conducted through our website; in
fact, it is ongoing&#151;young people can continually contribute to
it and update it. It is something of a snapshot of their views, so it
caused us to look at other research that might support or back that up.
I refer you to the Learning and Skills Network research that took place
in March 2007, where as many as 71.3 per cent. were in favour of
retaining the right to choose to stay in education and training, as
opposed to not having the choice.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08013010000389"></a>Mr.
Gibb:
						</b> Can you account for the fact that the
Government&#146;s consultation process seems to point to different
figures? Their survey says that 66 per cent. were in favour of
compulsion. Do you think this is because the Government conducted their
own research on their own proposals? Are you sure your surveys are
right?</div>

								James
Cathcart:
							</b>
						</i> If you do surveys of different groups of
young people at different times, you might get a variety of opinions.
Of course, where you have a percentage who are in favour of something,
you will also have a minority against&#151;there will always be two
sides to the argument. It would be interesting if we knew a bit more
about the young people who are replying to the surveys. We do not have
the resources to go into that depth, but if the majority of the young
people who are replying to the surveys are already in education or
training, they might have a different view from those who are perhaps
more on the margins&#151;the 10 per cent. that we might want to
target and gauge. So I am not sure of the degree of sophistication of
the surveys that were done as part of the previous work on this
Bill.</div>

							<a name="08013010000390"></a>Mr.
Gibb:
						</b> Thank you. In your briefing about the youth market,
you say that it needs to be considered whether the proposals could lead
to more age discrimination and discourage employers from recruiting
young people. Could you say a bit more about that? Do you think the
Bill will damage the employability of 16 and
17-year-olds?</div>

						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								James
Cathcart:

						</i> I think it could discriminate against them.
I think it is an area where we can forecast or project that it could.
If employers, for example, feel obliged to recruit a particular age
group, there is a possibility that they will then just seek to recruit
people who are over 18 or 19, rather than take the risk of having
unwilling or unable young people who would have to be
released&#151;whether it is one day a week&#151;to take part in
that
training.</div>

Minister for Schools and Learners (Jim Knight):
						</b> Thank you
all for coming. The first question is informed by the British Youth
Council&#146;s evidence but I think it will be a question to all
three of you. I agree with what is said in this evidence&#151;that
choice is really important for young people, as is voice for young
people. Where I part company is in thinking that having the choice to
do nothing is a good choice. Could you comment on whether you think
young people should be allowed to choose to do
nothing?</div>

						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								James
Cathcart:
							</b>
						</i> I think all of us have that choice at any
age. There may be circumstances in employment where, because of
bullying or mental health or whatever, we have the ability to hand our
notice in and leave our level of occupation. What is important is what
is done with the choice&#151;if the choice is education, work plus
training or training. Is there a fourth choice? That does not
necessarily need to be nothing, but it might be an opportunity for
young people to do other constructive activities that have been so
stimulated&#151;volunteering, for example. If the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column193" />Column number: 193</div>choices are the first three or a sanction, I think that is where it
feels rather limiting. I know that, indeed, in a lot of the research
done prior to the Bill, many other options are explored and arguments
put on both side&#151;indeed there are considerable measures to
stimulate young people to consider other alternatives. But it is the
net result of there only being four choices, and the fourth one
attracting a sanction, that rather prompts our opposition to
that.</div>

								Nigel
Haynes:
							</b>
						</i> I think I have to set to set the scene by
predicating that we work with the NEET group at the farthest
end&#151;we get referrals from the Prince&#146;s Trust. So it is
those in deep need that we are working with, and across a whole
cross-section of issues, from crime, homelessness, drug addiction,
youth truancy&#151;the lot. So our work spans those.</div>
					<a name="08013010000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, on choice, I think
choice has to have consequence, and as far as most of our young people
in the Green Paper surveys are concerned, they do believe that if there
is a degree of compulsion, for some that is going to be appropriate. I
think the important thing for the Committee to look at and understand
is that, if you have a number of choices, then they are
alternatives.</div>
					<a name="08013010000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of
the things we always ask is: what evidence is there that compulsion has
an effect? With the young people we deal with, the fact that they come
because they want to, and stay because they want to, is a stronger
motivation for change. When you look at the choices, particularly with
our group of young people, you have to think about what support
measures are required to get them to enter. A lot of them are not going
to go near it&#151;they have walked away from institutionalised
provision and there is nothing to say, with what you have on the table,
that they are necessarily going to engage with this proposal.</div>
					<a name="08013010000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">You need to think, what are the
gateways that lead into this particular process? If you think about
that for the NEET group&#151;for our lot&#151;I think you will say,
OK, support is appropriate, some diagnostic systems are there, which
have been raised by other people before us, and therefore you need to
get local authorities to sort out how that is going to happen. One of
things missing from the Bill is that there is no compulsion, if that is
the right word, for local authorities to engage with the voluntary
sector. We are dealing with the hardest to reach in this
instance.</div>

Knight:
						</b> Thank you. James, you said there should be other
options such as volunteering and support. If those were
there&#151;the Bill does not rule them out and indeed I have talked
about the importance of both those things&#151;does that mean that
you would come closer to supporting a duty to
participate?</div>

								James
Cathcart:
							</b>
						</i> The British Youth Council is a young
person-led organisation and we like to refer back to the young people
in developing our policies and views, but I know that the formation of
those views has been influenced by the tone or the general approach of
not having as many choices. If, in the procession of the Bill,
amendments were to come in that mitigated the circumstances and offered
alternatives, as indeed this process is designed to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column194" />Column number: 194</div>do, we would be happy to engage in that way and reconsider our position.
However, I would be a little wary of making that commitment without
referring back to my constituency, as it
were.</div>

							<a name="08013010000395"></a>Jim
Knight:
						</b> A final supplementary, before I finish with Nigel,
is on the research. Clearly your research had a slightly different
answer from the Government&#146;s research. Do you agree that it has
been quite difficult within the nature of the public debate to
differentiate a raising of the school leaving age, which a lot of the
media and some people believed we were proposing, and the reality of
what we are proposing around a duty to participate? Under our proposal,
leaving school at 16 and going to work, for example, as long as you do
280 hours of training, is one of the options that would be available to
young people. Do you think that might have corrected some confusion and
explained some of the difference
perhaps?</div>

						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								James
Cathcart:
							</b>
						</i> It has been clear to me, in reading how the
Bill has been summarised and presented. I think that is how it has been
consequently presented through other avenues, and young people may have
got the wrong impression. In our processes we have been careful to
explain the distinction between the word &#147;school&#148; and
being in employment and coming back one day a week to train. The
principle of continuing to have education and training opportunities,
particularly in the early days of your working career, is not something
the British Youth Council is opposing. It is the nature and the context
in which it is being presented in this Bill. Perhaps others have
presented it in a way you would not have welcomed. There is a lot to be
done and my understanding is that the Bill is looking for a cultural
change in public attitudes, but I think the way to get a change in
public attitudes, especially among young people, is not to include the
sanction element. Perhaps that has been focused on in a way that does
not suit your ends and
desires.</div>

Haynes:

						</i> I suppose we get round it in quite a subtle
way, in that there has to be some choice. If you are dealing with
post-sentencing commitment, and depending what the conviction is, a
young person coming to us through a YOT or from a YIP will have two or
three
choices.</div>

					<a name="08013010000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">Such a young

nature of their commitment is taken a bit into account. That said, when
we get them&#151;particularly with one or two of the projects in
high-density, high-crime areas&#151;they have proved to be remarkably
effective in terms of the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column195" />Column number: 195</div>move-on and progression for young people. However, I do not think that
they look at it as mandatory, compulsory attendance, because they know
that they can leave it at any time. Therefore, they do not have to stay
if they do not want to. The trick in the book with us is to engage the
want-to, and to get the commitment, and for them to realise that they
have to change. When that happens, then you get big
progressions.</div>

circumstances, unwillingness or inability, has led to them being
disengaged from society and the system, which means that another
sanction is not a deterrent to them not wanting to participate in the
first place. I know, having read the Bill, that it refers to the
sanctions and to compulsion being a last resort; there are lots of
measures and lots of other resources being put in there. But for some
young people&#151;it may be a minority who are already on the margin,
and perhaps when we have got past the 90 per cent. that group may get
smaller and smaller&#151;the deterrent principle will not have an
effect on them, perhaps in the same way that the criminal justice
system does not continue to have an impact.</div>
					<a name="08013010000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">To follow on from that, if they
then felt obliged to re-engage with the system, either because of the
deterrent or a fine or whatever, would they be willing and beneficial
participants in the education in which they subsequently felt obliged
to
engage?</div>

forget that quite a lot of them have walked away from institutionalised
provisions in one way or another, and they really could not give a
damn. The secret is getting the commitment&#151;the first step is to
get them to want to do it voluntarily&#151;and then sustaining that
commitment by making them realise that there are options.</div>
					<a name="08013010000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the overall sense of the
Bill, there are options and pathways for them to take that I think are
opening up more than they were previously. It is how you get them to
that point that is important. A large number of those coming from pupil
referral units are long-term, persistent truants or absentees. The
majority of young men between the ages of 14 and 16 are not going to go
back into secondary education. What we have discovered really works is
that, if you can open an 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column196" />Column number: 196</div>interest, they will go into further education. There is a range of
courses could stimulate them to think about what they might want to
do&#151;or could do.</div>
					<a name="08013010000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">If you have a cohort of young
people who have no qualifications and a long record, getting them back
to realise that they are of some value in the process is one of the
important parts of the process. If you can spin the wheel and get the
commitment to start, they will do it on their own; but you are not
going to get 100 per cent. with
that.</div>

education and training. From your knowledge of this diverse group of
youngsters, some of whom obviously have severe needs, do you think that
it would be desirable to have a wider range of options for them, even

do not do something about those pathways and you do not have the
provision to build them, with our cohort, you will have a lot of

re-engage, and those can prove successful if they are provided at older
ages for young people. The issue is not the extra number of choices and
the ladders, but the consequences if you do not participate. There are
lots of carrots, but the issue is the stick at the back when you are
leading the horse to water. If somebody is thirsty when they get there,
they will drink, and if you have lots of different ways to get there,
that is good. It is the stick at the back that is the

of reasonable excuse. You have to think quite carefully about what
categories of people you will have to give more support to. If you look
at the number of mental health cases, you will see that we have
increased engagement with them by 35 per cent. over the last year.
Quite a few of those people will not be in a position to understand the
consequences of choice. What, therefore, is a reasonable excuse? Some
people have talked about carers, but there are other categories of
people, such as those coming out of drug dependency, where they are
still on methadone on scrip. That is one of the things that you will

that constitutes education, training or volunteering that could lead to

work exclusively with under-16s. We work with 13 to 25, and 16 in inner
cities. The process that we use is engagement through voluntary aspects
and then through an access process that gets people to understand the
frameworks, boundaries and disciplines within which we work. That
progresses to the follow-on aspect of the programme, which offers a
range of activities that they can select, in which we offer
qualifications that we deliver for the Financial Services Authority, in
how to deal with money. We look at basic skills in basic skills
programmes, and we offer City and Guilds and ASDAN, which is an
equivalent, nationally recognised qualification.</div>
					<a name="08013010000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">The programme is deliberately
split into the 16-minuses, for whom the primary aim is to get them back
into education, and the 16-pluses, for whom the primary aim has to be
to get them into employment. The fact that it is sometimes a long way
off means that sometimes more support and progression is needed.
Everybody has an individual action plan in which their goals are
identified towards their progression point, which is moving on into
employment or
education.</div>

Williams</b> (Bristol, West) (LD): I would like to ask a
couple of questions of Mr. Haynes. I have worked quite
closely with Fairbridge in Bristol over the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column200" />Column number: 200</div>past two and a half years, presenting certificates and being on the
ship. Some of the people in Bristol cooked lunch for me, so I am a
great admirer of what you
do.</div>
					<a name="08013010000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have met many of
the young people who have gone through the programme recently. Most are
in their late teens or early 20s and have chosen to be there. It
strikes me that, in order for them to stay there, there must be a great
deal of investment and incentivisation by outdoor pursuits courses and
others to make learning and training fun, so that they want to be
there. That clearly cannot happen across the NEET group, because it
would require a large amount of resources. Therefore, not everyone can
offer what Fairbridge offers at present, if it were compulsory for
NEETs to participate in training. Would you agree with
that?</div>
					<a name="08013010000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Nigel
Haynes:
							</b>
						</i> Yes and no. To a certain degree, you have to
start by looking at the NEETs base and coming up with a pretty good
definition of who is in the deep NEETs spectrum&#151;the persistent
offender, the drug user and so on&#151;and what you are going to do
about it. The guys you met, if you met them on the first day, will be
very different from the guys you met subsequently. You are right to say
that the programme is cost-intensive. We work on a one-to-four basis,
and keeping the participants interested and engaged is
important.</div>
					<a name="08013010000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">But I put
it to you, what are the options? If you make it compulsory, they will
not turn up anyway, so you will be dealing with a problem on the
street. The evidence from our group that compulsion works is not very
strong at present, but the evidence for getting them to want to
participate is very strong. This will not apply to everybody. As I
started, where I am coming from, are those in deep NEET&#151;the
exclusion bracket for which you must make some provision. It will not
apply to everybody, and I think that compulsion works in the majority
of cases if there are interesting
courses.</div>
					<a name="08013010000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">May I say one
more thing? I totally agree with what Mr. Knight said about
the publicity surrounding the programme. A lot of it has been about
extended school, not extended opportunity for learning, or tracks into
employment. A bit has been missing in the communication, in the fact
that, for the majority of people&#151;not all of them&#151;you are
opening up something that has not existed before. We know that 
16 to 18-year-olds have always been difficult because they are out of

						</i> Yes, there is. Lobbing
responsibility&#151;if I may put it crudely&#151;at the local
education authority to get sorted is not necessarily the answer. You
must form proper partnerships at local level where there is a degree of
understanding of the need in the local area, and therefore a degree of
identification of the appropriate pathway. That is why the Bill needs
to include the partnership between local education and the voluntary
sector to make that happen. As other people have said, in some local
authorities it is going well; in others it is not. With the whole
business of children&#146;s trust and trying to bring that together
with Connexions fading out&#151;they were the signposts or the yellow
pages of direction&#151;part of that is being missed. If we can
retain that diagnostic and data information centralisation, young
people will know where to go to get that
information.</div>

35 per cent. of the total that we are engaged with. The needs basis is
sometimes exactly the same across the issues, but we are finding that
we are getting a better response from female progressions after the
time of motivation than we are with males. One thing is stabilisation.
All the programmes need time for young people to stabilise their
chaotic life. In the main, of those that we are dealing with the lives
of males are more chaotic than females. If you do not stabilise, you do

the impact and consequences of compulsion? One of the interesting
things from this morning&#146;s evidence from the principals of
colleges and last week from the Association of Directors of Social

felt that compulsion had a place but that it was almost the thing you
kept in your back pocket and hoped never to need to use.</div>

of the relationship and the conversation that you have with the young
person that is important; that dialogue and commitment, engagement
rather than compulsion, would lead to success. Each felt capable of
running projects that had that dialogue, had that adult relationship,
but also had the adult consequences of failing to meet expectations and
requirements. Can you see how that can work? Can you recognise their
perspective on why compulsion is a useful thing to have in your back
pocket?</div>

people offering the opportunity are not necessarily the same as those
holding the stick. If you are obliged to attend a course because it is
part of a probation order then the compulsory element is through the
court system. The people providing the course come from a different
organisation, the voluntary sector offering something
beneficial.</div>

this context, the education, training and employment are offered and
implemented by the local authority or government, who is offering the

the parent who offers the opportunity but also has the potential
sanction. It is the same person. We need to look at the nature of who
is holding those two elements. That has an impact on the person on the

You also have to consider someone coming back from a long period of

absolutely right that the NFER was unable to find direct evidence of

for that, of course, is that those countries that have introduced

recently. We have therefore yet to see evidence of what that change
does to attainment and qualification

set out quite fully in its report was a set of pieces of indirect
evidence about places that had made changes that had certainly had a
big impact on participation, even if that impact is not yet visible in

analogous situations in this country, and gave us some clear pointers
about the measures that have been effective and those that have been
less effective in other countries that have chosen to pursue a policy
of this sort. It was a piece of work in which some things were
impossible to tell, because it was too early, but there were also some
important pointers about how one might go about designing the policy
and implementing it effectively.</div>

						</i> All the previous changes to participation in
education have been about the school leaving age, so, yes, this is
fundamentally a different proposition. I think that there are some
pretty clear reasons for saying that it should be different, given the
variety of routes that are, and should be, available post-16.
Therefore, there is not an absolutely direct read-across, and I think
that that is something that the NFER quite rightly points to. There are
some very interesting studies of the impact on attainment when changes
to participation have been made. The most recent was at the end of the
1990s, when the decision was made to stop allowing people to leave
before the end of the GCSE period. There is a very detailed and
thorough economic analysis of what happened to achievement rates as a
result, which shows a strongly positive correlation; those who stayed
on were indeed more likely to achieve as a result of doing
so.</div>
					<a name="08013010000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">I absolutely
accept that that is a different situation, but it is the best analogy
that we have available at the moment. On the rates of return to
qualifications, it is true that they vary greatly between
qualifications, but there are vocational qualifications with strongly
positive rates of return; RSA diplomas for women have a plus 17 per
cent. rate of return and BTEC qualifications for men over 20 per cent.

that figure? We need to shift the culture, and we think that
introducing a duty to participate starts to do so. If we introduce a
duty to participate, but someone fails to deliver on that duty and
nothing happens, that does not bear scrutiny. There is some evidence
that creating such a duty has a negligible effect on participation, so
we have to introduce a sanction, and introduce enforcement on top of
compulsion.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column207" />Column number: 207</div>
					<a name="08013010000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have therefore introduced a
civil procedure, which is set out in the Bill. If that procedure does
not work and someone is determined not to participate and not to pay
the fixed penalty following the civil procedure, do we just give up or
do we try a little harder to enforce it? That is why we have gone for
the criminalisation option as the end of the road, but we have made it
clear that we want to go through the youth court, using the new youth
referral orders for which Parliament is currently legislating. We have
said that we do not want a fine above
&#163;200.</div>
					<a name="08013010000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
nature of the referral orders through the youth court means that any
criminal record will be wiped out, if people are under 18, two and a
half years after they have committed the offence, which is not a
recordable offence. If they apply for employment, the offence will not
be recorded on the national criminal database, and they do not have to
disclose it. The latest that someone would still have that on their
record would be at the age of 21. That is a reasonable approach that
shows the seriousness of the measure and provides some momentum, which
is important for young people. However, it is more important for those
of us who are making decisions and are responsible in the public sector
to ensure that the right support and the right choices are available
and that we engage young people so that they are not taken down the
enforcement route. As John Freeman from the Association of Directors of
Children&#146;s Services told us last week, he has available to him a
range of enforcement options that he does not use, but the fact that he
has them changes the nature of the conversation. That is the sort of
outcome that we want from a raft of procedures along the continuum,
ending with criminalisation and a &#163;200
fine.</div>

suitable provision for the young person not being available, such as
lack of entry to informal employment training appropriate for someone

with other education Acts, which means that the powers in sections 496

intervene. Where a local authority fails to comply with a duty, it can
be directed by the Secretary of State. As the Minister said, there is

in your group on how we engage young people who, as early as 11, 12 or
13, show clear signs of being switched off conventional academic
education.</div>

						</i> Yes, this is part of that important reasoning
for it being 2013 and not earlier. As the Minister said, those young
people&#151;the children now in year 6 who will make a transition to
secondary education this autumn&#151;will be the first to be taught
under the new secondary curriculum.</div>
					<a name="08013010000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">The point of the new secondary
curriculum is precisely to give schools more scope to tailor the
education that they offer to the specific needs of the young people in
front of them. For example, if they have disproportionately many young
people in their intake that fell behind at primary school, they have
more space to help those young people to catch up 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column213" />Column number: 213</div>during the course of key stage 3, particularly in the key subjects of
English and maths, and also to have a more flexible learning experience
in key stage 3.</div>
					<a name="08013010000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">Then, of
course, in key stage 4 and onwards, that group of young people will be
the first to have access to the full range of diplomas, which becomes a
national entitlement from 2013. They will therefore be given
opportunities to choose the new diplomas, and they will have
opportunities to choose GCSE. We are also developing the new foundation
learning tier, a more coherent body of qualifications and units
designed for young people who may have fallen behind and need a better
route to help them re-engage and catch up. If you take all those things
together&#151;the greater flexibility in key stage 3 and the much
wider range of options in key stage 4&#151;the Bill is trying to say
to the system, &#147;Actually, you have got to serve 100 per cent. of
the young people in this group sufficiently well every single day
between now and 2013 so that on 1 September 2013, when they are
required to participate post-16, not only will they have the offer they
need on that day, but they will have been well enough engaged on every
day of their lives up until then so that they want to participate and
have had a better experience.&#148; Those who do not have that now
will get it through this set of measures. That is the ambition of this
set of reforms.</div>

taught for the first time in September, will give schools that greater
flexibility. Instead of a long list of things that you must get through
and ploughing through the content in key stage 3, schools will have
much greater scope to shape the curriculum to the needs of the young
people in front of them. That is an important part of this change. Of
course, already, the requirements of the key stage 4 curriculum take up
only 50 per cent. of the time in key stage 4, so, taken together, that
gives schools much more flexibility.</div>

are you convinced that the requirements that the Bill places on

have had another look at the territory. The decisions were made by my
predecessor at a time when officials consulted the ISC, which was when
the ISC and the Independent Schools Inspectorate were part of the same
body. In answer to my question, Jonathan Shephard said that the two had
separated and were separate legal bodies, but the separation occurred
only on 1 January, so when the conversations took place, they were part
of the same body. The conversations with Ofsted also took place at that
point. Although the measure will make a negligible difference for
members of the ISC&#151;the latest figures show that although that
number was about 50 per cent., it has just tipped over, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column214" />Column number: 214</div>and now the majority are not members of the ISC and the independent
sector&#151;for the others it can make a significant difference by
reducing regulation. For us, as a Department, it will save money, and

Connexions client information system, which the National Audit Office
and the Prime Minister&#146;s delivery unit have recently assessed
and found to be robust. Obviously, we will need to make some changes
over the intervening five years, but, in essence, as we heard from
Connexions this morning, the system is sound. It is operated by the
40-odd sub-regional Connexions services, and it will be transferred to
the 150 local authorities, subject to the Bill going through. As we
heard this morning from Connexions, when learners reach the age of 13,
the very basic data are migrated from schools to the Connexions
database, and then every interaction that happens with schools,
colleges and training providers is recorded on the CCIS, which allows
that tracking to take place, and the local authority or the local

able to do that
work.</div>

basis of presumed parental consent, so parents can not give consent for
it to happen, but that is just the very basic data. From then on in,
the young person has to give active consent for the data to be shared
with other agencies. That is what happens at the moment and when it

that if a young person is excluded from provision, it is then a duty on

the agencies to provide support to re-engage that young person in
education. There would still be a requirement&#151;in this Bill, of
course, it is the Learning and Skills Council who would have the
responsibility, though we have announced that in future that
responsibility will transfer to local authorities&#151;to make sure
there is suitable provision in place. The full range of opportunities
still needs to be provided to that young person. It would not be
possible, though, to enforce the duty&#151;this is set out in the
provisions about initial steps&#151;in clause 39 of the Bill. It is
not possible to go to an enforcement stage until the local authority is
satisfied that the full range of support has been provided. The
independent panel, in reviewing whether or not an attendance notice
could be issued, would have to review both whether a suitable place had
been offered to the young person and whether sufficient support had
been given to make sure that young person had appropriate opportunities
to re-engage. So the message of the Bill is that it is not good enough
for the system to simply give up on a young person who has been
excluded; the system still has to find a way of supporting that young
person back into learning and making sure they find opportunities to
attend and
participate.</div>

when they are advised under the improved information advice and

October, they are offered some choice in respect of the range of
provision. Just as Nigel Haynes from Fairbridge was setting out earlier
on, there is compulsion for people to do something, but they have a
choice about what they do, so they will more actively want to be there.

is going into that. We have hugely increased the amount of resource
that we put into the school system. There is also the resource that we
have already committed in respect of offering more engaging options
post-16, to get to our 90 per cent. target. There are also those
resources that we talked about in the exchange with David Laws, which
are specifically intended to get us from 90 per cent. to 100 per cent.

						</b> May I ask about the information sharing provisions
of the Bill? In recent months, CDs with the records of 25 million
people were lost by Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs, there was
the Department for Transport fiasco, and the Army lost the details of
all the people who inquired about joining. The Bill has many clauses
requiring information to be  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column219" />Column number: 219</div>supplied. In particular, clause 16 states that all
the bodies listed can be asked to supply information about a young
person to the local authority. The list includes another local
authority, the Learning and Skills Council, a primary care trust, a
strategic health authority, a chief officer of police, a local
probation board and a youth offending team. Clause 15 deals with all
the social security information. Are you confident that none of that
data washing around the system will go
missing?</div>

currently in the legislation in relation to Connexions. To that extent,
I am happy with the way they are framed, in that we have not recorded
any significant problems with data sharing between those bodies and
Connexions to date. The national data for Connexions are anonymised and
are there to give people like you in Parliament and others the

However, in response to your question, given that such

Wolf was worried about the effects that the legislation would have on
the ability of 16 and 17-year-olds to get work. She said that the
burdens were not confined just to a preliminary conversation. She said
it was also the case that one could be served with an enforcement or
penalty notice. The CBI is in favour of the proposals but is also
worried about them. It said that firms offering valuable work
opportunities will be discouraged by duties to police participation,
and by financial penalties for falling foul of the law. Giving

duty in respect of initial arrangements in clause 24, but that is
really about that initial conversation and being satisfied, as an
employer, that the young person is going to fulfil their duty. That
might involve producing a letter from a college to say that they are
enrolled on a course, for example; that duty is then fulfilled. Clause
25&#151;the only other clause where enforcement can be taken
according to clause 27&#151;concerns a situation where an employee
comes forward and says, &#147;I&#146;ve changed my arrangements
from those I initially set out when I commenced employment with
you.&#148; That is a conversation about whether or not that
interferes unreasonably with the operation of the business, or whether

employment practices, that even a small business can accommodate. As

natural extension of where we have been going with the simplification
of inspection and reducing the burdens on institutions&#151;85 per

to deal with both Ofsted and the Department. But it is wrong to say
that we regulate maintained schools; local authorities regulate
maintained schools and the Education and Inspections Act 2006 gave
local authorities additional powers to manage that regulation, from
adding extra governors to taking back delegation and interim executive
boards. The Secretary of State has some reserve powers, but they are
used in very limited circumstances and substantiate the role of

the model. And we are not as centralist as some people would like to

Griffith</b> (Llanelli) (Lab): I would like to return to the
issue of employers and qualifications, which was touched upon this
morning. Quite clearly, there is a fabulous opportunity for young
people to take up the opportunities with employers and one would want
to see that used as much as possible to really broaden out the choice
that they have.</div>
					<a name="08013010000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">You can
understand that some of the national companies, with well known names,
can perhaps get economies of scale by providing national
qualifications, but some companies may take on somebody only once every
two or three years, in a particular interest maybe. Now, how are we
going to keep an eye on all of those qualifications and ensure that
they are
valid?</div>
					<a name="08013010000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Jim
Knight:
							</b>
						</i> It is important that we maximise the
opportunities for employers to accredit their training as part of the
options that are available to young people. The Qualifications and
Curriculum Authority is currently piloting a number of different ways
in which employers and providers can engage with the national
qualifications scheme system, and the reporting around
McDonald&#146;s and Flybe and others yesterday reflects that. So,
employers could have their training recognised as vocational
qualifications; employers could have their training recognised as
individual units in vocational qualifications offered by awarding
bodies, rather than them being awarding bodies themselves&#151;which
was the former option&#151;or, for the last option, employers can
choose to be recognised as awarding bodies in order to accredit their
own training. Those are broadly the three options that we are looking
at.</div>
					<a name="08013010000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think the Bill
will simplify the process, particularly where an employer wishes to
become an awarding body&#151;which works particularly well for the
larger ones. But I think their supply chain can also benefit from that.
In my constituency, for example, we have a number of engineering
companies that are part of the supply chain to AgustaWestland in David
Law&#146;s constituency. If they were to become their own awarding
body as a large company, and were able to offer qualifications to their
supply chain, so that their supply chain&#146;s skills training is
improved, that is the kind of thing that I am sure companies such as
that would really value. For them, with very high-quality engineering
for the aerospace industry, skills are absolutely crucial. What they
are looking at down their supply chain, more than anything else, is the
quality of the work&#151;certainly as much as
price.</div>

the qualifications framework&#151;and the introduction of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column222" />Column number: 222</div>a new credit and qualifications framework&#151;means that it will be
much more possible for a range of different awarding bodies to supply
recognised units and qualifications from a national framework. And if
they do that, there will be as much assurance about the quality of
those units, whether actually provided by an employer as an awarding
body, or whether the training is provided by the employer and
accredited by an external awarding body. That will have as much
validity in the national framework&#151;and be just as transferable
between different employers and different circumstances, as would be
the case for any other
qualification.</div>

have said that there were some concerns about some of the NVQs when we
did the economic analysis, and clearly we are mindful of what people
like Alison Wolf have said about that. We do not agree with her on a
number of things, but we must make sure that the qualifications reflect
skills and that we value skills. That is precisely why we are
encouraging employers to have their own training accredited, because
employers know very well what skills they need. So, if we can accredit
the training that provides those skills, we are absolutely confident

						</i> First, regarding the figures, I would just
say to you, Mr. Heald, that 60,000 pupils did not achieve
level 1 in English and maths; that is 9.2 per cent. That is level 1 in
terms of an NVQ. However, you must look at what you can do below that
level anyway, so, look at 11-year-olds. 93 per cent. of 11-year-olds
achieved at least a level 3 in English and maths in 2007. That means
that they can read a range of texts 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column223" />Column number: 223</div>accurately and independently and that their writing is organised,
legible and clear. Level 1 is what Leitch said is required to enter the
world of work, so that is 60,000, or 9.2 per cent., who do not reach
that point.</div>
					<a name="08013010000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">Obviously, we must do better
for those young people and what this legislation will do is to create
the environment whereby they are given a second chance. We are creating
a better range of provisions to engage those young people to come back
and to ensure that they reach at least level 1 in their literacy and
numeracy. However, do not dismiss the achievement of those students who
just get to level 3, which is a national curriculum level, at the age
of
11.</div>

there are, of course, huge inconsistencies in funding for local

process of consulting on a new funding formula for
schools&#151;obviously up until the age at which compulsory schooling
ends. We will set out our intention there to explore 14-to-19 funding
as an option at that point. So we will set out the beginnings of a
process that will help us to arrive at a new system to start from
2011-12, when the current funding settlement completes. We accept that
the spend-plus methodology that we have used to date can be improved to
make it fairer. However, in the end we completely believe that it is
right to reflect need in our funding allocations, as well as the
ability to recruit where recruitment costs are greater and therefore
you have to pay people more money. It is a complicated issue, as
everyone here who is trying to understand it will appreciate, but we
are confident that what we have got is relatively fair. For the next

cent. of 16-year-olds and 31 per cent. of 17-year-olds. It is a
cultural problem to re-engage them. In transport terms, because of what
are doing on 14 to 19, we will, by necessity, create the service that
is needed to get those young people to the provision or, in some cases,
get the provision to them&#151;we are considering the use of

will pay lower fees&#151;they will not have to be regulated as much,
because they are performing better. The normally smaller schools that
are underperforming and not members of the ISC might have to pay higher
fees because they need more regulation. That is quite an incentive to
them to improve their act. The impact assessment also states that we
will allow them to spread their payments, which should make life a

encouraging the momentum in what began as modern apprenticeships, a
whole different range of employers and sectors have come into the story
that is apprenticeships. In some of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column225" />Column number: 225</div>the more traditional areas, such as engineering, there are a number of
advanced level 3 apprenticeships, but it is right to say that in newer
areas like retail, there are a large share of level 2 apprenticeships.
It is a journey, depending on where the young person starts, but it is
broadly for that reason that there has been a reduction in the last
period.</div>

						</b> You say in your latest contribution to the debate,
in this new paper, that you want less level 2 and more level 3. You
said that the provision between level 2 and level 4 would be adjusted
to suit increased employer demand for advanced apprenticeships. We are
already travelling in one direction, but we are now going to travel in
another. May I take that on a little further, and ask how many of the
employers involved in apprenticeships are training providers&#151;in
other words, their principal or sole business is the provision of
training?</div>

						</b> I have looked at this quite closely&#151;I am
going to bring John in here, who has previous experience of inspecting
apprenticeships&#151;but I am advised that it is a small proportion
of the employers; I think the number was around 1,000.</div>
					<a name="08013010000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">I indicated
this morning that the important thing that we are getting, and
certainly what you have been trying to get at in your penetrating
questions and scrutiny on apprenticeships, is of course that young
people must be engaged in work-based training. It has always been the
case that the employer is in partnership with a training provider.
Within that, a small proportion of training providers are offering
apprenticeships; and there will be programme apprenticeships in which
young people are largely engaged solely with a training
provider.</div>
					<a name="08013010000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Committee has already taken evidence from the likes of the
Prince&#146;s Trust, Barnardo&#146;s and others, who see a real
need for programme-led apprenticeships for young people who are not
ready to take up an apprenticeship but who need to be on a journey to
get there. For those young people, training providers are providing
them with what are called programme-led apprenticeships.</div>
					<a name="08013010000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">We said in the review that we
want to look closely at the definition of an apprenticeship, and
clearly the definition of an apprenticeship we have indicated is about
being engaged with an employer. The contract may well be with the
training provider, because it is up to the employer, frankly, whether
he wants to be engaged in the administration of the
apprenticeship.</div>
					<a name="08013010000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">Indeed, I
know that you have also called for group associations; by definition
those group associations for smaller employers are in the business of
administration, and by definition many employers do not want to be in
that, as it is not the mainstay of their business. I am indicating that
we should not confuse programme-led apprenticeships with
apprenticeships per se.</div>

Landeryou:

						</i> I simply add that many employers prefer to
work through an intermediary rather than contract directly with the
Learning and Skills Council. However, the choice of which intermediary
is used is entirely theirs; after all, the apprentice, who is an
employee, belongs to them. If they are not satisfied with the service
that they get from that intermediary, they can go elsewhere.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column226" />Column number: 226</div>
					<a name="08013010000281"></a><div class="hs_Para">I suspect that what might be
behind the question is whether apprentices are employed by training
providers as proxies, rather than by normal enterprises functioning in
the economy. That, I assure you, is not the case. The training provider
acts as an intermediary only in the provision of training services.
They do not act as the employer of the apprentice in the sense in which
the system operates. As the Minister says, I have considerable
experience of looking at the system at first hand through various
inspection regimes over the last six or seven
years.</div>

in year 11 in schools, ONS statistics suggest that about 2.43 per cent.
of young people are absentees without authorisation. Have you modelled
what that number will be once the participation age is raised to 18?

						</i> We have worked closely with DCSF colleagues on
this, I have certainly worked closely with Jim Knight, and our
officials are in constant dialogue. First, Jim indicated that there is
a challenge to the use of those statistics, because in that number, it
is important not to include young people whose parents have taken them
out of school on holiday, and for a range of other reasons. They should
be in school, but they are not truants in the classic sense of the
word.</div>
					<a name="08013010000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, on
capacity, we must acknowledge that there has been massive capital
investment in further education over the past decade, and all the
principals who were here and the associations have confirmed that
capital investment. When it was put to them, can we deal with this,
they all said yes, because they all said, &#147;We are in the
business of doing this anyway, actually.&#148; Compulsion is about
galvanising a response, but FE is already doing this anyway.</div>
					<a name="08013010000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is another part of the
narrative, which we should not miss out although it is not directly in
the Bill. It is Train to Gain, which is the story of upskilling our
adult population through employees already in companies, and
understanding that we are asking many FE colleges to engage in activity
beyond their institutions. That feature also came up when the
principals gave evidence, so there is capacity, largely because
institutions are going into the workplace to deliver services, not
delivering them in the classic classroom way that they have done in the
past.</div>

stage of compulsion is introduced for 17-year-olds, the aspiration is
that the diplomas will be an entitlement nationally, but alongside
that, the Government have pledged that each 17-year-old, or younger,
who wants an apprenticeship will be entitled to that, too. Is that
deliverable? The state has a role in delivering diplomas, but employers
have a role in delivering apprenticeships, so you cannot necessarily 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column227" />Column number: 227</div>guarantee that employers will co-operate with that national

published a review yesterday, that the employers must be there to offer
the apprenticeships. We want to reform the system to incentivise
employers further so that the apprenticeships are there. The programme
obviously has caveats, and we are not departing from the idea that an
apprenticeship is employer-led; in the end, this is to meet genuine
skills needs in the country.</div>
					<a name="08013010000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">By definition, we must be in
the business of ensuring that there is a service that employers want.
Yesterday, in essence, the report said that we need a national service
that is properly branded and identified, more flexibility on
frameworks, to consider direct payments to larger employers so that
they over-train and train more apprentices, group training
associations, differentials for women and ethnic minorities, and a
range of things, including the matching service, to ensure that
employers come forward and we can meet our ambition. However, if we are
to deliver that ambition, the Government must be in partnership with
our colleagues in the CBI and sector skills councils if we are to
deliver

feeling that there is a gap in respect of the sense of urgency

that is currently missing out on education and skills. How do you see
yourself engaging with those organisations in the intervening
years&#151;you have until 2013&#151;and opening a dialogue with the
education providers, the voluntary sector and, perhaps more
importantly, with the local authorities, which might have talked with
the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory, but have not
engaged with the needs and experiences of the Department for Education

must have a field force in localities and regions. We recognise that
that element has, perhaps, been missing from how we have driven
apprenticeships in the
past.</div>
					<a name="08013010000300"></a><div class="hs_Para">You are
precisely right; if we are to get engagement at a local level and get
young people&#151;sometimes vulnerable young people&#151;to come
into that net, two things have to happen. We have to stand by our
sector-led approach, and obviously require different sectors, like
construction, to articulate how many apprenticeships they can offer in
London, how many of those can be for young women, and how can we
attract BME young people into those apprenticeships for, say, the
Olympics. That conversation with the regional skills boards, the Mayor
and local authorities has to be deep and meaningful, if we are going to
deliver. I was in Salford&#151;a very deprived community&#151;a few
months ago with the BBC and other media providers launching their new
set of apprenticeships, they were tying to reach out to young people
from non-traditional backgrounds. If you looked at the cohort of young
people coming into the BBC, there was a girl from Moss Side working on
&#147;Panorama&#148;, who had not been 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column229" />Column number: 229</div>to university and many young people from Salford who had not been to
university. It is a combination of the regional and the sector-led

								David

						</i> Absolutely, it is a fundamental point and
there are two bits of activity that are central. Behind the clauses in
the Bill are our 25 sector skills councils, and their work is relevant
to adult skills and apprenticeships. Each of those 25 sector skills
councils, which will be relicensed and refocused, is involved in the
business of articulating the necessary qualifications in their sector
and representing that sector in discussions with the QCA. That means
explaining what is no longer necessary and what has been duplicated,
but also what is absolutely necessary; that is the first tranche of
work.</div>
					<a name="08013010000303"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second
tranche is the work that we are doing with the qualifications and
curriculum framework. We are the piloting work on units and increased
modularity. We are also looking at accreditation and what employers are
doing&#151;obviously you will have seen the headlines about
McDonald&#146;s. That is about portability. I worked at
McDonald&#146;s and KFC, so I feel strongly about this. Young people
who stay on in that sort of employment and make their way up should be
able to demonstrate the levels that they have acquired if they wish to
move on to other areas. Those are the two tranches of work that meet
that need. You can move from one region or area of the country to
another area and people will understand the level that you have

driving up apprenticeships in this country. We are asking people to
come back to us and to tell us where they agree and disagree with the
document that we published yesterday. I hope that there is a
cross-party initiative to drive the figures up, which will be partly
achieved by the matching service that we have talked about. It is not
clear to young people where the particular apprenticeships are in their
local area and how they can access them. There are also 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column230" />Column number: 230</div>small and medium-sized businesses that are not aware of the
opportunities that apprenticeships could offer them. They are just not
on their radar. A new national service, with the advertising and the
regional field force that goes with that, is part of that
journey.</div>
					<a name="08013010000308"></a><div class="hs_Para">Sector skills
councils must articulate the growth in their sector and&#151;I
suspect that the relicensing process will involve this&#151;measure
it. Apprenticeships are an absolute priority for us, and we will
challenge the sector skills councils to come up with the
apprenticeships that are appropriate in their area. In addition,
training associations are important, as are further flexibility, direct
payment pilots where appropriate and the need to galvanise the country.
I hope that all the adverts about the value of skills will drive up
demand among employers. Young people must continue to come into contact
with work-based learning by, for example, acquiring the skills that are
required on programme apprenticeships.</div>

young people in education who are on programme-led apprenticeships. It
is a good thing if they are on a journey to an apprenticeship, but they
may well be on a journey to a diploma or some other training, and going
off on different routes. I expect that that number will increase over
the next period. I see that not as a problem but as a good thing. The
alternative is the NEET problem, where young people are not engaged in

in employers who have never had apprentices before, what should we do
to support those employers when they are training apprentices,

training providers: that is exactly the function that they have. They
have expertise in organising apprenticeships, and work with a wide
range of employers and, indeed, of young people. They employ staff who
have a skill set that enables them to work at both ends of that
equation. That is very much their role, and they will work well for
small employers. If larger employers want to get more involved in
apprenticeships, we see a role for the National Employer Service, which
already does that sort of work with blue chip companies. For large
regional employers that do not quite fit into that category, we
envisage that the national apprenticeship service will play a role in
helping employers to get themselves into a position where they are
confident about organising and running apprenticeships for themselves.
It will support them through that process until they feel they can cope
with it

qualifications within Skills for Life, which is a &#163;1.5 billion
Government programme. For the first time, we are making that an
absolute priority, and it applies to adults of all ages, including the
people with whom you, Oliver, are preoccupied, and who left school
without numeracy or literacy, and are now adults. They left school
before we were in government, but we are taking care of them under the

literacy and numeracy level skills, and I hope that you will support us
in that.</div>

there should be fee remission for 19 to 25-year-olds in relation to our
aspirations at levels 2 and 3. That is in line with what Lord Leitch
recommended, and it supports our other objectives that are being
piloted; we will come forward with further proposals in relation to
skills accounts and the new adult careers service. You are right: we
are not including a duty for people over 25 in relation to levels 2 and
3 in the Bill, because we believe that that provision is largely
catered for through the Train to Gain programme, under which adults and

the end of 2006, that we have to prioritise. The Bill and the
Government&#146;s adult skills policy build on the
Government&#146;s &#163;3.5 billion contribution to learning by

						</i> We deal with this at the end of our
apprenticeship review. We are recommending critical-mass pilots,
understanding that there are some areas of the economy in which a lone
woman going into a particular industry or a particular employer is kind
of scary. You have to get a cluster of apprenticeships. I hope, through
some of our direct payment pilots to larger employers, to bring on
groups of people such as women, so that we can make advances in that
regard.</div>
					<a name="08013010000322"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are also
introducing mentoring to support particular groups right the way
through. We already have sector pathways projects. I was with Care
Construction, looking at women particularly, in Islington. What is
clear to us is that the adult apprenticeship route, which has not come
up yet, is another huge opportunity for women in particular. By that I
mean that we know from evidence that young women at the age of 16 or 17
may simply lack the confidence to feel that there is a job in
construction for them. However, at 24, 25, 26 and beyond, they are far
more confident about knowing or feeling that they want to work in the
construction industry. So the adult apprenticeship route is also going
to be very important.

that questions expand to fill the time available. So I will encourage

						</i> The first thing is to say that, just as we
have talked about galvanising the system in relation to compulsion and
younger people, the adult skills clauses in the Bill are about
galvanising the LSC to ensure that there is proper provision and to
ensure that our priorities around adult skills are delivered. You heard
from the principals that they are up for that. Particularly in relation
to people who do not have a first full level 2 qualification, the Bill
is incredibly important in ensuring that there are
opportunities  for them.</div>

skills accounts or go to the new adult universal careers service, and
we get that message across to them that there is money in their name,
they can go and claim it at the local college to get that first level 2
qualification. This issue goes way back to those days when we streamed
people off, with O-levels on one side and CSE qualifications on the
other. I am talking about all those people who did CSEs being able to
go now, because of this Bill, to get these
qualifications.</div>

Hove-based provider of the new deal for Sussex and Hampshire has very
high retention rates within the equivalent of job placements.
Obviously, factors like personalities and personality clashes come into
play. Even if you have 60 or 70 per cent. rates, some apprenticeships
will break down. What happens to those people whose apprenticeships
break down? Is there a binding contract, like the old apprenticeships?
What kind of sanctions would be brought against them if the
apprenticeship breaks down?</div>

								John
Landeryou:
							</b>
						</i> We started to cover that in the document
that we published yesterday. Apprentices have exactly the same legal
rights and responsibilities as other employees. If an employee breaks
the terms of their employment contract, they will be subject to
dismissal, or they may choose to leave employment. That is one legal
definition. However, it is plainly in no one&#146;s interest if young
people who move from one post to another, particularly in the same
sector, when they are part way through an apprenticeship do not get it
picked up by their new employer so that they can continue. We see it as
the role of the Learning and Skills Council to try to ensure continuity
of training and to enable people to finish an apprenticeship. We
certainly see it as the responsibility of the National Apprenticeship
Service in future to ensure that that happens. After all, we have made
a part-investment in the first place, and it is logical to follow it
through.</div>

was indicated in Leitch about the obligation on the Government to be
more joined up between my Department and the Department for Work and

am sure that we all see people who are unemployed and who get a job for
a couple of months, but then go back into unemployment because they do
not have the skills to keep the employment and constantly to progress.
We must do more. Alongside the document that we published yesterday on
apprenticeships, there was much discussion about local employment
partnerships, the skills check, the work that we want to do with women
and lone parents coming back into employment, and the 16-hour rule. All
that effort is to ensure that we are more joined up in relation to

That is a hub-and-spoke model with the group training provider at the
centre doing the work around accreditation and liaison with the
Learning And Skills Council and the awarding bodies, and then spoking
out into small electrical companies with perhaps no more than five or
six people. Ways can be found. It is already the case, of course, that
a professional electrician or plumber must have a qualification as a
certain standard. They ought then to be able to teach, mentor and
provide an apprenticeship. The only barriers to that are financial and
administrative. We want to articulate what we think the offer is. We
