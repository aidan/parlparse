<B>Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory </B>(Wells): I beg to move amendment No. 307, in page 30, line 5, leave out

and insert

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 299, in page 30, line 11, after ``in'', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`what he was aware was or was likely to be'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> The clause deals with disciplinary powers and therefore is of great interest to market makers and participants, given that under the provision their livelihoods could be jeopardised and their reputation tarnished if the Financial Services Authority made a mistake. Against that, however, I and the whole Committee want such powers to be effective and wrongdoers to be brought to book so there is the usual balance to be struck.
<P>
The amendments would strengthen the obligations on the authority in several respects. Amendment No. 307 would clarify the standard of proof that the authority must meet to take action. In most professional discipline systems, the standard of proof applied is that of the criminal courts, which is one of beyond reasonable doubt. The Bill does not make clear exactly on what basis the authority needs to be satisfied of misconduct, but the amendment would make explicit in subsection (1)(a) that it must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt.
<P>
Amendment No. 299 is a little more complicated than amendment No. 307. Under the clause, someone could face disciplinary action if he knew that another authorised person was doing something, even though he might not be aware that the second authorised person was contravening a requirement under the Act. If I were a dealer in the City, for example, I might know that a co-employee was dealing in certain shares and assist him with the paperwork, place a few orders or contact some clients. I could therefore be associated intimately with his actions.
<P>
It could then turn out that my co-employee was breaching the rules. Because I was knowingly concerned in those actions, I might satisfy the requirement of subsection (2)(b) and face disciplinary action—even though at the time I did not know that the action concerned was a contravention of the rules. It should be made clear not only that I was knowingly concerned in the relevant activity, but that at the same time, I was aware that that activity was a contravention of the requirements imposed on the authorised person. That may be the intention behind the clause, but to clear up any ambiguity, it would be useful if the Minister could accept the amendment or could put on record beyond doubt the Government's interpretation of the provision, which could be used subsequently in court proceedings. However, that would be less satisfactory than making matters explicit in the Bill, which we always prefer; that is how legislation should proceed.
<P>
One way or another, any possible ambiguity should be avoided because of the seriousness of the clause. People's livelihoods are at stake. People will look closely at the provision and we must be sure that those who face disciplinary action do so not only because they did something wrong but because they knew that they were doing, or were associated with, something that breached the rules.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howard Flight </B>(Arundel and South Downs): Mr. O'Brien, may I add my welcome to your chairmanship?
<P>
The point has been made that the industry is still not at all happy with some provisions in the Bill. The London Investment Banking Association has written to me about
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the industry's continuing misgivings about the FSA's ability to mount disciplinary cases on the basis of breaches of a Principle alone because, unless the Principles are drafted clearly, there is the risk that cases will be brought against individuals/firms who could not foresee at the time an action was taken that it would be held to amount to a contravention.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
LIBA continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``We would hope ... that in practice FSA would agree that it would only take action where it was foreseeable that behaviour would breach a Principle and, at the very least, we believe that FSA should be required to publish clear guidance on the circumstances in which the Principles would be cited in disciplinary proceedings. We think it is essential, where individuals—and firms—have acted reasonably and diligently, that they should not be exposed to disciplinary action because, with the benefit of hindsight, it is held that what they did was deficient.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Those points entirely echo the arguments of my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory).
<P>
<B>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Miss Melanie Johnson):</B> I, too, welcome you to the Chair, Mr. O'Brien. If I may, I crave your indulgence. Before giving a lengthy response to the points made in this debate, I should like to say that the draft order on exemptions under clause 19 is published today, for comment by the end of January, copies of which are being sent to members of the Committee.
<P>
I am grateful to right hon. and hon. Members for making those points because it gives me the opportunity to explain both the drafting of clause 63 and how we envisage that the arrangements for discipline under these clauses will work. Much of what I shall say, especially on amendment No. 307, applies equally to several other aspects of the regulatory regime that will be established under the Bill, but I shall begin by making some more general points.
<P>
Clause 63 will give the FSA the power to discipline approved persons—mostly employees—whom the FSA has approved to perform controlled functions in accordance with the requirements in clause 56.
<P>
As the Committee will know, the FSA has been consulting on various aspects of the operation of the regime under part V. Final decisions on the functions that will be made controlled functions are not certain, although the FSA's proposed general approach is set out in consultation paper 26.
<P>
It is clear that many people subject to vetting under current statutory or self-regulatory arrangements will need approval, will need to comply with the statement of principles and will be capable of being subject to disciplinary action under the powers in the clause.
<P>
I turn now to the points raised in amendment No. 299 and the circumstances in which the FSA will be able to take disciplinary action. Subsection (1) will impose a two-stage test. First, the FSA may take action to discipline an approved person only where it believes that he is guilty of misconduct. Subsection (2) defines misconduct as being where the person fails to comply with the statement of principle or where he is knowingly concerned in a regulatory breach by the authorised person for whom he works. Secondly, the authority must be satisfied that it is appropriate in all the circumstances to take action against the approved person.
<P>
The term ``knowingly concerned'' already covers the thought that a person had to be aware of the nature of the conduct in which he was involved. If he had been ignorant of its true nature, he would not have been knowingly concerned in the contravention. That principle has been established in criminal law cases. Although we are not talking about a criminal offence, the same principles would apply to the interpretation of the clause. Of course, it is not enough for an approved person to claim not to know about FSA rules—ignorance of the law is no defence. However, we are not creating strict liability. I hope that that meets the concerns of the hon. Member for Chichester (Mr. Tyrie).
<P>
A further point of reassurance for members of the Committee should be the fact that the FSA may take disciplinary action only where it is appropriate in all the circumstances. It will have to consider that additional test and will take no action if action solely against the firm is sufficient in all the circumstances— for example, because the part played by the individual was small or peripheral and it was unnecessary to pursue him.
<P>
I shall quickly clarify a point raised by the hon. Member for Chichester on amendment No. 293 on Tuesday, which is relevant. As I said then, the FSA stated in consultation paper No. 26 that it did not propose to use the disciplinary powers provided for in clause 63 unless the misconduct resulted from deliberate actions by the individual concerned or his standard of behaviour was clearly below that which the FSA would reasonably expect of a person who performed that function.
<P>
The FSA has, therefore, prepared its draft code of conduct, which is set out in consultation paper No. 26, in a way that makes it clear that intent would be an important factor in reaching a view on whether discipline was appropriate.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked whether there could be a breach even when the person concerned was unaware that it was taking place. An approved person might reach a different view from the FSA about whether the code permitted certain conduct and so could be argued by the FSA to have breached the code. It would ultimately be for the tribunal to determine whether the conduct was acceptable. However, the fact that the person had honestly considered the issue might suggest that the conduct was consistent with the principle to which the relevant part of the code related and that the person had, therefore, not acted improperly. Although the conduct involved might have led to a breach, it might not be
<P>

<P>
for the FSA—
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell </B>(North-East Bedfordshire): Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> May I finish the paragraph? It might not be
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``appropriate in all the circumstances''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
for the FSA to take disciplinary action against the person, as set out in subsection (l)(b). The precise position will depend on the circumstances of the case.

<P>

<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I apologise for interrupting in the middle of a paragraph; it is difficult to know when to stop the Minister when she is reading a long passage. Is there any difference between the words ``appropriate'' and ``reasonable''?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> Perhaps I can come back to that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Tyrie </B>(Chichester): Throughout the Minister's last point, which I scribbled down as best I could, she said that it might be inappropriate to take action—the record will show that that is how it might be interpreted. Why was ``might'' put in, rather than ``should''? In my intervention on Tuesday, I sought clarity on an issue. However, the reply that I appear to have received is, ``Well, there might be clarity, but there might not.'' Are the words ``might'' and ``should'' interchangeable?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> No, I do not believe that they are. The reason for saying ``might'' is that the person could have considered the issue.
<P>
The ``might'' is intended to suggest that the relevant part of the code was consistent with the principle to which it related and that the person had not, therefore, acted improperly. The precise position depends on the circumstances of the case. It is, therefore, impossible to answer the point definitively.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> The Minister said that individuals might have considered the issue. In my intervention I did not intend to deal with such cases, but with those in which people were unaware that a breach had taken place. If people consider the issue, clearly they cannot be unaware. Therefore, I do not see that that is relevant to the question that I asked, which is whether individuals unaware that there has been a breach might find themselves on the wrong side of regulation. The Minister said, ``Well, they might or might not.'' I am asking for clarity on that issue.
<P>
<H5>9.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> Are the circumstances that the hon. Gentleman wants clarified those when individuals have considered the matter and decided that there is no problem?
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> As I understand it, the Minister said that individuals might have considered whether there had been a breach and come to the conclusion that there had not been. In that case, they would clearly be unaware of a breach. I am asking whether someone would be culpable in cases of a breach of the code of which he could not reasonably have been aware of making.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> While I think carefully about that, I shall respond to the point made by the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire (Sir N. Lyell). As he knows, the FSA is always bound to act reasonably. However, subsection (1)(b) requires the FSA to weigh up whether it is appropriate to pursue an individual rather than or in addition to a firm. The question is one of the individual versus the firm, and the FSA will of course take a reasonable view on it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I think that I missed the Minister's response to my amendment relating to the standard of proof. We require that proof should be beyond reasonable doubt.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> Are we talking about amendment No. 307?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> The two amendments are grouped.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> Perhaps I can clarify the matter. I did not finish dealing with both the amendments. I had finished with the first when I took an intervention from the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Does the Minister wish to continue?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> Yes. I shall return to the point made by the hon. Member for Chichester later.
<P>
I shall move on to amendment No. 307, which will at least satisfy the right hon. Member for Wells. I have serious difficulty with the suggestion that the FSA should be able to take action against approved people only when it is ``satisfied beyond reasonable doubt'' that they are guilty of misconduct. It is not helpful to speak of standards of proof when referring to a body exercising a statutory discretion. The point is that the FSA should exercise its powers rationally.
<P>
However, I agree entirely that the FSA should be required to be satisfied of misconduct before it takes action. We believe that nothing more is needed to achieve that result. Clause 63(1) uses the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``if ... it appears to the Authority''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I should perhaps explain that, as it is important to be clear about the effect of warning notice procedures set out in the Bill.
<P>
The FSA will need to reach a view about whether a person has been guilty of misconduct before it issues a warning notice. Before the warning notice is issued, there will almost always have been some informal exchanges on the matter with the person concerned. The FSA may well have undertaken an investigation that would have informed its view of the case. When the FSA issues a warning notice, it will have reached a view in the light of the information available to it. The purpose of issuing a warning notice is to mark the beginning of a formal administrative process. Generally, the FSA will have been engaged in informal discussions on the matter before that stage; the issuing of the notice crystallises the allegation of misconduct against the approved person.
<P>
Clause 338(1)(b) requires the FSA to explain its reasons for the proposed action. In cases of misconduct under clause 63, the requirement would include an explanation of why the FSA believed the approved person to be guilty of misconduct, and why the FSA considered it appropriate, given the circumstances, to take action against that person. The FSA must also make available to the approved person and to interested third parties any evidence then relevant to its beliefs. That marks the start of a formal administrative process.
<P>
Having been given a warning notice, a person accused of misconduct may make representations to the FSA on the matter. In the light of any representations made and any further information that may then become available, the FSA will reassess the case. If it continues to believe that there is a case, it will need to issue a decision notice. At that stage, the FSA must inform the approved person and any third parties mentioned in a prejudicial manner of their rights to refer the matter to the tribunal. However, even at that point, the FSA must act on the basis of its belief.
<P>
As my predecessor in this post, the current Minister for Small Business and E-Commerce, my hon. Friend the Member for Leicester, West (Ms Hewitt), explained before the summer recess, the FSA must, as an authority exercising statutory functions, have reached its view on a reasonable basis. That point need not be spelled out in the Bill. I expect that the extent to which evidence available to the FSA would stand up before the tribunal would be included in the authority's reasoning.
<P>
The word ``appears'' is intended to capture the points that I have made—namely, that the authority's decision to proceed with the formal procedures will turn on its reasonable belief in the prevailing circumstances. After those administrative stages, the approved person has the opportunity to refer the case to the tribunal under part VIII. The tribunal, in determining the case, will apply the appropriate standard of proof according to the nature, severity and circumstances of the case. In the light of my comments on that point especially, I hope that hon. Members will agree to withdraw the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for her helpful comments and for her clarification in respect of amendment No. 307. She frequently referred, as she has done previously, to the FSA's discretion, which, she implies, must not be hampered or circumscribed. However, the Committee's job is to try to set limits on discretionary powers exercised by an executive body, especially when that body is substantially immune under the law.
<P>
The Minister said that the FSA must act reasonably, and I am glad of that remark at least. We know from elsewhere in the Bill that it would be difficult for anyone to take legal action against the authority were it to act negligently or recklessly, because it is largely immune to such a course of action. It is vulnerable to challenge under the European convention on human rights and in other ways, but those are blunt instruments, expensive for a victim to use.
<P>
We sought to ensure that the authority would be placed under a burden of proof appropriate for the criminal court, given that even a warning notice could destroy someone's reputation. It is all very well to say that there are safeguards further down the track and before someone is fined, but a warning notice could be devastating to an individual or to a firm. That, rather than a subsequent clearance, is what is often remembered after people read about a case in the press. It would be desirable if the authority were to proceed, even at the outset, only if it was sure that someone had a case to answer and appeared beyond reasonable doubt, not merely on a hunch or on a balance of probabilities, to be guilty of misconduct.
<P>
We shall reach clause 338 in due course and examine it in the light of our misgivings. We are partly reassured by the Economic Secretary's words, but this is not the first time that she has appeared to place much weight on the FSA's reasonableness. As we have remarked before, we have confidence in the members of the FSA's management who have appeared as witnesses before the Burns Committee. However, people come and go and firms often deal with much more junior staff whose actions and judgment can in effect determine whether someone will receive a warning notice or face disciplinary action. Such events may occur as a result of a personality clash: the City contains some extremely awkward and strong-minded people, who may appear to have transgressed in a market that no one entirely understands, and whom suspicion may surround. I hope that the authority would not respond hastily by issuing notices and taking disciplinary action unless it were sure that such action was merited.
<P>
In responding to amendment No. 299, the Economic Secretary helpfully placed on record her understanding of the clause. I agree that its wording is probably designed to catch only those who were involved in a contravention of the rules and knew that it was a contravention at the time that they were associated with the action. However, a clever legal mind could argue that the clause will catch people who were involved in an action that was subsequently discovered to constitute a contravention, but who were unaware at the time of its doing so. I regret that that is not made clear.
<P>
The Economic Secretary gave an assurance that might be helpful under Pepper v. Hart rules, but I cannot for the life of me understand why she will not accept an amendment to make that clear beyond doubt. Why have any doubts or ambiguities in an important clause when a well drafted amendment could make it clear? The suspicion remains that either the authority or the Treasury is keeping up its sleeve the possibility of another, more damaging, interpretation on which to rely if the going gets tough. Unless the Economic Secretary cares to have a rethink, we intend to press the amendment to a Division.

<P>

<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I shall place one or two further points on the record in connection with the right hon. Gentleman's final remarks and the comments of the hon. Member for Chichester. Whether the right hon. Gentleman will still wish to press the amendment I cannot say, but perhaps I can help him a little further.
<P>
In some cases, there will be direct evidence that the person involved was aware of wrongdoing, such as his having taken steps to cover his tracks. In other cases, the FSA will have to consider whether it can be shown that the person involved must have been aware that the action in which he was involved was improper. In doing so, the FSA's judgment may turn on the extent of the connection between the person's functions and actions and the nature of the breach.
<P>
For example, a pensions salesman may have no reason to suppose that his actions in selling policies at a discount contributed to the firm's breach of solvency requirements: he might well have supposed that the firm had adequate margins to cover his activities. However, if he knew that his action seriously threatened the firm's solvency, it would be easier to show that he was knowingly involved in a breach. Equally, if an approved person performed tasks that were superficially routine, such as compiling customer profiles, without knowledge of how they might be used, it would be difficult for the firm to show that he was aware that he was involved in improper conduct. Ultimately—this is important—the tribunal will determine whether the necessary standard of proof that the person was knowingly involved in a contravention has been satisfied.
<P>
Therefore, there is ample judicial protection for approved persons against whom the action is taken.
<P>
<H5>9.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
To deal with the more general points raised by the right hon. Gentleman the Bill puts several constraints on the FSA. The notice procedure and the tribunals provide protections that will address his concerns. The risk of loss would be minimised since a notice will not take effect until all the procedures have been exhausted. The FSA will have to take into account the likelihood of its case being upheld by the tribunal, but it will ultimately be for the tribunal to weigh up those matters. We shall oppose the amendment if it is pressed to a vote.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 308, in page 30, line 18, after `publish', insert `in a national newspaper'.
<P>
The amendment is a probing amendment, designed to discover how a statement of misconduct will be published—rather than its simply being pinned on the door of the FSA. Special bodies usually publish such notices in newspapers. We wondered how the information would be disseminated: will it be on the internet, in newspapers or in an official publication? It is obviously desirable, if someone is guilty of misconduct, that that should be widely known. Publishing such information will affect the person's employment prospects—quite rightly if he is a wrongdoer. We will not press the amendment to a vote, because it would be rather inhibiting if it were accepted, but perhaps the Minister will enlighten us as to what is to happen.
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> Amendment No. 308 would enable the FSA expressly to publish a statement of misconduct in a national newspaper. I see nothing in clause 63 that would prevent that. I am surprised that Opposition Members believe that that would always be the appropriate course of action. I find it more sensible to leave it to the discretion of the FSA to decide how to publish its statement of misconduct in each case.
<P>
Under current disciplinary powers available to the self-regulating organisations, standard practice has been to publicise statements of the kind envisaged by clause 63(3)(a) in the form of press notices; these are distributed to the press nationwide. Since 1997, the FSA has provided administrative support to the self-regulating organisations on a contractual basis, and has therefore issued such notices through its press office.
<P>
In general, the national press—at least the broadsheets—tend to report public statements and decisions to impose penalties on employees. There is also wide coverage in trade publications. such as Money Marketing and Financial Adviser. The FSA has also made use of new technologies: all press notices are posted on its web site, and accessible by the public over the internet. These arrangements have worked well in the past and the FSA has no plans to adopt a different approach.
<P>
Such notices have been issued only rarely, and in the light of serious misconduct. The FSA has indicated that it does not envisage significant changes to the way it uses the equivalent powers under clause 63. I hope that hon. Members will agree to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 300 in page 30, leave out lines 38 to 41 and insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(3) A warning notice most, if practicable, state whether the Authority proposes to impose a penalty or publish a statement.'<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 301 in page 31, line 4, after first `the' insert `proposed'.
<P>
No. 302, in page 31, line 6, after first `the' insert `proposed'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Clause 64 sets out the procedures that the FSA must follow when proposing to take disciplinary action. The warning notice and decision notice arrangements and procedure from earlier provisions in the Bill also apply to the disciplinary measures in clause 63 relating to approved persons. In clause 64(3) and (4) it is contemplated that the warning notice will state the amount of the penalty, if it is proposed to impose one, and the terms of the statement, where there is a proposal to publish one. In our opinion, the warning notice should state only whether it is proposed to issue a penalty or statement.
<P>
We consider it wrong at that initial stage to go as far as specifying penalties and statements, before the person being prosecuted has had time to make representations to the FSA to defend himself, or used his right of access to details of the charges assembled against him by the authority. This provision and others in the Bill smack too much of the reversal of traditional British justice: the starting point of the British tradition is that a person is innocent until proven guilty, not the other way around. The amendments would provide simply that the FSA, if practicable, should state in the warning notice only whether it proposes to issue a penalty or statement.
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I listened with interest to the hon. Gentleman's comments. I confess that I am still rather puzzled. Throughout the Committee he and his colleagues have argued for accountability provisions, transparency and protections for those subject to the powers of the FSA. The Government believe in those too. However, the amendments go in completely the opposite direction.
<P>
Amendment No. 300 seeks substantially to weaken the obligation on the authority to make its position clear at the time it issues a warning notice. The FSA should not issue a warning notice until it has reached a view on a particular disciplinary action. That is the trigger for the right to see evidence and make representations. In order for those rights to be effective, the firm or individual concerned should be absolutely clear about what they are alleged to have done and the course of action that the FSA proposes to take. It should therefore be clear of its view as to any penalties or statements it has in mind at the time of the warning notice. It is only proper that the firm or individual should be told.
<P>
I might remind the Committee of the changes we have made to the warning notice provisions in clause 338(5), in particular compared with the draft Bill considered by the Burns Committee. Those strengthen the protections available by enabling the person concerned to have access to certain information relevant to his or her case. We will come back to that when we reach clause 338.
<P>
On the basis of that notice, the individual or firm may make representations to the FSA on the matters contained in the notice. It may be that they will wish to challenge the underlying decision, but equally, they may want to argue why the action the authority proposes to take in response is disproportionate or unjustified. If they are not told the full picture in the warning notice, they will be in a much weaker position.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 301 and 302 are also misguided. The insertion of the word ``proposed'' does not alter the effect or content of the notice in any way. The decision notice will represent what the FSA believes to be the detail and circumstances of the case, and what the FSA believes to be the right course of action, in the light of any representations from the individual or firm concerned.
<P>
It may be that shortly following the notice, if it is clear that the case is not to be referred to the tribunal, the FSA will proceed with its intended course of action, but equally, it is clear that it would not be able to proceed if the case were referred to the tribunal.
<P>
On that basis I am not sure why the Opposition seek to make these provisions inconsistent with the general drafting approach relating to warning and decision notices in other parts of the Bill.
<P>
I hope that they will reconsider the wisdom of these amendments and accordingly feel able to withdraw them.

<P>

<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I hoped that our point was fairly clear. We object to the timing. A person should obviously know and it should become public knowledge at the appropriate time after he has had the opportunity to discuss the matter with the FSA and seen whether it, as the prosecutor, has got hold of the right end of the stick. It is potentially very damaging if it becomes public that the FSA is proposing some major penalty equivalent to damning him for ever, as it were, in his career in the financial services industry before he has had an opportunity to try to sort it out.
<P>
We do not object to the transparency of information, but we feel that it is too soon. The warning notice procedure for this application should have a lower profile. The time to advise on the proposed penalty is self evidently after the FSA and the individual have had the chance to sort out whether the FSA's assertions are fair and accurate. What we particularly dislike, and it was evident in the language the Minister just used, is the assumption by the FSA that it must know that someone is guilty before he has had the chance to defend himself. The punishment is meted out before the individual has had an opportunity to discuss, look at the case, or defend himself in any way against the alleged crime.
<P>
We will not press this to the vote as the point is made. It is also part of a slightly larger issue under the principle of ``guilty until proven innocent''. I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for raising this matter.
<P>
There can be no doubt that the FSA would consult approved persons in carrying out consultations under clause 67. However, as the Financial Secretary to the Treasury, my hon. Friend the Member for East Ham (Mr. Timms) told the Committee on Tuesday, we intend to review and align several consultation requirements in the Bill.
<P>
Clause 67 is one such provision, and is closely related to clause 99, which we shall discuss shortly, when there will be an opportunity for proposed improvements.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`, but shall in any event include natural persons and Scottish partnerships under section 4 of the Partnership Act 1890'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> The amendments deal with the definition of private persons. Amendment No. 304 seeks to bring the drafting of clause 68 into line with other part of the Bill. Amendment No. 309 would ensure that the Bill recognises Scottish partnerships.
<P>
I am not a lawyer. However, under English law, partnerships—in contrast to companies—do not have a distinct or separate legal personality. Of course, there was a great breakthrough in the last century when the courts recognised that companies could act and be sued separately from the shareholders. Until then, most commerce was done through partnerships, which meant that everyone was liable in an unlimited fashion. I do not know how Scottish partnership law evolved, but perhaps the same problem, which was inhibiting trade and commerce, was spotted, and a type of partnership was therefore developed which had a separate legal personality and could act and be liable separate from the partners. That mechanism is also used at Lloyd's, so it is obviously useful, and it is therefore important that it is recognised in the Bill.
<P>
The reason that I raise those Scottish matters is that, for reasons that I cannot quite understand, there is no Scottish Member of Parliament on the Committee—[Interruption.] Does the hon. Lady represent a Scottish seat?
<P>
<B>Ms Sandra Osborne </B>(Ayr): Yes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> Then it is even more baffling that she has not raised those issues on behalf of her constituents. My hon. Friends and I have been in constant correspondence with Scottish organisations that are concerned that their point of view is not being reflected. Obviously, I am an English Member of Parliament, and therefore much less familiar with Scottish legal proceedings, but as the Bill is a United Kingdom Bill, and therefore definitely not a matter for the Scottish Parliament, we all ought to take an interest in what will happen north of the border.
<P>
The Scottish Law Society, in particular, has been energetic in ensuring that its own legal arrangements, which are separate in other respects as well as in partnerships, are understood. On the Burns Committee—where the only Scottish representative was on our side—we tried hard to ensure that Scottish professionals did not suffer from a sort of reverse devolution. In some respects, the Bill brings matters that have been regulated in Scotland down to London. That might cause resentment north of the border, especially if costs were to rise, or if decisions against Scottish interests were to be taken in London. I hope that that will not be the case, but we must be alert to that possibility. I raise that issue on behalf of Scottish lawyers, and I hope that the Minister can explain her position sympathetically.
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I am glad to be able to put on record the presence of my hon. Friend the Member for Ayr (Ms Osborne), and welcome the recognition of the right hon. Member for Wells that we are well represented in every part of the United Kingdom.
<P>
I reassure the right hon. Gentleman that I will always respond sympathetically to his points, but I cannot always agree with them. I am grateful for the opportunity to respond to these points. I agree entirely with the desirability of having flexibility of the kind that the right hon. Gentleman describes in his amendment No. 304.
<P>
In fact, the exercise of the Treasury's powers to make regulations under the Bill is governed by clause 362, which already provides, in subsection (2)(b), that regulations may make different provision for different cases. The amendment is therefore unnecessary. 
<P>
I am concerned about amendment No. 309. As a starting point, the persons identified there are within the group that would naturally expect in most cases to be included within any definition set out in any order made by the Treasury for such a purpose. However, in some circumstances we may require a more refined definition, for example where authorised sole traders deal with the firm on a professional basis. Because of the need for subtle definitions in such circumstances, the Government propose to make definitions by regulations. That approach is consistent with the position now under section 62A of the Financial Services Act 1986.
<P>
It might help members of the Committee to know that the current definition of ``private investor'' is set out in the Financial Services Act 1986 (Restriction of Right of Action) Regulations 1991. Those regulations define a private investor as an investor whose cause of action arises as a result of anything that he has done or suffered: in the case of an individual, otherwise than in the course of carrying on investment business; and in the case of any other person, otherwise than in the course of carrying on business of any kind.
<P>
Of course, the Bill refers to ``private person'' rather than ``private investor''—that is simply intended to take in policy holders and depositors, reflecting the wider classes of consumer under the Bill compared with the 1986 Act. There is no need to make different distinctions in respect of Scotland. I therefore ask the right hon. Member for Wells to withdraw the amendment. If he does not, I ask my hon. Friends to oppose it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 68 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 69</center></H4>
<H4><center>The competent authority</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I need to make some comments on this clause because of changes, so I rise to my feet to do so—no doubt to the discomfort of my Whip.
<P>
This part of the Bill carries forward the provisions of part IV of the Financial Services Act 1986, which implement our obligations under European Community legislation on official listing—the listing particulars directive, the admissions directive and the prospectus directive.
<P>
The effect of this European legislation is that the admission of securities to official listing on a stock exchange in a member state is subject to several detailed controls. For example, the directives set out a range of detailed requirements for the information to be contained in listing particulars or a prospectus. They require information about the securities themselves—for example, the extent of voting rights or entitlement to share in profit—and about the issuer, its capital, activities and financial position.
<P>
The directives also impose several continuing obligations that issuers whose securities are admitted to official listing must meet.
<P>
The purpose of the legislation is to protect investors and to improve the working of the single market by harmonising the arrangements for the listing of securities in member states.
<P>
Whereas there is no obligation on issuers of securities to apply for listing, investors know that issuers of securities that are admitted to the official list of any member state are obliged to provide certain information and fulfil certain conditions if their securities are to remain on the official list. Investors can therefore have confidence that they will have access to information that is sufficient to enable them to make informed decisions. That is, of course, one of the main planks of investor protection.
<P>
We have largely carried forward the provisions of part IV of the Financial Services Act, but we have made several improvements. We have introduced a new power, as provided for in schedule 7 to which the clause refers, to allow the Treasury to transfer the functions of the competent authority to another body in certain circumstances.
<P>
A second change is the introduction of a new penalty power, which will allow the competent authority to impose a penalty on issuers who breach the listing rules. This power also extends to directors and shadow directors and to ex-directors and ex-shadow directors who are knowingly involved in a breach. Up to now the only sanctions available to the competent authority have been private or public censure or suspension or cancelling of listing. The new penalty power increases the range of options available to the competent authority and will help make sure that effective and proportionate action can be taken where listing rules have been breached.
<P>
The third change, which is more technical, is that in future all securities admitted to the official list will be admitted under the statutory provisions. At present the stock exchange admits some securities, such as gilts, under contract. This will simplify the arrangements and put all issues on the same footing.
<P>
<H5>10 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The admissions directive, as hon. Members know, also requires member states to appoint a competent authority to operate the controls to which I have referred and ensure that issuers comply with the continuing requirements. The Bill currently names the London stock exchange as the United Kingdom's competent authority. I come to the meat of the clause and why I need to put these matters on record this morning. It sets out the statutory basis for the making of listing rules which govern admission to the official list and on-going obligations.
<P>
The decision to continue to name the London stock exchange as competent authority was taken by the Treasury in February 1998. The London stock exchange is, of course, currently the competent authority and has been since the concept was first introduced into UK law in 1984.
<P>
Our reasons for continuing with the current arrangements were simple. They work. As the Treasury made clear when announcing the continuation of the current arrangements, the London stock exchange enjoys a substantial reputation throughout the world and it operates satisfactorily in creating and enforcing listing rules in a way which gives confidence to investors.
<P>
However, recent events have led us to reconsider the position. As hon. Members will know, on 31 July the stock exchange announced its proposal to demutualise.
<P>
While it remains the case that we are satisfied with the way in which the stock exchange has been and is carrying out the function, in the light of that decision, it is no longer appropriate for it to continue to exercise the competent authority function. Indeed, the stock exchange itself suggested that this would be inappropriate.
<P>
A demutualised stock exchange will be a for-profit organisation. We consider that it would create the possibility of conflicts of interest for the statutory functions of the competent authority to be exercised by a commercial for-profit company.
<P>
This is no slur on the stock exchange. Far from it. It is simply the right response to the change in circumstances.
<P>
We have, therefore, decided that the competent authority function should be transferred to the Financial Services Authority.
<P>
The Treasury announced this decision in early October, and said that we intended to bring forward the necessary amendments to the Bill to effect this transfer of responsibilities.
<P>
On the assumption that the Bill is enacted in the Spring of next year, the transfer will take place as soon as possible thereafter. The stock exchange will continue to exercise the function in the meantime. We will be working with the FSA and the stock exchange to ensure a smooth transition.
<P>
We are confident that the FSA will do a good job and will continue to carry out the function efficiently and effectively, meeting the needs of issuers and investors alike.
<P>
Hon. Members will appreciate that we are not in a position at present to make the substantive amendments to the Bill to cater for the transfer of function. There is more to do than simply cross out the words ``stock exchange'' and insert ``Financial Services Authority'' in clause 69(1).
<P>
I now want to say a little bit about the approach that we will be taking. The competent authority function, as I hope is clear from my opening remarks, is different from the FSA's general functions as a financial services regulator. This has been at the centre of our thinking in considering what changes are necessary to the Bill and it is worth expanding on.
<P>
First, although there is some overlap, the constituencies covered are different. The competent authority deals with all companies with an official listing—from banks to chemical companies to telecommunication companies—and not just with financial services firms.
<P>
Secondly, the duties of the competent authority are not as wide ranging. The competent authority is essentially concerned with ensuring that companies provide the necessary information for the market, with the bulk of the requirements laid down in the directives. It is not concerned with the conduct of an issuer's business in the way that the FSA is concerned with the conduct of authorised firms' dealings with their customers and each other.
<P>
It is not therefore a function which necessarily has to be carried out by a financial services regulator.
<P>
However, there are good reasons for transferring it to the FSA. Having the financial services regulator perform this job is in line with the practice in a number of countries including France, Germany, the US and Japan.
<P>
There are useful synergies. The FSA has a great deal of relevant knowledge and, through its oversight of exchanges, has a clear interest in the market in officially listed investments.
<P>
The FSA also has a strong interest in ensuring that the markets in officially listed investments are not abused and that investors in officially listed securities, which are of course investments, are protected. For example, if those with inside information make use of it before the rest of the market, or if information is given out in a misleading way, it can lead to losses for investors and damage confidence in the fairness of the market.
<P>
In policing the official listing requirements, the FSA will be in a good position to ensure that where the listing rules are not complied with and abuse occurs, it can take action, and it will be in a position to prevent as well as cure.
<P>
To summarise, there are strong synergies, but the function is a distinct one from the FSA's other functions. We believe, therefore, that we should not simply seek to align the provisions of part VI with the rest of the Bill without good reason.
<P>
As I have said, the stock exchange has done a good job as the competent authority, protecting the interests of investors while being sensitive to the needs of issuers and the importance of dynamic and efficient capital markets. We want the FSA to continue to operate in this way.
<P>
My starting point, therefore, is that since we were content with part VI when the stock exchange was named as competent authority, the transfer of the function does not mean that the current structure and arrangements have suddenly become inappropriate. We need to consider on a case-by-case basis whether the duties and powers which attach to the FSA generally should also attach to the FSA as competent authority. My conclusion is that we need to make some changes to part VI as a consequence of the transfer.
<P>
The Treasury is ultimately responsible for seeing that the competent authority gives proper effect to the directives, which are highly prescriptive. Therefore, we propose to retain the power to transfer the function to another body. Although I am fully confident that the FSA will do an excellent job, should circumstances change, we may want to transfer the function. It is appropriate to have that power, given the Treasury's slightly different relationship with the competent authority compared to that with the FSA generally.
<P>
The precise scope of the power for any future transfer will need to take account of the fact that the FSA is the competent authority. For example, we will no longer need the ground in paragraph 3 of schedule 7, which is appropriate only when an exchange is the competent authority. We also intend that the Treasury will continue to oversee the competent authority in the way that it does now, although that is not a matter for the Bill. The Treasury agrees the competent authority's objectives annually and holds regular meetings to assess progress.
<P>
There are general objectives, such as that of ensuring that the listing rules continue to meet UK obligations under EC law. There are also policy objectives: for example, one of this year's objectives is to prepare for consultation suggestions for change arising from the current market research into the views of smaller companies. There are also operational objectives, for example, on the timetable for processing applications for listing.
<P>
Given our intention that the competent authority function should be carried out in broadly the same way as it now is, and given the Treasury oversight role, we see no need to set out objectives for the FSA as competent authority in the Bill any more than we intended to do so if the stock exchange were to remain as competent authority. However, we intend to apply a number of principles to the competent authority, along the lines of those in clause 2(3). We intend to place a requirement on it to have regard to proportionality, competition considerations, the international position and the effective and economical use of resources.
<P>
We also think it appropriate to enhance the accountability arrangements for the competent authority. The FSA's annual report and annual general meeting will cover its functions as competent authority. We shall apply the Treasury's powers to commission enquiries into efficiency and economy to cover the exercise of this function. The complaints investigator will be able to look at complaints against the competent authority. We shall place the same requirement on the competent authority as on the FSA more generally to consult on rules and to produce cost-benefit analyses. Finally, we have already brought the competent authority within the scope of the power to commission independent statutory enquiries into the running of the regulatory system.
<P>
We, propose to put the competent authority's investigation powers on to a statutory footing. We think it right that those important powers are delimited in the primary legislation. Finally, we propose to make changes to clause 87, which requires the competent authority to make and maintain arrangements allowing someone to appeal against a financial penalty. Now that the function is to be transferred to the FSA, we think it right that, if a decision to impose a penalty is disputed, the route for challenging the decision should be by a reference to the tribunal established under the Bill. We shall introduce provisions to that effect.
<P>
I hope that, in the light of what I have said, Hon. Members will agree to accept for now the relevant clauses of part VI as they stand. We shall table amendments to part VI to take account of the transfer in due course.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Tim Loughton </B>(East Worthing and Shoreham): We are glad that the Minister has given us that detailed explanation, because it is obviously is a large departure from what faced us when the Bill was introduced. The explanatory notes referred solely to the London stock exchange as the competent authority. Furthermore, only a few months ago, certain Opposition Members raised with Howard Davies the matter of the FSA taking over a listing function. On that occasion, it was categorically denied that the FSA had any intention or desire to do so. We understand the changed nature of the stock exchange. However, what has changed in relation to the FSA becoming competent to become the competent authority and taking on such a big role?
<P>
We do not dispute that such a role is perfectly permissible under the Bill. The Minister said that part VI makes provision for the London stock exchange ceasing to be the competent authority, as is now happening. I am glad to hear that the FSA may cease to be the competent authority, if it is no longer competent to carry out such functions. That is a recent development. As the Minister said, the Treasury press release came out three weeks ago, on 4 October. However, whether that release made it clear that circumstances may arise in which the Government want to transfer responsibility is a matter of dispute. The Bill certainly contains a short sentence in that respect, but such a likelihood had not been made clear when the Committee began discussing the Bill in July.
<P>
We are worried that additional powers are being given to the FSA. The FSA will make rules and regulations for financial services and markets, as well as rules on listing particulars. It will also police whether the rules on particulars are being followed, and it will have power to impose penalties should its interpretation be that those rules are not being followed.
<P>
The FSA will benefit from acting as the competent authority on listing. The Minister was quite right to say that demutualisation is resulting in the stock exchange becoming a commercial organisation for profit; however, it was not a not-for-profit organisation before. The listing function of the London stock exchange was, and remains, profitable: indeed, its most recent annual report revealed that £29.3 million—about a fifth of its turnover of £149.8 million—derived from its role as the competent authority for listing.
<P>
Being the competent authority for listing is a profitable business and a big change in circumstances has led the LSE to give it up. The report and accounts of the LSE reveal an overall profit last year of £25 million. Part of that profit, as with similar organisations in the City, was rebated back to members. The London international futures exchange also gives rebates to members who pay subscription fees—although not last year, when it managed to lose £64 million.
<P>
Our debate on what will happen when incomes from fines and membership are rebated to members therefore takes on new significance. In effect, the FSA now has an additional turnover that has historically been about £29 million, and an unlimited amount of extra income from fines. I shall examine how that new revenue will be dealt with shortly. Will fine income be tackled through rebates to the membership or will the FSA build up an even bigger chest of swag?
<P>
The Minister rightly said that the competent authority requirements relate to EC directive 80/390, which was passed in March 1980. The London stock exchange has been the competent authority in the UK under those terms since 1984. The Minister also listed some of the competent authority's listing rules and requirements. They are set out in the yellow book, which is no longer so much a book as a vast file—I noticed a copy of it under a civil servant's arm earlier.
<P>
<H5>10.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
First, I want to compare the FSA's role as the competent authority with that of other organisations around the world. How will the FSA's role as the competent authority compare with that of the Bundesaufsichtsamt für den Wertpapierhandel? I shall call it the BAW for short. The BAW handles listing requirements as the competent authority in Germany. More pertinent perhaps is the role of the Commission des Operations de Bourses [HON. MEMBERS: ``Well done.''] That is not something of which I am proud. The COB is responsible for listing requirements in France. There is also a separate body, the Conseil des Marchés Financières, which has a more regulatory role. All those roles will be put into one melting point under the FSA. How will we match up in that regard?
<P>
That is an important point. Under the Financial Services Act 1986, the powers designated for the competent authority are far more extensive than required under the 1980 EC directive. It is not sufficient to say that we are following the directive, because the FSA has many more powers than directive 80/390 requires.
<P>
The French authority, the COB, has a different penalty set-up. When the COB's regulations are infringed, it can pronounce fines of as much as FF10 million or 10 times that amount when profits have been realised. An important difference is that those fines are paid to the French Treasury, not to the competent authority or the regulator. That is not the case with any of the fines, income or surpluses handled by the FSA. The way in which the FSA will work as the competent authority differs from that in which two EU competent authorities work. I got the message from the Minister that she saw no difference, but there are real differences.
<P>
One could also bring in the Securities and Exchange Commission in the United States. Much of the Bill has been modelled on the way in which the SEC is set up, although some of the SEC's penalty powers should not apply here because the United States has a different legal system. However, that raises a matter of immunity, to which we shall return on clause 93.
<P>
 How will the arrangements work? My question harks back to a form of Chinese walls. The SEC has five distinct and separate roles, which are carried out quite independently. There is the division of corporation finance, which has overall responsibility for ensuring that disclosure requirements are met. There is the division of market regulation, which oversees the securities market and registers and regulates brokerage firms. There is the division of investment management, which administers the three statutes from the 1940s and 1930s that set up the SEC. There is the division of enforcement that is involved in compliance requirements and the office of compliance inspections and examinations. Will the Minister elaborate on how the role of the competent authority for listing of the FSA will fit into the FSA? There are many potential conflicts of interest, so how separate will it be from the rest of that organisation?
<P>
We are setting up the rule maker, which makes and monitors the rules. That rule maker will benefit from its role as the listing authority and will bring in a great deal of revenue. The authority will bring in a great deal more revenue from fines and it will be responsible for determining whether companies qualify for listing for the first time or qualify to maintain their listing on the market.
<P>
An obvious conflict will arise because the more companies that list on the market or apply to the competent authority for listing, the more revenue the FSA will bring in. To the more cynical people, there is an incentive for the FSA to give out listings willy-nilly, without the companies necessarily meeting the requisite standard, because it will be bringing in the listing income on the back of it, just as there is the incentive to fine if the listing requirements are not adhered to in the terms that the FSA requires. Those are clear potential conflicts of interest where, either way, the beneficiary will be the FSA either as a result of additional listing income or additional fines and penalties.
<P>
<B>Nigel Beard </B>(Bexleyheath and Crayford): Why are the incentives greater for the FSA than for the stock exchange?
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> For the simple reason that the London stock exchange is not the regulator of the financial services industry. It will be subject to the wishes of the FSA as it was to the Securities and Investments Board before that. Someone is monitoring the London stock exchange. Who will monitor the FSA? Other than the Treasury, there is not an organisation above it so the FSA, in effect, can do what it likes within its own rules [Interruption.] It can. The Bill is setting the framework, which clearly sets out that the FSA can greatly change the rules as it sees fit.
<P>
Will the Minister deal with my point concerning the potential conflict of interest that will arise? I understand why the stock exchange decided to demutualise. I have declared my interest as set out in the Register of Members' Interests, so I shall now declare a non-interest, I was a member of the London stock exchange; unfortunately, I became a member some months after the membership rules qualified, so I shall not qualify for a cheque for £10,000 because of the demutualisation of the stock exchange. However, the firm of which I am a director is a corporate member of the London stock exchange and will benefit from the demutualisation.
<P>
We understand why demutualisation has happened. Exchanges are no longer important; it is the markets that are important. The LSE is suffering great competition from Instinet, Tradepoint and, most recently, from E-Crossnet, which is a market of 19 investors who have assets under management of about £2,000 billion.
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I am very interested to hear the hon. Gentleman's comments, but he is straying from the matters that are relevant to our discussions. The reason the stock exchange demutualised has nothing particularly to do with the issues that we are now debating.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> It is entirely relevant because without demutualisation, we would not have had the changes that the Minister mentioned. I am not criticising the stock exchange or suggesting that we return to the status quo ante. However, the Minister must make a convincing case for saying that what follows will be an improvement—with checks and balances on additional powers and revenue—on what went before. That is my main point, but I want to raise further questions.
<P>
How can the Minister assure us that the FSA will have adequate resources for the job? We already know that it has encountered problems as a result of staff shortages. It is going to be given additional duties and face additional demands on its time by having to investigate some 200,000 pension mis-selling complaints on the back of its advertising campaign. There are also potential additional burdens in taking on mortgage regulation and other financial regulations that were not initially envisaged.
<P>
The FSA is now taking on a listing requirement role. The London stock exchange is responsible for some 3,500 to 4,000 listings. As the Minister acknowledged, the FSA is ``looking after'' not only financial services firms, but every company—the Minister mentioned oil companies, chemical companies and engineering firms—that currently lists on the stock exchange. That is a vast role. I am not saying that the FSA is incapable of performing it, but I want to know how.
<P>
Will there be a full-scale transfer of staff from the listing department of the London stock exchange? Can the Minister guarantee that in its new role, the FSA will maintain the number of listings currently on the market and that it will be capable of increasing the number of listings in line with the growth over recent years? It is essential that London remain a centre for the listing of securities throughout the world. Otherwise, the future of the financial services community—and the City, in particular—will be damaged.
<P>
What will be the specific arrangements relating to fines for infringement? Where will the fines go? Will they be offset against the work of the listing department or, if they amount to more than that, will they be offset against the FSA's entire work? If there is a surplus, will it be rebated to members who subscribe to the FSA or, indeed, to companies who pay for their listing status? Will the cost of listing be reduced on the back of surpluses from fines—on the same basis as fines for regulatory infringements will be dealt with? Will the same procedure apply? As I said earlier, no small profit can be made from acting as a listing authority.
<P>
How will changes affect market liquidity, which is already a problem in the London market—hence the springing up of bodies such as internet trade companies, which I mentioned earlier? Will it be the role of the FSA, as the Bond on stock exchange before it, to maintain market liquidity? The London stock exchange no longer has a monopoly on dealing in major shares, and liquidity is being fragmented among several new, often electronic, markets. What will be the FSA's role in maintaining good liquidity, which is in the interests of customers and clients in securing the stock that they want. That is potentially a big problem and I presume that the FSA will have to ensure that it does not become too big a problem.
<P>
I throw in the issue of stamp duty, which is the biggest threat to companies maintaining their business in London. We now have one of the most expensive stamp duty regimes in the world, in contrast to the United States, Germany, Sweden and Switzerland, which charge zero stamp duty, and are big competitors of ours. However, that is a debate for another day.
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
What will be the FSA's role vis-à-vis regulation of approved persons who work in corporate finance departments of housing, who do the groundwork for bringing companies to the market to obtain a listing in London? We may face an absurd situation. The FSA may have given approval for members of staff of the corporate finance department of a merchant bank in London and said that they are fit and proper and up to the job. Those members of staff may perform their job as they see fit and bring a company to apply for a listing in London, but the FSA may decline approval for listing on the basis that the listing particulars have been incompetently handled by its own approved members in the merchant bank. Will the FSA then take disciplinary action against the corporate finance members of staff, whom it has approved, on the basis that it has not approved listing for a piece of work that they have performed? That is a rather circular argument, but conflicts of interest may be produced.
<P>
Finally, we have dealt only with fully listed companies. A whole raft of other companies— comprising the fastest growing part of the London market, and indeed the German market—are involved in the alternative investment market. At present, the AIM stock market is dealt with by a department within the London stock exchange. Obviously, such companies do not have to meet the full listings requirements, and face reduced regulations to obtain a reduced listing on the market. Who will look after AIM stocks in future? I may be missing something, but I cannot see where the AIM market is dealt with in any of the press releases.
<P>
Will the London stock market maintain its control over AIM stocks, or will that role also pass to the FSA? The Minister has not mentioned that part of the market, and as it is the fastest growing part, it is important. There have been serious problems with the requirements that the London stock exchange has maintained in the past with regard to AIM stocks, which have acted as a disincentive to new, fast-growing, high-tech companies, especially internet companies, achieving an AIM listing on the London market. That is a real, practical problem.
<P>
I realise that I have spoken at length on a number of technical issues, and I appreciate that these are relatively early days, but those issues may involve some fundamental conflicts of interests, and a whole new big role for the FSA providing new, potentially unlimited, source of revenue for it. We need to know how the FSA will deal with that revenue. Those are not questions that can await the FSA's rule book, because they go to the heart of how it will run its business, including the enormous new business that is to be placed on its shoulders.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> To answer the point raised by the Economic Secretary, I must say that the competent authority is a wide area for debate, and subsection (3) refers to future delegation to a committee of the stock exchange, or others. This is a wide area for debate, which is why I let the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham continue.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Thank you, Mr. O'Brien, for indulging this widened debate on part VI. As the Committee will be aware, the various clauses up to schedule 10 do not make significant changes to the present arrangements, so it is the general issues raised by the FSA taking on the role in part VI that we need to discuss.
<P>
I shall add some points to those made by my hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Mr. Loughton). First, there is the practical issue of the fact that the official list of the stock exchange includes closing prices. A business-type role goes with that function. It is strange to envisage a regulator getting involved in the matter, but it would be damaging if the official list cease to publish such information, which is relevant to valuations in many contexts.
<P>
My hon. Friend asked whether the FSA will have the necessary resources: there is the issue of the sheer scale of the role being taken on by the FSA. Have the Government considered whether there is any alternative to the FSA, given that the stock exchange is no longer willing to undertake the role? An important point, which will come up in clause 93, is that the Confederation of British Industry shares our view, as set out in an amendment to which we shall come later. Our view is that in the commercial role—which is quite distinct from its regulatory role—that the FSA will have of being the competent authority for listings, it would be inappropriate for it not to be capable of being sued for gross negligence. Is it envisaged that the FSA will check prospectuses, or that it will subcontract that task to another body?
<P>
We also have concerns about implicit new developments. The competent authority will effectively have a monopoly on determining, under the Treasury's direction, whether companies wanting to list can do so. The only basis for listing will be whether companies are in a group that the Treasury determines is suitable for listing. There used to be a second limb, before the EU practice on listing, which has disappeared.
<P>
So we will have a rather monopolistic situation in which the Treasury will decide what category of assets are competent for listing and the FSA—its godchild, so to speak—handling that. At present, for example, it is important for the funds business that funds are listed on the stock exchange in relation to individual sectors. The Treasury will have the power to decide that funds are not a suitable category for listing on the stock exchange.
<P>
Another power that is being given for the first time is the power of the competent authority, now the FSA, to level fines on directors in relation to listings. However, in the case of wrongdoing, the listing rules do not constitute the same protective mechanism given in warning notices that we discussed earlier. Are the Government considering the introduction of parallel procedures for that situation?
<P>
I thank the Minister for her statements. The Government may not be able to go further, given that it might have come as a slight shock to them that the stock exchange had decided not to be the listing authority; no doubt there are nightmare negotiations going on with the FSA. However, many major issues are involved. As my hon. Friend said, we have particular concerns about potential conflicts of interest and the ability of an organisation such as the FSA to handle the tasks associated with listing with the appropriate dexterity.
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> Opposition Members are right to raise some of those issues. It is important that the Government respond to several of them in more detail than I am able to provide this morning, and no doubt we shall do so at the appropriate time: however, I shall respond to some of them now.
<P>
The hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham was not sure about the number of listings, There are 2,600, which is a smaller number than the one he quoted.
<P>
Opposition Members raised questions about possible conflicts of interest and the work load of the FSA under the proposed changes. We will need to ensure that the FSA benefits from the expertise and experience of the stock exchange staff who work on listing matters. Both Ministers and the FSA consider it capable of performing the new function effectively and without detriment to its other responsibilities.
<P>
I also pointed out that in several other countries, such as the US, Japan, Germany and France, the competent authority function is carried out by the financial service regulatory body. The hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham spoke about Germany and France, where the situation parallels the one that we envisage.
<P>
The other point to be emphasised is that the London stock exchange felt that it would be inappropriate, following demutualisation, to continue with that function. The hon. Gentleman said that nothing much had changed because it was already a profit-making organisation, albeit a mutual one rather than a demutualised and full-profit organisation. However, all concerned feel that change is necessary.
<P>
It is not true that the FSA will be able to do whatever it wants; it will be limited in many ways. I am at pains to emphasise that, crucially, we maintain the ability to make the decision, should we want to, that the FSA not remain the competent authority.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> That point is relevant to schedule 7, which we shall consider next and which is all about part VI. Paragraph 7(2)(a) of schedule 7, which is on page 207, says that the FSA has the power to modify or exclude
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``any provision of Part VI in its application to any such functions''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Therefore, it has the power to change the rules at whim.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I note the hon. Gentleman's comments and I am sure that we can return to the subject later.
<P>
We envisage making provision to ensure that we are not confined in future to the FSA being the sole competent authority. There should be another port of call if that is proved to be appropriate by experience, practice and other developments yet to be foreseen.
<P>
The hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham also asked whether the FSA would have a role in maintaining market liquidity. That is mainly an issue for the exchanges themselves, as I am sure he knows. It is a commercial matter and, so far as the listing function is concerned, we will apply principles such as proportionality and regard for the international position.
<P>
The AIM stocks are not officially listed. An AIM quotation will remain for the stock exchange, and the FSA will be concerned only with official listing.
<P>
I shall now deal with the FSA's staff resources and the practical arrangements, taking into account the envisaged amendments that I mentioned earlier. The London stock exchange listing department currently has a staff of about 85. Initial estimates are that a minimum of around 70 of those staff will need to be transferred. We envisage that that will happen, but the final number will depend on the agreed scope of the function and the detailed practical arrangements. The FSA and the London stock exchange have established project offices, headed by full-time project managers to ensure a smooth transition.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
We do not envisage that the transition will happen immediately. As I have said, the proposal is that it will happen when the Bill is enacted. Obviously, that will not happen until next Easter or beyond, so there will be time to consider the practical arrangements as we continue to work on the Bill.
<P>
A point has been made about the FSA—the regulator—carrying out the listing. However, the FSA will not carry out the listing as the regulator, but as the competent authority. The hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham chose to skate over that important distinction.
<P>
As I have said, it is our general intention that the financial penalties will be subject to the usual procedures, but we shall consider the precise details carefully.
<P>
Paragraph 7(2)(a) to schedule 7 will give the Treasury the power to modify the provisions of part VI if it decides to transfer the function from the FSA. We believe that that power is necessary.
<P>
Opposition Members have told us about the issues that they think relevant, and their remarks have been helpful. Obviously, we shall table a substantial number of amendments to the clause, and I hope that we can now move on.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I am grateful to the Financial Secretary for the explanation that she has given. Obviously, much work on the detail remains to be done. I hope that we shall have an opportunity, perhaps before we consider the Bill on Report, to hear of the progress that has been made. Perhaps the Financial Secretary will write to us, giving detailed updates on the points that I have raised, especially those about conflict of interest and where the revenues will go, both of which are pertinent to this part of the Bill.
<P>
I shall make a brief point on the FSA's continuing role, about which I might say more in the debate on schedule 7. I do not think that it was fair of the Financial Secretary to say that I skated over the different roles of the FSA as regulator and as competent authority. I specifically raised that issue in relation to the five positions of the SEC in the United States. I wanted to know—it is still not clear—how those divisions will work in practice. The FSA seems to be a large melting pot without defined areas, so how will the divisions be kept apart? An awful lot of Chinese walls will be needed at Canary Wharf, and an additional one will be required to ensure the separation of the regulatory role from that of competent authority for those possible conflicts of interest that I have mentioned. Perhaps the Financial Secretary will explain such matters later.
<P>
Simply saying that market liquidity is not a role for the FSA is not good enough. Who will be responsible for such matters? Surely it is not just a matter for the markets. If clients cannot sell the stocks in which they invested on the advice of approved members of the FSA, because of a lack of liquidity in a market, they are being prejudiced against. The FSA will supposedly ensure that the clients of financial services companies are not left out in the cold or treated unfairly. I strongly maintain that someone must monitor liquidity. I should have thought that the FSA had a continuing and, indeed, an increasing role in such matters. That is another reason why I mentioned the other electronic markets. I was slightly puzzled when the Minister said that that was not pertinent. It is extremely pertinent. It is wonderful to set up all this great regulation to monitor financial services companies, but if the financial services companies cannot deal in those securities for their clients, there is a problem. We cannot see the wood for the trees. Will the Minister consider that point for our later discussions?
<P>
Finally, I am still puzzled about why AIM will remain with the London stock exchange. An AIM stock is just a junior listed stock and most AIM stocks seek to graduate to a full listing. They are not a completely different sort of company, but simply smaller companies that tend to have a shorter track record and do not have the capital pedigree of some of our big blue chips. Why is it no longer appropriate for the London stock exchange to look after the listings of blue chips when it still wants to look after the listings and get in the AIM listing revenue for looking after AIM stocks? I do not see the division there. It is still a useful source of revenue.
<P>
As I said earlier, because AIM is the fastest growing part of the market, there is potentially a lot of revenue coming in. The London stock exchange is, to coin a phrase, trying to have its cake and eat it. Surely the whole lot should go together. It is losing many of its key staff—although the Minister did not refer to that—to go to Canary Wharf as part of the listing particulars expertise—[Interruption.] I apologise if she did mention it, but I presume that it was going to happen anyway. That will surely mean that there will be fewer listing staff.
<P>
Ultimately there will be an overlap between the AIM teams and the listing teams at the London stock exchange, making sure that the AIM stocks are up to their AIM level listing and are also continuing to abide by those regulations. Technically, the AIM market could end up being much less well looked after. I therefore do not understand why the Minister is content for the London stock exchange to retain the AIM market after demutualisation, but to hand over other responsibilities to the FSA because it is no longer appropriate. It is an important point that the Minister skimmed over rather too quickly. She may want to respond to that now or at a later date. These are all pertinent points. The Government have not given enough thought to the weight of these considerations and how they will affect the whole of the FSA's functioning. It will have one heck of an increased role. These are important practical points and, as someone who has worked in markets, I foresee a problem.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I should like to ask the Minister three questions. Paragraph 3(c) deals with competition. The competent authority would be changed if
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``it has become appropriate or desirable, in order to encourage or facilitate competition or in connection with the organisation and functioning of one or more markets, for the functions to be transferred.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is slightly at odds with the competition objectives that we debated before the summer recess. It appears here that the Government have recognised competition as an objective. It was all very well when it was the London stock exchange that had to promote competition, but now, in this part of its functions at least, the FSA will have to have competition as an objective. Will the Minister clear up the apparent dichotomy regarding that issue?
<P>
The Minister has dealt with my second point; I am assured that the FSA could lose its role as the competent authority as set out under paragraph 5, entitled ``Better performance''. One criterion under which the authority could lose its role reads:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the competent authority's performance in discharging the functions has not been satisfactory''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Will the Minister give examples of how, practically, the FSA could lose its role as the competent authority? Let us be realistic. It would hardly reflect well on the competence and integrity of the FSA to perform its overall regulatory job if it did such a bad job that the Government took away its role as the competent authority for listing. It is highly unrealistic that the FSA could ever lose that role. I need further assurance that the FSA is as vulnerable as the London stock exchange and other bodies.
<P>
I was about to mention the further paragraph concerning modifying provision, but instead I would like to have a brief response on the two points that I have made.
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> Clause 69 mentions the possibility of the transfer of the competent authority's functions from the current competent authority to another body. Schedule 7 provides the Treasury with the power to transfer some or all of those functions, and sets out the circumstances in which that power might be exercised. We intend to keep a transfer power following the transfer of the function to the FSA. Contrary to the suggestion of the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham, Bills do not weigh up realism; they make provision for things to happen or not to happen. That provision has been included; the transfer power exists.
<P>
A transfer may occur only if the competent authority agrees in writing that that should be done, if one of three sets of circumstances arise, or if the Treasury believes that it is in the public interest to make the transfer. The three sets of circumstances to which I referred are set out in paragraphs 3, 4 and 5 to the schedule, as the hon. Gentleman mentioned.
<P>
The first circumstance, mentioned in paragraph 3, would arise if the competent authority faced actual or potential competition from another body in providing a market for listed securities and it appeared that that competition might be encouraged if a transfer occurred. In the light of the transfer of the competent authority role to the FSA, that will no longer apply.
<P>
The second circumstance would arise if the Director General of Fair Trading investigated the rules and practices of the competent authority and, on the basis of the resulting report, the Treasury concluded that those rules and practices had a significant anti- competitive effect. We could direct the competent authority to make necessary changes to its rules and practices. However, if the problem was serious enough, or formed part of a repeated series of anti-competitive rules, then we might wish to transfer the function. We shall review whether the provision is necessary, given the transfer to the FSA.
<P>
The third circumstance would arise if the Treasury concluded that the competent authority was conducting its functions in an unsatisfactory and inefficient way, and that the situation would be significantly improved by a transfer. That is common sense.
<P>
I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for the points that he has made, and will consider them as we work out the detail of those matters.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Schedule 7 agreed to.
<H4><center>Clause 70</center></H4>
<H4><center>The official list</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> Many clauses deal with detail; several merit further explanation, and this is one of them. Under clause 70(3)(b), the power will be given so that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the Treasury may by order provide that anything which falls within a description or category specified in the order may not be admitted to the official list.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Treasury will be able to ban companies from getting on to the official list. Why will the Treasury have those reserve powers? In what circumstances might it exercise them? Can it do so now, and, if so, has it ever done so?
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Although that power is qualified in the explanatory notes, which state that it would be exercised in the event of an undue risk to investors, it remains rather wide. If the Treasury is giving the responsibility to a competent authority—now, the FSA—why does it need to prevent certain companies that come up to scratch according to the rules of the FSA—the competent authority—from receiving a listing?
<P>
As we have already mentioned, subsection (4) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The competent authority may make ... (``listing rules'') for the purposes of this Part.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Who will check that those rules are sufficient? The hon. Member for Bexleyheath and Crayford (Mr. Beard) asked how that provision differs from the existing arrangement. The difference is that, at the moment, a regulator oversees the functions of the London stock exchange, while no regulator will oversee the FSA's role as the competent authority. How, therefore, can we be assured that the rules are sufficient? Will we have to rely on a company challenging them through the tribunal procedure?
<P>
The Economic Secretary mentioned earlier the additional powers being given to the FSA as the competent authority in determining what will qualify for the official list, which currently includes securities and other financial instruments, in relation to which she mentioned gilts. Another example would be covered warrants. Those two types of investments are like chalk and cheese: warrants are very high-risk investments; gilts are pretty dull, boringly safe investments. What risk assessment is being applied to the inclusion of those new forms of investment, which are being brought under one umbrella? A good deal of risk is attached to one class of those types of investment.
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> The power in clause 70(3)(b) is not to ban a particular issuer but to ensure that particular categories of investments are not admitted. The list currently comprises securities admitted under part IV of the Financial Services Act 1986, and investments that are not covered by the statutory regime but are admitted by the competent authority under contract with issuers, as in, for example, the case of gilts, which the hon. Gentleman mentioned.
<P>
The clause will alter that arrangement by providing for a single statutory regime for the official listing of all such securities and other instruments. Under that regime, the competent authority will have discretion in deciding whether to admit a particular security or instrument to the list.
<P>
The existing statutory regime under part IV of the 1986 Act permitted the listing only of defined classes of investments. The new provisions abandon that restrictive approach and give the competent authority wider discretion to include in the list an unrestricted range of different types of securities and other investments. However, subsection (3) provides the Treasury with a reserve power to specify that certain categories of financial instruments cannot be admitted. I do not anticipate that that power will be used, but it is necessary to ensure that the Treasury could prevent the admission of instruments if, for example, they were considered to pose an undue risk to investors.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Will the Minister elaborate on my earlier point? As far as I am aware, the Treasury's power to prevent certain categories of assets from being listed has never been used. I am not sure why it exists and whether it should be the responsibility of the competent authority. It has become more relevant now, because until now what could not be listed under that body of doctrine could be listed under the old EU arrangements. Now, however, a monolithic regime applies. I should like to know the circumstances in which the Treasury might want to use such powers. I made the point that it could be damaging if, for example, it was decided that it was no longer appropriate for bonds to be listed. That would have tremendous knock-on effects on their marketing in other parts of the world, where a qualification might be listed on a recognised stock exchange.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I apologise for not responding to the hon. Gentleman when he made that point. I hesitate to give examples because there will probably be a market in them shortly. The sorts of things that we might not want to have admitted to an official listing are certain investments where it may be difficult to provide information on value, for example, insurance contracts.
<P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I am glad to have another pop at this matter.
<P>
Clause 71 relates to applications for listing. The FSA, as the competent authority, can refusing listing if it
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``considers that granting it would be detrimental to the interests of investors.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Will the Minister explain how it would be determined that something was detrimental to the interests of investors? This goes slightly to the argument about risk and, ultimately, systemic risk, which was discussed by the Burns Committee.
<P>
For example, would Barings have qualified if it had applied for listing under the regulations of the FSA as the competent authority? The authority would have approved, as its predecessors did, the members of its staff who were responsible for the trading in Singapore that led to its downfall. The FSA would have approved Barings' staff and the compliance officers who worked there, and allowed it to trade as a securities house. Would the authority have allowed Barings to have qualified for a listing? Because of that listing function would the FSA have allowed consumers to purchase shares in Barings as a listed, publicly quoted company? Barings would still have gone bust, although, all the way through the audit trail, every person responsible would have been approved by the FSA, and every detail of ensuring that the company was up to listing standard would have been approved by the FSA in its role as competent authority authority. Every check to ensure that it was continuing its listing obligations would have been approved by the FSA as competent authority, yet Barings would still have gone bust, causing underlying members of the public who were shareholders—not only the bank's private shareholders, and its owners—to lose money. Ultimately, of course, each member of the public who lost money because of all that would have no comeback whatever on the FSA because it would be immune from prosecution and not obliged to award compensation under the complaints procedure.

<P>

<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> Clause 71 deals with the processing of applications for listing by the competent authority. It makes clear that the authority will consider only applications made by, or with, the consent of the issuer of securities in question and that an application will be granted only if it considers that the listing rules, and any other requirements, have been complied with. The clause also gives the authority specific power to refuse an application if it considers that granting it would be against the interests of investors, and to reject an application from an issuer whose securities are already listed in another European economic area state if he has failed to comply with the rules of that state.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> Will the Minister say whether the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``detrimental to the interests of investors''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
is taken to refer to detriment caused by systemic risk.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I am coming to the point about detriment.
<P>
The clause gives the Treasury the power to prohibit the authority from listing securities of a particular kind. It is intended to use the power to continue the prohibition under section 143 of the Financial Services Act on the listing of securities issued by a private company or an old public company.
<P>
The phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``detrimental to the interests of investors''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
in subsection (5) is the same provision as in the existing Act. It is derived from the directives and is necessary to ensure adequate investor protection. I shall not speculate about variants as that would be inappropriate.

<P>
Basically, if the FSA does not get its act together—tough.
<P>
How does the system operate at present? What is the typical time between an application for listing and it being granted by the London stock exchange? If it is anything like six months, I should have thought we were in trouble. Six months is far too long. We have not tabled amendments on that subject, but I should be grateful for the Minister's comments.
<P>
What if the FSA, as the competent authority, fails to issue approval for listing not because the company is not up to listing or because it has failed to fulfil the criteria—filling in the forms, having a financial track record and approved persons working in the corporate finance department of a merchant bank to do the paper work—but because the FSA is incompetent? The paper work may have been put at the bottom of the pile and the FSA may not come up with the approval within six months, through no fault of the applicant, but every fault of the FSA department acting as competent authority. It is terribly loaded on one side. The listing company may do everything that is required of it; it may be as blue chip as they come and an obvious candidate for listing, but because of the FSA's incompetence or recklessness in not getting its act together within six months, the listing may be lost. Will the Minister comment on that, as it seems very one-sided?
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> It will be helpful if I explain the process that we envisage as there are some elements that will help the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham.
<P>
The clause provides that the authority must notify the applicant of the outcome of his application within six months of receipt, or, if it has requested further information to assist in its consideration, within six months of receipt of that new information. If the authority does not make a decision within six months, the application is deemed to have been refused.
<P>
The clause also provides that when a security has been admitted, its listing will not subsequently be called into question on the ground that the formalities for listing were not properly completed. That provision is necessary to ensure that issuers and investors can have confidence that any dealings that they may have done were in a properly listed security.
<P>
None of these provisions is new. They simply maintain in force the existing legislation—section 144 of the Financial Services Act 1986. The hon. Gentleman said that six months is far too long. Again, that is provided for in the directive. There might be occasions on which the authority requests further information from an applicant but does not receive it. Clearly, the authority cannot approve an application until it receives that information. If it does not receive it, it would be wrong to allow the application to remain in indefinite suspended animation, not least because the information in the original application might become out of date.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The European directive on listing, which the Bill implements, provides that decisions on applications must be taken within six months of receipt of the application. In practice, however, most applicants would not be expected to wait that long. No doubt the FSA will want to tackle that concern when exercising the powers in the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I am grateful for that reply, although the Minister did not add anything to what is in the explanatory notes. Will she consider at some point whether it is fair to penalise a listing applicant for what could be FSA incompetence, even if—as she assured us—that does not prejudice the applicant's case for reapplying? Is it fair for there to be absolutely no comeback against the FSA under the complaints procedure for failing to grant a listing? That seems unfair in the natural course of things.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 72 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 73</center></H4>
<H4><center>Discontinuance and suspension of Listing</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> Clause 73 deals with the suspension of listing and there is nothing controversial about it. The normal reasons for suspending a share pertain—financial irregularities, failure to produce financial information or whatever.
<P>
The one scenario that I would query is the suspension of a listing due to wild movements in share prices. Will the FSA have a role in that regard? At the moment, the stock exchange requires a listed company to explain movements in its share price and can suspend its listing until it does so. Given that a differentiation is to be made between the stock exchange acting as competent authority and controlling the market, in addition to exercising its exchange functions, the FSA will be slightly detached. None the less, such movements are a legitimate reason for suspending a share.
<P>
Is there any intention, as happens in other markets, for shares to be automatically suspended if their price moves beyond a certain parameter? That arrangement is intended to prevent a crash in the share price and undue speculation, which leads to prices overheating and which might suck consumers in to a false market in shares. Will the Minister comment on irregular movements in share price issue?
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> As the hon. Gentleman said, circumstances sometimes arise which mean that normal dealings in listed securities cannot take place. For example, a company might fail to comply with reporting requirements in the listing rules so that investors and potential investors have insufficient information to make informed decisions about whether to deal in a company's securities. A company might also be in financial difficulties, which it has not clarified or quantified. To protect investors in those circumstances and to protect the smooth operation of the market, the clause gives the competent authority the powers that it currently has under section 145 of the Financial Services Act 1986 to suspend or discontinue the listing of a company's securities. During a suspension, trading in the securities cannot take place on a recognised investment exchange.
<P>
As regards market volatility, the directives provide for the competent authority to suspend listing if necessary for the smooth operation of the market.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

Clause 73 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 74</center></H4>
<H4><center>Listing particulars and other documents</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 366, in page 34, line 36, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`, but shall not include offerors making an offer together with the issuer'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
For a change, we have an amendment to consider, which is nice. The clause deals with listing particulars and other documents. The amendment raises a practical consideration and we wonder whether the drafters of the Bill have taken it into consideration. Clause 74(3) provides for those persons responsible for listing particulars to be determined in accordance with the regulations by the Treasury. As we will shortly see under clause 83 such persons are potentially liable to pay compensation for untrue or misleading statements or omissions in their listings particulars.
<P>
One situation that has caused difficulty in the past is where the company publishing listing particulars issues new shares at the same time as an existing shareholder, typically a venture capital company that has taken a stake in a company at a much earlier stage, is selling shares. The new and existing shares will be offered at the same time pursuant to the same listing particulars. In those circumstances, given that the listing particulars will be prepared by the company itself, it does not seem appropriate that the selling shareholder should also be responsible for the listing particulars. There will be a double work load there.
<P>
The amendment provides that the people responsible for listing particulars will not include the offerers—those other shareholders such as the venture capital company or indeed private individuals—where the offer is made together with the issue. This is a practical amendment to prevent duplication of that role and the extra costs and compliance requirements that would fall on a smaller shareholder.

<P>

<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> As hon. Members will know, the purpose of listing particulars is to set out the information which investors would reasonably expect in order to make an informed assessment about the assets and liabilities, financial position, profits and losses and the prospects of the issuer as well as information about the securities themselves, such as the voting rights. Without that information the risks of investing would obviously be far greater. This would be detrimental to investors and issuers as well as fewer would buy their securities and at a lower price than otherwise.
<P>
Clause 74 gives the competent authority the power to require the production of listing particulars before securities can be admitted to listing. We need to give them this power in order to implement the directives properly.
<P>
Subsection (3) goes on to give the Treasury the power to make regulations to determine just who is responsible for preparing listing particulars. Obviously it is important to be clear about who has responsibility both so that the competent authority can take action if there is a failure to meet those responsibilities and so that investors who have lost out can claim compensation.
<P>
The persons responsible for listing particulars are currently set out in section 152 of the Financial Services Act 1986. Broadly speaking, these are the issuer of the securities and the directors where it is a company, and any other person who has authorised or accepted responsibility for the listing particulars or any part of them.
<P>
We have taken a power to be able to specify those responsible for listing particulars in secondary legislation to ensure that we can make any necessary alterations if the kind of investments that are admitted to listing change. We do not, though, intend to take a different approach now from that taken by section 152 of the Financial Services Act. As I said, understand it, the amendment would stop us making regulations which made offerers of securities responsible for listing particulars where they make an offer together with an issuer.
<P>
As I said, we are not proposing to change the effect of section 152 through our regulations, so we would not place obligations on people in this circumstance where no obligation currently exists.
<P>
For example, at present where a company issues shares, existing shareholders who are not directors, who have not agreed to become directors and who have not accepted responsibility for what is in the listing particulars, are not responsible for the listing particulars. That is only sensible. Why should they have any responsibility in this case? I presume that that is what the Opposition amendment is designed to capture.
<P>
The effect of the Opposition amendment would be to create a significant problem. Although it would stop offerors being responsible in this circumstance, it would also stop them being responsible if they were or had agreed to be a director or had taken responsibility for something in the listing particulars. I am sure that that is not what the hon. Gentleman intended.
<P>
I hope that in the light of my assurances about the exercise of our power under clause 74(3)—which we will, of course, exercise in a reasonable manner—the hon. Gentlemen will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I am grateful to the Minister. We will not press the amendment, but I am not entirely reassured by her comments. I understand the overlap when directors are offerors as well as directors of companies applying for the listing. I cited the specific example of venture capital holders who may not have a director role within the company. I heard what the Minister said, but I am not convinced that they would be free from the additional requirements. A degree of overlap remains and has proved a problem in the past. That is why we tried to improve section 152 of the 1986 Act. The amendment would provide some extra definition and I am not convinced that it would create a problem rather than help to avoid some overlap.
<P>
I would be grateful if the Minister would ponder further on that with her officials. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 138, in page 38, line 29, at end—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(6) The competent authority approved for the purpose of this section (the ``non-listing competent authority'') may be different from the competent authority appointed for the purpose of section 69 and in any such case references in Part VI to the competent authority shall in the case of a non-listing prospectus be construed as references to the non-listing competent authority.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Having sped through the previous clauses, we must now debate an amendment to clause 82. It deals with the approval of the prospectus when there is no application for listing. We want the Minister to respond to a technicality.
<P>
The amendment may have been superseded by events. We tabled it some time ago when we were looking ahead. It would have allowed the Treasury to appoint the FSA as the prospectus regulator for EASDAQ or trade point dealt stocks while retaining the stock exchange for listings. At the time, we could not see that that was already allowed under schedule 7. There may still be an alternative to the FSA being the competent authority for non-listing prospectuses—
