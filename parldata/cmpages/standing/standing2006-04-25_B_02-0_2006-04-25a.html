<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042548000360"></a>The

Chairman:</b> I remind the Committee that with this we are

discussing amendment No. 28, in page 12, line 40, leave out subsection

(3).</div><a name="06042548000031"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06042548000361"></a><b class="B">Lembit

&#214;pik</b> (Montgomeryshire) (LD): Welcome aboard, Mr.

Atkinson. You join us at an exciting, nail-biting moment in

proceedings.</div> <a name="06042548000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, I

apologise to the Minister. I recognise that the poor, poor Minister of

State for the Northern Ireland Office, the hon. Member for Delyn (Mr.

Hanson), always seems to get the bum&#146;s rush when it comes to

this sort of legislation, with the Opposition becoming increasingly

annoyed with the Government&#146;s position. I also assure him that

although I feel great warmth for him personally and have a lot of

respect for his capabilities, we do not seek to provoke him or the

Government for any spurious reason. I and my hon. Friend the Member for

Argyll and Bute (Mr. Reid) genuinely feel the concerns that we have

raised.</div> <a name="06042548000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">I move

swiftly on to conclude my points about amendment No. 3. In essence, the

recent history of politics in Westminster in relation to the

Government&#146;s fundraising efforts shows how any political party

will seek to gain advantage using any loophole that it is possible to

find. The Government should not be surprised that we are so concerned

about giving Ministers the opportunity to extend the prescribed period

under the clause. We should remember also that at least one party in

Northern Ireland has considerable previous form when it comes to taking

advantage of what one might call illegitimate fundraising techniques.

</div><a name="06042548000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister&#146;s

position would carry more gravity if he were willing to accept that the

exercise is one in risk management rather than risk elimination. What

slightly irks us is that the Minister seems to suggest that the

Government&#146;s solution is perfect and our concerns are not

necessarily legitimate. When the Minister responds to my amendment and

to amendment No. 28, which seems to do much the same, will he be a

little more balanced in recognising that our concerns are legitimate

and they come down to matters of judgment? When it comes to such

matters of judgment, those on the Opposition Benches and the 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column43" />Column number: 43</div>Members of Parliament who represent constituencies in Northern Ireland

have plenty of circumstantial evidence to suggest that if things are

not tied down tightly and made transparent, that opaqueness will be

used to maximum advantage by those who have taken much more dramatic

and illegal measures to raise money before.</div>

<a name="06042548000035"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06042548000362"></a><b class="B">Lady

Hermon</b> (North Down) (UUP): It is a pleasure to sit under

your chairmanship this afternoon,Mr. Atkinson. It is not long

since some of us sat under your chairmanship in the Northern Ireland

Grand Committee, in a lively meeting if I remember correctly. This

afternoon might not be so lively, but I am sure that it will be well

conducted.</div> <a name="06042548000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">I rise to

support the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire

(Lembit &#214;pik) and also to speak to the related amendment No. 28,

which I tabled.</div>

<a name="06042548000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 17 is an interesting

provision and has to be read in conjunction with schedule 2. Clause 17

declares in the definition

section:</div><a name="06042548000298"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;During

the prescribed period, the 2000

Act&#148;&#151;</div><a name="06042548000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">that

is the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act

2000&#151;will apply</div>

<a name="06042548000299"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in relation to Northern Ireland

subject to the modifications in Schedule

1.&#148;</div><a name="06042548000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">That application is a

welcome one.</div><a name="06042548000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will

not go into the modifications in schedule 1 in detail, because we will

have an opportunity later, but they mean that for the first time

political parties will have to notify the Electoral Commission of

donations, in secrecy. It is the Electoral Commission&#146;s duty to

keep strictly confidential the detail of donations given to political

parties and disclosed to the commission by political parties in

Northern Ireland during what is intended to be and is described as

&#147;the prescribed period&#148;.</div>

<a name="06042548000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">According to clause

17(2):</div><a name="06042548000300"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;&#145;The

prescribed period&#146; means the

period&#151;</div><a name="06042548000301"></a><div class="hs_brev">(a)

starting with 1st November 2007,

and</div><a name="06042548000302"></a><div class="hs_brev">(b) ending with

31st October 2010.&#148;</div><a name="06042548000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">My

amendment would remove the following damaging proviso in clause 17(3),

whereby:</div><a name="06042548000303"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The

Secretary of State may by order amend paragraph (b) of subsection (2)

so as to extend the prescribed

period.&#148;</div><a name="06042548000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not wish

that provision to appear in the final legislation for several good

reasons. The first is the Secretary of State&#146;s statement on

Second Reading. I shall quote his words directly. This is not an

invention by the Ulster Unionist party. The Secretary of State for

Northern Ireland gave the House an assurance that</div>

<a name="06042548000304"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the Bill will require Northern

Ireland parties, for the first time, to comply with the rules set out

under the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000, which

require donations over a certain amount to be declared to the Electoral

Commission. However, to take account of the continuing concerns about

the possibility of donor intimidation in Northern Ireland, for a

transitional period, donations to Northern Ireland parties will be

checked privately by the Electoral Commission...That period will

run from November 2007

and&#148;&#151;</div><a name="06042548000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">these are

the important words&#151;</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column44" />Column number: 44</div><a name="06042548000305"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;pave the way for full transition

to complete transparency, as in the rest of the UK, in October 2010,

which remains the Government&#146;s goal.&#151;[<i class="I">Official

Report</i>, 13 March 2006; Vol. 443, c.

1175.]</div><a name="06042548000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">That was the clear

assurance given to the House.</div>

<a name="06042548000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">The difficulty with the clause

is when it is read in conjunction with that statement. It was

unfortunate that the Secretary of State did not continue in his remarks

on Second Reading to explain that through subsections (3) and (4), he,

as the Secretary of State, may extend the prescribed period so that it

does not end on 31 October 2010. Subsection (4) states that instead, he

may by order extend that period every two years:</div>

<a name="06042548000306"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The power to make an

order...may be exercised on more than one occasion, but the

prescribed period must not be extended for more than 2 years at a

time.&#148;</div><a name="06042548000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Secretary of

State may extend once, twice, three

times&#151;indefinitely.</div>

<a name="06042548000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hoped that when the Secretary

of State said to the House on Second Reading that as in the rest of the

United Kingdom, Northern Ireland was in full transition to complete

transparency in October 2010, the Bill would put that into effect. On

close scrutiny of this clause, particularly subsections (3) and (4),

however, that will not be the effect. Full transparency could be

delayed indefinitely on the whim of the Secretary of State every two

years by an Order in Council. I refuse to allow that power to be given

to the Secretary of State, and I therefore wish to see the Minister

adopt the amendment.</div>

<a name="06042548000049"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042548000363"></a>The

Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office(Mr. David

Hanson):</b> I join the other members of the Committee in

welcoming you to the Chair for this afternoon&#146;s sitting, Mr.

Atkinson. You may or may not be needed for a further sitting later in

the week or next week. Who knows?</div>

<a name="06042548000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thank hon. Members for

raising their points and tabling the amendments before us. For the hon.

Members for North Down (Lady Hermon) and for Montgomeryshire, I shall

put on record straight away that it is the Government&#146;s wish and

intention that Northern Ireland becomes part of the overall regime on

transparency of donations as soon as is practicable. We have provided

under clause 17 that the period between 1 November 2007 and 31 October

2010 will be the prescribed period. For reasons that I explained

earlier to my hon. Friend the Member for Belfast, South (Dr.

McDonnell), we have disapplied the regulations on publication of

donations, because there is the potential for intimidation and there

are concerns about threats. The situation in Northern Ireland, although

becoming more stable, remains potentially unstable, and we have

disapplied the order for those

reasons.</div><a name="06042548000051"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042548000364"></a>Lady

Hermon:</b> Bearing in mind the much

quoted&#151;particularly by the Northern Ireland Office and

Government Ministers&#151;statement from the IRA

that</div><a name="06042548000307"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Volunteers

must not engage in any other activities

whatsoever&#148;,</div><a name="06042548000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">where does

the Minister anticipate the intimidation of those who donate to

political parties coming from?</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column45" />Column number: 45</div><a name="06042548000053"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042548000365"></a>Mr.

Hanson:</b> I am grateful for the hon. Lady&#146;s

intervention. She will know that I anticipate and very much hope, as

will every democrat in Northern Ireland and elsewhere, that the next

two to three years and beyond will see the continued building of

stability in the security situation in Northern Ireland that is

potentially there. The hon. Lady will know also that because of the

special circumstances in Northern Ireland, there is still potential for

the intimidation of people who donate to political parties, for

long-held enmities to continue, and for that to be manifested in

intimidation or, as has been put to me by political parties during the

discussions, threats to businesses that donate to political parties and

others.</div><a name="06042548000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope and

appreciate that normality will continue to grow, but the Bill includes

a provision for the anonymous registration of donations, monitored by

the Electoral Commission for that three-year period from 2007 to 2010,

because the threat of that intimidation may still exist and be of

concern. Legislation can be changed, but the provision is there for the

Secretary of State to have the power to make the order post-2010 for a

period of up to two years. Although I accept fully that the situation

may be normal by 2010, and the Secretary of State may not need to apply

the power, I would rather include it in case a situation arises in 2010

whereby the future Secretary of State, for whatever reason or judgment,

determines that he or she cannot make those applications and funding

documents public&#151;as is done in my constituency and in those of

my hon. Friends&#151;and must continue to disapply the

order.</div><a name="06042548000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not expect

that we will reach that situation. I expect fully that by 2010, we will

be in a situation of normality in which the Secretary of State can say

that in Belfast, North Down, Foyle and Belfast, South provisions will

be applied in exactly the same way that they are in my constituency and

in that of the Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, my hon.

Friend the Member for St. Helens, South(Mr. Woodward). I

fully expect that to be the case. However, if the Bill did not include

the provision for the Secretary of State to make those decisions, which

the amendments tabled by the hon. Members for Montgomeryshire and for

North Down seek to delete, and in 2010, we reach a situation whereby we

feel it is not practical to lift the disapplication, we would have to

bring primary legislation before the House. This clause provides the

Secretary of State with the order-making power to take the decision to

extend the disapplication for a maximum of two years, if he so wishes.

That power would also be subject to the confidence of the House of

Commons and another place through a

vote.</div><a name="06042548000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Members

for Montgomeryshire and for North Down are concerned about giving the

Secretary of State powers to extend the order. The Secretary of State

will not want to exercise that power, because our wish is to achieve

normality in Northern Ireland on a par with my constituency and those

of my hon. Friends. The power is there in case that situation does not

arise and the Secretary of State at that time needs to extend the

disapplication.</div><a name="06042548000057"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042548000366"></a>Lady

Hermon:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for taking another

intervention. I may have misheard 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column46" />Column number: 46</div>him&#151;I do not think that I did&#151;but he stated that the

Secretary of State will have the power to extend the provision for a

maximum of two

years.</div><a name="06042548000058"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042548000367"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042548000368"></a>Lady

Hermon:</b> Precisely. I just wanted the Minister to confirm

that a Secretary of State will be able repeatedly to extend the

provision for two years at a time, which is the wording in the

clause.</div><a name="06042548000320"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.15

pm</div><a name="06042548000060"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042548000369"></a>Mr.

Hanson:</b> The hon. Lady did not mishear me. I said that the

Secretary of State can undertake to extend the order by a maximum of

two years at a time. Each time that he does so, it must be confirmed by

this House and by another place in an order before the House. I have

said to the hon. Lady and to the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire that

the purpose of the legislation is to ensure that provision for

donations in Northern Ireland is put on a par with that in the rest of

the United Kingdom. The disapplication period will last for three years

in order to cover the points of concern that have been put to us, for

instance, by my hon. Friend the Member for Belfast, South.</div>

<a name="06042548000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">That disapplication period will

end in 2010, but if at that time, the Secretary of State judges that

they need to extend it, he, or she, can do so for two years, subject to

a vote in this House and in another place. But that will be the case

only if that is the situation at the time, which I do not expect. I

hope that it will be recognised that our intention is to apply the

provision uniformly across the United Kingdom. That is the

Bill&#146;s intention, but we have the reserve power, in order to

save further primary legislation, if the situation

deteriorates.</div><a name="06042548000062"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042548000370"></a>Lembit

&#214;pik:</b> I understand the Minister&#146;s position.

I have two thoughts about that. First, the irony of the

Government&#146;s intention is that the provision will give the

paramilitaries the opportunity to determine Government policy because

as long as the paramilitaries are willing to intimidate people who give

money to parties, the Government will have a justification for

extending the provision that we are

discussing.</div><a name="06042548000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,

I have another, perhaps even greater, concern: I have warned the

Government repeatedly that as long as it looks like there is a plan B,

plan A will not get as much support as it otherwise would. Everything

that the Minister has said suggests to me that the Government are

planning for a potential impasse or failure, or a situation in which

such intimidation

persists.</div><a name="06042548000064"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042548000371"></a>Mr.

right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, my hon. Friends the Members

Minister&#146;s voice. I do not want to provoke him because I do not

want to give the evidently false impression that I think that the

Government expect failure. Nor do I think that he is anticipating that

the legislation will fail. But to be equally precise, I observe

inclause 17, as I have in his language, a desire to keep the

option open.</div> <a name="06042548000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">Anybody

who has been involved in such matters for a long time will agree that

the Minister needs to recognise that when the Government keep their

options open, they keep open also the options of those who would resist

what the Government want. That is the difficulty with having a plan

B&#151;I am always advising the Government not to build one in as a

subtext to the primary message of

legislation.</div><a name="06042548000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not

think that the Minister his hoping for, or expecting failure, or

anything like that. However, by saying, &#147;We need to keep the

provision in case something goes wrong and we have to extend the

prescribed period,&#148; he is adding to the culture of expectation

demonstrated repeatedly by those who resist the process and who will

say, &#147;Okay Government, you have given yourself a way forward

here, even if we disagree, go ahead and use that extension

order.&#148; That is why I am opposed to this part of the

legislation. I think that the hon. Member for North Down has a slightly

different take on the matter, but at the end of the day, the sum total

is the same.</div><a name="06042548000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is not

worth dividing the Committee on the matter, but I should like to

reserve the right to return to it on Report, following further

amendment is very simple and could be described as a probing amendment.

I would like, as I believe would many others, to be reassured by the

Minister that information that is given to the Electoral Commission

will be held in a safe place, preferably in London rather than Belfast.

The reason for that is simple. In the period between now and

2010&#151;and afterwards if necessary&#151;there will be a serious

risk that information that has been disclosed, but not publicly

disclosed, will be leaked. We would like it not to be leaked, but if it

is, we do not want the wrong 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column48" />Column number: 48</div>people to be blamed. We do not want staff in a Belfast office

automatically getting the blame.</div>

<a name="06042548000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">More fundamentally, we are

fully aware that paramilitary organisations have sought at times to

gather information in the public sector. As I said in our debate this

morning, a member of the Real IRA was convicted in October 2004 after

he had accessed a number of personal details from records held at the

Royal Victoria hospital in Belfast. There have also been times, dare I

say, when there have been leaks from the Northern Ireland Office to

hon. Members across the Committee. It appears that in 2002 the IRA was

operating a spy ring inside the NIO. Those are some of the reasons, and

they are enough justification to say that information kept in Belfast

might not be as safe as it would be if it were kept

elsewhere.</div><a name="06042548000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am keen

to have some reassurance from the Minister that information that has

been disclosed will be kept in a safe place. Should I get that, I shall

be very happy to withdraw the amendment.</div>

<a name="06042548000075"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042548000374"></a>Mr.

Hanson:</b> I fully understand what my hon. Friend is trying

to achieve, and I have some sympathy with the points that he makes.

However, I do not think that it would be appropriate for us to put such

things in primary legislation; that should be an operational matter for

the Electoral Commission. My officials in the Northern Ireland Office

have discussed with the Electoral Commission the location and security

of any records that might be made under this legislation. It has

indicated that so far as it is aware, provisionally until the Bill

becomes law, the intention is that it should not hold any donation

reports from Northern Ireland in premises in Belfast. I hope that that

reassures my hon. Friend. The security of information is particularly

important to the Commission; it takes it very seriously and is aware of

the sensitivities in relation to Northern Ireland. While it is an

operational matter and I hope that the legislation will not fetter it,

the concerns that my hon. Friend has expressed are understood by the

Electoral Commission and, having discussed the matter with my

officials, I have every confidence that it will act

appropriately.</div><a name="06042548000076"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042548000375"></a>Lady

about the estimated cost of the Electoral Commission&#146;s providing

statute

book?</div><a name="06042548000077"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042548000376"></a>Mr.

Hanson:</b> I do not have to hand an estimate of the potential

cost, but let me put it into context. The Electoral Commission is

already undertaking that role for parliamentary constituencies and for

parties in Scotland, England and Wales. We are adding to its burden by

some 18 parliamentary constituencies, and the political parties that

operate in Northern Ireland. While I do not have an estimate of the

costs involved, I suspect that their overall impact on the legislation

will be marginal, because they will relate to an operation that the

Electoral Commission already undertakes.</div>

<a name="06042548000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">If I have any figures to hand

in due course, I shall write to the hon. Lady. However, the costs are

marginal and the commission is content to undertake the work. Given

that, I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Belfast, South will

feel able to withdraw the amendment.</div>

Laurence Robertson</b> (Tewkesbury) (Con): I welcome you to

the Committee, Mr. Atkinson. I apologise for arriving slightly late for

this afternoon&#146;s sitting. I do not want to speak for long on the

clause, but I am slightly concerned about the power that it gives to

the Secretary of State. I was wondering whether the Minister would

explain why it is necessary. As one or two hon. Members have commented

to me, we spend time on a Bill and then we reach clause 18, which shows

that it can all change by order.</div>

<a name="06042548000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 18(2) states:</div>

if issues are important enough they should be in the Bill. We can then

see what we are considering passing or rejecting, and have the

opportunity to debate the issues, not just in statutory instrument

Committees, which inevitably contain only a limited number of hon.

Members. If things are in the Bill, the whole House has the opportunity

to discuss them. So, will the Minister explain why clause 18 is

necessary?</div><a name="06042548000086"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06042548000379"></a><b class="B">Mr.

Alan Reid</b> (Argyll and Bute) (LD): It isa

pleasure to serve under your chairmanship,Mr. Atkinson. I

share the concerns of the hon. Member for Tewkesbury (Mr. Robertson).

We spend time scrutinising legislation, and we reach this clause, which

gives the Secretary of State sweeping powers to amend Acts of

Parliament. We are creating a culture of the Secretary of State being

given sweeping powers, particularly in relation to Northern Ireland

business.</div> <a name="06042548000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not

understand why such powers are necessary in this case. The Secretary of

State has powers under the previous clauses that we have debated. I do

not see why we need this sweeping clause, which gives him the power to

do more or less anything he likes to various Acts of

Parliament.</div>

<a name="06042548000088"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042548000380"></a>Mr.

Hanson:</b> I am grateful for the points that have been made.

The simple fact is that we have proposed that the Secretary of State

have this power because we hope that the situation will improve and

that we can introduce the regulations before 2010. The provisions give

the power for the Secretary of State, in conjunction with the Electoral

Commission and by order before the House of Commons and another place,

to change the provisions in clause 17.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column50" />Column number: 50</div><a name="06042548000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have said all along that the

disapplication period in clause 17 applies until 2010, and we have

given the Secretary of State powers to extend that if the situation is

worse. The provision in clause 18 allows him to amend the previous

clauses by order confirmed by this House, in conjunction with the

Electoral Commission, if we feel that the provisions of the legislation

need to apply at an earlier date.</div>

<a name="06042548000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope, as I am sure other hon.

Members present do, that the situation will arise whereby we are able

to bring normality to the funding situation in Northern Ireland earlier

than 2010. The provision simply gives the Secretary of State the power

to do that. I hope that offers an explanation. Hon. Members might

remain concerned about the matter. I must repeat that the Secretary of

State cannot just exercise the power. It will be exercised in

consultation with the Electoral Commission. If hon. Members know Mr.

Younger, its current chairman, they would know that the Electoral

Commission would have strong views should the Secretary of State

exercise the power in an inappropriate way.</div>

<a name="06042548000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the Secretary of State were

to determine that the scheme should be brought forward or ended because

the situation had improved, he would need both Houses of Parliament to

endorse his decision. That is the reason why the clause is included in

the Bill. Given that explanation, I hope that hon. Members will allow

it to stand part of the Bill, as drafted.</div>

16, line 5, leave out &#145;2010&#146; and insert

&#145;2008&#146;.</div><a name="06042548000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">In

this most miscellaneous of miscellaneous Bills, we are now moving on to

something completely different. This clause takes us away from

donations to political parties, away from the Chief Electoral Officer,

and into part 6 of the Bill, which is headed

&#147;Miscellaneous&#148;. The first of the miscellaneous items

that appears under clause 23 is arms decommissioning. I say with some

sadness that once again we are being asked to extend an amnesty

period.</div> <a name="06042548000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">I wish to

bring to the Committee&#146;s attention the words of a Secretary of

State for Northern Ireland:</div>

<a name="06042548000311"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In the face of IRA

decommissioning, I cannot see what possible reason loyalists now have

for retaining their weapons. They certainly need not do so for the

protection of their communities, which is the rightful preserve of the

police and the security forces. They used to argue that they would

decommission if the IRA made the first move. Well, the first move has

been made: the crucial act has been carried out. It is now up to

loyalist paramilitary organisations to demonstrate their support of

peaceful and democratic ideals.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report,

room would say, &#147;Hear, hear,&#148; to that. Was that the

current Secretary of State? No. Was it his immediate predecessor? No.

Those words are in fact five years old. They were delivered by the

current Secretary of State for Defence over five years ago. On that

occasion, the House was being asked to consider, yet

again,the Northern Ireland Arms Decommissioning (Amendment)

Bill to extend the original decommissioning period for five

years.</div> <a name="06042548000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">Five years

ago, the then Secretary of State made it quite clear that in a

democracy politics and violence do not mix. He insisted that if the IRA

had moved on decommissioning&#151;and it had at that

stage&#151;then loyalists had no excuse for not doing likewise. I am

exceedingly concerned and disappointed that the Government now choose,

under clause 23, to send completely mixed messages to

loyalists.</div> <a name="06042548000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

Government, the Northern Ireland Office and the current Secretary of

State all love to quote from the Independent Monitoring Commission

report when it suits them; if I might, I shall refer to the

IMC&#146;s eighth report, published on 1 February 2006. I know that

there is another current IMC report involving both Governments, but it

has not been published and made available to the wider world in time

for our

consideration.</div><a name="06042548000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me

just remind Members about the activities of loyalist paramilitaries.

Where do I start? There are so many&#151;the Ulster Volunteer Force,

the Red Hand Commando, the Loyalist Volunteer Force. They were

responsible for the feuding that led to the deaths of four individuals.

East Belfast members of the Ulster Defence Association were

responsible, in the view of the IMC, for the murder on 4 October of

their fellow member, Jim Gray, who was on bail following his arrest.

Unfortunately, the litany of carnage caused by loyalist paramilitaries

continues, according to the IMC, and the statistics are well

known.</div><a name="06042548000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">The current

Secretary of State challenged loyalist paramilitaries on 21 September

2005, when he said:</div>

<a name="06042548000312"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The choice for loyalist

paramilitaries is clear: play the political role that you claim as your

motive, or face the rigour of the law as the mafia organisations into

which you seem to be degenerated. You will not be allowed to terrorise

your own community&#148;.</div><a name="06042548000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">If

that is what the Northern Ireland Office really expects of loyalist

paramilitaries, why in heaven&#146;s name is it at the same time

sending out the contradictory message to them and others&#151;the

Continuity IRA, the Real IRA&#151;that a deadline for arms

decommissioning is not really a deadline and that there will continue

to be an amnesty not just for five years, and then another five years,

but right up to 2010? I am sure that, at that stage, the Secretary of

State, whoever it is, will bring more legislation before the House to

extend the

amnesty.</div><a name="06042548000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">For once,

could the Government just mean what they say? Pledges were given to the

people of Northern Ireland not so long ago that the amnesty period had

a cut-off time of 2007. Instead of now extending it to 2010, let us

just delete the reference. I know that my amendment substitutes the

date 2008, which tries to find a middle way, but I just want a clear

message to be sent, particularly to loyalist paramilitaries:

&#147;Enough is enough; get on with the

decommissioning.&#148;</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042548000382"></a>Dr.

McDonnell:</b> I admitted earlier that I was pleased to serve

in the Committee under your chairmanship, Mr.

Atkinson.</div><a name="06042548000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">We in the

Social Democratic and Labour party share the frustration of the hon.

Member for North Down that decommissioning has been such a long

drawn-out process. We are outraged that many of the groups have not

decommissioned at all. Dissident republican factions justify their

refusal to end violence and destroy their weapons, based on a fairly

warped understanding of Irish history which Irish people do not

generally share. They claim that in making their bombs, as they did

last week in Lurgan, they are somehow upholding the will of the Irish

people.</div><a name="06042548000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">The people of

Ireland, whether nationalist or Unionist, want and deserve a peaceful

future. If dissident republicans care anything, or have any respect for

what they claim to be the will of the people, they have no option but

to destroy their weapons now and go away.</div>

<a name="06042548000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">As for loyalist paramilitary

groups, as tomorrow&#146;s IMC report will doubtless make clear, they

remain active and, to my mind, dangerous. They are dangerous to

themselves and each other, but far more importantly, to the general

public. The UDA and the UVF have yet to decommission a single bullet.

Their spokesmen openly say that that is not even on their agenda. It is

disgraceful that the Democratic Unionist parties and the Government

have, at best, not put them under any serious pressure to get rid of

their arms and ammunition. In some cases, they have offered ready-made

excuses for them.</div><a name="06042548000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">I

shall give an example. Last February, after a meeting with the

international decommissioning body, the DUP leader predicted that the

IRA had held on to some guns and said that loyalist people should be

forearmed to meet what was going to happen. In other words, he

predicted that there would be a further outbreak of IRA violence.

Whatever was meant by that, those who carry guns and call themselves

loyalists will have only one interpretation of it: &#147;Hold on to

your guns, guys, because you&#146;re going to need them.&#148; Such

inflammatory remarks have shown a serious lack of leadership on the

part of the leader of the DUP and a reckless disregard for the safety

of the public.</div> <a name="06042548000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">There

is only one message that needs to be given to the loyalist paramilitary

groups, and I appeal to hon. Members on the other side of the Committee

to give it. It is the same as the one that we are giving and have given

loud and clear to republicans and to dissident republicans. We loudly,

clearly and unambiguously say: &#147;Wind up all your activity.

Destroy your guns now, and leave people in the island of Ireland, both

nationalists and Unionists, to the peaceful and democratic future that

they all deserve.&#148;</div>

<a name="06042548000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have a lot of sympathy with

the amendment proposed by the hon. Member for North Down. 2010 is a

long time for the amnesty to continue, but as I understand it, just

because the option is there to allow an amnesty until then does not

mean that it will be allowed to go on until then. Is the Minister

prepared to give some sort undertaking that, even though there is an

option to keep the amnesty until 2010, it will not necessarily be left

until that very backstop position? Such an assurance from the Minister

would go a long way. I would find it difficult not to support the 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column53" />Column number: 53</div>Government. But 2010 is a long way off and we need a strong reassurance

that that is the final backstop position and that there will be no

further extensions and excuses and that no further allowances will be

made.</div><a name="06042548000111"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042548000383"></a>Lembit

&#214;pik:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes a vain request. My

whole frustration on the previous amendment was that the Government do

not really take the red line sufficiently seriously. We know already

that whatever deadline they impose will be extended, such that the

Minister passionately argued for the Secretary of State&#146;s right

to do so in our previous substantial discussion on clause 17 and again

on clause 18. I have one question for the Minister. Given that once

again we are discussing something that sets a deadline, why should we

even bother to pretend that that deadline will be taken seriously? Is

there anything that the Minister can say that would make the deadline

any more plausible than all the other deadlines that have been

breached, including this one in

2002?</div><a name="06042548000112"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06042548000384"></a><b class="B">Mr.

Peter Robinson</b> (Belfast, East) (DUP): I want to respond to

the atrocious comments made by the hon. Member for Belfast, South. It

is appalling that any hon. Member of this House would deliberately

attempt, in the absence of my right hon. Friend the Member for North

Antrim (Rev. Ian Paisley), to recast the words that he used on that

occasion and to put some military or violent connotation on

them.</div> <a name="06042548000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">Not only was

the position abundantly clear in the context in which my right hon.

Friend made his remarks, but because the hon. Gentleman and his party

at that time made similar comments to those that he makes today, it was

explained over the airwaves so that everybody could hear what the clear

intention of his remarks was. The history of decommissioning has been a

very long and tiring one for the Unionist community in Northern

Ireland. All the people of the Province have suffered in one way or

another from the existence of illegal weaponry. We have lost thousands

of our fellow citizens. Tens of thousands of them have been maimed and

mutilated by those weapons.</div>

<a name="06042548000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are not talking about some

academic issue here. We are talking about the equipment that killed and

injured many thousands of people in Northern Ireland to the extent that

barely a family was untouched by the impact of those weapons. There is

an urgency about the matter. It is important that those weapons are

taken away from those who hold them and are destroyed. As far as the

IRA is concerned, my party and I regretted the cavalier fashion in

which the SDLP regarded the IRA&#146;s weaponry. It regarded it as

being all right for the IRA to hold on to its weapons and still to have

its representatives in government. That is not a position that my party

holds or will ever hold.</div>

<a name="06042548000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our view was consistently that

the IRA should not allowed into government until there was complete

decommissioning. Regrettably, the SDLP and others took representatives

from the IRA into government while it still held on to its weaponry and

took away the urgency that was required for decommissioning to take

place. That urgency still eludes the Minister, as he wants to stretch

out into the far distant future the limits on when it might be possible

to have decommissioning.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column54" />Column number: 54</div><a name="06042548000322"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.45

pm</div><a name="06042548000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">My party and I

see no moral distinction between the IRA holding on to weapons and a

loyalist organisation holding on to weapons. There is no distinction

whatever: all those weapons should be handed over. All of them should

be destroyed at the earliest moment. I do not take the view, which some

hold, that we no longer need to look over our shoulders at the

stockpiles of the Provisional IRA.</div>

<a name="06042548000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">I immediately indicated that I

considered the decommissioning act that took place recently to be

substantial decommissioning. There is no doubt that the IRA

substantially decommissioned on that day. Two witnesses saw the event

and, in very vague terms, reported the fact. General de Chastelain saw

it and, in imprecise terms, reported the fact, but it is at least clear

from what those witnesses said that a large quantity of weaponry was

destroyed. However, General de Chastelain and the two Church witnesses

immediately embarked on a spinning operation, telling the community

that the IRA had completed decommissioning and destroyed all its

weapons. When asked to produce some evidence that all the IRA&#146;s

weaponry was involved, they relied on the fact that the IRA had told

them that.</div> <a name="06042548000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">General de

Chastelain and the two Church witnesses might satisfy themselves with

the word of the IRA but my party leader quite rightly did not, and nor

did the IMC, which, on obtaining evidence that the IRA still held on to

some weaponry, reported it in its eighth report. The IMC indicated

that, although the Independent International Commission on

Decommissioning had been prepared to turn a blind eye to the IRA

holding on to its weaponry, it was not. The IMC noted the fact that

weaponry had been retained and also gave some descriptive terms,

indicating that the IRA had held on to a range of

weaponry.</div><a name="06042548000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">I cannot

predict what the IMC report might say when it is published tomorrow,

but as always the two Governments have been attempting to get their

retaliations in first and spinning the report as best they can in the

hours leading up to its publication. One of the leaks of the report

seems to indicate that the IMC will hold to its position that the IRA

still has illegal weaponry. If the report is accurate, it will indicate

that the IRA leadership did not sanction the holding of that

weaponry&#151;I am sure that that will bring some comfort to people

who will face the barrel of one of the guns&#151;and that it was held

by local cells, organisations, quartermasters or whatever grand title

they give themselves.</div>

<a name="06042548000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">That being the case, the book

is not closed on Provisional IRA decommissioning. More has to be done.

If some cells or units have held on to weaponry and that was not

sanctioned by the IRA, the IRA has to deal with that issue. It is

responsible for decommissioning all its

weapons.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042548000386"></a>Mr.

Robinson:</b> I do regard the IMC as a credible body. I have

the highest respect for it, in spite of the 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column55" />Column number: 55</div>fact that although there is a republican on it there is no Unionist, nor

anybody with whom the Unionist community in Northern Ireland would

readily identify. I have met the IMC, and it has issued reports that I

am sure the Government did not like and which they would have preferred

to be put in a different way. I understand that they will indicate that

there has been some measure of progress. No one would be happier than

my colleagues and I if there were progress in the reduction of

paramilitary and criminal activity in Northern Ireland. That is what we

want, but it has been painfully slow. However, the body that is charged

with the decommissioning of weaponry is not the IMC, but the IICD and

it is regrettable that, rather than admitting that it was wrong when it

indicated that all weapons had been destroyed, it still wants to cover

up the fact that some weapons are still being

held.</div><a name="06042548000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn to

loyalist paramilitary organisations. Apart from a very small

decommissioning exercise on the part of the LVF, which was the first

decommissioning of guns that had had their best days, there has been

nothing on the part of loyalist paramilitaries, nor has there been any

indication of intent by the loyalist paramilitaries to decommission

their weapons. It is unfortunate for loyalist paramilitary

organisations&#151;I point this out to the hon. Member for Belfast,

South&#151;that whereas pressure can be put on the Provisional IRA to

decommission in that the party that represents it is of a size that

merits positions in government under the d&#146;Hondt system and the

existing structures, there is no such enticement for loyalist

paramilitaries. Concessions were given hand over fist to the

Provisional IRA to hand over its weapons, but nothing of the sort has

happened for loyalist paramilitary organisations, nor do I ask the

Government for that. I do not believe that they should have bought guns

from the Provisional IRA, nor do I believe that they should buy guns

from the loyalist paramilitary

organisations.</div><a name="06042548000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want

to put it clearly on the record that all loyalist paramilitary

organisations must hand over their weapons and that those weapons must

be destroyed. Our community does not need illegal weaponry and it is in

everyone&#146;s interest to destroy weapons. I must tell the hon.

Member for Belfast, South that, by and large, the trend in the future

will be that any weapons held by republican organisations are more

likely to be used against those who live in nationalist areas than

against those who live in Unionist areas. Equally, loyalist

paramilitary weapons are more likely to be used against those in

Unionist areas for territorial control. It is in all our interests to

see all illegal weaponry out of

existence.</div><a name="06042548000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">That brings

me to the heart of the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for North

Down. I presume that its sole purpose is to try to introduce some pace

and urgency into the process and to persuade the Government to apply

themselves tothe earliest possible date. At the moment, the

Government&#146;s attitude is that if they do not come up with the

weapons they will just add on a few more years. We will never get to

the end of the road with that attitude in the Government. We must apply

some urgency to the matter and the hon. Lady&#146;s amendment

deserves support if it does nothing other than to persuade the Minister

to roll up his sleeves and get down to work.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column56" />Column number: 56</div><a name="06042548000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister is pointing to the

Under-Secretary who has already taken off his jacket. I hope that some

urgency will be introduced into the process and that we can tackle the

matter once and for all and close the chapter, knowing that the guns

have gone and that the prospects for peace are

heightened.</div><a name="06042548000127"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042548000387"></a>The

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland (Mr. Shaun

Woodward):</b> I join other hon. Members in welcoming you to

the Chair,Mr. Atkinson. This afternoon&#146;s debate

reveals that your expert chairmanship is needed as we steer through

these difficult waters and

decommissioning.</div><a name="06042548000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

amendment tabled by the hon. Member for North Down rightly raises the

debate and we welcome that. The Northern Ireland Arms Decommissioning

Act 1997 contains order-making powers for the Secretary of State to

extend the amnesty period during which paramilitary arms may be

decommissioned. The amendment seeks to reduce the proposed extension of

the order-making power so that the latest permitted date of the amnesty

would be February 2008. We believe that retaining the option to use the

order-making power for a further three years until February 2010 is a

better way forward.</div><a name="06042548000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">I

am not suggesting, despite what other hon. Members have said, that we

should anticipate that loyalist groups will take a further three years

to decommission their weapons. If the order-making power is not needed,

it will not be used. Despite the apparent differences between the hon.

Members for Belfast, East (Mr. Robinson) and for Belfast, South, they

are to an extent both right. Of course the matter is urgent. In giving

ourselves the power to extend the time to 2010 we still recognise that.

However, we are approaching the matter realistically and avoiding the

need to return for primary legislation in the event that things cannot

be achieved as quickly as we should

like.</div><a name="06042548000130"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042548000388"></a>Lady

Hermon:</b> Have any discreet private overtures been made by

officials in the Northern Ireland Office to members of the UVF or the

UDA to try to encourage them to begin the

process?</div><a name="06042548000131"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042548000389"></a>Mr.

Woodward:</b> Huge progress is being made. I remind the hon.

Lady that many people would, obviously, have wanted decommissioning to

have happened many years ago. The fact is that it has taken a long time

to get to the point that we have reached, but that does not mean that

we should not have gone on trying. It is precisely such powers as we

are discussing that have contributed to our making the progress we have

made. We can raise all sorts of questions and judgments about the

nature of the IICD, although the Government absolutely

respect&#151;and adhere firmly to&#151;its judgments, but huge

progress was made last year.</div>

<a name="06042548000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">The decommissioning by the IRA

was historic. It took longer than everyone would have liked&#151;that

is self-evident&#151;but it was achieved. Yes, we should like others

to make the same progress, and it may take longer than we should like,

but that does not change what we want to do or our confidence that it

can be done. The reason for our extending the order for three years is

not that we want the process to take three 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column57" />Column number: 57</div>years. We do not share the pessimism of the hon. Member for

Montgomeryshire on the matter; we are optimistic.</div>

<a name="06042548000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thought that the hon.

Gentleman was slightly mournful in his view of the prospects for

achievement. Perhaps he was up a little late last night reviewing the

papers for &#147;Sky News&#148;, but the fact is that we believe we

can make progress. We are being responsible. I know that the Liberal

Democrats like to keep all their options open, but we are keeping open

one option, which may take slightly longer than we should like. The

hon. Gentleman is desperate to

intervene.</div><a name="06042548000134"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042548000390"></a>Lembit

&#214;pik:</b> I thank the Minister for staying up long

enough to watch me on Sky, but he misinterprets what I have been saying

when he perceives it as a sign of pessimism. I am saying that the

Government&#146;s obsession with building in insurance policies in

case of failure turns into a self-fulfilling prophecy, because it gives

those people who are sceptical and resistant to the process the

assurance of knowing that the Government themselves entertain the

prospect that things may not work out.</div>

<a name="06042548000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister must surely accept

that on several occasions paramilitaries and other organisations have

called the Government&#146;s bluff about whether they have a plan B

and said, &#147;We don&#146;t believe you&#148;&#151;and the

Government have given in. Does the Minister accept that my argument is

that by giving themselves wriggle room all the time they end up giving

the same wriggle room to everyone

else?</div><a name="06042548000136"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042548000391"></a>Mr.

Woodward:</b> I do not accept that at all. The extraordinary

and historic decommissioning last year is evidence of why the power is

absolutely necessary and that it works. Our recognition that although

we should like to move even more quickly, things may take slightly

longer, is simply prudent contingency planning. By fixing a three-year

sunset, rather than the customary five years, we are sending a signal

that we expect decommissioning to be dealt with sooner rather than

later. The past years have brought about massive progress towards

lasting peace and stability in Northern Ireland, following the full

decommissioning by the Provisional IRA. The Government are determined

to build on that progress by doing all that we can to secure the

decommissioning of all paramilitary weapons, and encouraging loyalist

paramilitary groups to make the transition from conflict to

peace.</div> <a name="06042548000323"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5

<a name="06042548000137"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042548000392"></a>Lady

Hermon:</b> Will the Minister deal with the point about the

NIO appearing to give conflicting signals, particularly to loyalist

paramilitaries? In September, as I mentioned earlier, the Secretary of

State indicated that the full rigour of the law would be thrown at

loyalist paramilitaries if they did not move to begin decommissioning

and co-operation. That was in September 2005. Has the full rigour of

the law been thrown at loyalist paramilitaries, and if not, why not?

Will it be done before

2010?</div><a name="06042548000138"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042548000393"></a>Mr.

Woodward:</b> I say first to the hon. Lady that despite her

observations, we believe that there are no 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column58" />Column number: 58</div>conflicting signals whatever. Those who retain weapons should not do so.

That is the reason for the decommissioning order. Our objective is

absolutely clear.</div> <a name="06042548000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">I

am at one with the hon. Member for Belfast, East. He is right: there is

no moral distinction to be made between republicans and loyalists who

retain weapons. It is immoral and they should not do it, and we want

them to hand in those weapons. The way forward is simple. Getting there

will not necessarily be easy, but our objective is clear. All

paramilitary groups, republican and loyalist, must commit to the peace

process. That involves not holding on to illegal weapons.</div>

<a name="06042548000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government&#146;s view on

the matter is pragmatic, but we retain a crystal clear objective. We

believe that it can be realised. For that purpose, we are extending the

provision. If we do not have to use it, we will not return to

Parliament every year to seek its renewal, but none the less we are

making a prudent contingency plan in case we need it, based on what has

happened so far and the time that it has taken. We recognise the

urgency, and for that reason I hope that the hon. Lady will agree to

withdraw her

amendment.</div><a name="06042548000141"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042548000394"></a>Lady

Hermon:</b> I have listened patiently to the Minister&#146;s

response and I say calmly to him that he will have heard the remarks of

the hon. Member for Belfast, East. The Minister should also have noted

some of the remarks of the hon. Member for Belfast, South on the

Democratic Unionist party. I must say that I was most disconcerted by

those remarks. However, other remarks that he made were

valuable.</div> <a name="06042548000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

Minister should listen carefully to the representatives of Northern

Ireland constituencies. We are saying loudly and clearly to him that

the people of Northern Ireland cannot be expected to tolerate the

continuing existence of private armies, whether republican or loyalist,

that are armed to the hilt and engage in serious criminal activities.

In an earlier debate, the hon. Member for Belfast, South referred to

intimidation and extortion, as did the hon. Member for East Antrim

(Sammy Wilson). A catalogue of illegal activities are undertaken by

both loyalist and republican paramilitaries. The people of Northern

Ireland are sick, sore and very weary of it. They want paramilitaries

from all sides off their backs.</div>

<a name="06042548000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">This Government&#151;our

Government&#151;should send a clear message to the people of Northern

Ireland, who are part of the United Kingdom. I will therefore be

pushing amendment No. 30 to a Division, because I wish a clear message

to come from at least the Members representing Northern Ireland

constituencies. I assume that Tory and Liberal Democrat hon. Members

will also support the amendment.</div>

<a name="06042548000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">The people of Northern Ireland

need and deserve an end through the full rigour of the law to the

Northern Ireland Office&#146;s attitude of tolerance toward

paramilitary organisations. That is what the Secretary of State pledged

in September. With respect to the Minister, who is the security

Minister, we have not seen much of that. We would like to see more of

it.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042548000417"></a>Mr.

Robertson:</b> It was my pleasure to spend two years studying

the Great Britain energy market, and very detailed and complicated it

was too. I must confess to having not spent a great time studying the

position in Northern Ireland or, indeed, in the Republic of Ireland,

but I want to make one or two remarks about it. People in Northern

Ireland pay more for energy than we do in Great Britain. I want to

explore why that is so and whether the Bill holds out prospects of

cheaper electricity for people in Northern

Ireland.</div><a name="06042548000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">Members of

the Committee will remember that it was the Conservative Government who

brought about privatisation, but that it was the Labour Government who

took it further and introduced NETA&#151;the new electricity trading

arrangements&#151;which, under the Energy Act 2004, became known as

BETTA&#151;the British electricity trading and transmission

arrangements. The Government were right to introduce the change because

it moved the position away from the old pool system of electricity that

was based on long-term contracts to a much more fluid system that

operated more like the stock market than it had previously. As a

result, electricity prices in Great Britain fell considerably in

relative terms to the extent that it became a slight problem in that,

at one point, there was a shortage of investment in electricity

generation because the price was so low and there was no incentive for

companies to invest in generation. During recent months, there has been

an increase in the price of electricity and gas, although that is a

slightly different issue. It has been due to the world market that has

been affected heavily by the oil situation. As much as anything else,

it is a readjustment 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column60" />Column number: 60</div>of the prices of fuel rather than a failure of the market. The trading

arrangements that the Government introduced did a good service to both

producers of electricity in the long term and domestic and industrial

consumers.</div><a name="06042548000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">Changes are

planned, but the benefits did not extend to Northern Ireland in the way

in which they should have done, nor am I sure that they will do so

under the clause. Although the clause is headed &#147;Single

wholesale electricity market&#148;, having discussed it with the

relevant authorities in Northern Ireland my understanding is that the

regulation of the market is being changed rather than a market being

created. I would be glad to be corrected. There is not even one overall

body being created; I understand that there will be an attempt to

harmonise the regulation of electricity in Northern Ireland with that

in the Republic. We will not move towards the type of market that we

enjoy in Great Britain, so the benefits will not flow to consumers in

Northern Ireland in the way that they have to those here. Again, if I

am wrong, I will be pleased to be

corrected.</div><a name="06042548000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am a

little concerned about the creation of north-south bodies, considering

what the Government said in their recent statement. I hope that the

Assembly does get up and running because of the Bill that we will

consider tomorrow, but I did not like the insinuation that there could

be a strengthening of cross-border bodies even if the Assembly is not

running. That was not what was agreed in the Belfast agreement, and I

have some concern about it.</div>

<a name="06042548000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not want to be seen to be

urging the creation of a north-south body, given the uncertainty of the

situation, but there are possible benefits in the creation of a bigger

electricity market across the whole of Ireland, just as there would be

in one that covered both the UK and Ireland. I am as anti-EU as one

could wish to find in the House, but there could even be benefits in

creating a bigger electricity market across Europe. That does not

necessarily mean that regulation would have to be as one, although

there would have to be some

harmonisation.</div><a name="06042548000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">There

are great difficulties in energy at the moment. The UK increasingly has

to get its energy from further afield. Not long ago we were a great

producer of gas from the North sea; we are now net importers of gas.

The places from where that gas is coming are slightly worrying: Russia,

Algeria and other countries that might not be considered politically

stable. Russia has recently ended its supply of gas to a couple of

countries, which cannot be a good

thing.</div><a name="06042548000180"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042548000418"></a>The

Chairman:</b> Order. I am reluctant to stop the hon.

Gentleman, who is giving an interesting exposition of the energy

situation, but can he bring his comments back to the clause, which

refers to Northern

Ireland?</div><a name="06042548000181"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042548000419"></a>Mr.

Robertson:</b> I apologise for straying away from Northern

Ireland. The point that I seek to make is that I am not convinced that

the clause will move us towards greater security in the supply of

electricity or cheaper prices for consumers in Northern Ireland. We

need to look further into the future than the clause apparently does. I

would be pleased to be corrected, 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column61" />Column number: 61</div>but from discussions with authorities in Northern Ireland, I understand

that the clause is modest. Maybe the Government are planning ahead, or

maybe they intend to leave the issue to the Assembly, but I would like

to hear the Minister&#146;s response to my

points.</div><a name="06042548000182"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042548000420"></a>Dr.

McDonnell:</b> I endorse the broad context of the remarks of

the hon. Member for Tewkesbury. If time permitted, I should like to

talk at length, as he did, not just about the content of the Bill, but

about east-west connections between Britain and Ireland, and those with

continental Europe. I shall forgo doing so,

however.</div><a name="06042548000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause

and the Bill implement an ambition on which all parties agreed when the

Assembly was functioning. I sat on a committee there that moved forward

energy issues. It had nothing to do with constitutional politics, and

there did not seem to be any threat to anybody&#146;s political

interest.</div> <a name="06042548000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

situation in Northern Ireland is serious. Historically, we have had

severe stranded costs, caused by the privatisation of power stations

and the setting of prices at levels that are much too high by

today&#146;s standards. The cost of producing electricity had dropped

for a period, but now it may be going up again. The severe stranded

costs will continue until 2010 or 2012. The clause probably does not go

far enough, but I see it very much as opening a door to create the

space for serious discussions, which the hon. Member for Tewkesbury

referred to earlier in more depth. I would like those discussions to be

pursued, because the island of Ireland as a whole has fewer than 2

million people in the north and 4 million in the south. We need 12

million people for a serious energy market. We have some connection

with the grid in Scotland. We have a connector there, but it is fairly

fully occupied and we need another connector. It could be between Wales

and southern Ireland, or we could have a second connector between

Northern Ireland and

Scotland.</div><a name="06042548000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause

is a prelude to such discussions, and it will facilitate their opening.

It will create confidence for players in the market. Opening up and

facilitating a discussion is the political intention of the House, and

I think that the commercial interests want to see a clear indication

that that is happening. From that point of view, I endorse and support

the

clause.</div><a name="06042548000324"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.15

pm</div><a name="06042548000186"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06042548000421"></a><b class="B">Sammy

Wilson</b> (East Antrim) (DUP): The vague terms that have been

used so far show that none of us is sure how the single energy market

will operate or indeed what the implications will be. I made it clear

from the outset that the DUP considers that, if there are grounds for

north-south co-operation on issues that are of economic benefit to

people in Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic, we will not stand in

the way. Indeed, we would be foolish to do

so.</div><a name="06042548000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to ask the

Minister several questions about this clause, however, as I do about

clause 26. First, the single energy market will create a pool into

which generators will supply their electricity, which will then be sold

to the various distributors. Every half-hour of the supply into the

pool will be monitored. The demand and the price will be set

accordingly.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column62" />Column number: 62</div><a name="06042548000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are some hidden dangers

that I want the Minister to address, perhaps when we come

toclause 26. Creating a middleman&#151;the pool in the

single energy market&#151;means that there will be additional capital

costs, including initial capital costs. Can he say what they will be?

They have been estimated at between &#163;10 million and &#163;30

million. There will then be ongoing monitoring costs, because both the

input to the pool and the output to the various suppliershave to be

monitored, after which there will be billing arrangements and so on.

The revenue costs and the initial capital costs, together with any

change inthe arrangements during the time, are likely to add to the

overheads when it comes to supplying electricity to the

consumer.</div><a name="06042548000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before we go

down such a route, I want to be assured that, instead of looking at the

political glow that might come from a single market, we actually

examine the harsh economic realities. If they do not stand up to

rigorous economic analysis, it would be better to steer away from the

arrangement.</div> <a name="06042548000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">My

second point relates to subsection (2)(b), under which the provisions

would</div><a name="06042548000313"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;confer powers on

bodies or persons specified in, or appointed under or by virtue of, the

Order, including powers to make statutory rules (within the meaning of

the Statutory

Rules)&#148;.</div><a name="06042548000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a worry

for the existing generators in Northern Ireland, because the

consultation paper entitled &#147;Northern Ireland&#146;s

Generators &#151; Managing Security of Supply in a Period of

Transition&#148; said that the implementation of a single electricity

market could lead to existing contracts being revoked. That has caused

grave concern.</div> <a name="06042548000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">There

are two major generators in my constituency of East Antrim, and that

statement has caused major concern for those who have already invested

heavily on the basis of the prices that they anticipated and the

revenue streams that they expected to receive from the electricity that

they generated and supplied to the grid. It has severe implications for

them.</div><a name="06042548000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the Bill

enables the proposed body to revoke those contracts willy-nilly, it

will have an implication for future investment as well. Investors want

to know that when they invest, rules are set down that will continue to

apply and will not be changed at the discretion of a newly created body

or through some new rule that it decides to introduce. Otherwise,

companies will not have the confidence to invest.</div>

<a name="06042548000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the hon. Member for Belfast,

South pointed out, there are capacity problems in the market as a

whole. Over the next number of years, additional capacity must be added

to the system for the whole island, both for Northern Ireland and the

Irish Republic. If investors see that contracts have been changed, what

guarantee will we have that we will get the stability of supply that we

need? Will new generators come into the market to provide diverse means

of production and security of supply over the longer period? Will the

Minister reassure me as to the meaning of clause 25(2)(b)? How far will

the powers extend for existing

contracts?</div><a name="06042548000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">My third

point concerns a matter that will require legislation in the Irish

Republic. We discussed such 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column63" />Column number: 63</div>matters when we debated the arrangements for donations to political

parties. If legislation is not introduced in the Irish Republic to

provide the same safeguards as are provided in Northern Ireland, it

will have serious implications for the single market. Will the Minister

tell us what discussions he has had with the Government in the Irish

Republic to ensure that the legislation that is required in that

jurisdiction reflects the provisions made in Northern

Ireland?</div><a name="06042548000196"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042548000422"></a>Mr.

Hanson:</b> I shall try my best to answer the points that have

been made by hon. Members during this short debate on clause 25. I

welcome the fact that the hon. Member for East Antrim welcomes the

provision in the Bill. I understand that his party will adopt a

pragmatic approach to these matters, and the clause will bring great

benefit to Northern Ireland in the long term. I shall also try to deal

with the points made by the hon. Members for Belfast, South and for

Tewkesbury, as well as those of the hon. Member for East

Antrim.</div><a name="06042548000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">I pay tribute

to the Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, my hon. Friend

the Member for Basildon (Angela E. Smith), who is taking the lead on

dealing with this matter as a policy issue. She has day-to-day

responsibility for these matters outside this Committee with officials

from the Northern Ireland

Assembly.</div><a name="06042548000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 25

will enable Her Majesty by Order in Council&#151;I am afraid that

again it is by Order in Council&#151;to give legal effect to any

agreement that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary can achieve between

the British and Irish Governments relating to the creation of a single

wholesale electricity market in Northern Ireland and the Republic. I

hope that I can reassure all hon. Members that in the event of an

agreement being reached between the Irish and British Governments, it

will be presented to Parliament by my right hon. Friend the Secretary

of State for information and

confirmation.</div><a name="06042548000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">To

answer the point made by the hon. Member for Tewkesbury, my hon. Friend

the Under-Secretary of State and the Irish Government hope that a

memorandum of understanding, rather than a formal treaty, will be

established between the British and Irish Governments to put in place

several safeguards and ensure that the key elements needed to establish

a single wholesale market will be put in place. Although that

memorandum is still subject to discussion with the Irish Government and

the electricity operators&#151;to answer the point made by the hon.

Member for East Antrim&#151;it is still being consulted on and

discussed with them. However, in the event of an agreement being

reached, it is hoped that the memorandum of understanding will cover a

range of issues, such as regulatory arrangements, the role of the

market operator, dealing with market power and dominance, sharing

information between the Republic and the British Government, licensing

arrangements and access to the market.</div>

<a name="06042548000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have taken an assessment of

the costs of the exercise that could be undertaken, subject to the

agreement between the two Governments. An early estimate is that, if

the single market were established, the total implementation and

operational costs in Northern Ireland would be in the region of

&#163;34 million 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column64" />Column number: 64</div>over a 10-year period. The cost during that period would be offset by a

potential saving of &#163;30 million, so at the end of the first

10-year period, if the agreement is reached, the net cost to Northern

Ireland would have been about &#163;4 million. However, after 10

years, savings accruing to Northern Ireland would, I hope, be passed on

in the long term to the hard-pressed electricity payer in Northern

Ireland.</div><a name="06042548000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have to say

to all hon. Members who have raised this question, including the hon.

Member for Belfast, South, that in the short term I doubt whether the

ordinary electricity payer in Northern Ireland will make savings as a

result of this exercise. In the long term, however, there are potential

savings to be made, and after the 10-year period, they will accrue in

ever increasing amounts, subject to ever-rising electricity prices,

which are causing problems in all hon. Members&#146; constituencies,

not least those in Northern

Ireland.</div><a name="06042548000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">The market

will bring greater competitive opportunities as well as efficiencies

and economies of scale. The most important thing to emphasise to the

hon. Members for Tewkesbury and for East Antrim is that, potentially,

after 10 years the economies of scale and efficiencies that can be made

for generators and suppliers will lead to savings that I hope will, in

due course, be passed on to ordinary individuals in Northern Ireland.

Again, I emphasise that energy will ultimately be the responsibility of

the Assembly. I would hope that, in due course, when the Assembly is

reconstituted&#151;as I hope it will be&#151;it will monitor and

take forward this aspect of policy

provision.</div><a name="06042548000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that

that has answered some of the points made by hon. Members. I am

attempting to answer them on behalf of my hon. Friend the

Under-Secretary, who I am sure would be happy to meet colleagues in the

event of the agreement being

progressed.</div><a name="06042548000204"></a>

Wilson:</b> I appreciate the point that the Minister made

regarding the cost; I suppose that he can give only an estimate.

However, will he address the issue that I raised about how secure the

current contracts will be with the advent of a single electricity

market? Will it be possible for the operator to revoke those contracts,

or will they be guaranteed to run to end of the relevant

period?</div><a name="06042548000325"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.30

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042548000424"></a>Mr.

Hanson:</b> I shall return to that point in a moment, if the

hon. Gentleman will allow me to do so.

</div><a name="06042548000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I mentioned, the

&#163;34 million cost over the 10-year period will be taken into

account with the&#163;30 million of savings. The hon.

Gentleman made a good point with regard to the current operators, with

whom the matter is being discussed. The memorandum of understanding, if

agreed with the Irish Government, will take into account all those

matters.</div> <a name="06042548000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Order in

Council that proposes the memorandum will be subject to

consultation.Clause 25 simply gives to the Government the

power to make that agreement, but the agreement and its potential

implications for existing operators regarding savings or otherwise and

for the relationship between 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column65" />Column number: 65</div>the Irish and British Government will all be subject to the order, which

will itself be subject to

consultation.</div><a name="06042548000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">To get

back to the basics, the clause will give my hon. Friend the

Under-Secretary legal backing to negotiate the memorandum of

understanding with the Irish Government and to introduce an Order in

Council to bring that into

effect.</div><a name="06042548000209"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042548000425"></a>Mr.

Robertson:</b> I realise that this is a specialist area, and I

appreciate the Minister&#146;s attempts to explain a difficult and

complicated situation.</div>

<a name="06042548000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall reiterate what I was

trying to say: the regulation is one thing, but the actual opening up

of the market is another. The existing long-term contracts present a

bit of a problem because they could end up keeping the price of

electricity high, but as the hon. Member for East Antrim said, it is

important to honour those contracts. I hope that the Minister will

speak to his hon. Friend the Under-Secretary, because it is important

that we move as quickly as is fair towards an open market in

electricity, and not just harmonisation of

regulation.</div><a name="06042548000211"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042548000426"></a>Mr.

Hanson:</b> I anticipate that the current contracts will

operate certainly until 2010. After that date, they will be a matter

for discussion and consultation; discussions on the single electricity

market and how it will operate and affect contractors in the future are

under way already with existing

operators.</div><a name="06042548000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 25

will give my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary the power to negotiate the

memorandum of understanding and to bring it back here after

consultation for execution by this House and implementation beyond that

date. I understand the concerns that current operators will have, and I

hope that the reassurance of 2010 will be of assistance to them. Those

matters will be subject to consultation, at which stage the hon. Member

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042548000427"></a>Mr.

Robertson:</b> On this occasion, I shall attempt not to stray

on to the issue of Russian gas

supplies.</div><a name="06042548000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us

compare the renewables market in this country with that in continental

Europe, where the supply of renewable energy is far more prevalent.

Continental Europe generates far more electricity from renewable

sources than we do. As hon. Members might well be aware, the renewables

obligation covers Great Britain, but we manage to generate only about

3.5 per cent. of our electricity from renewable sources compared with

the target of 10.4 per cent. by

2010.</div><a name="06042548000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">Now that it is

2006, that target looks very ambitious, but it does not seem awfully

high when we consider the necessity of moving towards the cleaner

generation of electricity, for which the necessary technology has been

around for some time. For Northern Ireland there is 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column66" />Column number: 66</div>the non-fossil fuel obligation, but that will be set at only 6.3 per

cent. by 2012, which is not terribly ambitious. At the moment, the

figure is about 3 per

cent.</div><a name="06042548000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">I accept that

there are problems with the promotion of renewable energy in Northern

Ireland that do not exist elsewhere in Great Britain, where there is

perhaps more potential for the generation of renewable electricity. In

encouraging renewable electricity in Great Britain, the Government have

made the mistake of depending far too much on windmills. Although they

have their place in electricity generation, several problems are

associated with them. The biggest is that they are

intermittent&#151;when the wind does not blow, we get no electricity.

That might seem like an obvious statement, but the wind tends to blow

only 30 per cent. of the time, so we get electricity only during that

time. The great problem with electricity is that it cannot be stored,

so if the wind blows twice as hard one day, we cannot get twice as much

electricity and store it for a day when the wind does not

blow.</div><a name="06042548000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">For two years, I

have tracked the Government on energy issues and shadowed the Minister

for Energy and I think that we need a much broader approach to

developing renewable energy. There is far too much emphasis on wind

power&#151;</div><a name="06042548000221"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042548000428"></a>The

Chairman:</b> Order. I am sorry to stop the hon. Gentleman

again, but I am anxious not to have a general debate on the merits of

wind power versus nuclear or otherwise. The clause touches on promoting

wind farms in Northern Ireland, and his comments must relate to the

Northern Ireland

situation.</div><a name="06042548000222"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042548000429"></a>Mr.

Robertson:</b> Thank you, Mr. Atkinson. Having visited a wind

farm in Northern Ireland, I felt slightly qualified to discuss the

issue. I am merely trying to suggest that the Government take a much

broader approach to developing renewable energy in Northern Ireland

than they have in Great Britain. The approach that they have taken in

Great Britain has left us struggling to meet the targets, and I do not

want the Government to fail to meet the modest targets in Northern

Ireland. If they are serious about developing renewable energy in

Northern Ireland, they need to be much more focused than they have been

in Great Britain.</div>

<a name="06042548000223"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042548000430"></a>Sammy

Wilson:</b> I have a couple of points relating to the purposes

of the financial assistance and the aims listed in subsection (2) of

the clause. Those aims are admirable, but the existence of a single

energy market poses a particular threat. The biggest player in that

market will be the Electricity Supply Board&#151;the electricity

generating body from the Irish Republic. Contrary to the current

situation in Northern Ireland, it will be not only a generator, but a

supplier, transmitter and distributor, and it will control at least

half the market. Given that the electricity that goes into the pool

will be based on half-hour transmissions, such a large supplier will

have the potential to distort the price to its own advantage, which is

particularly worrying.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column67" />Column number: 67</div><a name="06042548000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">What steps will be taken during

the negotiations to deal with that issue? Attention must be paid to it

to ensure that one large player, which will not only supply the pool,

but buy from it, does not distort the market. What steps will be taken

to ensure that that does not happen? The danger is that ESB could drive

out some of the smaller generators by influencing the price. As the

hon. Member for Belfast, South said, the energy market on the whole

island&#151;in Northern Ireland and in the Irish Republic&#151;is

quite isolated. Some power can be brought in through the interconnector

from Scotland, but by and large the island is quite isolated, so the

loss of one generator could greatly distort the market and greatly

increase price volatility. That is one of the reasons why I said at the

start that although in theory a single energy market would be

welcome&#151;</div><a name="06042548000225"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042548000431"></a>The

Chairman:</b> Order. I am sorry to interrupt the hon.

Gentleman again, but we are again straying rather wide of the clause.

As its title says, it is about financial assistance for energy

purposes. I should be grateful if he related his speech to that

subject.</div><a name="06042548000226"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042548000432"></a>Sammy

Wilson:</b> Thank you, Mr. Atkinson. I was dealing with

subsection (2), whose first purpose

is</div><a name="06042548000314"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to secure a diverse

and viable long-term energy

supply&#148;.</div><a name="06042548000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">If steps are not

taken to address the power and influence that can be exercised by one

supplier and distributor controlling 50 per cent. of a single market,

that purpose will not be achieved. It will be possible for that one

supplier to influence the price and affect in the long term the number

of generators in the

market.</div><a name="06042548000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should

appreciate some guidance from the Minister on what discussions have

been held on the matter. One way around the problem is a fairly

generous capacity payment mechanism, whereby generators would be paid

to keep some surplus capacity so that peaks and troughs could be dealt

with and sufficient generating capacity would exist during peak periods

to ensure greater price stability. I do not know whether discussions

have been held along those lines, but that is one solution that

generators have suggested. They have a vested interest in being paid

for surplus capacity, of course, but it would be equally beneficial to

consumers in that it could even out price peaks and troughs during the

year or the

day.</div><a name="06042548000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">Attention must be

given during negotiations to the ESB&#146;s ability to distort the

market and to affect the working of something that should be beneficial

to consumers, rather than going in the long run against some of the

purposes in clause

26.</div><a name="06042548000230"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042548000433"></a>Dr.

McDonnell:</b> I am conscious of the time, but I feel that it

would be remiss of me not to welcome the clause warmly, as I welcomed

clause 25. Renewable energy and diversity of supply are important

issues for us in Northern Ireland, and from where I stand, I see a gap.

The Government must have the ability to intervene to develop the market

and to encourage those who are uncertain about investing in renewable

energy to move forward.</div>

<a name="06042548000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not wish to delay the

Committee unduly, as other business is on the schedule, but I want to

endorse strongly the broad principles of the Bill and urge the Minister

to see that those principles are applied to 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column68" />Column number: 68</div>ensure a stronger renewable energy sector. We need diversity of supply,

because the present circumstances do not do enough to encourage and

create that market. I warmly welcome the

clause.</div><a name="06042548000232"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042548000434"></a>Mr.

Hanson:</b> The clause is important for the reasons that hon.

Members have mentioned. Developing renewable energy is crucial to the

alternative energy sources required to help improve Northern Ireland

for the future. At the moment, Northern Ireland is at99 per

cent. of the quota on imported fossil fuels and other energy sources.

We need to examine alternative

energy.</div><a name="06042548000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">For that

reason, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State announced early

this year that he would allocate a &#163;259 million support package

to develop alternative energy sources during the next few years. The

clause gives legal effect to the amendment of existing legislative

powers so that financial assistance can be provided for energy

purposes. It will enable the Department of Enterprise, Trade and

Investment to assist in a wide range of energy provisions, including

renewable development. I hope that it will be welcomed by all hon.

Members.</div> <a name="06042548000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">The target

in Northern Ireland is for 12 per cent. of electricity to be supplied

from renewables by 2012. I accept that that is an ambitious

target.</div>

<a name="06042548000326"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.45

pm</div><a name="06042548000235"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042548000435"></a>Mr.

Robertson:</b> The Minister has access to far more information

than I have. I was told that the obligation was for 6.3 per cent. with

an aspirational target of12 per

cent.</div>

<a name="06042548000236"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042548000436"></a>Mr.

Hanson:</b> Indeed. The renewables obligation is 6.3 per

cent., but the Government target is to try to make it 12 per cent. by

2012. We need to support renewables effectively. I welcome the hon.

Gentleman&#146;s support for the Government&#146;s attempt to

develop renewable energy. Far be it from me to reflect that, as I

recall it, when the &#163;59 million that the Government are

allocating was announced in the Budget, the hon. Gentleman voted

against it. I welcome the fact that he is committed to supporting

renewable energy, but I wish that he was committed not only in his

aspirations but in his voting.</div>

<a name="06042548000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having said that&#151;let us

not be churlish&#151;the hon. Gentleman said that wind power is

important. Yes it is, but that is not all that the Government intend

bringing forward under the Bill. If the clause becomes law, we intend

to give powers to the Secretary of State to ensure that research on

generating energy from waste products is undertaken, with a &#163;15

million fund; there will be accelerated deployment of solar power; and

over the next couple of years, the Housing Executive will be installing

600 solar heating systems in social housing and increasing to 10,000

the number of homes that receive energy from solar power through a

number of energy efficiency measures under the warm homes scheme. We

will also build market capacity with an investment of &#163;2.5

million, and we are underpinning the knowledge economy by investing in

such areas. I would certainly say that the clause is important. It

gives legal backing to the power to achieve those results.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column69" />Column number: 69</div><a name="06042548000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Antrim,

South mentioned ESB&#151;an important point. [<span class="SmallCaps">Hon.

the hon. Member for East Antrim. I know the difference between Antrim,

South and Antrim, East; I have seen both of them kicking around in the

park on several occasions. It was a slip of the tongue.</div>

<a name="06042548000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the hon. Member for East

Antrim said, ESB will have nearly 60 per cent. of the generating

capacity in the new market, and we need to consider how to prevent ESB

from abusing its market power. The dominance of ESB is a challenge to

the operation of the new markets, and the Irish Government too are

considering the position of ESB in their review of the Irish

electricity sector. The Department for Enterprise, Trade and Investment

has taken a close interest in the matter, and the Under-Secretary of

State for Northern Ireland, my hon. Friend the Member for Basildon,

will be considering it

carefully.</div><a name="06042548000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">In

recognition of ESB&#146;s current position, the regulators are

developing a market power strategy to address the potential for market

abuse by participants that control a dominant segment of the generating

plant capacity. Again, I hope that that will be a matter for further

discussion, and I am sure that, if required, my hon. Friend the

Under-Secretary will support a meeting with the hon. Member for East

Antrim to discuss the matters further.</div>

<a name="06042548000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">I commend the clause; it is

valuable, and I am grateful that hon. Members in all parts of the

am delighted to speak to yet another miscellaneous provision in the

Northern Ireland (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill. The clause covers for

the first time a subject that has not been mentioned&#151;the

extension to Northern Ireland of the provisions of the Serious

Organised Crime and Police Act 2005. The amendment is fairly obviously

a probing amendment. It proposes extending to Northern Ireland section

112 of that Act.

intend to adjourn the Committee for a short period for a dinner break

at 7 o&#146;clock. I hope that that might focus

minds.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column70" />Column number: 70</div><a name="06042548000249"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042548000439"></a>Lady

Hermon:</b> I apologise, Mr. Atkinson, if I appeared to

hesitate earlier. I had not heard the Division Bell because I was so

excited by the anticipation of what the Minister would say

aboutthe delay in extending to Northern Ireland sections of

the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005, and in particular

sections 60 to 67, 69 and 70, which are belatedly being extended by

clause 27.</div><a name="06042548000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have

considerable concern about that point. The Minister, who is a diligent

Minister and takes his responsibilities seriously, will have noted that

immediately before the Serious Organised Crime and Police Bill came

before the House there was yet another report from the highly respected

and regarded Independent Monitoring Commission, which he and his

colleagues are so keen to quote to us. They will doubtless do so again

before the end of the

week.</div><a name="06042548000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall quote

from the November 2004 IMC report, which I recommend to all members of

the Committee if they have not already read it. Paragraph 5.5, on page

27, is pertinent to discussion of the Serious Organised Crime and

Police Act. It

states:</div><a name="06042548000315"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The

Northern Ireland Organised Crime Task Force has stated that there are

some 230 organised criminal gangs believed to be operating in Northern

Ireland.&#148;</div><a name="06042548000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall repeat

that: 230 organised criminal

gangs.</div><a name="06042548000316"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We have

been advised that about 60 per cent. or some 140 have paramilitary

links and that, of the top 25 criminal gangs involved in international

activities operating in early 2004, 17, some two-thirds, had

paramilitary

associations.&#148;</div><a name="06042548000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">The next

sentence is the most striking on the entire

page.</div><a name="06042548000317"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Seldom

in the developed world has this high proportion of the most serious

criminals been associated with groups originating in terrorism, with an

organisational structure and discipline, and the experience of

planning, learning and conducting sophisticated clandestine operations,

methods of handling money, and with traditions of extreme

violence.&#148;</div><a name="06042548000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">That was the

report as recently as November

2004.</div><a name="06042548000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was astounded

that, in 2005, despite that report having highlighted the seriousness

of the situation in terms of organised criminals and the gangs that

operate in Northern Ireland&#151;let me remind all members of the

Committee that Northern Ireland is a small part of this United

Kingdom&#151;many provisions of the Serious Organised Crime and

Police Act were not immediately extended to Northern Ireland by way of

primary legislation. It concerns me greatly that now, two years later,

clause 27 belatedly extends to Northern Ireland only sections 60 to 67,

69 and 70.</div><a name="06042548000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">On Second

Reading, the Secretary of State described the chief purpose of the

Bill. He

said:</div><a name="06042548000318"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The Bill

will chiefly allow maximum flexibility in the arrangements for the

future devolution of policing and justice functions to the

Assembly&#148;.&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>, 13 March 2006; Vol.

443, c. 1167.]</div> <a name="06042548000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">Had it not been

for their overriding purpose of devolving to the Assembly the decision

about when it wishes to take responsibility for policing and justice,

when in heaven&#146;s name would the Government ever have got round

to extending to Northern Ireland the important provisions of the

Serious Organised Crime and Police Act, which ought to have been

extended at the time of that Act in

2005?</div><a name="06042548000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment

would extend to Northern Ireland section 112 of the 2005 Act, which

deals with the 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column71" />Column number: 71</div>ability of a constable to order a person to leave an area. For example,

there has been a series of high-profile cases in Northern Ireland in

which men&#151;and let us assume that the vast majority of people who

commit domestic violence are men&#151;have been released, had their

names included on the sex offenders register there, and gone on to

commit serious offences. My amendment would extend to constables in

Northern Ireland the section&#146;s powers in, say, the case of a

convicted criminal who had been told to stay away from the victim of

sexual abuse. The key question is when the Minister intends to extend

the other key sections of the Act to Northern Ireland. When will the

Government get their minds around to that? I shall listen intently to

the Minister&#146;s

response.</div><a name="06042548000259"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042548000440"></a>Mr.

Woodward:</b> I welcome the hon. Lady&#146;s amendment and

the debate that she has raised. Unfortunately, we are not able to

accept the amendment, but perhaps I may crave her indulgence for a

moment, so that she will understand why&#151;and why, none the less,

we are interested in her

ideas.</div><a name="06042548000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">The powers

referred to in the amendment are part of a package of exclusion powers

that include exclusion orders and, where appropriate, electronic

monitoring, all of which, as the hon. Lady recognises, are available in

England and Wales under the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005

and previous legislation, but not currently in Northern Ireland.

Although the amendment is well intended, it would, even if technically

correct, raise practical issues about how to apply it.</div>

<a name="06042548000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">At present the necessary

legislative building blocks are not in place in Northern Ireland to

allow us to adopt the amendment as it stands. To extend section 112 of

the 2005 Act to Northern Ireland now could require the creation of a

much more substantive package of sentencing powers in the Bill, which

is not what the Bill was designed for. My hon. Friend the Minister of

State is now carrying out a review of the sentencing framework for

Northern Ireland, including consideration of, for example, electronic

monitoring. We hope to publish proposals for separate measures in due

course, and in that context we shall of course carefully consider what

the hon. Lady has said.</div>

<a name="06042548000262"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042548000441"></a>Lady

Hermon:</b> I appreciate the assurance that the Minister has

given. I posed two questions, and I accept the answer about why the

amendment cannot now be accepted, but my first question was why the

provisions that clause 27 extends to Northern Ireland were not extended

to it when the Act was first

passed.</div><a name="06042548000263"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042548000442"></a>Mr.

Woodward:</b> Because at the time the exclusion orders were

being developed for England and Wales, Northern Ireland was in the

process of a criminal justice review, in the wake of the Belfast

agreement. It was therefore deemed inappropriate to proceed with those

powers for Northern Ireland. Things have clearly moved a long way since

then. That is one reason for the review being conducted by my hon.

Friend the Minister of State.</div>

<a name="06042548000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are very mindful of the fact

that the success of some of the relevant powers here could apply in

Northern Ireland, and we are taking that into 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column72" />Column number: 72</div>consideration. We do not think that this Bill is the right vehicle for a

comprehensive set of measures, which would be necessary in the case of

exclusion powers and exclusion orders. There is a better place to do

that in light of the fuller sentence review. That is why, given those

assurances and the fact that we are conducting the review, I ask the

hon. Lady to withdraw the amendment.</div>

<a name="06042548000329"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.15

pm</div><a name="06042548000265"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042548000443"></a>Lady

Hermon:</b> I am sorry that I seem to have given the Minister

the wrong impression in my intervention. I warmly accept his

assurances. I am surprised, as we draw towards the end of our

consideration of the Bill, to have had an indication that a

Minister&#151;one, at least&#151;has been listening to our

suggestions as to how it can be improved for the sake of the people of

Northern Ireland.</div> <a name="06042548000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">My

intervention concerned the extension, under this clause, of the SOCAP

provisions to Northern Ireland. The investigatory powers of the

Director of Public Prosecutions&#151;the powers spelled out in

sections 60 to 67 and 69 and 70&#151;were available to be extended to

Northern Ireland in 2005. My question was, when on earth would they

have been extended to Northern Ireland had it not been for the fact

that the Government were adhering to a commitment to Sinn Fein to give

an indication that they would devolve policing and justice to the

Assembly?</div> <a name="06042548000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">That was

the chief purpose of the Bill, but it has turned into a ragbag of all

sorts of things. Of course I welcome the extension of some parts of

SOCAP to Northern Ireland, albeit so late in the day. I am just sorry

that the Minister did not take the opportunity to explain to me why the

measure was so delayed, when it was meant to concern just the

DPP&#151;not exclusion zones; not legislation that did not extend to

Northern Ireland; and not the review that is currently being undertaken

by the Minister of

State.</div><a name="06042548000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, the

Minister has given me an undertaking that a review is being conducted

and that he will look positively at our suggestions for further action.

With those assurances, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

amendment.</div>

chairmanship this afternoon, and to that of your co-Chairman, Mr. David

Taylor, this morning. I must single out for comment the Whip, the hon.

Member for Gedling. He happens to be in the Government party, but as an

Opposition Member, I note that he has been very kind to all members of

the Committee and has been receptive to the odd text message from the

hon. Member for North Down, asking him why I have not been notified of

certain matters. He always tries to keep us very well informed, and I

single him out for

thanks.</div><a name="06042548000292"></a><div class="hs_Para">I commend also

<i class="I">Hansard</i> and the other officials. I commend <i class="I">Hansard</i> for

its speed, because when asked in a note in a brown envelope to submit

the Secretary of State&#146;s quotation from September, I did so, and

when, 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column75" />Column number: 75</div>within minutes, I needed it back, it had already gone. I commend

<i class="I">Hansard </i>staff for their efficiency and speed, and I look forward

to reading what the hon. Member for East Antrim said in his long

contribution on electricity. I am sure that I will understand it better

on a second

reading.</div><a name="06042548000293"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042548000452"></a>Dr.

McDonnell:</b> Further to that point of order,Mr.

Atkinson. I add my thanks and appreciation to all involved. However,

perhaps the best way of showing that to staff would be to shut up and

let them out of here. I add my thanks to you personally, Mr. Atkinson,

because I am relatively new&#151;I have less than a year under my

belt&#151;and I have appreciated your understanding and flexibility

towards me as I am not quite up to speed with

procedure.</div><a name="06042548000294"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06042548000453"></a>The

with my co-Chairman and me. I am sure that we are all delighted not to

have to come back at 10.30 on Tuesday

morning.</div><a name="06042548000295"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question
