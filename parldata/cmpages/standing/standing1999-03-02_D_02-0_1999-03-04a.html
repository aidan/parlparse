<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I have made inquiries into a matter raised by some hon. Members. It seems that the summons cards for our sitting today had already been printed when the decision was taken not to sit this morning. To save costs, the cards were not reprinted, but were issued with the morning sitting crossed out. Unfortunately, the pen used for the crossing out was too faint, so it appeared that the morning sitting had been highlighted rather than deleted. I am assured that, should there be a future requirement to issue amended summons cards, a more suitable pen will be used. I apologise to the Committee, on behalf of those responsible, for that inadvertent lapse.
<H4><center>Clause 1</center></H4>
<H4><center>Meaning of ``stakeholder pension scheme'' </center></H4>
<P>
Amendment proposed (2 March): No. 1, in page 1, to leave out lines 7 to 11 and to insert the words&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(1) A pension scheme is a stakeholder scheme for the purposes of this Part if it fulfills all the conditions of this section.'&#151;(Mr. Quentin Davies.)
<P>
Question again proposed, That the amendment be made.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that with this we are taking amendment No. 7, in Clause 2, page 2, leave out lines 31 to 33.
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Department of Social Security (Mr. Stephen Timms):</B> The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford (Mr. Davies) ranged widely in his opening comments on the amendments and drew in a number of points on subsequent amendments. It may be appropriate if I respond to some of those points, although I know that a number of them will recur when we come to later amendments.
<P>
I shall deal first with the hon. Gentleman's references to the recent proposal for increased flexibility in pension investment. There is no divide between the Department of Social Security and the Treasury on so-called LISAs. The consultation paper is clearly badged as a joint production of the two Departments. The aim is to improve pension provision and to ensure that better pension options are available to those who are able to save for their retirement. The proposed framework for stakeholder pension schemes will achieve that aim. The new flexible vehicle in the document will help by providing a new way in which to invest money in pensions.
<P>
The new arrangements will be an option for all types of pension scheme, including stakeholder pension schemes. The features of the investments in that arrangement will promote flexibility and transparency in any scheme based on it. The arrangements do not rival stakeholder pension schemes. They are not pension schemes at all, but can be used by pension schemes as a way of investing their members' money in stakeholder and other pensions.
<P>
The hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs (Mr. Flight) anticipated my response, but implied that we are missing an opportunity by treating this new development as a relaxation of the investment rules rather than a new sort of pension. No such opportunity is being missed. The advantages of flexible investment that the hon. Gentleman wants in LISAs will be available in personal pensions and, indeed, stakeholder pensions, which use this new investment approach.
<P>
The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford made much of the fact that the new investment proposal is not mentioned in the Bill. That is so, but the consultation paper makes it clear that the arrangements can be established by secondary legislation and that no primary legislation will be needed to authorise the new mechanism.
<P>
Our proposals for stakeholder pension schemes go much wider than the investment mechanism. In particular, it is crucial that schemes should be governed in a way that ensures that members' interests are protected. That is what clause 1 requires. A board of trustees is one long-established, well-understood way of achieving that, but we recognise, as we said in the Green Paper, that other structures could provide similar protection. Clause 1 also allows other forms of scheme governance to be approved. The Green Paper clearly limits alternative proposals and that is the basis on which we are proceeding. We shall not sell the members of stakeholder pension schemes short. The experience of personal pensions should be sufficient to show that additional protections are needed to ensure that savers get a good deal. We cannot allow a re-run of the mis-selling debacle. Any alternative to the trust structure will need to provide scheme members with comparable protection.
<P>
The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford gave the impression that the Bill's proposals will force members of existing pension schemes to give them up. There is nothing in the proposals that will have that effect. There will be no requirement on employees to join a stakeholder pension scheme. Anyone who is in a personal pension will be able to stay in it. In many cases, it will be in their best interests to do so.
<P>
We are saying that employers should make access to a stakeholder pension available to any employees who cannot join an occupational scheme. That will lead to a major improvement in access to pensions. It should not be a significant burden on employers. There is no requirement on employers to set up and run schemes themselves. They simply need to identify a scheme that their employees can join and pass contributions from the employee's pay packet if the employee wishes them to do so. No employer would be in breach of the requirement if any of his employees opted to stay in an existing personal pension&#151;doing so will be fine.
<P>
As to whether a personal pension can count as a stakeholder scheme, we have set out in the clause several conditions that stakeholder schemes should meet. There is nothing in those conditions that will stop personal pensions from being adapted so that they meet the conditions. I have no doubt that several providers will do exactly that.
<P>
The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford criticised us for producing the Bill before the end of the consultation period on the Green Paper. As I explained in our previous sitting, there has already been extensive consultation on the idea of stakeholder pension schemes. In the Green Paper we are consulting not on the proposition itself but on the details of the way in which the schemes should be set up. We shall set out further details in secondary legislation. I assure all Committee members that when we draw up the detailed regulations that are consequential on the Bill we shall consult further.
<P>
<B>Mr. Eric Pickles </B>(Brentwood and Ongar): Further to the point that I made during our previous sitting about secondary legislation, it would be helpful if we had some idea of the timetable that will be involved. The fears of Opposition&#151;and, I suspect, Labour&#151;Members would be allayed if we were given such details in draft form before the consultation period.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> As I said during our previous sitting, we shall issue&#151;I imagine after Easter&#151;a series of consultation documents about the detailed secondary legislation. Those documents will not be available much before the end of our Committee proceedings and the draft regulations certainly will not be available before then. I am afraid that I cannot give the hon. Gentleman the assurance that he seeks. However, a similar approach was adopted with the Pensions Act 1998. I believe that it worked satisfactorily with that Act, and I am confident that it will do so on this occasion as well.
<P>
I must return to the detail of amendments Nos. 1 and 7. The main effect of amendment No. 1 would be to prevent the addition of any further qualifying conditions for stakeholder pension schemes, beyond those already in the Bill. Consequential to that, amendment No. 7 would remove the requirement for schemes to declare that they have complied with such conditions.
<P>
The proposals to set minimum standards for stakeholder pension schemes have been widely welcomed. They will provide an important safeguard to members of the scheme, and they will help to encourage the many people who are wary of pensions to begin saving for their retirement. We have to rebuild trust in pensions and the Bill's safeguards will allow us to fulfil that extremely important task.
<P>
The clause sets out eight conditions in total which all stakeholder pension schemes will have to meet. They are the only conditions that we currently expect to apply. However, it would be supreme over-confidence to imagine that we have come up with a list that will never need to be added to. Committee members will appreciate that the financial sector changes rapidly, as does technology. It is entirely possible that we will need to change the conditions for stakeholder pension schemes in line with other developments.
<P>
We shall want to monitor stakeholder pension schemes when they start operating. Experience of the operation of the schemes may tell us that new conditions are needed.
<P>
We shall consult the pensions industry carefully as we set out the details of the conditions for stakeholder schemes. Those consultations could identify areas where we might want to add new conditions. The amendment would considerably restrict the Government's ability to respond quickly, by requiring that any new condition could be added only by new primary legislation. That would mean that we would risk the requirements for stakeholder pension schemes falling out of date, which would not be sensible. In tabling the amendment, Opposition Members may have been seeking to clarify what further conditions we have in mind.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Jacqui Lait </B>(Beckenham): I think that the Minister realises from the thrust of the amendments that we are looking for more flexibility. He refers to the need to create new conditions. Will those conditions include a less restrictive approach, and does he envisage getting rid of some conditions because of the changing market and the way in which new instruments have developed?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Timms:</B> To provide reassurance for investors in stakeholder pensions, we need the conditions that are proposed in the clause. The hon. Lady makes the point that the amendment seeks to increase flexibility. However, it would seriously reduce flexibility because it would mean that we could do nothing else until we had a new Bill. Given the way in which those things are developing, that would not be a sensible approach. We want to stick with the eight conditions set out in the Bill, as they provide an essential minimum set of standards that will provide people with the necessary reassurance and confidence in pensions&#151;a confidence that has been lost because of events such as mis-selling in recent years.
<P>
The clause could be used to specify some types of investment in which stakeholder pension funds could be held. It could also require schemes to hold records in a common technological format in order, for example, to assist data transfer.
<P>
Under amendment No. 1, schemes would not have to register with the Occupational Pensions Regulatory Authority to qualify as stakeholder pension schemes. I shall explain the reason why registration with OPRA is important. Stakeholder pension schemes will be required to apply for registration. To do so, they will have to give a positive declaration that they meet all the standards that apply. We are not proposing that OPRA should investigate each and every registration. In most cases, the declaration will be sufficient. Requiring schemes to make a positive declaration to OPRA will ensure that the Government and the authority know what schemes are purporting to be stakeholder pension schemes, and OPRA will be in a position to take swift, effective action if it becomes clear that the standards that we are aiming for are not being met.
<P>
We make it clear in the Green Paper that OPRA already has considerable experience in regulating the conduct of occupational pension schemes. OPRA will be able to regulate the conduct of trustees in stakeholder pension schemes in broadly the same way, dealing with reported problems as they arise. The register will also help employers to provide their employees with access to a stakeholder scheme. A comprehensive register will list all the stakeholder pension schemes available, without which the task of identifying a suitable scheme would be much more difficult. Difficulty inevitably adds costs, which places an additional burden on employers. I am sure that every member of the Committee would wish to avoid that.
<P>
The amendments would remove an important safeguard, and, to pick up the point made by the hon. Member for Beckenham (Mrs. Lait), an important flexibility to alter the conditions for stakeholder pension schemes. I hope that in light of that explanation and those assurances the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Leigh </B>(Gainsborough): The Minister referred to the Green Paper, ``A new contract for welfare: partnership in pensions''. After Tuesday's sitting, I took the opportunity to glance at it; it is very well written. Paragraph 37 of the Green Paper makes it clear, as the Minister said, that the Government
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``consider that trust law provides an appropriate framework for stakeholder pension schemes'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and that such schemes
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``will provide for schemes to be set up under trust law.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
However, paragraph 38 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``It is possible, however, that other arrangements could be capable of producing a comparable outcome for scheme members. And we would not want to rule out the development of new governance structures in the future. In order to proivde sufficient flexibility, therefore, we will take the power to define, in secondary legislation, alternative governance arrangements which would be approved by the Secretary of State for Social Security as meeting the requirements to be stakeholder pension schemes. We would welcome views from the pensions industry on alterntive structures which could provide comparable benefits for stakeholder pension scheme members.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<H5>2.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
That is a very interesting paragraph. Given that the Government intend to assume the power to define alternative arrangements through secondary legislation, they are clearly not fixed in their determination to limit the running of stakeholder pensions to trust law. Perhaps that is the result of the hard work of my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford, or of representations made to the Government. Paragraph 38 does not explain the various ideas that are floating around, and I suspect that the Minister has received representations from the pensions industry about those ideas. If, in the light of advice given by my hon. Friends, the Government intend to assume powers to vary the arrangement whereby stakeholder pensions will be fixed in the trust law straitjacket, we should know more about the matter.
<P>
We also need to know more about how the trusts will work. As the Green Paper makes clear, trustees are currently responsible for pension schemes and oversee their conduct and operation. They appoint commercial companies to administer the schemes and invest funds on their behalf, and check the companies' performance.
<P>
Trustees currently operate in the regulated private sector, but how will they operate in the new, stakeholder environment? Paragraph 39 of the Green Paper states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Treasury will . . . publish shortly a consultation document outlining proposals concerning investment by pension schemes. The proposals are designed to allow stakeholder pension schemes run under such alternative governance arrangements to invest funds in units in pooled investment schemes, in a transparent way.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
How will trustees' duties under the new arrangements vary from those under existing trust law? To what extent will the Treasury control the type of investments in which trustees place their confidence? I suspect that, at the moment, trustees have a wide degree of latitude. Will that freedom be curtailed?
<P>
The Government say that stakeholder pension schemes must be registered when they are set up. How will that arrangement differ from the current trust set-up, given that, presumably, trustees are already required to register pension schemes? The Government also say that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Most private sector occupation schemes are already set up under trust''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That implies that a scheme that the Government consider setting up should be set up under trust as well. However, I am particularly interested in the use of the word, ``most''. The Government have yet to explain the alternative arrangements and, given that I am not an expert in this field, I have yet to discover them. Will the Minister enlighten me on that subject?
<P>
My main gravamen is to draw the Minister's attention to paragraph 38 of his Green Paper, which refers to the possibility of making alternative arrangements. I hope that we shall be enlightened&#151;if not today, then very soon&#151;about what alternative arrangments the Government has in mind.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies </B>(Grantham and Stamford): It is a pleasure to be under your chairmanship again Mr. Malins. I must apologise because I am, sadly, suffering from a slipped disc, which can be painful. My doctor told me to spend the next few weeks either lying down or standing up but under no circumstances should I sit down. I cannot lie down in the Committee and I do not suppose that you would want me to stand the whole time, but If I sometimes rise and stand behind the notional Bar, I assure you that I will be following the debate just as attentively. I will, of course, return to my seat as quickly as possible if I need to catch your eye. I hope that I shall be forgiven if my behaviour seems more fidgety than usual.
<P>
I must pick the Minister of State up on a couple of points. All those in the industry who have read the clause would agree that it is an unholy mess. Taken at face value, it is unduly restrictive. Although it mentions trusts and money purchase schemes, it excludes other vehicles. We have tabled amendments to deal with that. If, however, we take into account the phrase that regulations may waive this provision, which is always tacked on, the clause is not restrictive or defining. In fact, it has no purpose because a stakeholder could be anything that the Government decided. That is not a satisfactory way to legislate.
<P>
Our amendments are directed towards achieving greater definition. The new form of the clause as set out in the amendment would provide a simple, straightforward, clear, open and permissive definition. If we state which vehicles can be considered stakeholder pensions and do not mention the lifelong individual savings account, we will face an absurd situation. A LISA is defined in the Treasury's document, ``Helping to Deliver Flexibility in Pensions'', which says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``A financial instrument invested in pooled investment schemes thus looks an attractive alternative framework for personal pensions.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
As an alternative to the existing personal pension, it attempts to give to a wider range of pension investors the opportunities that are available to high-earning people through self-invested pensions. We favour that objective, but it is not clear whether a LISA is allowed or disallowed. If the Minister gets his way and manages to obtain powers to write regulations as he likes, he will be able to decide that matter when the Committee has finished. That is not satisfactory at all.
<P>
We all know why LISAs are not mentioned. They were first referred to in the Treasury document published a couple of weeks or 10 days before the Bill. The gestation period for a Bill is often months&#151;certainly many weeks. The Minister does not want to admit that the Government were overtaken by events. Their timing is appalling. They are rushing the Bill through before the end of the consultation period&#151;which is disgraceful&#151;without co-ordinating with the Treasury or thinking it through.
<P>
The Minister was less than frank when he said that the Bill will not force employees to give up personal pension schemes or companies to give up schemes which they provide for their employees. Strictly speaking, that is correct. Companies can continue to provide a group personal pension arrangement for employees who choose it, as well as providing a stakeholder facility. Deduction from payroll is the essential distinction between the stakeholder pension scheme and previous schemes, and the Opposition are not opposed to that in principle. The employer's obligation to provide a stakeholder pension can therefore be fulfilled in parallel with any previous scheme.
<P>
The Minister knows, and might as well admit, that employers will be faced with the considerable new administrative burden of fulfilling their obligations under such legislation. In practice, therefore, employers will be disinclined to run several different facilities for their employees. A real danger exists&#151;which the Government did not address when I drew attention to it on Second Reading, and which the Minister has not addressed this afternoon&#151;that employers will say that they cannot administer several schemes. If the Government will not allow the group personal pension to count in fulfilment of the obligation to provide a stakeholder system, employers may say that they will have to bring the group personal pension to an end.
<P>
The tragedy is that the stakeholder provisions in the Bill do not require the employer to make any contribution other than providing the facility&#151;he does not have to make any contribution whatever to provisions for the retirement of his employees. But the overwhelming majority of group personal pension schemes currently include an employer contribution. An employer who is exasperated by the Government forcing him to take on an additional administrative burden or to unwind his present arrangements might say to himself, ``I will do the minimum the Government require, and just provide a stakeholder pension''. That will severely disadvantage employees, who will lose the employer contributions that they currently enjoy. Alternatively, an employer might provide the group personal pension scheme to existing employees only, and new employees will have to contribute to the stakeholder scheme or get nothing. Existing and new employees would be substantially disadvantaged in both cases. That will not be a good day's work for pensioners or for aggregate pension provision in this country.
<P>
The Minister should acknowledge that although employers will not be forced to give something up, they will be forced to provide something new. In practice, few employers will want to run several different parallel schemes. I must quote again from the Green Paper&#151;to which my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh) rightly referred&#151;which, unlike the Bill, makes it plain that personal pensions will not be counted as an effective or legitimate means for employers to discharge their obligations under the Bill. On page 53, in chapter 7, paragraph 29 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Existing personal pensions will not . . . be able to describe themselves as stakeholder pension schemes.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The risk is therefore real, and it is bound to have an effect, which is highly undesirable. It remains the objective of Conservative Members to ensure that stakeholder schemes involve no diminution of rights and benefits currently enjoyed by employees and that group personal pension schemes can be continued as stakeholder schemes. That is a fundamental difference between the Opposition and the Government.

<P>

<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I want to make a couple of brief points, which relate to what the Minister said. He put enormous emphasis&#151;and was quite persuasive&#151;on the need for flexibility. Perhaps he can enlighten the Committee on a couple of other small points. Clearly, there will be different tax conditions and contracting-out requirements with regard to stakeholder and non-stakeholder schemes.
<P>
I do not have the expertise of my hon. Friends the Members for Grantham and Stamford and for Gainsborough, but it is not clear to me whether a single scheme, if registered as a stakeholder scheme, could be used as a non-stakeholder scheme. For example, if a person's salary increased, that might take him above the maximum permitted contribution. Could the scheme be adapted or would he have to move on to a new scheme? That is the first point that I should like advice on.
<P>
<H5>3 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Secondly, some money-purchase occupational schemes are multi-employer schemes. Will a single scheme be able to operate as a stakeholder scheme in respect of the employees of one employer but not of another?
<P>
We shall discuss later whether to remove trusts, but it might save time if the Minister could explain now, given the flexibility to which he referred, why trust support is so important. In view of the nature of stakeholder schemes, how will trustees be appointed? Under most schemes they would be appointed from current or past employees&#151;currently pensioners. How will those employees know who to vote for?
<P>
If the Minister can explain those three simple points, we shall begin to make rapid progress.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I am happy to respond to those three points and to the others that were made.
<P>
The hon. Member for Gainsborough asked for more information about the alternatives to trustee governance. Responses to the Green Paper are still coming in. We shall review all those that we receive by the end of the consultation period and we wait with interest to see what proposals come forward. The hon. Gentleman rightly set out the position that is explained in the Green Paper: we are open to receiving ideas from the industry about how the scheme might work. The same position is put in the Treasury-DSS document. Paragraph 39 refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``acceptable standards of security and protection''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>Those are the key objectives that we are aiming for through the trust route. Paragraph 41 goes on to say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``A stakeholder scheme invested in this way''&#151;
<P>
</UL></FONT>that is the way described in the document&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``offers no counterpart of the role of trustees in delivering protection for scheme members' interests. If the requirement for a trust structure for the stakeholder pension is to be set aside for some schemes, a different set of safeguards will be required.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>The document goes on to say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``One possible way of delivering an alternative governance standards might include developing a recognised code of conduct.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>Some of the ideas that come forward may follow that route. As I say, we have asked for proposals and are waiting to see what comes forward.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> The Minister says that the proposals are rolling in. When the consultation period ends, will we have a chance to see those papers? Will they be placed in the Library? It is germane to our debate. The Minister said something very interesting: that one could conceive of a scheme that was not run by a trust but was governed by a code of conduct, no doubt laid down by the Government. If that is true, we are opening the gates wide and moving away from the Government's apparent original intention to limit the Bill to trust law schemes. Therefore, the responses could be interesting.
<P>
<B>Mr Timms:</B> The consultation documents that we shall issue will be widely available, and Committee members will have no problem seeing them. Although they will not be issued while we are considering the Bill in Committee, they will be openly distributed and widely consulted on.
<P>
The hon. Member for Gainsborough also asked about the regime under which the trustees would operate. There are no proposals to curtail the discretion of trustees. The body of regulation under which they will work is essentially the same as applies to occupational schemes under the control of trustees. Trustees will have the same power to decide how money is invested, subject to the overriding duty to act prudently and in the interests of scheme members. Therefore, the requirements will be the same.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> Will the trustees therefore be allowed, as they are now, to have full freedom to decide where investments should be placed?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> Yes, the rules will be the same. Trustees of stakeholder schemes will have the option to invest members' funds in the new vehicle outlined in the Treasury document, but that option will also be available to personal pensions and occupational pension schemes.
<P>
The hon. Member for Gainsborough asked, finally, how the register will operate. As I outlined earlier, we envisage that those who wish to set up a stakeholder pension scheme will have to explain on a form how they will meet the conditions set out in the clause and submit that to OPRA, which will check that the requirements are properly met and will maintain a register. It is not an onerous process and it will enable employers to find out readily what stakeholder schemes are available from which they can select one for their employees.
<P>
The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford asked about employers who are already making good pension provision via group personal pensions. He is worried that, because group personal pensions will not count as occupational schemes, employers will be required to give access to another stakeholder scheme and group personal pensions will be forced to close down. We are aware of that issue. I refer the hon. Gentleman to page 58, paragraph 56 of the Green Paper, which says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``We would also like to hear views on how best to incorporate employers who currently offer group personal pension arrangements, or who make contributions to personal pensions, so as to ensure that employees are not disadvantaged by any change.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Therefore, we are consulting on how the access requirements might apply to such employers.
<P>
It will be possible for a group pension to become a stakeholder pension scheme, provided that it meets all the conditions set out in the clause. We recognise that there are some good group personal pensions, particularly those with the benefit of an employer's contribution, and we are aware that requiring employers to offer a stakeholder scheme as well could lead to them closing down group personal pension arrangements to the disadvantage of employees, which we do not wish to see. Therefore, we shall discuss with the industry an approach that is not only fair to providers but ensures that members' interests are protected.
<P>
The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford referred again to the proposal in the Treasury-DSS document. The vehicle set out in that document is an investment vehicle for pension schemes, which could be used by personal schemes, occupational schemes or stakeholder schemes. It is important to distinguish between the vehicle and the pension itself. The stakeholder pension referred to in the Bill could use that vehicle if it is appropriate.
<P>
The hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles) asked some interesting questions. He asked whether someone who wanted to move to the new regime could convert a stakeholder pension into a personal pension. The person investing would have to transfer from the stakeholder pension scheme to a personal pension scheme, but the framework for the stakeholder pension would make that transfer straightforward and inexpensive. The change would not be problematic, but a stakeholder pension could not be deemed a personal pension without taking any action.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked whether the same scheme could be a stakeholder pension for some people and a non-stakeholder pension for others. Again, the answer is that a distinction must be maintained. The provider of the stakeholder pension and the personal pension could be the same, and the conditions and arrangements could be the same, but people should be aware of a distinction between the two schemes.
<P>
Where the trustees come from will depend on who provides or offers the stakeholder scheme. Such schemes may be offered by trade unions&#151;some already have proposals to do so&#151;employer associations, chambers of commerce and so on. I know that some banks that provide payroll services to small businesses are considering offering such schemes to their customers. Where the trustees come from will depend on the nature of the scheme and who provides it: they may be representatives of the organisation setting up the scheme; they may come from the employers offering the scheme to their employees; as schemes develop and mature, trustees may be scheme members, or they could be independent individuals with experience of the pension world.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> The White Paper states that trustees will be expected to take steps to protect the value of members' funds as they approach retirement. The Minister referred to schemes maturing, which suggests some form of compulsory investment lifestyling with a move from long-term gilts to cash as members move towards retirement. How can trustees be expected to know when someone will choose to start drawing benefits?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> Let me, first, explain what I meant by maturing. As the stakeholder schemes grow and gather more members, so there will be an opportunity for trustees to be drawn from the members of the scheme. That will not be easy at first, because there will not be many members. Nevertheless, the process described by the hon. Gentleman of how members' funds are dealt with as individuals approach retirement is the desirable way in which the funds should be managed, and information will no doubt pass between members and the scheme to make that work. That is how schemes should operate.
<P>
Trustees will be able to draw on the services of professional advisers, as occupational scheme trustees do now.

<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> One of the big issues that came out of the Maxwell pension fund problems was representation by employees as trustees. Will the Minister tell the Committee how employees would have their views represented among the trustees if, for instance, a bank provided the stakeholder pension?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The arrangements will vary, depending on the nature of the stakeholder scheme. At the outset, when the schemes are being established, there will not be many members on which to draw. We want member-nominated trustees to be appointed to the board of stakeholder pension schemes. One can envisage a variety of methods for doing so. Trade unions, for example, provide a useful comparison. They have regular elections among their members, who are in different organisations, to appoint officials. There are several ways to fulfil the provisions' requirements, but they will not all operate from day one, because not many members will be available at the outset.
<P>
<H5>3.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I hope that I have satisfied Opposition Members&#151;I have answered their points&#151;and that the amendment will be withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> We have made a little progress. I am grateful to the Minister for his full explanation and for acknowledging the danger of running down existing&#151;very good&#151;group personal pensions. I hope that the Government have taken that problem on board. When we come to later amendments, we shall give the Minister an opportunity to solve the problem, if he is minded to do so&#151;I hope that he is.
<P>
Obviously, the Minister is still in a complete tizz about the LISA scheme. It is no good saying that it is a vehicle rather than a pension scheme. It is a financial instrument. For heaven's sake, the managers of every sort of funded pension&#151;occupational or personal&#151;are perfectly entitled to invest in the shares of unit trusts and many of them no doubt do so. Most personal pensions are directly invested in unit trusts or in investment trusts. In that case, however, the Government's proposals will involve no change and will be a complete waste of time and waste of the paper on which they were printed. However, as I said, the paper probably did not cost very much&#151;the Treasury document was a rushed job.
<P>
The document used the word ``framework'', although the Minister appeared not to like it. Perhaps we should simply call the proposal a new pension scheme. It will be clear to everyone who reads the Bill whether such a scheme will qualify as a stakeholder scheme.
<P>
We have made a little progress, and we shall be able to debate the subject in greater detail in a moment. I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 3, in page 1, leave out lines 12 and 13.
<P>
The amendment raises the question of trusts, which we touched on previously. Those propsals, as I said earlier, come not so much from the Government as from the Department of Social Security, which is completely obsessed with trusts.
<P>
Clause 1(2) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The first condition is that the scheme is established under a trust''&#151;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and it continues, as is usual in this context:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``or in such other way as may be prescribed.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Why does it say that? The subsection begins by making an assertion but goes on to suggest that it can be withdrawn. If the intention is to withdraw the provision, what is the point of wasting the Committee's&#151;and the House's&#151;time by stating it in the first place? Is subsection (2) a compromise between the DSS's obsession with trusts and the Treasury's views on them? The Treasury either dislikes them or it feels that they are not as indispensable to pensions as the DSS thinks.
<P>
We have to get to the bottom of this issue. We need to clarify where this obsession with trusts comes from and whether it is justified. Doing so will help us to decide whether to accept the amendment or to leave the clause unamended.
<P>
The Green Paper clarifies the obsession with trusts. Paragraph 37 on page 55 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``We consider that trust law provides an appropriate framework for stakeholder pension schemes and that the presence of trustees in the schemes will ensure they are capable of meeting the aims we have set out for them. The legislation for stakeholder pension schemes will provide for schemes to be set up under trust law.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That statement could not be clearer. It no doubt accounts for the first few words of subsection (2), which we are seeking to delete from the Bill.
<P>
Paragraph 26 on page 52 of the Green Paper states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``We propose to legislate initially for one such model''&#151;
<P>
</UL></FONT>one Government model&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``where schemes are established under trust law and run by a board of trustees''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>During the sittings motion debate, my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough asked me&#151;I was glad that he thought that I might have an insight into the Government's mind&#151;why the Government were so obsessed with trusts and trustees. The only reason that I could think of was that they were attached to a model of the labour market that no longer corresponded to the majority of that market and which had little to do with the part of it&#151;small businesses and mobile firms&#151;that was growing and generating employment.
<P>
The Government's model involves masses of people who work in an industry, stay there for the bulk of their lives and appoint employee trustees to look after their pension fund. That is a fine model&#151;I do not want to be accused of attacking it&#151;but why is it necessary to employ it across the board? Most personal pensions do not have such boards of trustees. I am delighted that it will be possible to set up a personal pension on that basis, but who will be the trustees of a stakeholder pension that is set up by a company with 20, 30 or 40 employees? Only a small minority of companies employ more than 100 people; the majority do not. It will not be worth while setting up a trust for 20 or 30 employees.
<P>
Let us consider the cost implications. Trustees, actuaries and lawyers to advise the trustees would have to be paid. If the Government do not accept our later amendment, companies with one or two employees could find themselves in such a situation. That is patently absurd. Life offices will, I imagine, create a vehicle that qualifies as a stakeholder and sell it to companies that need to establish a stakeholder facility. The companies will be told that they are signing up to a trust-based stakeholder pension and that they can make deductions from employee payrolls. They will also be told who the trustees are, and they will not be employee trustees. The trustees will have nothing to do with the company or industry. They will not be on the shop floor for people to chat to.
<P>
The House of Commons has a good old-fashioned system. As a group of several hundred people who work in the same place, we can go to the trustees of the House of Commons pension scheme and ask about the state of play of widow's benefits&#151;has there been any improvement&#151;or ask what they are doing about poor Jack who died last week. That is a splendid system.
<P>
<B>Mr Leigh:</B> How many members of the Committee know who are the trustees of the House of Commons pension scheme?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> My hon. Friend makes a good point&#151;most would have to think hard. I am trying to be fair to the Government. I am happy to say that the trust system works well in some contexts, but it would make no sense for a small firm with 15 employees to share a stakeholder pension fund that is run by a large life office with tens of thousands of people throughout the country who only have in common the fact that their employers send employees' payroll deductions to the same fund and the same fund managers.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> Would my hon. Friend care to comment on the difficulty of ethical investment? There is a greater demand that there should be no investment in, for example, some fashion groups, or tobacco&#151;
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> That is absurd.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> It may be absurd but some employees believe that their pension fund should be invested ethically. How would an employee who is a member of a scheme run by one large provider and which encompasses a large number of small firms be able to influence the investment policy?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> My hon. Friend makes her point extremely effectively. In big occupational pension schemes with a defined group of employees, for instance in the railway industry, the coal mines or the chemical industry, there has been a movement among employees to influence the fund's investment policy. It is their fund and they can do it. But that would not make sense if the fund were entirely unrelated to the enterprise, firm or group of employees.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham asked the same question from another direction and asked it well. I shall not be drawn, Mr. Mallins, on the implied issue of so-called ethical fund management policies, as I know that you would not like that. Although I have strong views on them, I shall not be tempted in that direction.
<P>
We need an answer from the Government on this matter. I wonder whether I can help them. The last time I suggested an answer to them, they did not seem to want to accept it, but they did not give me an alternative explanation. I also wonder whether the Government or the DSS do not have a fundamental misconception about the difference between occupational pension schemes and personal pensions. They believe their own propaganda that personal pensions are bad because they have been mis-sold and when that happens, as with any good product that is mis-sold, the consequences can be extremely evil. No Opposition Member would dream of defending mis-sold pensions. However, personal pensions were set up for those who did not have a pension to which an employer was contributing, who were self-employed or who thought that they could get a better return by investing the state earnings-related pension scheme rebate. All three categories have done extremely well out of personal pensions. Therefore, it is wrong to say that they have been an inherently bad product.
<P>
Occupational pensions have been splendid, but the Government are confusing salary-related occupational pension schemes&#151;I think that we all accept that salary-related schemes are a particularly good deal and therefore a precious part of our pensions framework&#151;with money purchase schemes, which can be occupational or personal pensions.
<P>
Paragraph 28 on page 52 of the Green Paper says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Most private sector occupational schemes are already set up under trust, with a controlling trustee board. It will therefore be open to occupational schemes which offer money purchase benefits to be designated as stakeholder pension schemes if they also meet the other requirements.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>Therefore, occupational pension schemes will qualify as stakeholder, but personal pensions will not. The distinction that the Government are making is that one has a trust and the other does not. However, the real distinction is between salary-related schemes and money purchase schemes.
<P>
There is no reason, and I defy the Government to give me one, why it makes the slightest difference to an employee whether he has a money purchase occupational scheme that has a trust rather than a money purchase scheme in the form of a personal pension. One might say that a money purchase personal pension is a better deal for the employee because it gives him greater flexibility: he can take it with him when he moves; he does not suffer the cost of establishing a different pension system; and he can vary the contributions to it, which he cannot do under the more rigid framework of a money purchase occupational scheme.
<P>
If the employer is providing a group personal pension scheme, that is as good as, or better than, the employer providing a money purchase occupational scheme. I accept that if the employer is prepared to provide a reasonably generous salary-related scheme, that is probably the best deal of all.
<P>
The matter becomes confused here. The Government were carried away by a complete irrelevance of trusts, which the amendment seeks to remove. If the Government wanted to distinguish different types of scheme by the amount of protection that they provide for employees, instead of distinguishing between occupational, which can be defined as benefit or defined contribution, and personal, they should have distinguished between salary related and defined contribution or money purchase, the two phrases meaning the same. That might have been a valid distinction. However, money purchase schemes that have been properly managed and properly sold to the right people have provided good benefits. Nothing could be more stupid than to take away such facilities simply because the scheme does not have a particular structure&#151;a trust, which is neither here nor there. Some personal pension schemes have replicated the trust structure of the classic occupational pension and some have been set up under deed poll. No one has suggested that schemes set up under trusts represent a better deal and produce a better return on investment. If there were such data, the Government should produce it.

<P>

<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> Although I asked the Minister a direct question earlier, he was unable to answer my question about paragraph 38 of the Green Paper, which relates to the alternative governance arrangements that the Government have in mind for the stakeholder pension. As my hon. Friend has experience of the pensions industry, can he enlighten the Committee on what those arrangements might be?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> No, of course I cannot&#151;the Government do not say what those arrangements are in the Green Paper. In the Minister's earlier response, he had the gall to say that the Government had asked for responses on the matter. It is his fault that he has not received any guidance from the public, experts or industry&#151;he introduced this ill-considered Bill before the end of the consultation period. I know, Mr. Malins, that you are about to say that the consultation period is not germane to trusts, and I shall therefore return to that matter.
<P>
We must establish clearly what lies behind the Government's obsession with trusts. If we do not discover the reasons in this debate, we shall never know. That would not be satisfactory. I shall propose two hypotheses&#151;the Government may refute either, but if they do so they must suggest another one. First, they are obsessed with a model of the labour market that is no longer in existence and no longer represents reality in this country. Secondly, they have confused salary-related schemes and money purchase schemes and they have identified occupational pension schemes with salary-related schemes, which are coincidentally set up under trusts, whereas most personal pensions are not. In other words, they have been deflected by a complete irrelevance.
<P>
If a more charitable explanation exists, the Minister should say what it is. There are no three ways about it&#151;if the Government have an agenda to promote trusts, which are mentioned in the clause and the Green Paper, they should tell us their reasons. If they do not have such an agenda, why have they added the words:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``or in such other way as may be prescribed''?<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If the Minister is about to tell me that those words open the field to any reasonable respectable vehicle for setting up a pension scheme, why are trusts mentioned in the first place?
<P>
The Government cannot have it both ways. If they have a special reason for placing confidence in trusts rather than other vehicles, they should say what it is. Why should it be waived if it is so important? On the other hand, if the phrase, or in such other way as may be prescribed; is intended to relax a particularly restrictive provision, why has the clause been set out in such a cumbersome fashion? If that is the explanation, I hope that the Government will accept our amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I promise not to read out any sections from the Green Paper that I have already read out. I shall, however, read out another section, which gives me the opportunity further to question the Government. I am interested in paragraphs 34 and 35 of chapter 7 of the Green Paper because I want to help the Government.
<P>
Paragraph 34 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``We need stakeholder pension schemes to be clearly run in the interests of their members and to be capable of acting on their behalf. Schemes will therefore need to adopt a structure which ensures this can happen.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Will the Minister explain why, in an extremely tight regulatory environment, the non-flexible instrument of a trust must be adopted to meet the aims set out in paragraph 34? I get showered with letters, virtually every week, from a constituent&#151;a financial adviser&#151;who writes about the appalling burdens placed on the financial services industry by the regulatory structure. I am sad to say that that structure was developed mainly by the Conservative Government, but for good reasons and in response to political pressure. A friend and former colleague who has been appointed non-executive director of a new financial services company tells the same story as my constituent. Why is the existing regulatory structure, which is probably one of the most burdensome in the world, incapable of protecting members' interests as set out in paragraph 34 of the Green Paper?
<P>
Paragraph 35 of the Green Paper states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The structure must be able to . . . use the power of the members' contributions to ensure that they get the best value for money''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is what people really care about. The industry's regulatory structure is very tight and value for money is also the industry's primary concern. However, why must a scheme be run by a trust to get best value for money? Indeed, for the kind of small company to which my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford alluded, the running of a scheme by a trust may prove an inflexible instrument that fails to ensure best value for money.
<P>
Paragraph 35 also states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The structure must . . . ensure the scheme complies with the minimum standards and other regulatory requirements; and provide the members of the scheme with high standards of service and with good-quality information about the scheme and about the members' pension rights within it.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Nothing in those aims&#151;which are the Government's, not mine&#151;suggests that the structure must be limited to trusts. A clue to the Government's thinking may be found in paragraph 37 of the Green Paper, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Many of the protections and benefits currently enjoyed by members of occupational schemes will therefore be available&#151;for the first time&#151;to those who work for employers who do not offer an occupational scheme''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That shows why the Government are hooked on trusts. We all have a romantic desire to recreate the occupational pension scheme. On Second Reading, there was a bit of fun when the Minister was asked about the number of new final salary occupational schemes created under the Government. He had to admit that none had been created, and subsequently suggested that none had been created under the previous Government either. It was suggested that that was not true, but we need not go into that now.
<P>
Final salary schemes are the best available and employers have proved increasingly reluctant to set them up. We now know that the Government are trying, by other means, to recreate the occupational pension movement. That is a perfectly good intention, but, as my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford said, one cannot go back in history. The working environment has changed. We no longer have a relatively small number of large employers with stable work forces who remain in the same job for 30 or 40 years. We therefore need to adopt more flexible instruments and the Government have yet to convince me that trust laws are the best solution.
<P>
My family have personal experience of trusts. We discussed setting up a new one with our chartered accountant and family lawyers, but it simply was not worth it. We are currently winding up a trust in which investments were placed for the best part of 80 years by a family firm of solicitors. I shall not bore the Committee with the details, but it has been run in such a conservative way that the rate of return has been minimal compared to what it could have been if the trust could have been broken many years ago. My hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford will know by how much the FT index has increased since the war. If the fund had been invested in ordinary stocks and shares, it would have grown exponentially, but because it was set up under trust law and run by solicitors, growth has been far lower. A trust is an increasingly old-fashioned, stereotyped, conservative, non-value-for-money instrument.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> I recall that a few months after I began my career in the City in 1974, the FT index, under the brilliant management of the then Labour Government, fell to below 150. Sadly, because the Labour Government took all my small salary in tax, I was unable to take personal advantage of that. However, my hon. Friend will realise that a lot of money could have been made.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We are in danger of becoming discursive in discussing the ups and downs of the stock market. Perhaps we can return to the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> You will be pleased to know, Mr. Malins, that I have made my point. The Government's strictures are, rightly, that the primary concern should be to give people value for money, so why are they putting such a tight, old-fashioned straitjacket on what should be a brand new instrument? I believe that the Government are not convinced because, as my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford said, this is a remarkable Bill. I shall probably be told that the form of words in the provision has been used in other Acts, but I have sat on many Standing Committees and I am not sure that I have ever seen a Bill that states that its first condition is that something must be done in a specified way, but that it could also be done in any other way. Clause 1(2) says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The first condition is that the scheme is established under a trust or in such other way as may be prescribed.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I would not mind if the Minister were prepared to tell us what are the other ways that may be prescribed. I know from our earlier debate that he will simply not tell us. He will give us some soothing words about how trust laws are the norm, how they provide protection and all the rest of the argy-bargy that we have already heard, but he will not tell us what other ways may be prescribed. We all know what will happen. When the bill has wound its way through Committee and we can no longer debate it, the Government will introduce a less prescriptive way. If that is so, perhaps we should delay this debate until Report.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I rise to support my hon. Friends because I share their views that it is prescriptive to specify not only an old-fashioned form of pension fund management, but&#151;I slightly take issue with my hon. Friends on this&#151;one that inhibits innovation. We all know how the system works. Inertia, excessive caution and conservatism&#151;as with the family trust of my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough&#151;and that also affects the civil service. It is to the credit of the City of London and the financial community that new instruments are regularly developed. We now have different forms of pension scheme that we had not even begun to think about 10 or 15 years ago.
<P>
I suspect that subsection (2) will limit the options for people with stakeholder pensions. The bulk of stakeholder pensioners will not be in the higher income bracket, so it is even more important that they are able to take advantage of the most flexible, successful and best-value-for money schemes around. One would have thought that the Occupational Pensions Regulatory Authority would have sufficient control over what sort of schemes should be allowed to be stakeholder pension schemes.
<P>
There are also some practical problems. I do not have the depth of experience that my hon. Friends have in the pension market. I have never earned my living in that way. However, I did sit, for my sins, through the deliberations leading to the Pensions Act 1995. I was silent during those deliberations not because I was on the Conservative Government's side, but because I was then a Parliamentary Private Secretary in the Department of Social Security and could not, therefore, contribute. That Pensions Act was largely required because of the issues arising from the Maxwell pension scheme. We have no intention of revisiting the problems of the Maxwell pension scheme, but some issues emerged from it that are not addressed in the Bill, although it is theoretically modern pension legislation.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Quention Davies:</B> My hon. Friend has just adduced an interesting example. The Maxwell case was the worst case of malversation and fraud in the pensions industry, and it was carried out under the trust structure. Are the Government suggesting that the trust structure provides special protection for investors. If so, it is most peculiar that the greatest pension fraud evere perpetrated happened under such a structure. One can only hope that the Government do not draw the wrong conclusion from that.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I agree with my hon. Friend. Most of us who were in that Parliament remember the anguish that many Maxwell pensioners had to endure. There was then an almost overwhelming demand for employee representatives on any trust. The problem with the Bill is that, in order to provide best value for money, the stakeholders' money would need to be in a very large fund. I am sure that it was at the back of the minds of those who drafted the Bill that they might replicate the occupational pension schemes, in which a fairly small fund could be run by the trustees in a medium-sized company&#151;let us not even talk about a small company.
<P>
We want to get the best value for money for pensioners. A board of trustees of a small pension fund voting to put its money into a larger pension fund, managed by a bank or an insurance company, would not be the most effective way to ensure that employees had a voice in the investment policy, because they would not get the return on capital invested that we wish stakeholders to receive. Inevitably, institutions such as banks will offer stakeholder pensions&#151;indeed, the Minister has pointed this out.
<P>
I do not doubt that the Minister is correct. A small number of very large stakeholders funds would therefore emerge. What price, then, the employee-trustee? What price, then, the frequent demand that a pension fund should not invest in whatever is currently unfashionable, whatever the result may be? How is the pensioner&#151;the contributor, whose money is being invested&#151;to have any say in how it is invested? What will happen to employee rights&#151; if rights they are? I am sure that the Government believe that employee pensioners have rights. However, if those pensioners have no representations through the trustees, they will not be able to influence the way in which their pensions are invested. The economic imperative will result in large stakeholder pension funds.
<P>
Will the Minister address those practical details, which are smaller add-ons to the larger philosophical points so ably made by my hon. Friends?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I am delighted to have the opportunity to do that. I shall explain why the Government consider trusts to be the starting point for the stakeholder model. Trust law is already extensively used in the pensions sector&#151;here I touch on some of the points that were made by the hon. Member for Gainsborough. Trust law has been widely tested in the past. It provides valuable security and protection to scheme members. Trust-based schemes are an effective way of ensuring that schemes have a governance structure that ensures that they look after the interests of their members.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> Why does not the Minister just throw away the brief?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The hon. Gentleman should listen to my comments&#151;he might find some answers to his questions.
<P>
If trustees can deliver even a small reduction in overall scheme costs by negotiating on behalf of scheme members, that is likely to outweigh the pretty minimal direct costs of having trustees.
<P>
Stakeholder schemes need to have a governance structure that ensures that members' interests are looked after. The trust basis provides an effective way of achieving that. Trustees will ensure that contributions are used to secure value for money from providers, that schemes comply with the minimum standards and that members receive good-quality information and high standards of service.
<P>
The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford said that trusts were an irrelevance and that they were neither here nor there. Conservative Members' comments on trusts will be deeply insulting to the many pension fund trustees around the country. When Conservative Members reflect on the insults that they have hurled, I hope that they will consider withdrawing their remarks&#151;[Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The Committee is being too noisy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The hon. Member for Gainsborough referred to a dusty firm of family solicitors that had sat and done nothing for 80 years. If he thinks that the members of the National Association of Pension Funds operates its large schemes in a similar way, he has got another thing coming. He should talk to the trustees of the large pension schemes. They are not conservative people who sit on their hands doing nothing, and who take no account of their members' interests. They are energetic, able, committed people who deliver an extremely good service to pension fund members. We want the stakeholder schemes to operate in a similar manner&#151;that is why the trust basis is the starting point for the stakeholder scheme.
<P>
The hon. Member for Gainsborough asked an interesting question. Why, he asked, is the onerous regulatory regime&#151;which he rightly said was introduced by the previous Government&#151;not capable of delivering what we need? That is a good question. The answer, of course, lies in the mis-selling debacle that took place under that framework.
<P>
The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford said that the Maxwell scandal was the worst example of a pension scandal, but that is not the case, although it was an extremely serious scandal. The hon. Member for Beckenham (Mrs. Lait) reminded us that she sat through the Committee stage of the passage of the Pensions Act 1995, which was designed to correct the problems exposed by the Maxwell scandal. However, the biggest scandal was the mis-selling of personal pensions. The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford was the only Opposition Member who mentioned that scandal, although he did so in passing and suggested that it was only a minor issue affecting a few people who should not have got access to personal pensions. It was a huge scandal. It is no good Opposition Members telling us that we should adopt the same starting point for stakeholder pensions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> If the Minister wants to criticise me, which he is fully entitled to do, I hope that he will respond to what I actually said. I said that pension mis-selling was evil. There is no stronger word in my vocabulary to decry any behaviour. On the Maxwell episode, I did not say that it was the greatest scandal; I said&#151;my words will appear in Hansard&#151;that the episode involved the greatest malversation and fraud. Pension mis-selling involved many things, but not malversation or fraud. In case the Minister does not know this, malversation means stealing money or taking money from its rightful owners. That is what Maxwell did. If the Minster wants to criticise me, he must criticise what I actually said.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> Let me remind Committee Members of the scale of the mis-selling scandal. There were 685,000 cases in phase one, and the cost of redress was &#163;2.3 billion. Phase two will involve 1.8 million further cases, and the total bill to the industry will eventually be between &#163;8 billion and &#163;11 billion. For Conservative Members to suggest that we should go down that road again for stakeholder pensions is an outrage. If anyone wants further clarification of why we need the trust basis as a sound foundation for the stakeholder project, the answer is in those figures.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> If what the Minister is saying with such passion is right and the trust route is the only way to protect people, why, in paragraph 38 of the Green Paper, are the Government promising to offer people alternative arrangements?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The trust basis is the starting poing for the stakeholder model. Those are the words that I used and that is the position enshrined in the Bill. That is why we are legislating for stakeholder pension schemes to be set up under trust law. However, we want to retain some flexibility for the future, for the reasons set out in the Green Paper and eloquently read to us by Opposition Members, provided that alternative structures can deliver the same protection and a comparable outcome for members. Then, and only then, shall we be prepared to admit alternative forms of governance to the stakeholder framework. We said in the Green Paper that we welcomed views from the pensions industry on alternative structures that would achieve those ends. That invitation for views is echoed in the recent consultation paper from the Treasury and the DSS on the new flexible investment vehicle.
<P>
I hope that the position is now clear. We need a fundamentally new model for the stakeholder project that will put behind us, once and for all, the disaster of personal pension mis-selling and will rebuild confidence in pensions. That is what our proposals will achieve.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> As a former trustee of a pension scheme I did not feel insulted by any of the Minister's remarks. I congratulate him on managing to put some excitement and controversy into his words. Together with the debate on beef on the bone, this debate will be regarded as one of the most explosive that we have had.
<P>
We are starting off with a new stakeholder scheme, which we genuinely want to be a success, but the Government have chosen a model that is likely to have a low return: they have chosen a model of trustees who are likely to be conservative in their investments. The Minister says that the trustees are worth only a small sum of money. That small sum would be much better spent on advice, which will be singularly lacking for those taking out stakeholder schemes. His own Green Paper recognises that there are other ways of putting stakeholder pensions together.
<P>
The Minister has been asked one simple question and he has gone off all over the place, talking about the scandal and disgrace of personal pensions, and everything else. He is a reasonable man. He is blustering because he cannot answer a simple question&#151;why trustees? Why are they necessary to business? What are the advantages over everything else that is available? Why has the Minister chosen this road?

<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> I think that we won that argument 10-0. I have rarely seen such a clear example of the collapse of a Minister, trying to defend his brief. We have all asked him, why trusts. All that he could do was read back at us the stuff that we had already quoted at him from the Green Paper and say that trusts must be the starting place, but he never began to address the question why trusts must be the starting place. Not a single argument was adduced. So great was the Minister's embarrassment that he fell back on distorting what I had said and going off into irrelevancies about pension mis-selling and so forth, interesting and serious as that is.
<P>
I know many trustees who sit on pension funds, and I have met many in the last few months. They will not be taken in by that childish misrepresentation. Every time I have mentioned trusts, Mr. Malins, I have trespassed on your indulgence by repeating how much I appreciate their value and how much I appreciate the classic structure of occupational pension schemes. Nothing that we say should be taken as a criticism of them. However, the Minister has failed to say why trusts should have a special status or, to use his phrase, be the starting place for stakeholder pensions.
<P>
Before the Minister rose to speak, my hon. Friends asked whether we were going to vote on the amendment. I said that we should wait and hear the Government's response. We cannot be more open minded than that. You hardly need to wonder, Mr. Malins, what we are going to do now. It is clear that we won the argument. The Government have no basis for mentioning trusts.

</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 2, in page 1, leave out lines 17 to 21.
<P>
The amendment is designed to remove another apparently restrictive provision. We want to alter the proposal that stakeholder pensions must be money purchase schemes. However, subsection (4) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``subject to such exceptions as may be prescribed''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This might be another headless chicken, but if it is not a waste of time and there is a real intention to favour money purchase schemes over final salary schemes, the provision is more bizarre and potentially damaging to the interests of pensioners than the Government's insistence on trusts.
<P>
I thought that common ground existed between actuaries, accountants and the financial industry that final salary schemes represent the best value for people in their retirement. It is regarded prima facie to be in the interests of anyone who has a final salary scheme with reasonable terms&#151;usually two-thirds of final or average salary or, in some public sector schemes, 50 per cent.&#151;to stay in it. The basis of the personal pension mis-selling scandal to which the Minister referred is that companies tried to persuade people in final salary schemes to move out to money purchase schemes. That was at the heart of what was problematic, dubious and, in many cases, cynically dishonest about the mis-selling of personal pensions.
<P>
It is quite extraordinary, when the Government take such demagogic advantage of the pension mis-selling scandal&#151;I am sorry that so many people were badly damaged by that; it is not a laughing matter&#151;that they come up with a clause in their Bill to establish stakeholder pensions that appears to favour money purchase schemes. We must probe that with even greater energy and determination.
<P>
The Government have only two or three possible avenues open to them in their defence. They can say that the clause does not mean anything because it will be relaxed and that its only purpose is to extend the Bill to make it more pompous and impressive. They can maintain that they do not know or care about money purchase schemes because they have a huge majority and are able to produce whatever regulations they want when Parliament has finished with the Bill. That may be the case, but the Minister will not make that explicit.
<P>
There are only two possible explanations if the Government are serious about their preference for money purchase schemes. Contrary to what I have just said, they may believe that money purchase schemes are better in principle than other schemes&#151;contrary to the received wisdom and the universal belief of the financial services sector, the Government may think that money purchase schemes are the best deal for the public. If they think that, there could not have been a pensions mis-selling scandal because people who were encouraged to leave the final salary schemes in favour of money purchase schemes would have been acting in their best interest. The Government should confront that contradiction.
<P>
The alternative explanation is that there is a technical problem with including salary-related schemes as stakeholder pensions. The Government might say that that is difficult because it is impossible to predict what an employer's contributions might need to be to maintain the provisions of a final salary scheme. If the financial markets turn down, an employer may need to make exceptionally high contributions and that would be inconsistent with the limit that the Government have set in the Bill of a &#163;3,600 maximum contribution. That is also a contradiction because the limit is a constraint of their own making. My hon. Friends and I have provided&#151;helpfully, I hope&#151;a solution. A later amendment would relax the &#163;3,600 limit and enable the alternative existing revenue limits that are applied to occupational and personal pension schemes to have effect.
<P>
This is another simple case of asking the Government, despite their large majority, to tell us whether there is rhyme or reason&#151;whether there is any coherence&#151;behind the provision and, if there is, what it is. Let us hope that we get a better answer than the one that the Minister used to justify the logic behind the Government's obsession with trusts.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I want to make a brief contribution and I shall not repeat what my hon. Friend has said.
<P>
I want to know about those hybrid schemes that are partly money purchase schemes and partly related to salary. What is their position under subsection (4)? Will the two parts be treated separately? To restrict the option of money purchase benefits would deprive scheme members of a higher salary-related entitlement. Other hybrid schemes operate on the basis of money purchase at a specific age or after a length of service, or are salary related thereafter. If schemes operate on a money purchase basis for some categories of employees and are salary related for others, will the money purchase option operate as a stakeholder scheme? That is an important point which needs a response.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> First, I repeat to the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford that governance was at the heart of the mis-selling scandal. That is why the clause tackles the problem in the way that it does.
<P>
Money purchase arrangements are simpler and more flexible than salary-related arrangements. I agree that salary-related schemes are excellent value for many people, but they depend on having someone standing behind the scheme&#151;an employer&#151;and normally there will be no such party able to stand behind a stakeholder pension scheme. Therefore, that approach is not practical. With money purchase, on the other hand, each person has a readily identifiable pot of money&#151;the contribution that has accumulated so far. Everybody understands that. People will receive regular statements showing how much their pot is worth. Transfers of funds will be simpler and charges more transparent. Therefore, money purchase will be best suited to the needs of those who move jobs frequently and are therefore most likely to benefit from a stakeholder pension scheme.
<P>
The complexity of current arrangements is one of the main deterrents to people taking out a pension. The provision of benefits on any basis other than money purchase will necessarily be more complicated and therefore less attractive to those who are new to pensions&#151;the people whom we want to attract into the stakeholder project.
<P>
As the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford said, there is the power to prescribe exceptions to allow other forms of benefit, but schemes would still have to satisfy the other conditions for stakeholder pension scheme status. We do not envisage allowing such flexibility initially, although it may be appropriate later. Whatever happens, we want to ensure that any stakeholder scheme is secure, flexible and value for money.
<P>
Hybrid schemes of the type described by the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar would not meet the conditions for stakeholder pensions. However, one of the attractions of the model is the ease and cheapness with which it will be possible to move from a stakeholder scheme to something else if people feel that another sort of pension is more appropriate to their circumstances. That would be the way to achieve the hon. Gentleman's objectives.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tom Levitt </B>(High Peak): I was not planning to speak, because pensions are not the part of the Bill on which I am most expert. However, as this short debate has progressed, three kinds of people have come to mind who illustrate graphically why the clause is right and the amendment wrong.
<P>
I can think of people I have worked with in the past who, in their 50s, are worn out, but keep going for one more year because they need the final salary rather than the contributory element to help them along a little. More worrying than that, I know of people at the end of their professional life who get a promotion from an employer who is well minded towards them. That promotion is not based on their skill or responsibility but is a favour to help them to reach the final salary level in the last couple of years, because of the nature of the scheme that they are in.
<P>
The third person that I think of is someone I met on a doorstep a few weeks ago. He was worried that, as someone on a temporary contract, he could not enter the occupational scheme that 90 per cent. of his fellow employees were in. He would be penalised in some existing schemes because he had been on temporary contracts for several years with gaps in between.
<P>
As the stakeholder scheme not only does not depend on manipulation but does not penalise those who opt out of it for a year or so while they are building up their pension, the money purchase scheme, for all three of those people, would be the best and most just. Therefore, I have no hesitation in supporting the clause against the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> I think that I can satisfy the hon. Member for High Peak (Mr. Levitt). He cited the example of someone who feels too exhausted to continue in work, but who is desperate to do so to achieve the final salary, perhaps at the expense of his or her health. The solution is clear. As my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar suggested, the employer could offer a hybrid&#151;in other words, a choice&#151;by way of a stakeholder scheme.
<P>
No one is suggesting that the provisions contained in the 1993 Act should be relaxed. They have always enabled money to be taken from an occupational pension scheme or final salary scheme and transferred to a money purchase scheme, should that be the most advantageous course of action. Therefore, a person in the hypothetical situation that the hon. Member for High Peak described would not be disadvantaged.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman also referred to the exaggerated promotion of individuals at the end of their careers to provide better pensions. In doing so, he is attacking final salary schemes by alleging that they are open to abuse. I have seen no serious evidence of that, but if it exists, he should produce it. That would be an indictment of the occupational final salary scheme as a whole.
<P>
<H5>4.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
What worries me is that the hon. Gentleman has largely confirmed the dark suspicion&#151;which we have held for some time, and which is so horrible that one hesitates to mention it&#151;that the Government, despite their rhetoric, have it in for final salary schemes. Events since the Labour Government came to power, which have been disastrous for such schemes, were not, as I have hitherto alleged, a result of Government thoughtlessness, but part of a deep-seated agenda to destroy the final salary occupational pension system. Considered objectively, their actions undoubtedly reflect such an intention.
<P>
The abolition of the pension tax credit, which removed &#163;5 billion a year from pension schemes, was a major blow to the final salary scheme in particular. The costs and potential risks associated with setting up such schemes greately increased and led to an unprecedented decline in their number. Schemes were wound up, frozen&#151;in other words, closed to new employees&#151;and replaced by something less attractive to the pensioner.
<P>
The differential SERPS rebate was another scandal to which I referred at the time. Where SERPS rebates reduced or remained constant for final salary schemes, they actually increased for group and other personal pensions. The agenda behind the provision that we hope to amend is once again to attack the concept of final salary schemes. That is a frightening thought for people who are members of such a scheme and for those who hope to enjoy the advantages that so many have enjoyed in the past. Unless the amendment is accepted, the Bill will effectively cut off that hope in respect of stakeholder pensions.
<P>
The Minister gave the worst possible answer to my question. He did not say that the matter was technical, or that he intends to use the regulatory power that he is seeking to allow final salary schemes de facto, despite the fact that the Bill appears not to regard them as welcome. He said that the power will not be used and that the provisions will not be relaxed immediately. That means that prospectively there will be no relaxation in favour of final salary schemes.
<P>
The situation is extraordinary. We all know that the schemes are under threat because employers have found them increasingly expensive to maintain under the new Labour Government. When those liabilities are viewed as assets, from the point of view of the beneficiary, their greater expense means, by definition, that that scheme must be better than the money purchase alternatives. That is a matter of fundamental logic. If something is more expensive for the provider, it is by definition a better deal for the recipient.
<P>
The Government will deliver another blow against the final salary scheme and they will narrow even further the scope for those schemes to develop. They will push money purchase schemes. Whether or not the amendment is agreed to, our debate has revealed the Government's real agenda on the structure of pensions in this country and I thoroughly deprecate their intentions in that regard.
<P>
Conservative Members will continue to defend final salary schemes. They represent extremely good value for money. We tabled the amendment in the hope that the Committee would agree that employers who are good enough and generous enough to accept a higher level of liability should be able to offer final salary schemes as stakeholder pensions. We should encourage them to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> Let me correct the impression that the hon. Gentleman has given. We have absolutely no prejudice against salary-related occupational pension schemes. However, that is not an appropriate model for stakeholder pensions for the reasons that I gave. An employer should back up the pension promise, but in the case that the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford discussed, there will not be a party to do that.
<P>
On Second Reading, the hon. Gentleman and the shadow Secretary of State suggested that no new occupational pension schemes had been set up under this Government. In fact, in 1997-98, 30,000 new occupational schemes were set up, and just over 24,000 new schemes have been set up so far in this financial year. I do not have the figures showing how many of those were salary related. The hon. Gentleman's suggestion that such schemes are on the way out is wrong.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davies:</B> Immediately after our debate the other day on this subject, I contacted the National Association of Pension Funds Ltd, which told me that it did not know of any new final salary scheme that had been set up under the Labour Government. The Minister's answer is either deliberately deceptive&#151;I cannot believe that he would try to be deliberately deceptive and I would not accuse him of doing so&#151;or it shows his failure to grasp the essential distinction between money purchase schemes and salary-related schemes. The Government are obsessed with the complete red herring between occupational schemes, which are defined as those that have a trust structure, and personal schemes. The Government pose a direct threat to salary-related schemes. We supposed that that was the result of thoughtless action on their part, but we now know that it is part of a deliberate agenda.
<P>
This is a bad day for pensions in this country. We shall press the amendment to a vote.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
I may be able to set the Committee's mind at rest on one question&#151;this is a probing amendment, and unless the debate takes a turn that I cannot predict we do not intend to put it to a vote. We need a detailed and precise discussion on maximum charges. Our amendment would establish that the total cost in fees, commissions, management charges, or administration charges of a stakeholder pension would not exceed 1 per cent. of contributions&#151;whether they are beneficiaries' contributions or, if the employer is contributing, which we would always hope would be the case, employers' contributions on behalf of beneficiaries&#151;or 1 per cent. of the investment return achieved by the management of the fund.
<P>
It is important to make an explicit distinction&#151;we will return to the issue of cost later in the Committee&#151;between the portion of the money handed over by the individual employee or employer that is invested for the account of and benefit of the employer, and the portion that is abstracted for any other purpose. Under our amendment, the abstracted portion would not exceed 1 per cent.
<P>
It is my strong natural inclination to argue in principle that it is not for Governments to fix prices or charges. As we do not intend to put the amendment to a vote, I shall not argue differently today. It is not sensible for Governments to fix the price of electricity, beer, bus fares or rents. It has been tried in the past, usually by Labour Governments, with unhappy results. It has been tried elsewhere in the world with even more unhappy results&#151;some sensational cases will come to all our minds.
<P>
In an efficient, competitive market, the rate of profit should be no more and no less than the market rate. If it were less than the market rate, no one would invest in the service, the service would cease to be provided and the volume of supply would fall until the point at which the price rises because the demand remains high. Alternatively, if the rate of profit were in excess of the market rate, competition would be encouraged, supply would increase to meet a given amount of demand, and the price would fall. That is basic microeconomics to which all Conservative Members are devoted. Our amendment does not seek to revise economic theory.
<P>
Some markets may not be competitive&#151;on the whole, financial services in this country are competitive. It is right for the state to take action if a market is not competitive, but it should do so through regulation and competition policy, not through price fixing.
<P>
Our simple reason for tabling the amendment is that the Government published a Green Paper stating that they would fix costs and charges. The Bill provides for that possibility without stipulating the level at which those costs and charges will be fixed. One can argue in principle against Government regulation of prices, and I have already done so in principle. One could argue, as the Labour party always used to do, in favour of Government regulation of prices, but the worst of all possible worlds is one in which the Government come to the House to seek a blanket right to fix costs and charges in any way they choose without telling Parliament how they intend to exercise that right. That is arbitrary regulation of prices, which doubles the offence and the danger to the economy and to the pension system.
<P>
The Green Paper is clear. Page 53 states in paragraph 32 that the Government will require
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a limit on the permitted level of charges. There are risks in setting a maximum, which can become a minimum and discourage competition to get below it.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
They have accepted my theoretical point and reflected. Paragraph 32 continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``But we think the reassurance of a fixed standard is needed to enable stakeholder pension schemes to meet their aims.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Paragraph 31 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The minimum standards for stakeholder pension schemes will build on the `CAT' standards&#151;costs, access and terms&#151;which are to be used for Individual Savings Accounts.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It continues, and I emphasise this:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``But compliance with the ISA CAT standards is voluntary. For stakeholder pension schemes, compliance with the standards will be a requirement for the scheme to be designated as a stakeholder pension scheme.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
It is clear that the Government have considered the economic arguments, which I set out, for and against price fixing. It is clear that they have decided in favour of price fixing, but they are not telling us in the Green Paper or the Bill how the charges will be fixed. The consequences of that are enormous. The industry must prepare for stakeholder pensions and needs to know what the charges will be. It will know only that the Government have taken powers arbitrarily to fix them, but not what they will be. No board of directors will invest in a market in which prices are dictated not by the market but by the Government, when no one has any idea of what they will be and when, presumably, they will be able to be changed. That is hopeless. If the Government allow the clause to go through without specifying the charges, they will stymie the stakeholder system until they explain what the charges will be.
<P>
The Government may say that they will tell the public and the industry in a month or two what the charges will be, but that is not good enough. It is not good enough to rush legislation through Parliament before the consultation period has finished and to tell us something in a month or two which they could tell us now. If that is their intention, we must know why that is and specifically what factors the Government do not know now but will know in a month or two which will determine the charges. If the Government cannot say what those factors are, we must presume that no relevant new circumstances will be known to the Government or mankind in a couple of months which could not be known now and that there are no uncertainties which will be less great in two or three months than they are now. If those are the circumstances, we see what the Government are playing at: they are playing ducks and drakes with Parliament. They are trying to introduce legislation which gives them powers to make an arbitrary determination of something and they are disguising what that will be. They could tell us now just as easily as in a few months.
<P>
If they are saying that, in two or three months, the world will not be very different from now, but in a year, two years or five years it may be different so they cannot anticipate the charges, the whole scheme will be dead. Perhaps it is a good thing that they pulled the consultation period early, because people have spent time and money focusing on stakeholder pensions and it is a shame that they were cheated between December and February. It would have been even worse if they had spent time and money on it until 31 March or beyond.
<P>
Furthermore, we are wasting our time in the Committee, because in those circumstances not a thing will happen until the charges are fixed. Nobody will prepare for this new product; nobody will begin to consider how to market it or manage it, whether there should be a trust and, if so, how it should be set up; and nobody will talk to employers. It will be a completely dead duck. Parliament is again being treated irresponsibly, because we are debating something that cannot possibly happen. We are debating something that is dead&#151;a dodo. That is no good at all.
<P>
The Minister must decide where he stands. He can either tell us that, on reflection, it was not sensible to say in the Green Paper that the Government were proposing to fix charges or to put it in the Bill, and that he intends to get away from fixing prices in this market. If he tells us that, we shall be perfectly happy and can then move on to the rest of the Bill. Alternatively, he can tell us that he still thinks that there is good cause to fix prices in this market, in which case he needs to answer two questions. He has a pen in his hand and I hope that he writes them down and does not forget to answer them when he rises to his feet.
<P>
The first question is this: what is special about this market that does not apply to motor cars, ice cream or anything else that makes it sensible to fix prices here and not in other markets&#151;unless the Labour Government intend to go the whole hog and have a Gosplan type of economy. I do not know whether that is currently in their minds, but one never knows.
<P>
If the Minister wants to go down that route, the second question is: what is the level of charges? The charge for the LISA has been fixed at 1 per cent., so the amendment would seem to be one that the Government would want to vote for, even if we do not want to. We are giving the Government the opportunity at least to come clean with a bad policy by putting down specific figures that they do not want to tell Parliament and the public about.
<P>
The Minister can keep writing, because another possibility is that he will say, ``Just wait a little bit. We don't known the answer to this question, but we shall come back to you.'' I have another pair of questions for him&#151;a sort of binary question. If the Minister comes back and says ``Don't worry. We can tell you fairly soon. The regulations will be in place in the next few months'', as he has said in the context of other regulations this afternoon, he must answer this question: what will change in the world between now and when he expects to be able to issue those regulations that means that he will be able to give the public and the industry in a few months' time the answer that he is withholding from Parliament now?
<P>
The second aspect of this second set of questions is this: if the Minister says, ``No, there will be no change in the next few months, but the Government will not know for some time how they will use the power that they wish to take here''&#151;in order words, when they will calibrate the clause by putting costs on it&#151;he must tell the House how in the name of financial and commercial theory he expects anybody to invest in this product or begin to get it ready in anything like the Government's timetable, which wants stakeholder pensions to be available for the public by 2001. The industry will require at least two years to get the systems and software in place to begin to market and set up those structures. The whole thing may be a new Labour gimmick, which was never intended to amount to anything. I increasingly think that that is the case.
<P>
The Minister must give us his answer. The Committee is a forum in which he cannot escape answering those questions. If the Government do not answer them today, they will probably never be answered. I hope that the Minister has carefully noted those two sets of two questions, because we need precise answers.

<P>

<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I hope that the Minister has ample ink in his pen, because I want to ask another question. The Government are laying down the level of expenses, and no doubt the Minister will tell my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford what that level will be. As my hon. Friend said, this is a probing amendment.
<P>
The Bill lays certain obligations on trustees, who will have to employ actuaries, auditors, investment managers, legal advisers and the like to discharge their duties under the Bill. I can foresee circumstances in which, in discharging their obligations, their costs will be greater than the sum prescribed by the Government. The most obvious example would be if they became involved in protracted legal proceedings and costs started to escalate. What would happen under those circumstances? Who would pay? Would the trustees be liable? Would the beneficiaries of the stakeholder scheme eventually be liable? Would the stakeholder scheme have to fold up because it could not meet those requirements?
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford said, until we know the answers, no one will start the process of setting the schemes up, in case they cannot discharge their obligations under the Bill. There is also the prospect that stakeholder pension schemes will be seen as a soft touch for those who become involved in legal proceedings, because they will know that there is a ceiling under which they cannot pass.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I want first to make a couple of comments on the amendment. As I read it, it proposes that the charges might be an amalgam of a limit on the three parameters set out in it. Those three parameters may well appear in a charging regime, but I would expect only one of them to appear, rather than an amalgam.
<P>
I know that the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford will not press the numerical point, but whereas under parameter (c),
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the value of the rights under the scheme'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the figure of 1 per cent. has occurred elsewhere and has been discussed in that context as well, for parameter (a), typically for personal pensions, the costs amount to 25 per cent. While we hope that the cost of stakeholder schemes will be less than that, it would be optimistic to think that we could reduce them to 1 per cent. of parameter (a). Nevertheless, the amendment is an opportunity to consider the charging regime that we shall introduce.
<P>
I reassure Opposition Members that there is a great deal of interest in providing stakeholder pensions. We are debating a measure that will provide appropriate, funded pensions to millions of people who do not have access to anything appropriate at present. One reason why they do not have access to anything appropriate is the high costs associated with personal pensions. That is a particularly serious problem for people on low and moderate incomes, whom we want to bring into funded pensions with the stakeholder model.
<P>
On personal pensions, typically, charges take about a quarter out of the final pension. We think that that can be done much more economically with the stakeholder model, because of how they will be sold and because they will be set up by existing affinity organisations. As the industry recognises, there is a good deal of scope for doing things more economically, given that approach. We therefore propose that the minimum standards should include both the way in which charges are levied and a limit on the permitted level of charges. Subsection (5) gives the power for that to be done.
<P>
It would not be appropriate to set out the charging limit in the Bill, as the amendment proposes. As things develop, there may need to be a change to the standards for charges. With experience and as more providers come into the market, it may become clear that the initial charging regime is too lenient. It is conceivable that it could be too strict&#151;or become so at some stage&#151;and would need to be eased in the light of our experience of running the schemes. It would not be appropriate to include a figure in the Bill or to announce the level of charges at this stage.
<P>
The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford asked what will change&#151;the consultation process will be completed by the time that we announce the charges. This is a fundamental decision and it is important to get it right. We shall try to do so by having detailed discussions with those who will provide the pensions and with the industry more generally. We shall have those discussions in good time to enable the schemes to be in place before April 2001, which is just over two years away. It would not be appropriate or right to attempt to guess what the level might be.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
It is important to have a standard for charges. Much anxiety has been caused by the high level of charges associated with personal pension. I assure Committee members that those problems will not be a feature of the stakeholder model.
<P>
As the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford said, our approach is entirely consistent with the CAT standards for ISAs. There was extensive consultation before the standards were set. The figures will be announced in good time to allow the industry to make stakeholder pensions available by 2001.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> Will the Minister answer my question, which was about what would happen if the prescribed levels were exceeded?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> Like every financial services product, those responsible for providing the pension need to manage their business in a responsible way. Unforeseen expenses can occur in any regime and they need to be managed in relation to stakeholder pensions as they do elsewhere. There is nothing exceptional about the stakeholder regime in that respect.
<P>
There is agreement in the industry about the fact that we have an economical approach. A much more attractive charging regime will be applied to people on low or moderate incomes, whom we need to encourage into the pensions sector.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> Will the Minister answer my question? If the prescribed limits are exceeded who will pay and what will the consequences be for the stakeholder pensions scheme?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The answer to that question is that which applies to any business that faces a serious financial charge&#151;it is for the managers and trustees to deal with. There is nothing different from the situation that is faced by any other financial service provider&#151;normal commercial arrangements will apply.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quentin Davies:</B> These proceedings are taking a sad and unfortunate turn. We are not making any progress at all. The Minister is not responding to my questions; he is merely reading out a fog of platitudes and circularity.
<P>
Earlier, I asked the Minister why trusts were supposed to be the first stage in the stakeholder pension. He replied, ``Because trusts are supposed to be the first stage in stakeholder pensions.'' In this debate, I asked him, ``Why is it necessary to fix prices and charges in this market?'' He replied, ``Well, it is necessary to fix prices and charges in this market.'' I asked him, ``Why cannot one say what the charges are?'' He replied, ``It is not appropriate or right to say what the charges are.''
<P>
I used to think that ``appropriate'' was a word that bureaucracies used rather contemptuously to befuddle the general public. Judging by the number of occasions on which the word appeared in the text that the Minister read out, it appears that bureaucracies now use the word to befuddle their own Ministers. The Minister is certainly thoroughly befuddled, because he has been unable to answer the key questions that I asked. I shall repeat them&#151;he has one last chance to give an answer to them, if he has one.
<P>
First, what are the specifics of this market that make it appropriate for price fixing, when even the new Labour Government accept that Government price fixing is not generally appropriate to markets? Secondly, if there is a basis for fixing charges in this market, what level of charges does the Minister have in mind?
<P>
Thirdly, if the Minister does not have a figure in mind at the moment, but will make a decision in the next few months, what factors can possibly change in that time? What elements will be available to him in a few months' time that will enable him to make a better or more appropriate&#151;to use the word that he likes&#151;decision than he could make now? How can he possibly conceive of that? This is an important matter.
<P>
There are sometimes reasons in life for putting off decisions&#151;for example, when relevant information, not now available, is likely to emerge that would make those decisions more effective if one waited. That is not the case here. If it were, I take it that the Minister would have told us what factors would be available. All that he referred to&#151;which was insulting in the extreme&#151;was the consultation period. I have already pointed out to him that it was wrong of the Government to present the Bill before the consultation period had expired.
<P>
It is extraordinary that the Minister thinks that the Committee will accept the excuse that in the next three weeks someone will come up with a magical answer to these questions, as he obviously does not have an answer now. He should not come to the House with the Bill without having thought through the matter, and without having answers to those questions. If he needed a consultation period in order to be able to answer them, the Government should have allowed the consultation period to reach its term before presenting the Bill.
<P>
If there are to be no new factors, no greater ability to make a sensible decision in a few months' time than now, and if the delay will in fact be longer than that, will the Minister accept that the 2001 deadline is absurd? Nothing would be done by the industry in the meantime&#151;quite rightly so, for the reasons that I have already given. The stakeholder pension project, on which we are spending so much time&#151;possibly completely uselessly&#151;will never take off until the Government have resolved this issue.
<P>
Those are my four questions; they were not answered. That is a most unsatisfactory way to proceed, and it will affect our vote on clause stand part, when that opportunity arises. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
