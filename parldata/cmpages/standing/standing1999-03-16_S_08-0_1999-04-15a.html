</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before I call the first amendment, I shall make a short announcement. As hon. Members will be aware it is permissible in debates to read extracts from documents, but page 372 of ``Erskine May'' states that such extracts and quotations should be reasonably short. Naturally, in this phase of the Committee's proceedings, Members will want to refer to, and quote from, oral and written evidence that the Committee has received. However, I ask them to keep such references brief and to the point.
<P>
Members may have noted that a volume of Hansard containing the written evidence received by the Committee was made available in the Room on Tuesday. A new version of that document, containing a table of contents, was published yesterday. Some copies are available in the Room, and they can also be picked up from the Vote Office.
<H4><center>Clause 2</center></H4>
<H4><center>Leave to remain</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. James Clappison </B>(Hertsmere): I do not intend to move amendment No. 74 which appears first on the selection list.
<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Allan </B>(Sheffield, Hallam): I beg to move amendment No. 109, in page 3, line 7, at end insert&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(2A) Only conditions of a kind that could be imposed on leave to remain given under section 3 may be prescribed.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Following in the footsteps of the Deputy Prime Minister, I was almost caught on the hop. The amendment is designed to obtain clarification from the Government. Why are the conditions set out in section 3 of the Immigration Act 1971 not specified as a particular requirement under this clause when they are referred to in clause 1? Section 3 of the 1971 Act specifies a particularly restricted set of conditions that can be applied or imposed on leave to remain. They include a time limit, a restriction or prohibition on employment, a requirement to register with the police and/or a requirement not to have recourse to public funds.
<P>
Clause 1 clearly states that the conditions can be applied on leave to enter, but I was concerned to find that they do not appear in clause 2, which relates to leave to remain. As it stands, I understand that the Secretary of State could impose a variety of different conditions way beyond those specified in section 3 of the 1971 Act. His ability to impose such conditions would not in any way be subject to parliamentary scrutiny and Parliament would not be able to determine what they involve in the same way as it did with the conditions in the 1971 Act.
<P>
I hope that the Government will accept the amendment and clarify that the conditions that apply to leave to remain will only be those specified in section 3 of the 1971 Act. If the Government do not wish to accept the amendment, will the Minister tell us whether the Government intend to go beyond the scope of those conditions or whether the clause will allow only the conditions that I have described to be applied? It would be a major issue if the law were changed to allow a new set of conditions to be applied without any form of parliamentary scrutiny. We should be able to consider whether we wish to allow the Secretary of State such power.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> We now come to leave to remain as opposed to leave to enter. In our previous sitting, we debated how the Government proposed to change the arrangements for how and when leave to enter should be granted. The amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Allan) touches on an issue that concerns a number of organisations that have made submissions to the Committee, including the Immigration Law Practitioners Association and the Immigration Advisory Service. They seek clarification from the Government about the conditions that could be imposed under subsection (2)(b).
<P>
I shall keep my remarks brief, as we simply seek clarification. It may be that the wording of the Bill has given rise to these concerns and the Government do not intend to make substantive changes and impose different conditions on leave to enter. The organisations that I referred to want the statute to make clear what conditions can be imposed on leave to remain. Will they be the same as at present or do the Government intend to introduce new conditions?
<P>
Under section 3 of the 1971 Act the conditions that can be imposed on somebody granted leave to remain are a time limit, a restriction or prohibition on employment, a requirement to register with the police and a requirement not to have recourse to public funds while the leave to remain in this country subsists. Do the Government envisage that the order will contain different conditions? If so, that would put a different complexion on matters. The explanatory note does not pave the way for new conditions, but refers to the purpose of the clause as being
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``to allow greater flexibility in the way in which foreign nationals . . . are notified of the leave to remain that they have been granted and the conditions . . . and time limits attached to that leave.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Without going into the matter at too great length, we simply ask whether the Government intend to impose new conditions or to impose the present conditions in a more flexible and technological way.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department </B>(Mr. Mike O'Brien): Clause 1 provides for a new section 3A to be inserted in the Immigration Act 1971. Subsection (3) of the new section would allow the Secretary of State to lay an order before Parliament to provide that, in specified circumstances, a visa or entry clearance is to have effect as leave to enter. An order under subsection (3) might provide, for example, for the number of times that a visa is to have effect as leave to enter and the conditions that apply to leave to enter.
<P>
Under subsection (5) of new section 3A only conditions of a kind that may be imposed on leave to enter under subsection (3) may be prescribed. Subsection (3) is concerned wholly with the situation where visa or other entry clearance might also act as leave to enter. We wish to restrict the conditions that might be imposed by the entry clearance officer when granting a visa as leave to enter. Subsection (5) of the new section 3A inserted by clause 1 coveres that. It limits the entry clearance officer to the conditions that might be imposed by an immigration officer at the port of arrival.
<P>
The restrictions on conditions to be imposed in the case of a visa also granting leave to enter apply in a limited and specific context. Clause 2 deals with a different and wider issue&#151;the granting refusal and variation of leavev to remain&#151;and covers a more varied range of circumstances. It is therefore wholly inappropriate to mix the circumstances in clauses 1 and 2. The leave to remain decision will be made by those workers in the United Kingdom and it is appropriate that the full range of conditions is available.
<P>
For example, in due course a requirement could be inserted that a person puts a smart card in a slot on returning to the UK after a period abroad, where the leave does not lapse on leaving the UK. The clause gives us the flexibility that we need. We do not seek to impose different conditions from those now imposed on people who have leave to remain, other than those brought about by new technology. People may have leave to remain to attend a college course which might go beyond the time restriction on employment and registering with the police. We may want to add a condition that they should attend their course, but for the moment we do not seek to introduce it in the clause. It would have to be done through a change in immigration rules, or through other provisions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> We are coming to the point. Does the Minister agree with my analysis of the current restrictions on conditions that can be imposed on people granted leave to remain&#151;this is the view of the expert organisations&#151;and does he propose changing the type of conditions?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> We do not at present propose to change the conditions that can be imposed by immigration rules. However, we want to be able to accommodate any changes in the way in which technology enables us to impose conditions. If, for example, a person had leave to enter and to remain, and we wanted to introduce a new way of ensuring continuance of that leave, we would want to be able, through the clause, to introduce new regulations to facilitate that. In a sense, it would be a new condition as the new method would be part of the process by which a person who had received the permission would be able to extend it. We are almost at cross purposes because what worried the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam, and to some extent perhaps the hon. Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison) was whether a possible series of new conditions would restrict a person's ability to do something which they are currently able to do. That is not our intention. We intend to enable ourselves to impose conditions that may be necessary to meet new technology. We do not know what they are because we do not know the nature of the new technology that might develop, but we want the Bill to give us the discretion to introduce orders at a later stage to allow us to take account of new technology. The hon. Member for Hallam need not concern himself with fears about lots of new conditions that would effectively restrict the liberty of persons given leave to remain. However, new technology may have implications on the conditions under which a person may remain. As I understand it, the hon. Gentleman's fears relate to new conditions being imposed on a person's freedom. That is not what we propose.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> That is a useful assurance. However, from my reading of the Bill, the Minister can make an order providing for the imposition of such conditions. So although the Minister has stated that he does not intend to impose conditions affecting a person's liberty, my reading is that he would have that power when the Bill was enacted even if he chose not to use it. It must be an issue of concern that a statutory instrument laid on the basis of the Bill could impose a condition that a person with certain leave to remain must stand on one leg for one hour a day or meet whatever other condition the Minister wished to impose. The Bill gives him a very wide power. I accept his assurance at this stage and I accept that simply restricting it to section 3A of the 1971 Act may interfere with any future technological changes. I shall consider whether there are other ways of ensuring that the Minister is granted the power only to respond to technological changes and to new ways of implementing the conditions rather than to impose new conditions, but at this stage it would not be helpful to press the matter to a vote. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amentment, by leave, withdrawn.

<B>The Chairman:</B> Amendment No. 126 to be moved formally.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Bottomley (Worthing, West)</B><I> rose&#151;</I><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The amendment is not debatable. It has already been considered.
<P>
Amendment made: No. 126, in page 3, leave out lines 17 and 18 and insert&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `( ) But no such order is to be made unless a draft of the order has been laid before Parliament and approved by a resolution of each House.'''.&#151;[Mr. Mike O'Brien.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<H5>9.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Bottomley:</B> I should like to ask the Minister one point that follows on from the previous debate. Does he have the power to require someone, as a condition of entry, to reside in one part of the country or another? Can a person be required, for example, to live in Cumbria or Scotland? If the clause gives the Minister that power and if there is no limitation, we are left with the powers in the amendment that has just been made to challenge secondary legislation. I do not suggest that the Minister would intend to use or create such a power, but we should ask the question. If the Minister wants to take advice I am perfectly happy to wait for an answer.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The advice that I am given is that we do not have that power nor do we do not propose to take it under the terms of the Bill. I suspect that the hon. Gentleman alludes to the provisions relating to the support mechanism; if someone wants support they have to comply with certain conditions. The hon. Gentleman appears to be asking whether we are able to direct that someone should live in, say, Winchester, and the answer is no.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bottomley:</B> I am aware that the Government do not have that power yet. My question is whether under the clause that power could be created by secondary legislation. If there is no specific exclusion it would be useful, perhaps on Report or in another place, to see whether it would be possible for secondary legislation to grant powers outside support mechanisms. If so the Minister may want to come back to us.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I shall certainly consider the point that the hon. Gentleman raises and I shall write to him about the implications. The clause will obviously be the subject of secondary legislation. We may look at the detail of what could be done in the broadest sense, but what could be done may not be what is likely to be done under this or subsequent Governments of whom we can have reasonable foresight. Parliament and government in this country are based on the abstinence of the abuse of power and although some provisions in Acts give the Government quite broad powers to introduce secondary legislation, in reality the Government do not use them. The hon. Gentleman asks a perfectly legitimate question and I shall try to give him a proper answer in due course, but under the present Government his fears on that score are unfounded.
<P>
Clause 2 introduces a new section 3B into the Immigration Act 1971. It is designed to allow greater flexibility in the way in which non-British citizens or non European Union or European Economic Area nationals are given or refused leave to remain and the way in which the leave to remain is varied. It applies to the notification that it has been granted and the conditions and time limits attached to it, such as whether they have permission to work.
<P>
Our aim is to make all aspects of our immigration control as effective and efficient as possible. The clause will allow us to deploy our staff resources to areas where they will have greatest effect. Removing some of the stages inherent in the process will enable us to provide a faster and more efficient service to the applicant. The primary aim is to have efficient immigration controls that work and take account of any developments in new technology.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> Before we leave the clause 2 stand part debate, I should like to elaborate on the issue of the leave to remain in the United Kingdom not lapsing on leaving the common travel area. We did not go into this when we debated the amendments and I hope that we can do so now briefly. It takes us back to the issue of international students, which was raised on clause 1. The university of Sheffield, which is in my constituency, has a large number of Indonesian and Malaysian students. Clause 2 may be extremely helpful to them if it enables them to go home for normal family visits and then re-enter the United Kingdom in a more straightforward manner.
<P>
Will the Minister confirm that that is one of the clause's intentions? That would reassure students, who feel frosty toward the Home Office as a result of problems at the Immigration and Nationality Directorate in Croydon, which have left them feeling that the United Kingdom is not serious about encouraging international students because it is not serious about giving them passports enabling them to travel to normal family events. Will the Minister confirm that the measure will reverse that trend, and that clause 2(2)(c) is intended to make life easier for international students?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bottomley:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that some conditions that the Secretary of State may impose would allow students to be given provisional acceptance for the full period of their course? Should they break one of those conditions, they would be subject to review, and the period for which they have leave to remain would be shortened. That would relieve pressure on immigration and entry clearance officers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I agree. It would be ideal if students were given a three-year leave to remain for a three-year course. They should be allowed to come and go for family visits for the duration of such a course, and should not face unnecessary hurdles in doing so. In the vast majority cases, such students are simply going about their ordinary business. Whatever we can do to facilitate such visits would be to the benefit of UK plc, and would help to promote the important export industry of exporting our education skills.
<P>
I therefore hope that clause 2 will enable international students to go about their ordinary business with minimum hassle, especially when such business relates to family visits. As non-EEA nationals, many of them regularly make such visits over a number of years.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Maclean (Penrith and The Border):</B> I am anxious about the Minister's reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Worthing, West (Mr. Bottomley), who made a good point. Clause 2(2) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``An order under subsection (1) may, in particular, provide for . . . the imposition of conditions''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Subsection (2) is open-ended about those conditions, which relate to powers in subsection (1). The latter subsection states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Secretary of State may by order make further provision with respect to the giving, refusing or varying of leave to remain in the United Kingdom.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Secretary of State therefore has an order-making power to impose conditions.
<P>
I, like other Committee members, would like the Minister to spell out the nature of the conditions that will be made, and we would be grateful if he would do that sooner rather than later. Admittedly, it is impossible to cover every eventuality. There will always be cases on which the immigration service wishes to impose conditions that it has not imposed before.
<P>
I do not expect the Minister to give a comprehensive list of every eventuality. However, we need to know what the ball park cases are. I will not be content with an assurance that, theoretically, the clause gives the Secretary of State power to do whatever he likes, but that the power will never be used.
<P>
Many Governments have given such assurances. Order-making powers are usually used because they are more convenient than making primary legislation. That is not a confession. However, I anticipate that the order-making power built into the clause will be used, so we need to know whether such power may be used to impose conditions on where a person may reside.
<P>
I accept that the Government have no intention at the moment of imposing such conditions. However, once the Minister has taken legal advice, will he confirm that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the imposition of conditions''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
specified in subsection 2(b) may, theoretically, be used to make orders imposing conditions on residence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bottomley:</B> There may be an easier question to ask: are there existing powers to enable the Secretary of State to impose residence conditions? Under other provisions, police and magistrates can require people who are suspected of committing an offence to comply with specific conditions such as living in a particular place. It is proper for the Committee to explore the matter today and, if necessary, later in our proceedings.
<P>
I want briefly to consider education and family visits to those studying degree or degree-equivalent courses. Parents are often keen to see their children taking degrees or receiving awards. It is worth trying to set up consultations between the Home Office, the United Kingdom Council for Overseas Student Affairs, vice-chancellors and principals of colleges and others to ascertain whether parents could expect, almost automatically, to attend a degree ceremony without going through the panoply of the process of applying for leave to enter. Perhaps some sort of certification from the college or university could facilitate matters.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman is talking about leave to enter, but the clause deals with leave to remain.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bottomley:</B> Education links the two subjects. The hon. Member for Hallam mentioned family visits, which were associated with students' leave to remain. I am trying to help the Minister by suggesting that the measure could include practices that would lead to a diminished bureaucracy and increased acceptance in respect of matters attendant on an overseas student coming here to earn and be awarded a qualification. I would take it for granted that I could see my children receive awards in this country, or abroad, if they had leave to remain for studying. That should also be the case for parents who want to come here to see their children receive awards.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The hon. Member for Hallam and I agree that educating overseas students is important for this country. It is an industry that benefits this country substantially, not only by giving students knowledge of the way in which the country operates&#151;and, I hope, a favourable impression&#151;but by bringing a lot of money to our educational institutions. We want to encourage that.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked whether the clause would enable students to go on family visits more easily, without being subject to unnecessary bureaucracy such as being interviewed again on re-entry to obtain new leave to enter. The answer is yes. The provision will reduce bureaucracy and make students' visits to their families easier. However, it will not reduce controls. An immigration officer will still be able to intervene if he has grounds to do so. Controls can be maintained while bureaucracy is reduced.
<P>
The hon. Member for Worthing, West asked whether we could lessen bureaucracy even further without reducing controls. We can build on our experience; therefore, I do not want to say that we would not do that in future. However, a general provision to allow parents to enter the country for degree ceremonies could be open to abuse, and I would be reluctant to support such a provision now. We shall consider the operation of the system in due course, when we have introduced the regulations.
<P>
We do not want to reduce immigration control. Indeed, we hope that the clause will enable us to improve those controls through the use of technology.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison</B><I> rose&#151;</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> If the hon. Gentleman will forgive me, there are several points that I want to consider.
<P>
The hon. Member for Worthing, West also asked about permission being given for the whole of a student's course and perhaps being withdrawn if something goes wrong. The difficulty with that is bureaucratic. If permission is given for, say, a three-year degree course and the person does not attend at all, where will the checks be made? The university might decide that it does not want to be part of the immigration control network and inform us of that, but when would it do so?
<P>
<H5>9.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
One way to exercise permission for a defined period, if there are concerns about a student, is to provide that, at the end of a year, the student must come along and say, ``This is a letter from my university or college saying that I have attended the course. Now can I have the extension?'' As I said when we last discussed this matter, each student must be looked at individually and certain conditions may have to be imposed on one student rather than another, if the immigration officer has concerns.
<P>
The process that the hon. Gentleman suggests could not be applied generally. Many students now receive permission to attend the whole of their course. If they fail to comply with the conditions, that permission can be withdrawn, but there is no prospect of a change in our procedures for granting permission to students, although we are looking at ways to encourage more students to come. In due course, technology may make it easier for us to effect the balance between control and reducing unnecessary bureaucracy, as the hon. Gentleman put it.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border (Mr. Maclean) referred to concerns about the clause that we have already discussed. We have no intention of imposing extra conditions for leave to enter and leave to remain. Under legislation introduced by the previous Government it is possible to impose such conditions on temporary admission. I have no problem with that&#151;it is perfectly legitimate where extra control must be imposed on certain individuals&#151;but we do not intend to do impose extra conditions under the clause.
<P>
Many order-making powers are contained in legislation passed by the House. However, the House always has the ability to check the power of Ministers. The Home Secretary will always be subject to further parliamentary control in any regulations that are introduced. Our amendments show that we consider that process to be an important element of parliamentary control, which we have sought to enhance in clauses 1 and 2. I understand the right hon. Gentleman's point, but he need have no fears in this regard.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(7) Claim for asylum means a claim that it would be contrary to the United Kingdom's obligations under the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and its Protocol, or under Article 3 of the 1950 European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, for the claimant to be removed from, or required to leave the United Kingdom.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> We move on to a new subject, which relates to charging fees for those applying for leave to remain in the United Kingdom.
<P>
A number of organisations have submitted evidence to us expressing concern about the position of those seeking protection under the refugee convention and article 3 of the European convention on human rights, should the proposal to allow charges to be made for applications for leave to remain be agreed.
<P>
Nothing in the Bill exempts those who seek protection under the refugee convention or under article 3 from having to pay such a fee. Intriguingly, the explanatory notes state:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The current intention is that asylum seekers and those seeking protection under Article 3 of the ECHR will not be charged.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In the light of that wording, we need to probe the Government's thinking a little further.
<P>
Several organisations, including Justice and the Refugee Council, have expressed concern about the proposal. Justice takes the view that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Any barrier which prevented a person claiming or obtaining protection under either Convention, with the result that he or she had to return to face prohibited treatment would be in breach of the European Convention of Human Rights and the 1951 Convention. Any fee which governed the ability to make an application for such protection and which resulted in some people being unable to make protection claims would be such a barrier.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Is there any prospect of charges for leave to remain being put up as a barrier in the way of those who seek protection? Organisations, including Justice, have recommended to the Committee that the Bill should specifically exempt claims for asylum under the 1951 convention or under article 3, so as to govern the Secretary of State's regulation-making power.
<P>
In the light of those recommendations, does the Minister agree with Justice that charges would be a barrier to asylum applicants and that such a barrier would be a breach of our international obligations? If he accepts that view, will he turn his mind to including a suitable provision in the Bill to exclude the possibility that such a barrier could be created?
<P>
What do the Government mean when they say that they have no ``current intention'' to charge? Some would say that whenever a Government of whatever political persuasion say that they have no current intention of doing something, one had better start to make preparations for that to happen. The Minister may say that he wants the Government to have a free hand, but, on such an important matter, he should consider our international obligations and ensure that there is no prospect of our breaching them in future.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> Amendment Nos. 110, 111 and 112 explore the issues that the hon. Member for Hertsmere outlined. The word ``current'' in the explanatory notes is of particular concern. If the Government had no intention to charge fees, that would give us one level of reassurance. However, the use of the phrase ``current intention'' gives us no assurance that fees will not be charged in future.
<P>
I have two main concerns. First, as the hon. Member for Hertsmere pointed out&#151;and it is a common feeling on this side of the Committee&#151;any charging of fees would be contrary to the international conventions that this country has signed. Secondly, regulations could be introduced at a later stage to discriminate between applicants. The Government's arguments on asylum seekers appear to make a distinction between those they deem to be worthless and those they deem to be worthy applicants. Other provisions in the Bill will allow the Government to take powers to themselves to penalise those who they believe to have made worthless applications.
<P>
Under the clause, the Government will take powers that could enable them, if they were so minded, to judge whether to charge a fee according to whether they deem an application claim to be worthy or worthless. That would be damaging because all applications need to be deemed worthy until such time as an adjudicator decides otherwise and judges that a person does not conform to the criteria of the 1951 convention or the ECHR.
<P>
We could understand the Government's need for wide powers in the context of uncertain technological change or other unpredictable circumstances. However, we can predict precisely what will happen in the context of ECHR and 1951 convention applications and we hope that the Government share our view that no charge should ever be made when applications are lodged in the first place. That is necessary to conform entirely with those two treaties.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will explain the meaning of the word ``current'' in that context and why the Government believe that they need such wide powers to make regulations to impose charges. If that is not the Government's intention, the Minister must explain why that is not in the Bill. It would be easier for the Government to sign off their legislation in compliance with provisions such as the Human Rights Act 1998 if the Bill expressly contained the requisite provisions. That would be preferable to waiting for regulations later, perhaps under a less benign Home Secretary who might seek to impose charges. We would then have to go to the courts in order to test their legality under the Human Rights Act 1998.

<P>

<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Can I be as clear as possible and say that no fee will be levied on applications for the right to remain by asylum seekers or one-way refugees? In our view, that would not comply with the 1951 convention. We will not charge refugees, so those who are worried about that should not be. It is debatable whether article 3 of the ECHR would allow a fee to be charged, but in any event, we have no intention of charging any such fee. I hope that I can reassure hon. Gentlemen about that.
<P>
I was asked about the word ``current''. Overcaution may be responsible for it, but several wider issues may also be involved&#151;for example, what should happen in respect of various rights of leave to remain following asylum applications. Those issues impinge on the amendments from each of the Opposition parties. They were presented as corrections of drafting errors, but I accept that it is legitimate to ask whether a charge will be made. It is difficult to exclude various groups, but I can give a clear and categorical assurance that no fee will be levied on applications under article 3 of the ECHR or under the 1951 convention for granting refugee status.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> This has been a useful and worthwhile debate. The Liberal Democrats and ourselves do not want to put this country in breach of its international obligations that have been honoured in the past.
<P>
I welcome the Minister's assurance but I am intrigued by the last part of his response, in which he sought to explain why it could not be incorporated into the Bill. The amendments may not be technically perfect, but the Government could table an amendment of their own. I remain curious about the wider issues that prevent such an amendment being made. I am happy to accept the Minister's assurance, and I am grateful to him for it. The best solution would have been to spell it out in the Bill, but there it is; if I cannot tempt him into a more consensual&#151;
<P>
<H5>9.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I shall certainly tell the hon. Gentleman that, for example, the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Hallam says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``No fee shall be payable in respect of a claim for asylum''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Obviously some people will not be granted asylum, but another issue may arise later, on a different basis. All sorts of things may arise. When we restrict provisions to asylum seekers or refugees, it is difficult to ensure that that is all we restrict. I have given an undertaking, which I am sure hon. Members will accept, that the clause will not be used for such a purpose.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Well, there we are: the Government have set their face against the amendment. This has been a worthwhile debate and we have explored the issue, but I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 78, in page 3, line 22, after `to', insert `enter or'.
<P>
The amendment concerns charges for applications for leave to remain in the country. In its evidence to us, the Immigration Service Union raised the question of amending the clause to make applications for leave to enter, as opposed to applications for leave to remain, subject to charges. It says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``There is no mention of the possibility of a charge for leave to enter itself. The work of the Immigration Service, and its potential to raise significant sums for the relief of the UK taxpayer, has been neglected in the drafting of these measures.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We are anxious to give the Minister an opportunity to respond to any suggestion of neglect made by any of those who gave evidence to us, from whatever source. I look forward to hearing his response.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I suspect that an airport tax, which this amendment would introduce, would be better dealt with in the Finance Bill, not in an immigration Bill. I see the point that the ISU is making, but I would rather have duties and obligations to pay by reason merely of entry, which is effectively a tax, dealt with in other legislation. The Opposition have been anxious to look at the issue of airport taxes for their own reasons, but this is not the appropriate place to do so. I am always anxious to ensure that the Revenue is properly funded, but we will do it in the proper place and not in this Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> We would not want any of the organisations that are interested in the Bill and have given evidence to say that their questions were not raised and received no response. So there we are, we have done it. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 79, in page 3, leave out lines 29 and 30 and insert&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(3) The regulations may prescribe different rates of fee for different classes of application, provided that all such rates shall be commensurate with the reasonable expectations of applicants.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 133, in page 3, line 29, leave out `may', and insert `shall'.
<P>
No. 134, in page 3, line 29 leave out `in prescribed circumstances', and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`by those granted leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom as students or otherwise under Part 3 of the Statement of Changes in Immigration Rules (HC 395) as amended.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The amendment deals with the level at which charges are fixed for leave to remain. How much could applicants for leave to remain be called upon to pay? We are told in the explanatory notes that fee levels for applicants
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``will reflect the full cost of processing their application''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants expressed concern about that and suggested the amendment. It said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``It is objectionable that applicants should be expected to pay fees calculated at rates to cover the full cost of processing applications when the administration at the Immigration and Nationality Directorate is so deeply inefficient. The worse the system becomes, the more&#151;on the basis of such calculations&#151;applicants will be required to pay.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We find it understandable that those faced with the prospect of paying charges linked to cost, and hence to efficiency, should be concerned by the current problems affecting the Immigration and Nationality Directorate. I am sure that they and the Committee would be pleased to hear evidence that, at last, the Government are getting to grips with this problem.
<P>
The Minister knows that I have been pressing the Government about their timetable on the subject. I tabled a written question on 7 May last year, which he eventually answered by letter on 27 October. I was told that ``good progress'' was being made with the development of software needed for the full computerisation of the IND's case work and that it had been decided that the directorate should make the transition to new working methods in advance of the introduction of the software. I was also told at the time:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``By February next year the whole organisation should have been established and will be operating in new temporary offices above the Whitgift centre in Croydon.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Sad to say, February has been and gone, the deadline has not been met, parts of the organisation have not even made it from the old office to the new temporary office&#151;and in the middle of last month we heard that the Secretary of State himself is to take personal control of the matter. Against that background, one can understand those people's concern when they hear that sad, sorry history and that the amount that they will have to pay for applications will be linked to the efficiency of the IND.
<P>
We understand that a new plan is being drawn up. When will it be ready and can the Minister give the Committee an idea of the likely charge for an application for leave to remain?
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Bottomley:</B> May I say, briefly, that I hope that the Minister will give special consideration to students on fees? He ought to limit costs to what the work should entail rather than to the number of staff who may have to be brought in to answer the telephone or to go searching through garages in Croydon for papers. If he is minded to accept my probing amendment, which proposes that any fee paid should be refunded if an application is not dealt with within seven days, it will be welcome news for people who are waiting with some frustration.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I support the comments of the hon. Member for Worthing, West, especially those about students, because I know of the considerable concern out there about people having to pay for what has proved to be a terribly unsatisfactory service. Often people from less developed countries say that our system is worse than the systems in their countries and they do not understand why they must wait six months at a time for the IND to grant leave to remain.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will also consider the question whether many people will be able to take advantage of the directorate's services, because of their financial circumstances. It is widely acknowledged that many ethnic minority communities here fall within the categories relating to the less well off. In my region in the north, many communities are quite disadvantaged despite fulfilling many of the requirements specified in the clause for additional permission to be granted to family members to stay in this country.
<P>
The Conservative amendment is a catch-all proposal suggesting different fees for different classes of application and so on, although it also proposes that fees meet the reasonable expectations of applicants. I hope that, when the Minister considers it, he will bear in mind the fact that, for example, people who originally came from the Indian sub-continent, who have a perfectly legitimate expectation of family reunion and simply wish to pursue their family interests, as any of us would, will often find it difficult to pay a significant fee because they will already have paid a visa fee of approximately &#163;240 a person to obtain entry clearance to come here in the first place.
<P>
As the hon. Member for Hertsmere said, those people will expect a level of service commensurate with the fee they are paying; they will not expect to pay additional money so that Siemens Business Systems can do the extra work needed for the system. I hope that when considering the points made by the hon. Member for Hertsmere and those about students the Minister will refer particularly to the financial position of many of our citizens who will use the Immigration and Nationality Directorate's services for legitimate and worthwhile family reasons.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> The hon. Member for Hertsmere referred to the sad and sorry history of the contract with Siemens entered into by the previous Government to reorganise the IND. He also mentioned the inefficiency at Croydon and the current problems. The problems there are long term. Indeed, the previous Government signed the private finance initiative contract at Croydon to try to resolve by computerisation some of those long-term inefficiency problems. There have been substantial difficulties with the contract, which is not simply to computerise the IND but to reorganise it: it involves moving offices, reorganising working practices and introducing computers. Substantial difficulties have arisen in the development of the contract. The IND has moved offices and the new organisation is now in temporary offices, albeit for a few years, at the Whitgift centre.
<P>
The public caller unit has not yet moved to the Whitgift centre&#151;as it will do so in due course&#151;because proper queuing arrangements were not available there. The view was taken that, while we could still use Lunar house, we should do so for a few months to allow people to queue in comfort. I know that the hon. Member for Hertsmere visited Lunar house recently, as I did on Tuesday morning. The public caller unit is seeing more people now than it has in the past and seems to be operating well. However, other areas of the Department at Croydon clearly have substantial problems, which I do not underestimate. One of the Home Office's priorities is to deal with some of the problems caused by Siemens' failure to deliver on the contract signed by the previous Government. A plan has now been drawn up to deal with the current difficulties.
<P>
I understand the JCWI's point that it does not want people to be burdened with substantial cost. We do not propose to introduce these fee levels immediately, but hope, having moved beyond the current difficulties at Croydon, to introduce the level of computerisation promised by the contract and thereby reduce the unit cost of processing each application.
<P>
When the previous Government signed the contract, the theory was that it would reduce unit costs and enable Croydon to operate much more efficiently. We understand the concept behind computerisation, reorganised working practices, new offices and the redevelopment of the old offices, but the plan has produced some difficulties. We must go beyond that and then consider what is a reasonable fee. If the contract is delivered, we hope that the unit costs will be lower than they would have been. However, I emphasise that the problems at Croydon have been going on for years: that is why the contract was entered into.
<P>
Amendment No. 79 would remove the power in clause 3(3) for fee regulations to provide for specific applications to be considered without charge, and to relate fees to applicants' expectations. That would leave the taxpayer to bear the burden. The hon. Member for Hertsmere did not mention that.
<P>
The amendment is unacceptable for several reasons. Clause 3(3) should be retained. The amendment's reference to prescribing different rates of fees for different classes of application is unnecessary because clause 134(2)(b) already provides for that.
<P>
<H5>10 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I turn to the novel concept in the amendment that the fee rates prescribed by the clause should be
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``commensurate with the reasonable expectations of applicants.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I have yet to hear a reasonable proposal for a method of assessing the varied ``reasonable expectations of applicants''.
<P>
However, it is important that fees should be set on an objective basis. They will reflect the cost of processing applications, and the calculations will comply with usual Treasury rules, which apply across Departments. Those rules are used as the basis for setting fees for citizenship applications.
<P>
I do not yet know the number of categories of fee, or the exact fees, but our current estimate for applications for leave to remain and similar applications is &#163;90. I said that in a recent reply to a written question from the hon. Member for Hertsmere.
<P>
There will be no charge for asylum seekers. I do not know whether &#163;90 is commensurate with the expectations of the Committee, but&#151;subject to more detailed calculations, which will be necessary in due course&#151;that is the cost to the Home Office of processing applications. There is no logical basis at this point for charging at any other level.
<P>
Amendment No. 79 is clearly unworkable and is unfair to taxpayers, who would have to make up any shortfall in resources. I cannot recommend it to the Committee.
<P>
The hon. Member for Worthing, West made it clear that amendments Nos. 133 and 134 are probing amendments. He asked that special consideration be given to student fees. Amendment No. 133 is defective and would have an effect that the hon. Gentleman does not intend. Restricting the power to provide for no fee to be payable under part 3 of the immigration rules could mean that there would be no clear power to consider applications for asylum, or those under article 3, without charge. The amendment is technically deficient, but I appreciate that it was not tabled as a technical amendment.
<P>
We shall consider proposals for students in due course when regulations are introduced. It would be appropriate to discuss the detail of specific categories of fees and the figures in a debate on those regulations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Bottomley:</B> I understand that, and I am grateful for the sensitive way in which the Minister dealt with the possible defects in the amendment.
<P>
Will the Minister assure the Committee that the Home Office will have the power to introduce regulations for dealing flexibly with students, if the Government are convinced that, for economic or other reasons, some students should pay a reduced fee or no fee? Is there sufficient power in the primary legislation for the secondary legislation to achieve that? If the measure does not contain sufficient power, the House and the other place will return to the problem again and again.
<P>
The content of the secondary legislation is a secondary issue. The key point is ensuring that the measure contains the flexibility to allow the Government to propose that specific students should pay no fees, some fees or different fees in different circumstances. Students are important. Does the Bill contain that flexibility?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> We believe that the measure contains sufficient flexibility for us to identify proper and legitimate requests by students and to deal with their worries and needs. As I said to the hon. Member for Hallam, we want to encourage the education industry&#151;if we can call it that&#151;to bring students here and to educate them properly. Therefore, it will be perfectly proper in due course to consider how we charge student fees.
<P>
The hon. Member for Worthing, West asked whether we had wide enough powers. We think that we have wide enough powers to enable us to do all that we want to encourage students to come to this country. When these matters come before the House, we shall have a debate under the negative resolution procedure. The hon. Gentleman will be able to pray against that and hold a debate on fee levels if he thinks that that is appropriate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bottomley:</B> It may not be worth pursuing the subject much further, but I have one point to add. If the Government are convinced by the case put forward by UKCOSA and other concerned groups that there should be no fee or reduced fees in some circumstances and they then feel that the primary legislation does not give them sufficient power over the secondary legislation, the House would feel that&#151;to put it gently&#151;it had been let down. Whether the Government are convinced by that case is a separate matter, but I want to ensure that they have sufficient, flexible and wide powers to cover all the arguments on which they might be convinced either now or in the future.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Opposition Members suggest that the Government's powers are too wide in one clause and not wide enough in this clause. We will have all the powers to do what the hon. Gentleman and I want to do, which is, with proper immigration controls, to encourage students to come to this country. The hon. Gentleman's fears are not well founded. We will have sufficient powers to do what is necessary to encourage the industry.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bottomley:</B> I wish to add one point to which I do not expect the Minister to reply. I want him to have the power to do what we want should he be convinced of the need to do it. That is all.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> We will be able to do what we believe we need to do. I understand the hon. Gentleman's point, but, given the broad requests that UKCOSA may make, I do not want to commit myself to being able to do everything that it might want. However, the Government will be able to do anything that they reasonably believe to be necessary to encourage students to come to this country. One way of doing that is by bearing and dealing with their fees in a reasonable manner.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> This has been a worthwhile debate on an important subject. My hon. Friend the Member for Worthing, West has raised the issue of students, a subject we should continue to bear in mind.
<P>
I agree with the Minister that it would be wrong for the cost of charges for leave to remain to fall on the taxpayer. However, I understand the view of someone who is called upon to pay such charges. He would not want to pay charges linked to the cost of an inefficient organisation.
<P>
I heard what the Minister said about Lunar house and he knows that that is a matter of great interest to us. We have heard the same things time and again. The Government say repeatedly that things have turned the corner, are going well and are on a steady keel. They claim that they have a plan, a timetable and a deadline, but the deadlines pass and the problems remain the same. The Government have been in charge for two years. If anyone managing an enterprise with the sort of troubles that face Lunar house said that they were the result of what happened more than two years ago, he would get pretty short shrift.
<P>
We shall keep a close eye on the problem. The deadlines that the Minister has set keep on passing, but we will keep reminding him of his responsibilities to the public and to the visitors to this country who have been put to such inconvenience. When can we expect an action plan from the Home Secretary and a timetable on that plan?

<P>

<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> No doubt, the hon. Gentleman would accept that we are constrained by the contract negotiated and signed by the Conservative Government. The hon. Gentleman served as a Minister in that Government, and is trying to evade their responsibility for the current situation, saying that we are responsible for everything.
<P>
We are in charge of the situation and we accept that we must dig ourselves out of the mess that we inherited. That is part of the process of being in government. Senior managers and Ministers are considering an action plan, which should be in place shortly. There are already clear signs that the matter is being dealt with.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Let us hope that that action plan is more successful than some of its predecessors in relation to problems at Lunar House.
<P>
The matter will not go away and is of great concern to those facing the prospect of paying a charge for leave to remain, and to many other people. However, having participated in a worthwhile debate and for the sake of progress, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> On a general point, I remind Committee members that interventions should be brief. That applies to Ministers and Back Benchers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 123, in page 3, line 30, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``where without prejudice to the foregoing generality&#151;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) the applicant has insufficient means to pay any prescribed charges;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) the applicant is below the age of 16 years; or<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(c) the applicant is in receipt of any benefit.''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Law Society of Scotland helpfully suggested this amendment at fairly short notice, which ensures that those without access to the requisite funds are not prejudiced in their rights to apply for leave to remain in the United Kingdom, the variation of leave to enter or remain, or the right to have an indefinite leave stamp fixed on their passport.
<P>
Access to rights and justice should not be restricted to those with the financial means to apply for it. I express those sentiments only a day after the Access to Justice Bill swept away legal aid for many people.
<P>
Under the Bill, vulnerable asylum seekers without ready access to funds will be denied the right to make applications referred to in clause 3(1). I hope that the Minister will take a more enlightened approach to justice than his colleagues in the Lord Chancellor's Department.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> In speaking to the previous group of amendments, I referred to the financial background of many of those caught up in such matters. I am sure that it was only an oversight that prevented the Minister from responding on that issue. However, let me repeat the facts in the context of the helpful amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Hertsmere. In 1997, 44,360 family members were granted settlement, 12,000 of whom were from the Indian subcontinent, 5,760 from other parts of Asia and 10,050 from Africa.
<P>
Clearly, those people are not generally settling in well-off UK communities, and some of them fall into the categories referred to in amendment No. 123. Will the Minister reassure us that the regulations will put family unity before Treasury interests?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> The general proposition advanced by the Government in clause 3 is that fees levied in immigration cases will reflect the type of case and the cost to the taxpayer in determining the application. We have already indicated that some types of application will be free, but it is not our intention that individuals should not be charged a fee because of personal circumstances. Taxpayers would continue to meet costs, if individual applicants were to be relieved of the need to pay a fee. Alternatively, those costs would be met by other applicants, who would have to pay higher fees as a result.
<P>
I therefore reject the amendment, the thrust of which is that younger and less well-off applicants should not be required to pay fees and should be subject to a means test. The United Kingdom has long welcomed foreign nationals, as is right and proper. However, controls are necessary, and I am sure that no one on the Committee disagrees with that part of our immigration policy which ensures that third country nationals do not take jobs from permanent residents in an unregulated manner, and do not seek to gain improperly from our social benefit system.
<P>
Therefore, the immigration rules specify that, in general, applicants seeking entry or leave to remain will be supported without further recourse to public funds and, in many cases, without working. The obligation is on them to show that they can support themselves without recourse to public funds. The rules also contain a list of social benefits, recourse to which is generally incompatible with the grant of leave to enter or remain.
<P>
The amendment would confer a new benefit, whereby the taxpayer subsidises certain immigrants who should be able to support themselves. I hear what the hon. Member for Hallam says about people coming here from relatively poor countries, but is he suggesting that anyone who comes as an immigrant&#151;we are not talking about asylum seekers here&#151;from those poor countries should be supported by the taxpayer? When costs are inherent in their coming to this country, is the hon. Gentleman saying that the taxpayer and not the people themselves should pay them?
<P>
<H5>10.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The amendment does not specify what exactly is meant by ``insufficient means'' or ``any benefit'', but they appear to be widely drawn and the amendment is unacceptable on that ground alone. It would be difficult to compile a list of benefits that was not covered&#151;at least in part&#151;by the list in the immigration rules. The Committee is being asked to make provision for applications to be free of charge if the applicant is unable to pay the fee when the reason for the inability to pay would, in many cases, be inconsistent with the requirements of the rules and would lead to the refusal of the application. That simply does not make sense.
<P>
On a practical level, I am anxious that the staff of the Immigration and Nationality Directorate in Croydon should apply their expertise to considering the relevant immigration law requirements in individual cases. I am not convinced, however, that it is a good use of their time to have them consider, through a means test, whether individuals' financial circumstances are such as to enable them to pay a fee. The extra time involved in doing so would arguably increase the costs and the fee levels that needed to be charged. That is also undesirable.
<P>
The amendment also includes the proposal that all applicants under 16 should not be charged for their application. Applications are normally lodged on behalf of minors by family members or considered as part and parcel of a family application. If a young person is here in his or her own right, I see no reason why the normal policy should not apply. If the application is part of a family application it might be possible to reflect that in our costing structure in due course, but I can give no undertaking on that at this stage.
<P>
I have no wish to be unsympathetic to individual applicants but we are proposing to relieve the taxpayer of some of the costs of considering immigration applications by seeking a contribution from those who benefit from staying in this country. Clearly, applicants hope to derive some benefit from remaining here or they would not seek to come here in the first place. In those circumstances, it is right that the taxpayer and the Exchequer should have the benefit. We should not allow those unable to satisfy the public funds requirements of the immigration rules to make a gratis application that has no hope of success. I invite the Committee to reject the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I have listened carefully to the Minister's answer and the subject was worth exploring. We had a worthwhile response from the Minister, so in order to make progress, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 128, in page 3, line 36, at end add&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(6A) No regulations may be made under this section unless a draft of the regulations has been laid before Parliament and approved by a resolution of each House.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I hope that I will be pushing at an open door with this amendment. I am looking for a spirit of generosity from the Minister. Both Ministers on this Committee are generous men and I would not describe them in any other way, especially when I am trying to get them to accept an amendment. We had some success yesterday on the same lines and my ears pricked up in the debate on amendment No. 79 when the Minister said that we would have the opportunity to discuss charges when the regulations came before the House. The Minister knows that the negative resolution procedure is haphazard and if the Government are relying on having a debate on the issue in future, how better to achieve that than by accepting the amendment? I thus look forward to the Minister's reply with some optimism.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I support the amendment. The issue of charges, as demonstrated in our earlier debate, will be sensitive and will affect many citizens and many of our constituents. It is right and proper for such a sensitive issue to be guaranteed a debate in the House, particularly in view of the complexities involving students to which the hon. Member for Worthing, West referred. It will not be a straightforward document but quite a complex one setting out the circumstances in which fees would be charged. I hope that the Minister will agree that such a document would benefit enormously from parliamentary scrutiny. If it went through without it, the Home Office would miss the opportunity to have expert eyes cast over it. In particular, it would bring the expertise that we have on matters on which our constituents consult us every week. For most of us, immigration is among the key issues raised by our constituents. I am sure that many hon. Members will wish to raise the issues relating to charging and the service that people receive from the IND and will feel quite aggrieved if, because we fail to adopt the affirmative resolution procedure, they cannot do so.

<P>

<B>Mr. Robert Syms </B>(Poole): I also support new subsection (6A). Many hon. Members are expert in these matters, and the Government would profit from a debate on the subject. The devil is very much in the detail and it is important to get the regulations right. A debate in both Chambers would result in much better regulation.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The amendments to clauses 1 and 2 were tabled following consideration of strong representations made in the Committee's evidence-taking sittings. They reflected real concerns and we were therefore ready to listen, but I cannot agree that all subordinate legislation in the Bill should be dealt with in the same way. If the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam believes that Parliament would benefit from greater scrutiny of subordinate legislation, it is open to him to pray at the appropriate time that such scrutiny should be undertaken, but I do not believe that it is necessary in respect of clause 3. It is the normal practice for fee regulations to be made subject to negative resolution. That was the procedure adopted by the previous Government in the provisions of the Immigration Act 1988, enabling the charging of fees for the grant of indefinite leave to remain, which the clause seeks to replace and extend. It is also the procedure used for fee regulations under the British Nationality Act 1981.
<P>
I see no essential difference between the fee-making powers in clause 3, which can be prayed against as a result of clause 134(4) of the Bill, and the similar powers that I have cited. I need not remind the Committee that those powers were taken when the previous Conservative Administration were in office. No doubt the hon. Member for Hertsmere or his predecessors supported those provisions and believed that they should be subject to negative resolution.
<P>
I do not believe that it is necessary or desirable to accept the amendments. The House has a great deal of business before it and should treat with circumspection and concern any request to put more business before it, because that would constrain Members' ability to absorb the vast amount of information that they already have to absorb. Hon. Members can themselves decide whether, in a matter such as charging a fee, it is necessary to pray against a negative resolution. On that basis I ask the Committee to reject the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am a little disappointed by the Minister's reply. It was not as good as I had hoped in the light of what happened yesterday, but hope springs external. The Minister has shown this morning that he can be tempted, so I shall put a bit of temptation in his way. He mentioned the strength of the representations that we received on earlier amendments, which is fair comment, but he will know that many organisations are worried about the possible level of charges and he has heard about the concerns of students. We have received representations from UKCOSA. I have also had a letter from a group called Osprey, the International Student Advisory Council, and many students, universities and colleges have been in touch with the Committee.
<P>
Will the Minister keep an open mind on the matter for a little longer, before closing the door on the amendment, and consult the organisations to see whether they feel so strongly that, in their view, the affirmative resolution procedure would be appropriate in this case? I hear what the Minister says about not having the affirmative resolution procedure for every piece of subordinate legislation in the Bill. Without making too much of a point now, there are about 50 order-making powers in the Bill and only about four of them are subject to the affirmative resolution procedure in clause 136 or 137.
<P>
I warn the Minister that I will put forward the same argument on other occasions, but not indiscriminately. I will not do so for every piece of subordinate legislation in the Bill because I accept that some of it is a matter of detail and is appropriately dealt with by the negative resoltuion procedure. However, on a matter of sensitivity that concerns many organisations the Minister should perhaps keep an open mind on the question of affirmative resolution procedure for a little longer. Perhaps the Minister could tell the relevant organisations that concern was expressed in Committee and find out how strongly they feel. Perhaps for once I could tempt the Minister along those lines.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Get thee behind me, and so on. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will have stronger grounds in relation to other matters. I see no real grounds for the Government to change their view on this. A number of organisations expressed concern, but it certainly did not feature as one of the primary areas where an affirmative resolution procedure was required. The negative resolution procedure is usual in such cases and I see no reason to change the Government's view. If the hon. Gentleman has other areas where he wishes to argue the case for an affirmative resolution procedure, we will certainly listen with care. However, on this occasion he is not on as strong ground as perhaps he thinks he is.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Forever the optimist, I am a bit disappointed by the Minister's response to the amendment, but I am not going away empty handed because he has given me something to put in the bank for a rainy day when I can again argue for an affirmative resolution procedure. I will remind the Minister of his comment that I may have stronger grounds later on other matters. I have tried and done my best. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 135, in page 3, line 36 at end add&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(7) Any regulations made under this section shall prescribe that any fee paid is to be refunded if the application to which it relates is not dealt with within seven days of receipt.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This amendment is not exactly tongue in cheek, but it expresses a worthy sentiment. The provision it makes it rather strict. It is asking quite a lot to expect the IND to deal with something in seven days. We hope that things will have speeded up a bit, but this is perhaps a council of perfection. The amendment is of interest and concern to UKCOSA and probably to other student organisations. Although I would not insist on the wording of the amendment, I would ask the Minister to consider whether it might be possible to have a mechanism to refund the fee for an application which is not dealt with within a reasonable length of time. That would be one way to ensure that minds are concentrated and that the job is done as quickly as possible.
<P>
It is very undesirable for people who are seeking leave to remain to have to wait for a long time. It creates a very bad impression about this country. We know that the many students who come here go back to their own countries with a favourable impression of our education system, but we would not want them to take away a negative impression of our way of government because of our bureaucracy and delays. I ask the Minister to bear that in mind and to respond to these concerns.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> This is a bold amendment, and I wish to refer to a couple of examples that led to it being tabled. I shall talk about students shortly, but business people stand to lose significantly, too. I have been contacted by a constituent who is an American national and who was due to go on a business trip. He had to send his passport to Croydon to obtain his leave to remain, but, like many other people, he had to wait for a long time for his passport to be returned with the appropriate stamp in it. He therefore missed business appointments because he was unable to travel abroad while he was waiting for the problems to be sorted out.
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I am also aware of an Israeli national who ended up as an overstayer because he did not dare send his passport to Croydon in case he was called back to Israel to do national service during the Gulf crisis. That was too great a risk to take at a time when he, as an army reservist, had to be able to return to Israel at the drop of a hat.
<P>
More recently, another student sent his passport to Croydon and its return was delayed for way beyond the seven days. Finally, the Immigration and Nationality Directorate admitted that it had lost the passport, so the student was required to obtain another from his embassy. He returned that passport to Croydon to have it stamped and was told that it would receive a guaranteed express service. In the meantime, the original passport had been found and returned to the student with the necessary stamp in it. By that time, the embassy had cancelled the original passport, so the stamp for leave to remain was in a worthless passport. The shiny, new passport had no stamp in it.
<P>
Such cases have driven people to demand much higher standards, and I am sure that the Minister will agree that we need them. The suggestion of a seven-day limit&#151;if that were feasible&#151;would be greatly welcomed by students and business people who find themselves facing the problems that I have described.
<P>
If the Minister is not able to accept the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Worthing, West, I hope that he will say that the Government will not add insult to injury by charging people when things go wrong. There should be a compensation scheme. I understand that informal arrangements have been made in the current chaotic situation for people not to incur excess costs. When they have to apply for a new passport because of an error by IND, they do not have to pick up the costs of that. However, I hope that the Minister will make it clear that when people receive an unsatisfactory service, they will not pay a charge and will receive compensation if the service is so bad that they suffer as a result.
<P>
I have explained the intention of the amendment. Although I am sure that the Minister will reject it, I hope that he will tell us that it is the Government's intention not to add insult to injury by making charges when service falls far below the standards that anyone in any country could reasonably expect when applying for leave to remain.

<P>

<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> The hon. Member for Hertsmere said that the suggestion of a seven-day target was somewhat tongue in cheek. I understand why he takes that view.
<P>
I fully accept that there are serious difficulties at Croydon, and the Government do not seek to disguise that fact. The position is unsatisfactory. A team of senior officials and Siemens Business Systems are trying to sort out the difficulties, to improve the service substantially, to tackle the backlog of cases and to get the contract back on target. Special exercises have been introduced to target priority cases, such as work permit applications. I hope that the changes in procedures will result in greater productivity and increased staffing.
<P>
As the hon. Member for Hallam pointed out, there have been difficulties in recent months with linking passports. A special exercise over Easter carried out a large-scale linking exercise when IND was closed. That dealt with much of the backlog. Before Easter there were 22,000 unlinked items&#151;not all of them passports&#151;and that figure has now gone down to 2,000 according to the latest statistics that I have received. So the hon. Gentleman will see that the operation appears to have been quite successful. I cannot guarantee that there will be no future problems&#151;no doubt there will always be some problems in an organisation the size of the Immigration and Nationality Directorate, where post is often directed to the wrong person, especially while we are still reliant upon a paper-based system&#151;but all due effort will be made to improve the quality and efficiency of the service.
<P>
<B>Ms Diane Abbott </B>(Hackney, North and Stoke Newington): On passports, I have heard a number of disturbing stories about missing or lost passports. Can my hon. Friend shed any light on that? My constituents would be greatly concerned to think that their passports had gone for ever.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The phrases ``missing passports'' or ``lost passports'' have been used for passports in the system but not yet linked to files. Many passports&#151;there were also items of post including several thousand passports&#151;were among the 22,000 items of post. The files in the system were moved from Lunar house to the Whitgift centre in boxes, so the post would not have been linked to the files. Over Easter the boxes were opened, the files indexed and the paperwork and passports linked to the files. So ``lost passports'' by and large have been found. However, in such a big organisation there will be individual instances of passports not arriving on time or being put into the wrong file: I cannot guarantee that that will not happen, but the serious problem arising from the move from Lunar house to the Whitgift centre at the beginning of the year has been overcome, at least, in terms of the linking exercise. Many people who wrote to say that their file was ``lost'' have learnt that their passports were found.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> That explains the mystery of my constituent coming in straight after the Easter break saying, ``I've got the passport back, but it's the wrong passport.'' I hope that my constituent is not too ungrateful. I wonder whether the Minister might learn from that and ensure that when a passport has been relinked a check is made on whether or not events have moved on since it became ``lost''.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I hesitate to give an individual guarantee of being able to satisfy the hon. Gentleman about each file. All I can say is that there are considerable difficulties which we are seeking to overcome.
<P>
The concept of the contract signed between Siemens and the IND before the general election was that we would move to a paperless system to avoid the problem of not being able to link files and to be able easily to photocopy passports or put them on computer so that they could be dealt with easily. That has not happened yet; Siemens is currently saying that a testable system should be ready by June or July after which there will be a testing period of four or six months before the system is introduced at the beginning of next year, on a reasonably workable basis, we hope.
<P>
There have been substantial difficulties. The National Audit Office said that the contract was too large and too ambitious and in many ways that was true when the contract was signed. Many Government Departments have experienced difficulties and the delays to which the amendment relates resulted from them. Difficulties have arisen with the computer system and with administration. With an all singing, all dancing contract such as we had, not only with computerisation but with reorganisation and a move of offices all within one concept, the opportunities for things to go wrong were obviously considerable, as the National Audit Office said.
<P>
Interestingly, the National Audit Office also said that the way in which the Home Office had dealt with these matters in the past 18 months was not substantially a cause for criticism for them and that we had inherited an extremely difficult situation. In a sense, I do not blame the previous Government for the failures of Siemens; I blame them merely for the contract and the way in which it was handled. Obviously, Siemens has had difficulties. We seek to restore the trust and support between Siemens and the Immigration and Nationality Directorate to establish a workable system. That will help to create the reorganisation of IND that Siemens wishes to bring about, along with the computerisation of IND.
<P>
I therefore ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw his amendment. He said that it was tongue in cheek, and was tabled to highlight the situation in Croydon. We have dealt with that matter fully.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> When I was younger, I watched a television programme with the catchphrase, ``Open the box''. That adds a new perspective to the Minister's description of what happens at Croydon.
<P>
I am anxious about such matters. The hon. Member for Hallam was right and as I said, the measure is bad for students. It is also bad for business people. I visited Croydon shortly before Easter and spoke to a staff member in the telephone caller unit who had just been dealing with the representative of five irate Japanese business men, who were unable to get their passports back when they needed them. They had been told that they had to go to Croydon in person and were not pleased about it. That gives a bad impression of this country.
<P>
I am sympathetic to the Croydon staff who have to handle such matters, as they must deal with irate&#151;and sometimes distressed&#151;people who are trying to get their documents. Our amendment is concerned with efficiency: people shoud not have to wait too long for their cases to be dealt with. In a spirit of vigilance, I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I should like to raise a couple of matters. The first concerns the frequency of applications required by the Home Office, which will obviously have an impact when charges are introduced. Libyan students, for example, are typically required to renew their leave to remain every six months. Clearly, charges would have a significantly greater impact on them than on international students who have to renew their applications for leave to remain less frequently.
<P>
That raises the question of natural justice, as Libyan students must bear huge additional expense, not as a result of their own actions, but because the United Kingdom has decided to impose on them a six-month renewal requirement. How does the implementation of charging relate to natural justice, when it imposes burdensome requirements on some people? I question not the need for such requirements, but the fact that charging places another burden the people affected by them.
<P>
Where will the additional funds raised by charges go? Will they be used to expand the immigration service? I wrote to the Minister about international students, suggesting that it would be helpful for immigration officers to visit educational institutions with a large number of international students. It might be better for the immigration service and the IND, and certainly for the students, if officers were to go to institutions and stamp passports there, having already processed the applications. That would mean that passports would not have to be sent anywhere and would not require relinking as they would not have left students' hands. Similar services were delivered in the past. Clause 3 may generate more funds and allow the Minister to examine the possibility of an at-university service for students.
<P>
Finally, I return to the issue of contracting. Earlier, I asked whether charges would be used to pay for Siemens' contractual failures. Did the contract contain penalty clauses, and is Siemens making a contribution? People would be very unhappy if the charges that they pay were used to fund the overall cost of the system, even though that cost is the result of not having held to account those responsible&#151;Siemens in this case, but it could be another company in future&#151;for failure to provide services for which they were contracted. That could help to establish whether the mess is the current Government's fault for managing the contract badly or the previous Government's fault for drawing it up.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> The first question from the hon. Member for Hallam was about Libyan students. People from some countries and backgrounds will obviously cause concern to the immigration service and other Government organisations. Therefore, it is sometimes necesssary to take special precautions with some students. I am sure that all members of the Committee understand what I am talking about. When British taxpayers are not responsible for those anxieties, they should not have to pay the price for suspicions and fears. Those students, or their countries&#151;some students are supported by their Governments&#151;should fund their stay here. The students or their Governments, rather than the British taxpayer, should also fund the extra security and immigration requirements that we place on them. I understand the hon. Gentleman's point, but I cannot offer him any solace on the issue.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman's second point dealt with immigration officers visiting education institutions. I shall seek advice from officials about the extent to which that would be practical. In the past, immigration officers have not always been welcome in those institutions, perhaps through fear that they might check whether students attended their courses. Students might not be as happy for immigration officers to carry out those checks as they are for immigration officers to come and stamp their passports. The matter is slightly more complex than it first appears, but I shall consider the hon. Gentleman's suggestion.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hallam also asked about the contract. Siemens has a private finance initiative contract with the Government. It means that Siemens pays the cost of development if there is any delay. The National Audit Office supports the way in which that currently works because the taxpayer does not pay the cost of Siemens' slowness in development. Other costs will have implications for IND, which does not have the computer system that it ought to have had. Therefore, the unit costs are higher than they would otherwise have been. Siemens, not the taxpayer, is primarily meeting the costs of developing the computer system.
<P>
Siemens has received some payments for work that it has already completed. The contract was not only for computerisation, but for reorganisation and training for new working practices in IND. Siemens has not been paid for work that it has not carried out. It is paying any costs that arise from delay.
<P>
The money will go to the Consolidated Fund in the usual way. I ask hon. Members to support the clause, which allows reasonable fees to be charged. We intend to move to such a regime in due course.
<P>

<P>

<B>The Minister of State, Lord Chancellor's Department (Mr. Geoffrey Hoon):</B> I beg to move amendment No. 5, in page 3, line 40, leave out `person' and insert `member of a mission'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, we may take Government amendment No. 6.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> Hon Members will have noticed that clause 4 is one of the most important elements of the Bill, which is no doubt why the Home Office has entrusted it to a Minister from the Lord Chancellor's Department.
<P>
Clause 4 is intended to prevent foreign nationals from taking a job in a diplomatic mission in an attempt to evade our immigration control. Before 1988 any foreign national who worked at a diplomatic mission was exempt from immigration control. It was discovered that immigration offenders subject to enforcement action were using such employment to avoid being removed from the United Kingdom. The Immigration Act 1971 was therefore changed in 1988.
<P>
Under section 8(3) of the Immigration Act 1971, a person is exempt from immigration control as long as he or she is employed as a member of a diplomatic mission. Section 8(3A) of the 1971 Act, which was inserted by the Immigration Act 1988, provides that foreign nationals already here who are offered a job at a diplomatic mission, remain subject to immigration control provided that they remain in this country. We describe such individuals as locally engaged staff.
<P>
However, the current wording of Subsection (3A) of the 1971 Act means that if a locally engaged member of staff leaves the United Kingdom and then re-enters, he or she becomes exempt from immigration control. That is because they will have entered the United Kingdom as a member of a mission.
<P>
Foreign nationals seeking to evade immigration control have exploited that loophole in the past. Clause 4 will close it by making it necessary to be resident outside the United Kingdom, and not present in the United Kingdom, when a post at a mission is offered, in order that the section 8(3) exemption can apply. The clause will also prevent a person from benefiting from the exemption if he has ceased to be a member of the mission and is then re-employed there, unless the subsequent re-employment satisfies the requirements of the clause.
<P>
Foreign nationals seeking to evade immigration control have exploited that loophole in the past and the two amendments seek to close that gap in the law. Amendment No. 5 replaces ``person'' with ``member of a mission''. It is straightforward, clarifying precisely to whom subsection (3A) applies.
<P>
Clause 4 allows a person who entered the United Kingdom as a visitor to obtain a post at a diplomatic mission and benefit from the exempt provisions of section 8 of the 1971 Act. Although the persons would be living in the United Kingdom, they would ordinarily be resident elsewhere and therefore fall within the terms of the clause. Paragraph (a) of amendment No. 6 makes it clear than an individual must be not only resident outside the United Kingdom but physically outside it when offered a post at a diplomatic mission.
<P>
Paragraph (b) is intended to prevent a further abuse. When a person is offered a post while resident outside and physically outside the United Kingdom, he or she becomes a member of a mission and thus exempt from control. When such persons leave the mission they cease to benefit from exempt status. However, if they remain in the United Kingdom and are subsequently employed by the mission, without paragraph (b), such people could claim exempt status in respect of the subsequent post, even though the circumstances surrounding the appointment did not satisfy the requirements of the new subsection (3A). As another means of getting around the requirements of paragraph (a), that would be undesirable. I therefore invite the Committee to support the amendments.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Amendment made: No. 6, in page 3, line 41, leave out from ``is'' to end of line 43 and insert

(a) he was resident outside the United Kingdom, and was not in the United Kingdom, when he was offered a post as such a member; and
<P>
(b) he has not ceased to be such a member after having taken up the post''.'.&#151;[Mr. Hoon]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> It gives me great pleasure to welcome the Minister of State to the Committee. It is the first time that he has intervened in any of our proceedings. I am unsure whether he intervened in the earlier stages of the Special Standing Committee but it is certainly the first time that he has spoken in this stage of the debate. I congratulate him on being given the honour, as he rightly put it, of presenting such an important part of the Bill. I also congratulate him on the clear and lucid way in which he explained the purpose of the amendments, which left the Committee in a state of complete agreement with no questions to ask.
<P>
I have just one question to ask about the clause. It was raised by one of the groups that made an earlier submission and I hope that the Minister will be able to provide a clear, brief and simple answer. How will it be enforced? What will happen when someone who has acquired diplomatic immunity by being engaged here, goes overseas, returns and claims diplomatic immunity again?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> Obviously they will be subject to the same enforcement process as any other person who is seeking to evade the immigration rules.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I thought that the Minister would give me a clear, brief and simple answer, and I was not disappointed.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 4, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 5</center></H4>
<H4><center>Persons ceasing to be exempt</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> Clause 5 deals with a similar and related issue. It will ensure that certain people who cease to be exempt from immigration control do not thereafter remain in the United Kingdom for more than 90 days, unless they have permission to do so. Under the Immigration (Exemption from Control) Order 1972 certain personnel of international organisations are exempt from immigration control. In addition, under section 8(3) of the Immigration Act 1971 members of diplomatic missions are also exempt from immigration control. Therefore, they are not subject to the provisions of the 1971 Act.
<P>
As a result, members of diplomatic missions and international organisations do not commit an offence if they remain in the UK after their exempt employment ceases, but fail to apply for leave to do so. The clause closes that loophole by providing that people who cease to be exempt from control are given deemed leave of 90 days. I emphasise that the clause does not apply to EEA nationals and their dependants, who, if exercising European Union rights of free movement, do not require leave to stay in the UK.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 5 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 6</center></H4>
<H4><center>Removal of certain persons unlawfully in the United Kingdom</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 115, in page 4, line 30, at end insert&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(1A) Directions may not be given under subsection (1) unless the Secretary of State is satisfied that all relevant factors listed in the immigration rules have been considered'.'<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The significant change in the law proposed by the clause runs contrary to the views of the Labour party in opposition. The Immigration Act 1988 removed appeal rights in the context of deportation from people who had been here for less than seven years at the time of the decision. The Labour party spokesman at the time, now the Secretary of State for Wales, was most concerned about the erosion of such people's rights. The Secretary of State will now be able to use administrative removal for a wider range of people who have breached the immigration rules.
<P>
We have tabled the amendment to ensure, as Labour Members argued in opposition, that a humanitarian decision is taken in each case. The amendment suggests that the relevant factors in the immigration rules should be taken into account. Paragraph 364 of the immigration rules deals with decisions to deport and says that the Secretary of State, when considering the public interest of deportation, should look at the compassionate circumstances on an individual basis and consider such factors as the age of potential deportees, their length of residence in the UK, the strength of their connections with the UK, their personal history, including their character, conduct and employment record, domestic circumstances, any previous criminal record, the nature of any offence of which they may have been convicted, compassionate circumstances and any representations received on their behalf. The amendment seeks to ameliorate the new requirements in the clause by ensuring that the Bill requires the Secretary of State to make a similar consideration when undertaking a removal.
<P>
The Home Secretary was asked about that point when he gave evidence to the Special Standing Committee. He said that he was willing to look at it and was open to argument. The amendment offers him one route to making such a consideration, by explicitly directing him to the relevant paragraph of the immigration rules.
<P>
If the amendment is not accepted, it will be possible for the Minister to say that the Secretary of State, when making such a removal, will take into account the compassionate circumstances that I referred to, but we believe that, as in many other instances, it would be helpful if it were made explicit in the Bill. We would not then have to rely on the Secretary of State's beneficence when deciding whether to take into account the factors listed in the immigration rules. Although we are moving towards the expansion of administrative removal, I hope that the Minister can tell us that he believes that an explicit link to the immigration rules would be helpful.

<P>

<B>Mr. Neil Gerrard </B>(Walthamstow): I want to comment briefly on the amendment which is in the names of the hon. Members for Hallam and for Twickenham (Dr. Cable), who is allegedly also a member of the Committee.
<P>
You will be aware, Mr. Maxton, that in the evidence taking sittings, I referred to some of the concerns that are raised in the amendment. My hon. Friend the Minister will know that I have also spoken to him about them on a number of occasions.
<P>
This and some later clauses remove the appeal rights of people who currently have them, particularly overstayers, a process begun by the Immigration Act 1988. Since I first came to the House in 1992 one change that I have seen in the way in which individual cases are dealt with&#151;it certainly happened in the Home Office under the previous Government&#151;is that more and more people are treated as illegal entrants rather than as overstayers, even when they have been in this country for a number of years, and are thereby deprived of appeal rights. To some extent this and later clauses extend that process so that appeal rights disappear.
<P>
We could be creating difficulties. In my experience of dealing with large numbers of cases, Members of Parliament spend a great deal of time on those who currently do not have the full appeal rights&#151;particularly overstayers who have been here less than seven years&#151;because they may well have compassionate circumstances that need to be considered. It is better if they can be taken into account formally, as is possible when there is a deportation appeal, instead of being dealt with through representations by individual Members of Parliament, which takes up a great deal of our time as well as that of senior Home Office civil servants and Ministers. I should prefer as few cases as possible to go through those discretionary moves and as many as possible to be dealt with by the full circumstances being taken into account through the formal processes that exist in the rules.
<P>
As a result of the changes in this and later clauses we may generate unjustified asylum claims as a route to an appeal that the clause does not allow. I see nods of agreement from the hon. Member for Hertsmere. It begins to grate on me when I hear compassionate circumstances being paraded by Opposition Members, as I do not remember much compassion being shown whenever I took cases to Ministers in the previous Government.
<P>
The amendment is not necessarily the way forward because it simply says that, within administrative removal, these circumstances should be taken into account, when it should be dealt with through later clauses on issues relating to appeal.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I sympathise with the hon. Gentleman's views on the general principle of how we deal with compassionate circumstances. If the change is made, the amendment would ameliorate its effects and make it slightly less bad. It is not meant as positive support for the proposal in the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerrard:</B> I understand that, but the amendment is not necessarily the best way of dealing with the problem. However, it has pointed to an issue that the Committee should consider carefully. What will happen to some of the people who currently have rights of appeal and who will be dealt with differently from the way that clause 6 implies? The amendment addresses that point.
<P>
I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will give us guidance on the meaning of subsection (4) because that relates closely to the amendment. When a decision is made on whether to remove someone under subsection (1), the amendment would introduce other factors to be considered. However, subsection (4) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Subsection (1) does not apply in such other circumstances as may be prescribed.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That suggests that moves may be made towards the suggestions contained in the amendment of the hon. Member for Hallam. It would be useful if the Minister could clarify whether that is so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> This is an important subject, and the clause is not satisfactory in its current form. The Minister will have to reconsider it from several different points of view.
<P>
The amendment states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Directions may not be given under subsection (1) unless the Secretary of State is satisfied that all relevant factors listed in the immigration rules have been considered.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
As the hon. Member for Hallam rightly said, clause 6 makes an important change to the type of enforcement action that is taken against people who have overstayed or who are otherwise in breach of their conditions.
<P>
We need to keep an important distinction at the centre of our debate. Until now, a distinction has been drawn between two categories against whom enforcement action is taken. The first is those who obtained lawful leave to enter but who have overstayed or breached their conditions in other ways. The second is made up of illegal entrants who do not have lawful leave to enter and who have evaded controls. Enforcement action is taken against both groups, but that distinction has traditionally governed the nature of the action taken. People who have lawfully entered but who have overstayed or breached their conditions have been subject to deportation and the procedures, including the right of appeal, accompanying the making of deportation orders. Illegal entrants are liable to summary removal. They too have rights of appeal, and I shall come to them shortly. However, there is an important difference between the two categories.
<P>
The clause will move many people who fall into the first category and who are subject to deportation into the type of enforcement action that is used against people in the second category. However, we should consider that change against the background of appeal rights available to both categories&#151;that point was touched on by the hon. Members for Walthamstow (Mr. Gerrard) and for Hallam. Both referred to compassionate circumstances and the extent to which they can be taken into account. We need to look clearly at all factors if we are to judge the amendment.
<P>
A person who has been in the United Kingdom for more than seven years as an overstayer has a full right of appeal against deportation in that all the factors of his situation can be considered; family or compassionate circumstances can be argued. A person who has been in the UK for fewer than seven years can appeal against the facts upon which the Home Office has based its decision&#151;the question whether he has overstayed or otherwise breached his conditions or, as the law stands at present, whether he is an illegal entrant&#151;but family or compassionate reasons cannot be argued. In both cases appellants can remain in the United Kingdom while their appeals are being dealt with. That is an important point.
<P>
Turning to removal, which is used to deal with illegal entrants, there is a right of appeal on the ground that the person is not an illegal entrant but family or compassionate circumstances cannot be argued and the right of appeal can be exercised only from overseas. Unlike someone who is appealing against deportation, a person who is subject to a removal order cannot remain in the United Kingdom to bring his appeal.
<P>
The substitution of removal for deportation as the enforcement action for overstayers or those who have otherwise breached their conditions has been widely seen as curtailing rights of appeal, especially for the longer-term overstayers who are most likely to have put down roots here and to have the sort of family or compassionate circumstances to which I have just adverted.
<P>
The previous Government were criticised by the then Opposition who opposed the curtailment of appeal rights for deportees who had been here for fewer than seven years, even though the action taken in 1988 left a full merits appeal of compassionate and family circumstances available for the longer-term overstayer&#151;those here for more than seven years&#151;and both categories of overstayer could remain in the United Kingdom to bring their appeal.
<P>
The curtailment was heavily criticised by the then Opposition. In 1987 the shadow Home Secretary said that what was needed was a proper appeal to a tribunal which could consider all the circumstances in both cases of over seven years and less than seven years. It is reasonable to suggest that the curtailment now being proposed is much more far reaching in its effects on the rights of appeal than the one that was so heavily criticised by the present Government in 1988. The Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants said that this was perhaps the most draconian measure in the Bill. The Immigration Advisory Service said that it was ``wrong in principle'' and that it would ``not work in practice.'' The Refugee Legal Centre said that it would ``promote manifest injustice''.
<P>
The Immigration Law Practitioners Association says that it is fundamentally opposed to what is taking place. A number of those commenting draw attention to the way in which these provisions will affect any person in breach of conditions. They would affect, for example, bona fide students working in this country who, had they known it was necessary&#151;and many do not&#151;would have obtained permission.
<P>
Under the new provisions, such a person now faces removal, as opposed to the enforcement action previously in place, in which appeal rights and other considerations could be taken into account. I am interested to hear the Minister's response, because, as I have just outlined, many organisations have expressed weighty concerns.
<P>
I am inherently sympathetic to good arguments for better enforcement, which is a serious problem that I shall address shortly. When considering enforcement, one must consider the extent to which appeal rights should be available. Certainly, the previous Government never wavered from its judgment that those overstaying by more than seven years probably had extensive family roots and connections in this country as a result of their lengthy stay, and so were entitled to a full merits appeal, in which they could draw on family and compassionate circumstances while in this country. We supported effective enforcement, tempered by a proper appeals system which took into account appropriate circumstances.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Enforcement is important, and I accept that there must be a balance. However, we must examine the balance set by the Government.
<P>
I have other fears. The hon. Member for Hallam said that the Government are not broadly compassionate, and organisations which gave evidence said that the Government are ignoring compassion. I nodded in assent when the hon. Member for Walthamstow touched on the issue of enforcement, because I am anxious that the measure will not work and will not bring about better enforcement, as it will generate more appeals.
<P>
In introducing changes, the Government presumably aim to streamline procedures. Such an objective deserves support, but Conservative Members are backed by expert organisations in wondering whether the measure will have the opposite effect. A number of those who gave evidence entertained that fear and are anxious that people who have their appeal rights curtailed in the way that I have just described may pursue other avenues of appeal.
<P>
People in such circumstances are often desperate, and want to find whatever way they can of staying in this country. The longer they have been here, the more desperate they are likely to be. Should a full right of appeal with family and compassionate circumstances not be available to them, they will turn to another avenue.
<P>
The Bill is opening other avenues to such people. They may decide to claim asylum, as has always been possible. However, it is more likely that they will lodge an appeal on human rights under clause 47. The credibility of a claim sometimes depends on which country the asylum seeker has come from. However, clause 47 is available to anyone, regardless of the country they come from before overstaying.
<P>
I remind the Committee of the concern expressed in the evidence-taking sittings that the Bill would have exactly that effect. We heard that people who had one appeal avenue closed would simply go down another. The Immigration Law Practitioners Association said in evidence:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``This change will engender tension and mistrust within established communities, and could lead to breaches of human rights obligations. The inevitable result would be an increase in applications for judicial review, and increases in ill-founded claims for asylum and (perhaps more well-founded) claims under clause 47 (actions contrary to the Human Rights Act). This is not a recipe for consistent decision-making, nor for quicker or fairer procedures.''&#151;[Official Report, Special Standing Committee, 17 March 1999; c. 196.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Briefly, Mr. Stoyle of the Refugee Legal Centre told us in his oral evidence:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``If people happen to be overstayers or without valid entry clearance and are prevented from ventilating the full facts of their case, frustration will be built into the system for those who want to argue compassionate circumstances and those matters that do not fall within the prescribed concessions. Human nature being what it is, people will seek a remedy elsewhere. The whole point, as we understand it, of the Government's thrust in this policy is that there should be one appeal to deal with all matters. However, they have designed this process to restrict those matters. That is self-defeating.''&#151;[Official Report, Special Standing Committee, 17 March 1999; c. 178-9.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is my concern too&#151;that it will be a self-defeating measure that will generate new asylum claims or human rights claims which will mean more litigation and more cases brought before the courts. Many of us believe that those are not the right avenues, but a desperate person may well pursue them. It will generate much more work at Lunar house in Croydon for caseworkers processing asylum claims. It will certainly generate extra work in the courts when people bring human rights actions and appeals based on them. That is our main concern and it is supported by many other organisations.
<P>
I shall judge the amendment against those criteria. I shall listen carefully when the Minister explains the precise effect of the amendment. I feel that he cannot leave matters as they are. The Government are drastically curtailing rights of appeal for certain people and are opening up some other avenues of appeal. What we are left with is a change that might have a worthy objective in terms of streamlining procedures but will prove self-defeating. It will take away people's rights of appeal and generate much extra work.

<P>

<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> The new procedure will put an end to cases where applicants who have no claim to remain are playing the system and prolonging their stay by lodging a succession of appeals&#151;first against refusal of further leave, then against the decision to deport and finally on asylum grounds.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hertsmere's point about the creation of other types of appeal is not necessarily true. Nothing prevents an overstayer who has had an appeal against deportation dismissed from being deported. More than 80 per cent. of such appeals are dismissed outright, while a further 12 per cent. are withdrawn for one reason or another in applications for asylum or judicial review. The aim is to try to reduce the ability of people to keep playing the system.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The Minister has just quoted figures for deportation, but he knows that deportation covers enforcement actions other than those that we are discussing now. Do his figures incorporate all cases of deportation or only those involving overstayers or people in breach of conditions?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The figures are based on deportation appeals.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> For everybody?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Yes, for everybody.
<P>
The clause does not deal with the removal of appeal rights per se, which is dealt with in part IV of the Bill. When we reach that stage we can debate more fully whether certain appeal rights should apply. This clause is about the mechanics of removal for those who will no longer be supported and we would rather have removed. It introduces a new arrangement for the removal of certain categories of immigration offender.
<P>
Presently, immigration rules require the Secretary of State to take various factors into account when deciding whether to make a deportation order. The rules are silent about what has to be taken into account before removing someone under the proposed new procedures envisaged under clause 6, as the hon. Member for Hallam pointed out. Those rules would need to be amended before this amendment could have any effect.
<P>
Paragraph 364 of the immigration rules explains that in deciding whether to deport a person, the Secretary of State effectively performs a balancing exercise, weighing the public interest against the circumstances of the case. The Secretary of State is specifically required to take into account a number of factors: age, length of residence in the United Kingdom, the strength of ties with the UK, personal history, including character, conduct and employment record, domestic circumstances, any criminal record, any compassionate circumstances and any representations that may have been made on a person's behalf.
<P>
In practice, the factors listed in paragraph 364 of the rules are taken into account in deciding whether to remove someone as an illegal entrant even though there is no legal requirement for that. It is our intention that these considerations will also apply in considering whether to remove someone under the new procedures.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The Minister is telling us about what happens when the Home Office makes its decisions. Will he say a little about the right of appeal of such persons against decisions made by the Home Office in that way?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I shall come back to that.
<P>
The appropriate mechanism to change the way in which the rules will apply and the circumstances that must be taken into account in removal cases is in immigration rules, not in the Bill. The hon. Gentleman seems to be seeking with his amendment to oblige all the relevant factors in the immigration rules to be considered as a result of the Bill's proposals. Our view is that the best place to consider such a change&#151;and I have given an indication of the Government's view about whether the change should be made&#151;would be in immigration rules. We think it unnecessary for such a provision to be in the Bill, as the amendment proposes. In the light of that explanation, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept that the distance between us on what ought to be considered is not great, and that it is the mechnism rather than the outcome that is in dispute.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> Is the Minister suggesting that there should be a change to the immigration rules whereby a paragraph similar to that quoted for deportations be inserted which specifically relates to the removals under clause 6? That was my understanding but it would be helpful if the hon. Gentleman would confirm it.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Yes. I hope that on that basis the hon. Gentleman will feel able to withdraw his amendment.
<P>
I come back to some of the far more broadly based points raised by the hon. Member for Hertsmere. We shall have this debate later in the Bill, but the hon. Gentleman stayed in order during his representations to the Committee, and I wish to respond to him.
<P>
One situation about which I receive most representations from hon. Members is where a constitutent has lawfully entered the United Kingdom and has overstayed&#151;remained in the UK for a time, met someone, married and had children, and is meanwhile the subject of a deportation order because of having overstayed. That is one of the most difficult circumstances that Ministers have to deal with: one parent is the subject of a deportation order and the other is not; the children were born in the UK and perhaps have lived here for a considerable time and the prospect following the deportation order is that the person being removed&#151;deported&#151;from the UK will not be allowed to return for at least three years. This gives rise to representations from Members, who say, ``If this person had entered the UK unlawfully, he would have been subject to removal, would have been removed and would be able to apply to come back almost immediately and, as a spouse, would often be granted entry to the UK.''
<P>
The way in which a deportation order operates is not only cumbersome and enormously expensive and does not only create multiple opportunities for delays, but it creates great inequities. We have to consider a far more simple and straightforward procedure which says to people who should not be here, ``You need to go quickly'', does not provide multiple opportunities for unnecessary delays, reduces the pressure on Croydon, the courts and the legal procedures and ensures a much more effective and streamlined system.
<P>
The detail of how the appeal system will operate and who will and will not have appeal rights will be discussed in due course. The objective of the clause is to ensure that we put in place a faster system that allows fairness&#151;
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> May I inform hon. Members that the Committee Room will be locked between now and half-past four if they wish to leave papers here.
<P>
It being half-past Eleven o'clock, The Chairman adjourned the Committee without Question put, pursuant to the Standing Order.
