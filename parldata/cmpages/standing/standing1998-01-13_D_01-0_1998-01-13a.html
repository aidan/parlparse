<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Department of Trade and Industry (Mr. Ian McCartney):</B> I beg to move,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> That, during the proceedings on the National Minimum Wage Bill, the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock and, with effect from Thursday 15th January, half-past Four o'clock.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
On behalf of both sides of the Committee, I wish you and your co-Chairman, Mr. Atkinson, all the best for 1998, and for 1999. Today is the birthday of my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe (Mr. Betts). He is a new Labour Whip in a new Labour Government--I have not been able to prize out of him just exactly what his age is, but we all wish him well.
<P>
It has been three decades or so since you entered the House, Mrs. Dunwoody, and you have played an active part. As a Minister at the Board of Trade, which became the Department of Trade and Industry, you spent a great deal of time working with my father in the House. It has been three decades since the campaign to establish the minimum wage began, so there is synergy here in relation to your chairmanship.
<P>
It has been said, Mrs. Dunwoody, that you have a number of traits of which hon. Members on both sides of the Committee, particularly those who are new to the House, should take account. I understand that you are a chubby pin up to the trade union leaders and I hope that by the end of our consideration of the Bill, I will be challenging you for that title. It has also been said that you are very much opposed to lying press men. I hope that we will all get a fair hearing from the press as the arguments about this important Bill go to and fro in Committee.
<P>
You are also multilingual, Mrs. Dunwoody, speaking Dutch, French and Italian. Perhaps by the end of proceedings, you will have added Glaswegian to your repertoire.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am delighted that the Minister is giving me this publicity; indeed, I had not expected that sort of commercial without paying. I assume that he will come to the sittings motion at some point.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I was informed by my officials to try to curry favour. I should have stuck to my own inclination and said, ``Get lost.'' I think that I have made the point.
<P>
It is important to the Government and to the Committee that we consider the Bill in as timely a way as possible. The timetable proposed is intended to keep pace with the twin-track approach that we adopted in the Queen's Speech. The first track is the establishment of the Low Pay Commission, which is to report by the end of May this year. The second track, if Parliament wills it, is the legislative process, which will provide a legal and administrative framework for setting the rate and dealing with associated issues as soon as possible after the commission reports.
<P>
I believe that that will be an effective and efficient use of Government time and the House's time which will enable the Government to honour an election pledge to tackle the scandal of poverty pay as quickly as possible.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Boswell (Daventry):</B> I echo the remarks of the Minister and wish you, Mrs. Dunwoody, and all members of the Committee, a happy new year. I join the Minister in wishing the hon. Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe a happy birthday. I have served in Committee on my birthday. It is not always where one might choose to be, but we are here only for the morning--I bring my remarks immediately to the sittings motion--and I hope that he will enjoy the rest of the day. More generally, I hope that we shall enjoy the Committee proceedings.
<P>
Before I continue--I do not know whether this is true, but I have the sense that the Minister is like me in this--I should say that I always feel more comfortable with my jacket off on these occasions. That is not to be taken as a pugilistic gesture--I just wondered whether I might have your permission, Mrs. Dunwoody, to remove my jacket during my remarks or thereafter. If we can do so, one or two hon. Members might find our proceedings easier. I hope that that will be a symbol of the relaxed but focused consideration of our affairs.
<P>
In deference to the encomium that has been made to you and, indeed, to your superb performance on ``Westminster Women'' the other day--you had a starring role, in my view--I will immediately quit the cackle and say that Conservative Members intend to be precise, targeted and ever-compliant with your wishes when moving amendments and in debate. The amendments are drafted with those concerns in mind, as subsequent amendments no doubt will be.
<P>
In order not to be churlish at this stage, I also welcome the two Ministers to the Committee and hope that they will enjoy it. I have an awful admission to make, although I am sure that the Whips on either side of the Committee are not listening. I enjoy Standing Committee work and the cut and thrust of the exchange. I can see that my Whip is expressing amazement--being the Member who admits to enjoying Standing Committees is like being in a Bateman cartoon.
<P>
We could describe what happens in Committee as the top of the iceberg. A huge amount of dialogue takes place underneath between Ministers and their officials, if only to unearth what hon. Members are trying to say in their amendments, which, if I am honest, are not always drafted lucidly and are sometimes rather purposeless. That dialogue is extremely important to the process of government. I am sure that Ministers want to get the Bill as right as they can because they are very proud of it, even though we disagree with them on the principle. It is, therefore, important that we have a full and appropriate dialogue, which is why Conservative Members will not oppose the sittings motion.
<P>
It would be appropriate at this stage for me to make a short statement about my personal position for two reasons. First, I obviously considered it carefully when I agreed to take on Front-Bench responsibilities. I might not have needed to make my next point had the hon. Member for Rotherham (Mr. MacShane), who is not a Member of the Committee, not mentioned it, but just before Christmas, he became a trifle overheated about my appointment to the Front Bench. He raised one or two questions of interest, and he and members of the Committee are entitled to answers.
<P>
My interest in a family farm appears in the Register of Members Interests. Since my election to this place in 1987, the day-to-day running of the farm has been devolved to outside management, although I would not seek to shelter behind that. I now employ only one full-time employee, who has worked for me for the past 15 years. It would not be appropriate for me to give details of an individual's remuneration in public, but I can confirm that he receives significantly more than the Agricultural Wages Board rate--the appropriate rate at the moment is &#163;4.17 an hour. Of course, we do not yet know the national minimum wage rate, which will be the substance of remarks I shall make in a moment. It is extremely unlikely, however, that my employee's pay would be below that rate.
<P>
To suggest, as the hon. Member for Rotherham was beginning to, that I could not sensibly or properly comment on the public interest matters involved in the national minimum wage rate would put Ministers in an even more invidious and difficult position when they comment on their Bill. We have evidence of pay rates in the public sector going as low as &#163;3.17 an hour. Some people in the public sector, though not large numbers, are employed within the target zone of the national minimum wage.
<P>
For the sake of completeness, I should say before leaving that point that a former employee who is now retired but who comes in to do relief work also receives well above the Agricultural Wages Board rate. Anyone who does casual work on the farm, although there is little of that, is of course paid at least those rates. In my type of operation, which depends on organisation, mechanisation and comparatively small amounts of labour, the Agricultural Wages Board is of little direct significance. It would have a more direct impact on other agricultural activities. I was a Minister at the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food for nearly two years. In that time, I answered questions about the Agricultural Wages Board. Nobody, including officials who were aware of my position, expressed any anxieties. At that time I was also responsible for horticulture, which is more labour intensive than agriculture. It involves a significant labour force which, I recall, consists of some 58,000. A large number of those people are paid approximately &#163;3.20 per hour, sometimes for casual employment. As the National Farmers Union has pointed out, the Bill has serious implications for jobs in that sector.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I hesitate to interrupt the hon. Gentleman so early in the sitting, but I remind him that the Committee is debating a sittings motion not a general clause stand part debate--that does not happen during consideration of a sittings motion. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will bear that in mind.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I shall indeed. I shall conclude the point to present the matter of interests with a proper degree of light and shade.
<P>
Many implications for employment are woven into the structure of the Bill, particularly for the low paid. That is one of the reasons why the Bill needs careful consideration, and it was noted with characteristic gusto by the Deputy Prime Minister, when he said that the minimum wage would cost jobs and that any silly fool knew that.
<P>
I am mindful of your strictures, Mrs. Dunwoody and I do not intend to refight the debate that took place on Second Reading, or to trade competitive soundbites with the Government. The Committee stage should be more probing and more reflective than that. In the context of the sittings motion, and of the Government giving the Committe time to meet in the afternoon, the Opposition are anxious that consideration should be proper and not rushed.
<P>
The Finance Bill in the summer and, to some extent, the Bank of England in the autumn demonstrated a tendency towards legislative prematurity. That tendency is unwise because it does not allow the Government to have the right dialogue with their officials or with interested parties.
<P>
First, I wish to start the debate on a note of consensus--inasmuch as one can be found--which I hope will inform our debates. All hon. Members can agree that we wish Britain to be successful economically and competitively. A significant problem is unfolding before our eyes in the economies of south-east Asia. That problem must inform the Committee. Indirectly, it is a major competitive threat because of the depreciation of those countries' currencies.
<P>
If nothing else, the national minimum wage will increase costs for business. That can be avoided only if it puts up unemployment even faster, until the wages bill drops. I do not suggest that that is a likely scenario. The Opposition are anxious that the national minimum wage may damage Britain's competitiveness at precisely the most difficult moment.
<P>
Secondly, we should agree that bureaucracy must be kept to a minimum, especially for small firms. I pay tribute to the Minister for Small Firms, Trade and Industry. The matter is very much her interest. She has been in correspondence with my hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs. Gillan), and has stated that she wishes compliance costs to apply across the actions of the Government--I am pleased to see her nodding. That approach confirms and reinforces a tradition set by the Opposition when in office. The Bill is overtly an enabling Bill under which compliance costs cannot apply to smaller firms--although there are strong indications that they will face extra costs--because the detail does not exist. We know, however, that the Government's proposals contain no exemption for smaller businesses.
<P>
As the Bill is debated according to the sittings motion, the Opposition hope to show that its drafting could bring problems of interpretation and administration for small businesses, and an unwelcome level of uncertainty. That will be clear from the first amendment that the Opposition propose.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
My third point, on which I do not intend to dilate even if you were so minded to allow me, Mrs. Dunwoody, is that I presume that all members of the Committee--certainly Opposition Members, and I expect most Labour Members--are interested in those who are or may be in receipt of low wages. I mentioned earlier, just as an example, the times when a great number of agricultural workers were very low paid. In the pre-war period, my father was very pleased to be able to pay his workers a shilling a week over the minimum, which was something like 28 shillings a week. When, as a teenager, I used to work out the PAYE as an interesting intellectual exercise, the minimum rate was around &#163;6 a week.
<P>
We do not want people to be in receipt of low wages. We want them to have jobs that pay them well. We also want them to be able to skill themselves up so that they earn more and obtain greater job security. Again, I will not dilate on this point, but in my time at the Department for Education--as it then was--we had a strong family commitment to basic skills improvement and to the obtaining of basic qualifications: levels 1, 2 and, one hopes, 3 in national vocational qualifications and general national vocational qualifications. I spent a great deal of my time on that.
<P>
A job is better than no job. It is also a starting point for a better job. We are genuinely concerned that the Government's proposals, as far as we have unpicked them, could lead to people pricing themselves out of jobs. I concede that that is not what the Government and their Back Benchers want, but we need to examine the proposals to see what will happen.
<P>
That brings me to some of the equivocations in the Bill, which will be the subject of legitimate criticism and probing. I hope, and intend, that it will be constructive criticism that is designed to draw out what is proposed. It is clear that the whole thing could be a void for uncertainty, as lawyers would say--although I am not a lawyer, thank goodness.
<P>
It is no accident that the decision-making process has been reversed, although the Minister claimed that as a virtue. It is extraordinary that the Bill and our debates on it come before the recommendations of George Bain's Low Pay Commission on a rate--putting the cart before the horse has become almost an art form. Those of us who once studied classical languages will know that the precise meaning of the word ``preposterous'' is backwards-frontwards. That is exactly the impact we fear from the Bill. It is no accident that that is how the matter is arranged, because it will shut down debate on the likely costs and impact. We cannot know precisely what they will be until we are given the figures. In the days of yore--and even not so yore--when there was a Conservative Government, the Department of Trade and Industry was able, through its experts, to forecast on certain, not unreasonable, assumptions that there would be up to 1 million job losses at &#163;4.15 an hour. The Government will need to give us more details of their proposals.
<P>
According to the serial leaking and speculation from the press on which we rely, we know that there is equivocation within the Government on the final rate. If one interprets on a reasonable assumption the Government's former commitment--to which, certainly in 1992, the current Prime Minister was committed--to half male median earnings, one can see that the solution rate is &#163;4.61 an hour. Ministers at the Department of Trade and Industry--I am not sure whether this is so for both the Ministers present, but it is for one of them--are reported as opting for a rate of &#163;4 an hour. The chairman of the Commission, Professor Bain, has described--of course without commitment--a rate of &#163;3.75 as being not outrageous. The Chancellor of the Exchequer was reported extensively in the press only last month as fighting for a &#163;3.50 rate. The Confederation of British Industry has acknowledged that there may be some consequences and some damage with a rate even as low as &#163;3--although, having conceded the Government's mandate to legislate, its members appear to be settling for a figure of about &#163;3.20.
<P>
While the Minister considers his response, I should like to give praise where praise is due to him and to his officials for some extremely comprehensive notes on clauses, which we appreciate.
<P>
In addition to the rate itself, we must probe the issue of exclusions. Even in as authoritative a medium as the green research paper--the briefing note prepared for the assistance of members of the Committee--the Minister without Portfolio is reported as having said at a meeting at the Labour party conference that he was in favour of wide powers of exception, which were described--rather interestingly--by a report in The Guardian as being part of a ``neo-liberal agenda''.
<P>
The Minister without Portfolio has many powers and a chameleonic character: at one moment he can be a neo-liberal, and at the next he can be a Honecker clone running an east German experience. We want to probe in detail the cause for what the exceptions should be.
<P>
At the heart of the Bill there is a massive equivocation. Either the national minimum wage is set at a single rate that is low enough to do little damage and will therefore fail to meet the aspirations of those who propose it, or it will be set at a rate high enough to bite, which means that its bite will result in job losses, re-ignited differentials, further jobs lost in the second round and damage to competitiveness.
<P>
It would be easy for an Opposition considering the Bill to take refuge. We could just sit here and witter on until the Low Pay Commission reported--

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> I think not.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> But I think not, as you wisely remind us Mrs. Dunwoody. We could, however, say that the whole thing is very difficult and put down some dilatory motion, or suggest in some way that it is impossible to debate such matters. I rather hope that the Low Pay Commission will consider not only my remarks but those of my colleagues in the matter. It is important that the debate is full. We could resort to delaying tactics, but--as you rightly remind us, Mrs. Dunwoody, we shall not be permitted to do that.
<P>
We might say with a bland smile--I can think of one or two former colleagues who would enjoy saying this--that we saw no particular reason to exclude any particular group from the benefits of higher unemployment that are likely to come about generally as a consequence of the Bill. In effect, we would be saying that the Government have a mandate to legislate, so let them legislate, and then let them, the British people and the low paid suffer the consequences. We do not want to do that. We want to have a dialogue about what is appropriate within the Government's policy to find out more about that policy and to decide how it can be improved and how safeguards can be built in.
<P>
In conclusion, I shall use an analogy that I have not used before. Conservative Members are very much alive and full of the joys of the forthcoming spring--by which time we may perhaps have concluded our remarks. We are lean and fit. Nevertheless, we are archaeologists: we must dig, sift and probe to unearth the skeleton of the Bill and the skeletons in the ministerial cupboard that accompany it. We must work out how the various parts fit together and relate to each other, and how one part might lead to another. We shall attempt to puzzle out what the Bill means. We shall not ease up from that task until we have obtained better answers than those that the Government have offered so far.
<P>
I hope that our consideration of the Bill proceeds without difficulties. We shall not oppose the sittings motion.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Chidgey </B>(Eastleigh): I would also like to offer my seasonal good wishes to the Committee, but I fear that the moment--or even the day--has already passed. I am sure, Mrs. Dunwoody, that you will be pleased to hear that my opening comments to the sittings motion will be brief.
<P>
I agree with the Minister about the Bill's importance. I remember well his impassioned speech at the end of the Second Reading debate, in which he imparted his own views on, and knowledge of, poverty. An awareness of poverty, however, is not his sole prerogative. Many Liberal Democrat Members--as well as hon. Members from other parties--have had stark experiences of people living in poverty, which is why we regard the Bill as such an important measure. I assure the Government that we intend to approach the Committee stage in a productive and constructive manner in order to achieve legislation that addresses the issue of poverty wages in this country.
<P>
I hope that the Bill will tackle the lack of regulation that allows cowboy operators to undercut their competitors by paying poverty wages at the expense of the taxpayer. I also hope that there will be time for the equally important task of ensuring that the legislation does not merely put a floor under poverty wages but does so without the risk of creating instability in local and regional economies and in job markets. I hope that the Committee will have detailed arguments about those matters, and especially about the impact of a national minimum wage on regional economies and their variations.
<P>
I also hope that we consider the role of the Low Pay Commission, and especially the treatment of those who are under or over the age of 18. A key difference exists between those individuals who are on recognised training schemes and those who are not. The Bill must tease out how that difference is to be addressed. I believe that, for all adults, the guideline should be equal work means equal pay, and that that should apply regardless of gender.
<P>
Low-paid workers who work extremely long hours to earn a living wage also deserve to be considered, and at present the Bill does not do that. We must ensure that those who work very long hours are entitled to overtime payments related to an enhanced national minimum wage.
<P>
Automatic annual uprating of the national minimum wage is another area that the Bill presently fails to address. We must consider whether a national minimum wage could be increased automatically in line with key economic indicators.
<P>
It is also crucial to identify the long-term role of the Low Pay Commission. It should be established as a permanent body with powers allowing it to act independently of the political guidance--I say guidance rather than interference--of the Secretary of State. Whatever the present Government's good intentions to address poverty wages, any future Government might have quite different intentions. The Low Pay Commission must be strong and independent if we are to ensure that poverty wages disappear from this country for all time.
<P>
I have outlined the key issues that concern us, but many more will arise as the Committee considers the Bill. We hope to improve the Bill so that poverty wages are removed from this country for good.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Lansley </B>(South Cambridgeshire): As I am a newer Member--I hesitate to say new as this is the second occasion on which I have had the privilege of serving on a Standing Committee--perhaps I may crave your indulgence, Mrs. Dunwoody, if I sometimes need extra guidance on procedure. I look forward to the opportunity of learning a lot more about the procedure of Standing Committees under your chairmanship.
<P>
I have some comments on the sittings motion. As my hon. Friend said, we do not intend to oppose it, but I want to introduce some considerations that should be brought before the Committee. In a sense, the cart has been put before the horse in the Bill. The Government argued on Second Reading that, as their proposal to proceed with the principle of a national minimum wage had gone as far as appointing a non-statutory Low Pay Commission, the Bill should be introduced at an early stage so that Parliament could express its views on the principle and the Low Pay Commission could undertake its work. However, it does not follow that consideration of the Bill should proceed ahead of the report of the Low Pay Commission.
<P>
I shall illustrate that point by referring to the inter-relationship between the explanatory and financial memorandum of the Bill and our consideration of the Bill. I had a little experience of such matters before coming to the House, not least when representing business organisations. The purpose of the explanatory and financial memorandum, among other things, is to set out the impact of the legislation on public sector manpower and business compliance costs. Those implications should be considered in detail before proceeding to legislation.
<P>
In the explanatory and financial memorandum under ``Financial effects of the Bill'', the Government state:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``It will not be possible to estimate the majority of the Bill's financial effects on the public sector with any accuracy until the level of the National Minimum Wage, and consequently the number of people who may be directly affected by it, are known.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Enforcement is a major area of the Bill where the Government seek to take powers. The explanatory and financial memorandum states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Operational details as to who enforces the National Minimum Wage have yet to be decided.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The implications for public sector manpower are given on page vii, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Any increase in workload from the introduction of a National Minimum Wage will depend on which if any of the enforcement options is chosen and on the actual rate and coverage of the National Minimum Wage.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
My experience suggests that the most important purpose of the explanatory and financial memorandum is to set out the business compliance costs associated with the Bill, and page vii states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The National Minimum Wage will clearly have both direct and indirect effects on business costs, but these are difficult to predict without knowing its rate, definition or coverage.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Government admit that we are proceeding to consideration of the Bill not with unseemly haste, but at a time of the Government's choosing which is in advance of the point at which they are able to state in the explanatory and financial memorandum the financial effects on the public sector, the manpower effects on the public sector, the implications for enforcement and how that will be accomplished by Government Departments and so on, and the effects on the business community because we do not yet know the rate of the minimum wage, its definition or its coverage.
<P>
The Government have failed to make a decision on the level of the national minimum wage and the Bill gives Ministers curious powers to introduce exemptions. For example, it allows them to exempt trainees, but does not allow them to make other exemptions. It is a curious beast that we are dealing with. My hon. Friend made it clear that we are dealing with an enabling Bill, but the Government have designed it to enable them not to respond to the debate in Committee. The Bill is not designed--looking at clause 4, for example--to give Ministers the freedom to make exemptions where they think that those are necessary.
<P>
I listened carefully to the hon. Member for Eastleigh (Mr. Chidgey). After discussing the impact of the minimum wage on different regions and speculating on what rate the Low Pay Commission might recommend, the Committee might conclude that there are grounds for a ministerial power to exempt certain regions or to set different rates for different regions, but the Bill is designed to exclude that power from Ministers. We are dealing with a curious beast which is an enabling Bill to an extreme extent: a national minimum wage at a single rate is to be set, but we know little of the detail, such as exemptions and how practical implications might be translated into legislation. Ministers have not given themselves the freedom that they ought.
<P>
That returns us to the question of timing. Having established the principle on Second Reading according to their majority in the House, the Government have chosen to proceed before the Low Pay Commission has made its recommendation. Other hon. Members who have been trying to acquire information will know that while many organisations have made recommendations or given evidence to the Low Pay Commission, it contines to acquire oral and other evidence from around the country.

<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am most grateful to my hon. Friend for giving way at such an early stage. Does he agree that once the Low Pay Commission had carried out its inquiries around the country and reported in May, the Government could then have brought to the House a Bill informed by that debate? Given the Government's ability to run Standing Committees at a frenetic pace, could not consideration have been done and dusted by the end of the summer without impairing their essential timetable?
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> My hon. Friend's experience of those matters allows him to explain better than I could that that would have been possible within a reasonable time scale for the implementation of the national minimum wage.
<P>
We shall discuss what is desirable in terms of timing and implementation. It would be undesirable for many businesses were a national minimum wage to be implemented without proper transition and notice of the rate that is to be applied. It would have been possible to proceed in Committee when we knew much more about the rate, definition and coverage of the national minimum wage, but the Government have chosen not to proceed in that way. As my hon. Friend rightly said, with the majority that the Government enjoy in the House, they would have had no difficulty in proceeding reasonably quickly; indeed, they would have had a better Bill to bring to the Committee, and consideration could have been less prolonged than might be the case.
<P>
We must look frankly at different scenarios and think rather speculatively about the character of the national minimum wage to decide whether the Bill should be amended to allow Ministers to take into account the practical difficulties that certain sectors of industry, certain regions and certain businesses, not least small businesses, might encounter. We must also consider the practical implications for such businesses of the minimum wage rate that is set.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Bercow </B>(Buckingham): I am following the logic of my hon. Friend's thesis closely. It seems to Conservative Members that the Government have put the cart before the horse.
<P>
Does my hon. Friend agree that there should be adequate time to debate the significance of clause 4? There appears to be tension between the Governement's recognition that some people--namely those under 26--could be deterred from getting work or prevented from keeping it by the minimum wage, and their apparent resolute determination to make no other provision for other categories of workers--those of a particular age, perhaps--whose employment prospects might similarly suffer if they were subject to the minimum wage. Would not it be sensible, for example, to allow the possibility of an exemption for older workers?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I hesitate to interrupt, but this might be a good moment to make one or two points. Hon. Members must address the Chair, because they want their words recorded. They should also acknowledge the Chair, because that is a matter of courtesy, not to me but to the powers of the House of Commons. It is also important to remember that interruptions are brief and speeches are speeches--this being the first morning of our Committee, I am not minded to restrict speeches, but we must try and remember the difference between the two.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I was cautious in prefacing my remarks with reference to the need to be guided procedurally.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I shall do my best to help the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I am grateful to you, Mrs. Dunwoody.
<P>
I will not be tempted by my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham, (Mr. Bercow) to consider the implications of clause 4, but he is right to say that we need detailed consideration of what I fear will be speculative but also practical issues about how the national minimum wage may apply to different ages, different categories of trainee, and so on.
<P>
We are proceeding with a shot in the dark. The principle is established, but the practical effects have yet to be illustrated. I fear that we will be illustrating them and that our debates will inform the work of the Low Pay Commission, rather than the other way around. We will illustrate, not only for the benefit of the Low Pay Commission but for the benefit of Ministers' future considerations, some of the practical difficulties of implementing the Bill.
<P>
At this point, I will not discuss other issues to which it is desirable but we should give detailed consideration, as they will come up under later parts of the Bill. I was struck, however, by a quotation from Professor Walter Oi of the Institute of Economic Affairs. In June 1997 he wrote:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``A policy that can raise the wages of those at the bottom of the wage ladder with no job losses is remarkable. It rivals a perpetual motion machine or alchemy.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We shall wait to see whether Ministers intend to turn base metals into gold, or perhaps to turn the gold of economic competitiveness into base metal.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brian Cotter </B>(Weston-Super-Mare): I shall follow the excellent example of my hon. Friend the Member for Eastleigh and keep my remarks brief.
<P>
I welcome the idea that there should be fair wages in this country--that is why I am glad to be participating in this Committee. Many matters will arise throughout our discussions, but I want to highlight my concerns about the impact of the Bill on small businesses. I am disappointed that there is no clear representation of small businesses on the Low Pay Commission as there is on the Federation of Small Businesses or the Forum of Private Business, where that sector is clearly represented, and it is obvious that members are consulted and feedback sought. That is a great omission in the commission's set up.
<P>
Being in business myself, I know that when one sees new regulations, one is concerned about bureaucracy and increased paperwork. I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Eastleigh and many other hon. Members will address that, because many aspects of the Bill could cause such bureaucracy. It is not only people in business who are concerned; many others throughout the country feel that we must fight against the paperwork mountain.
<P>
Another cause for disappointment--this theme will recur throughout our discussion--is the impact that the minimum wage will have if it does not have a regional aspect. At the moment, the Government are setting up regional development agencies, which would have provided an excellent opportunity to give the minimum wage and similar matters a regional aspect.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Philip Hammond </B>(Runnymede and Weybridge): I would like to add a few observations to my hon. Friend's comments about the Bill's structure and the impact that it may have on the time that the Committee needs for proper deliberation on it.
<P>
We should seek to mitigate the Bill's effects in the course of our debate. We may find ourselves in strange company because I suspect that our proceedings will mirror a debate that has already taken place in the Labour party and in the Cabinet between those who seek a pure, dogmatic version of the national minimum wage and those who seek to make the Bill a pragmatic and working piece of legislation.
<P>
The problem that we face in Committee is that, as my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) observed, we are working in something of a vacuum. We have to assume a range of outcomes from the deliberations of the Low Pay Commission. The Bill's structure is such that clauses 1, 2, 3 and 4 provide a framework for regulation, which will eventually contain all the meat. We ought to be discussing that in Committee, but cannot do so. We can properly debate and judge the Bill only by that meat.
<P>
I noted that the Minister and the Prime Minister made references in the House in the weeks before Christmas to the number of people who would be affected by a &#163;2.50 minimum wage. Clearly, if that figure were to be proposed, many of our concerns would evaporate. If we already knew the proposed figure for the minimum wage, we could make our remarks more focused.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that there would be many unhappy bunnies on the Government Benches if the rate were &#163;2.50?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am sure that my hon. Friend is right. My point is that we may need more time than would otherwise have been the case because we need to consider a range of possible outcomes and what follows from each of them in terms of the Bill's provisions.
<P>
Clauses 1 to 4 are permissive and allow the Secretary of State to introduce regulations. I suspect that that was all they did when the Bill was drafted. Sometime during the summer, however, someone became alarmed about what the Minister without Portfolio was saying. The Bill's broad structure is now permissive, but it has been Mandelson-proofed by the imposition of restrictions on the Secretary of State's discretion.
<P>
We see before us an enabling Bill. We cannot see the key facts that we should be debating, but we can see that the Secretary of State's ability to make regulations is almost always restrained in a bad way, which will almost always lead to worse regulations. Conservative Members will want to probe restrictions such as that in clause 1, whereby the Secretary of State is constrained by regulation to introduce a single national minimum wage. In clauses 2, 3 and 4, she is constrained by non-discrimination provisions.
<P>
The Minister spoke of the twin-track approach that the Government have adopted. A Low Pay Commission has been appointed, but as far as I understand from my reading of the available information, there is no reference in the Secretary of State's letter that defines the commission's remit to the limitations under which she will operate when implementing its recommendations. The Low Pay Commission has gone off to do its work without necessarily appreciating in formal terms the constraints under which the Secretary of State operates. The Committee must investigate the relationship between the Low Pay Commission's work and the legislation. It is questionable whether reference has been made under clause 5(1) in view of the fact that important parts of subsections (2) and (3) were not included in the letter of reference.
<P>
Many Committee members will have sought to inform themselves by contacting organisations that have made representations to the Low Pay Commission.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The Committee is considering a sittings motion. I have shown some leniency by allowing hon. Members to discuss matters that they believe relate directly to that motion, but I must remind hon. Members that they should be debating the timing of sittings.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am sorry, Mrs. Dunwoody, but I was seeking to draw attention to the Bill's unusual structure, and to unusual circumstances which may make the Committee require more time than would otherwise have been the case.
<P>
Perhaps I may briefly draw attention to clause 8.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> No. Let me make myself clear because apparently I have not done so. The Committee is debating a sittings motion, a motion to set down the timetable according to which it should consider the Bill. The clauses will come up for debate one after another and hon. Members will have the right to table any manner of amendment to those clauses. The Committee is not, however, debating those clauses now; it is debating the sittings motion. The Committee must begin as it means to go on--in a fairly orderly fashion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Thank you for that guidance, Mrs. Dunwoody. Of course, I bow to your decision, and I shall conclude merely by asking you to take account of the points that Opposition Members have raised about the extraordinary difficulties under which the Committee will be labouring. I know that you will ensure that the Committee will have adequate time to discuss the rather peculiar, and one might say bizarre, aspects of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Damian Green (Ashford):</B> You will be relieved to know, Mrs. Dunwoody, that I intend to be very brief. I wish to address directly the principal point made by the Minister in his introduction. The twin-track approach informs the whole purpose of the sittings motion. As the Minister said, the sittings motion is intended to enable the Committee to do its work at the same time as the Low Pay Commission is doing its work in a different part of the jungle.
<P>
From the point of view of the efficient and effective working of the Committee, that approach is peculiar and extraordinary. If the Committee is to do its job effectively, a twin-track approach is especially inappropriate. Clearly, the Committee's purpose is to scrutinise in detail the effects of every clause in the Bill and that is impossible without the Low Pay Commission's findings. To say that a twin-track approach is appropriate for the Committee's sittings is dead wrong. The reverse is true, as is illustrated by the many submissions that have been made to the Low Pay Commission. I am sure that, in preparing for the Committee, hon. Members will have looked at those submissions. They all concentrate on a few important central issues for the Bill's future including the rate at which the minimum wage might be set, as well as other aspects such as the wider economic impact on competitiveness, employment levels and so on, and the impact on individual companies. The pressures on small companies will be different from those on larger companies, which may have greater flexibility. All those issues will be discussed by the Committee, but we shall be unable to discuss them effectively if we are not informed of the work that the Low Pay Commission is doing while we are sitting.
<P>
One important issue is the impact on trainees and young workers, which is the subject of many submissions to the Low Pay Commission. Several clauses cover trainees and young workers who may not be on trainee schemes. Without knowing the findings of the Low Pay Commission--its work is still being done and will continue for some months--the usefulness of the Committee's work will be seriously reduced. I appeal to the Government to publish the commission's interim findings or to encourage it to provide background material--for example, the submissions made to it--while the Committee is sitting. Otherwise, we shall have to do our best with a series of hypothetical considerations of what the rate will be, what the restrictions will be, what regional variations there will be and so on without knowing the full details of what we are discussing. If the Committee is to be as effective as we all want it to be, we must have as many facts as possible. The Low Pay Commission will develop expertise and its findings should be made available to the Committee as we proceed. If that does not happen we shall be faced with the peculiarity of discussing a Bill which is both abling and disabling. We shall have to strike the balance which the parliamentary draftsmen have tried to strike without knowing the full facts. The Committee's work will be less effective than it should be because it is sitting now and not in a few months when the Low Pay Commission will have reported.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I shall strive mightily to remain in order, Mrs. Dunwoody, and I am conscious of the strictures that otherwise await me. I am moved to make some brief comments on the strength of what has been said by my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry and others.
<P>
It is important to put on the record that our concern is genuine. The need for a lengthy timetable for consideration of the Bill and any amendments in Committee is not accidental. Such consideration is specifically the responsibility of the Minister of State, Department of Trade and Industry and his hon. Friends on the Front Bench. If the matter had been dealt with the right way round and the Low Pay Commission had considered the relevant issues in advance and produced its recommendations, a meatier and simpler Bill could have been presented and the Committee could have considered it more speedily. We cannot do that because the Government have not decided what they want in the Bill. They have merely decided to provide themselves with the weaponry subsequently to make exceptions, exemptions and variations according to what I might describe as presidential taste. The President of the Board of Trade will be empowered by the provisions of the Bill to make variations and exemptions in the future. She would not need to do that, and the Minister would not need to commend to the Committee a Bill that allowed for that, if the Government had made some sensible decisions--or, indeed, any decisions--by now about what they wanted to recommend to the Committee.
<P>
It seems peculiar that the Government have not been able to come forward with something a little more meaty and specific in the light of our historical experience. The Minister may be greatly surprised and even somewhat embarrassed by this, but I respect his commitment to a national minimum wage and his past commitment to a specific level for the national minimum wage.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> Could you point anywhere--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I apologise; I meant to say ``the hon. Gentleman''. That is my second yellow card. I think that that is a sending-off offence. Could the hon. Gentleman point to anywhere in the record that indicates that I had a position on what the level of the minimum wage should be?
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I believe that I am right in saying--the Minister will correct me if I am wrong--that in 1992 he stood as the Labour candidate for Makerfield on a manifesto commitment to establish a national minimum wage at a rate of &#163;3.40 an hour. I wait with baited breath and beads of sweat upon my brow in eager anticipation of the Minister's rising to his feet to say that he castigated the 1992 manifesto, but I believe that I am right.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> We are discussing the consequences of the 1997 general election, not the 1992 election.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I recognise that, and I am grateful to the Minister for making so pertinent and obvious a point. The point that I am making is that the Committee will be delayed in its consideration of the Bill precisely because the Government are not prepared now to offer the specificity that they were prepared to offer in opposition in 1992.
<P>
The reality is that because no quantified single rate is proposed for the Committee to consider, we cannot assess its impact on the overall level of wage costs, on employment and on other factors such as wage inflation and even, depending on the economic view taken, price inflation. We cannot debate such matters.
<P>
I would welcome the Minister's reconsideration and his decision that, in the interests of the speedy deliberations of the Committee, he and his colleagues would, even without the advice of the Low Pay Commission, specify a particular rate. If they were prepared to say in 1992 that the rate should be &#163;3.40, I do not understand, as a new Member and a relative innocent in such matters, why the Minister is not now prepared to say that it should be &#163;3.40, or &#163;3.50, or &#163;3.75. The newspapers appear to be regularly briefed that the intention is that the rate be &#163;3.75; unfortunately, the Committee is not favoured with the intelligence that is provided to the media. Is the rate to be &#163;4, or &#163;4.15, or &#163;4.61? Is it to be more than that? Is it to be as much as the Minister pays his cleaner? I do not know, and neither do any of my hon. Friends on the Opposition Benches. It is precisely because of that lack of specificity that our deliberations will take longer.
<P>
I know that the Minister is a tolerant fellow--he is more tolerant in Committee than he is on the Floor of the House, anyway--and he will understand that we want conscientiously to examine the various options. That is a matter of some regret. It means that more of your time, Mrs. Dunwoody, more of the Minister's time and more of our time is taken up than would otherwise be the case. That is not to take account of the interests of Strangers who might be listening to our deliberations because they have a commercial or personal interest, or both. We are going to take longer because of that lack of specificity.
<P>
In commending the sittings motion, my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry indicated that he rather enjoyed these proceedings. That caused a faint astonishment to appear on the face of some Labour Members. I am sure that he meant it--he enjoys these Committee deliberations. I think that I am correct in saying that the Minister made a simlar comment--or that at least he did not dissent from it. I wonder whether the Minister greatly enjoys lengthy debate on these matters, or whether he has some kind of masochistic instinct. I must emphasise, however, that we are approaching the Bill in a constructive spirit. The Minister must accept that it is essential to assess the implications of particular rates, and that that is one key reason why the debate will take longer than it would otherwise have done.
<P>
The second reason why the debate will take longer than it would otherwise have done is that Opposition Members are genuinely baffled and perplexed by what the Government appear to intend--I use the word ``appear'' advisedly--in respect of exemptions. The Government appear to intend that there be very few exemptions, which some of us might think regrettable. It is perfectly apparent that the Minister without Portfolio thought that that was regrettable, which was why he argued for a greater number of exemptions and, specifically, for variations. Opposition Members who have studied the Bill, however, do not understand why the Government have committed themselves to age discrimination with regard to those under 26 years of age but thereafter have set their faces like flint against any other age discrimination. I use the word ``discrimination'' in its correct sense of having a discriminating outlook on the grounds of the sector, the region, the size of undertaking or the occupation of the person or persons.
<P>
We do not understand the logic of going helter skelter for agism on one hand and rigorously opposing it on the other, which is why we shall need to debate these matters in considerable detail and at length. We shall do so in a constructive and--from time to time no doubt--an amicable spirit.
<P>
It should be absolutely clear, Mrs. Dunwoody, that insofar as your task is more arduous than it otherwise would have been--which is of concern to the Committee and no doubt to you--and insofar as it is a more arduous task for the Minister and his colleagues, the responsibility lies with this ducking and weaving Administration. On the one hand the Government have trumpeted their commitment to a national wage, and on the other they have failed to offer us any substantial detail after eight months in office. For that reason, we will probe, examine and scrutinise every clause and amendment in the greatest possible detail. I feel sure that the Minister will greatly welcome that intention.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> This has been an interesting set of exchanges. It is clear that, in setting up the ground rules for debate, my hon. Friends and I have been concerned about discrimination. That is a mutual word--it may be appropriate to discriminate or grossly inappropriate to discriminate, but we need to be told which it is. I am sure that that will provide major substance for the Committee's earlier exchanges, although I would in no sense wish to downgrade the importance of considering the current and future role of the Commission or the operation of the Bill.
<P>
Some years ago I was a special adviser, as was my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham, and that experience taught me two things: a growing appreciation of the ability and the commitment of the civil service and an understanding of the need to produce policies that are not only as right as can be in the circumstances but administrable. I will share only one anecdote with the Committee in winding-up. I can remember bringing a meeting to a complete halt by uttering the three words ``Have we powers?''. I knew, of course, that we had not. It will become evident when we discuss amendment No. 6--if I may give a trailer for it--that little words and administrability will be extremely important. The essential point is that we need to test the Government on whether--and if so, why--any measure of discrimination is appropriate in particular circumstances.
<P>
The debate has been useful in explaining the importance of a measure of dialogue with the Low Pay Commission. Conservative Members will not seek to challenge the motives behind the timetable and approach that the Government have set out. We would, however, welcome the most open dialogue possible with the commission. That is not so that we can do its job or nobble it in advance but so that it can at least feel that the Committee will be informed of its conclusions as they begin to unfold and could enter into a dialogue with it. I do not wish to pin the Minister down on the means by which that should be done. I should, however, reiterate the firm view of myself and my colleagues that it would be immensely helpful to have some dialogue with the commission. It would be helpful for it to be able to share its emerging conclusions with us and inform our debates as they take place. I ask the Minister only to reflect on that and to tell us how best we can take that dialogue forward.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> I will respond to the technical issues that have arisen in the debate on the sittings motion. Much of what has been said today has been an eloquent bluster by Opposition Members who are embarrassed by their continuing opposition to the concept and principle of a national minimum wage. I was going to say that the Conservative party was the only organisation left in the United Kingdom that still opposed the minimum wage, but after the speech by the hon. Member for Buckingham we could add masochists against the national minimum wage.
<P>
No issue of substance has arisen today which is not covered by this comprehensive Bill, which contains 3 clauses and 3 schedules. The Government welcome the fact that they will have ample opportunity for dialogue with all members of the Committee to ensure that when the Bill leaves Committee it meets the requirements of the Government's policy declarations. The Government will treat the Committee with all seriousness. If amendments are reasonable and fit in with the concept and principle behind the Bill, we will consider them seriously. We will obviously reject wrecking amendments or proposals that undermine the Bill's concept and principle, as people would expect. Ministers will, however, give consideration to proposals that are worthy if it.
<P>
I want to make it clear from the outset that the Low Pay Commission is an independent body. The Government clearly established that commitment before the general election following extensive national consultation with industry--probably the most extensive ever undertaken on a single issue by a party in opposition. Out of that consultation came the concept of and commitment to establishing the Low Pay Commission very early in our Administration, and that was done within 90 days. Industry welcomes its involvement with the Low Pay Commission, both directly as members of it and through its ability to have dialogue with it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> I agree that the Government have honoured their commitment to set up a Low Pay Commission, which he knows I welcome. Is it the Government's intention that it should be a permanent body?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> As I said earlier, we can debate the Low Pay Commission's role and activities when considering the Bill--some of the clauses relate directly to its role. Surely, the most important factor is that the Low Pay Commission has been up and running for six months and has already completed a national tour to take evidence from more than 600 organisations. It will soon establish a process for reaching conclusions, which the Government and, thereafter, the House will consider. It is interesting to note that the Government have done something that the previous Administration often failed to do; they have consulted about the heart of their proposals. The Low Pay Commission shows that.
<P>
The Bill is about establishing a legislative framework to take account of whatever proposals come from the Low Pay Commission. The House will have a fuller opportunity for consideration when it debates the secondary legislation. The Government have not curtailed adequate debate--nor will we--about the minimum wage and its consequences or the detail of the final proposals. We are proceeding step by step. It is important that social partners are involved at each step--those who will receive the minimum wage and those who will pay it. That is the primary purpose of the Low Pay Commission.
<P>
With regard to the twin track and information, where we can provide information to hon. Members, we shall do so. The concept in principle is clear; we will establish advice notes on clauses. In my previous life as an Opposition spokesman, I found that one of the most frustrating things for members of Committees was the fact that advice notes and notes on clauses would usually simply repeat what was in the Bill--They gave no further information. We have tried to set out each clause in three parts: the concept in principle, the consequence and legal definitions. I hope that hon. Members find that a useful tool for berating or challenging the Government. We are providing information in that qualitative way so that hon. Members can give the Bill proper consideration during our deliberations.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> The Minister said that the Government would reject wrecking amendments but that they would consider constructive amendments sympathetically or with an open mind. Would he be prepared sympathetically to consider the composition of the Low Pay Commission, about which Opposition Members have genuine concerns?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> The only people who have concerns about the composition of the Low Pay Commission are Opposition Members. I see it as a smokescreen for opposition to the Low Pay Commission itself. A major first in British industrial employment relations took place when the Low Pay Commission was established--the Institute of Directors and Unison agreed on its composition.
<P>
The commission has widespread support. Its members are there on the basis of their skill, knowledge and commitment and their working relationships with industry. Current members of the commission who are carrying out its important task clearly represent all aspects of industry, commerce, small businesses and large businesses--all the sectors where issues of low pay are most prominent--as well as the work force. It is clear that all sides of industry welcome the establishment of the commission and the professional way in which it is carrying out its duties.
<P>
We assure hon. Members that we intend to hold a dialogue about all aspects of the Bill. There is no purpose in having a Committee process if there is only a dialogue of the deaf. It is important to all of us that we have open debate. No doubt there will be clashes of concept and principles--so be it. The fact is that the principle was won at the last election, although that does not for a moment remove the right of Opposition Members who are still opposed to the concept of a minimum wage and still support low pay and no pay to make their case, although that concept is deeply distrusted by the rest of Britain. The Government are willing to listen, but we shall reject at all times any attempt to derail the Bill or to undermine its concept. We are determined to put the bill on the statute book at the earliest opportunity.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Will the Minister accept that for the purposes of the Committee's debates, the Opposition will not seek to derail either the Bill or the work of the commission? However, will he give a commitment at least to examine the possibility of producing some input from the commission in time for our debates, rather than leaving the commission to report after the Committee has concluded? I am not asking him to commit himself as to the details or even to do it, but will he at least consider whether it is possible?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> The answer to that question is no. The Low Pay Commission will make its recommendations. The Government will then consider them and bring forward secondary legislation. We gave a commitment on Second Reading that the secondary legislation would be for the House to debate. The House and the Government will consider the LPC's recommendations at that stage.
<P>
It is still open to Conservative Members to submit their evidence to the LPC. I am sure that the commission will welcome thoughts from the Conservative party on what the minimum wage should be. When we asked for access to information in opposition, the previous Government alway asked us to submit our views. It is open to anyone to put views to the LPC, which will follow with interest what is said in Committee. The position is absolutely clear: the LPC will put its proposals to the House, and the House will consider them and then propose secondary legislation.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 6 in page 1, line 7, leave out `by his employer'.
<P>
Wrapping up what the Minister has said, Conservative Members are disappointed with his remarks. There were fine words about the need for consultation, but when it comes to the beef there is none. We are unable to have the direct input of the commission into the Committee and--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. With respect, we cannot go over the debate that has just finished. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman, who has been a Member of the House for a long time, knows that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Precisely so, Mrs. Dunwoody. I was coming to this particular technical debate.
<P>
In my opening remarks, I said that I was not a lawyer, though I have mind that is slightly lawyerly. Probably the worst kind of lawyer is an amateur lawyer--in Committee we do not have to carry that baggage with us, although it is useful if some of us do--but we have to probe to get Ministers to speak to the Bill.
<P>
The Minister of State drew a distinction--one that he will pray in aid more than once--between wrecking and constructive amendments. Conservative amendments will, on occasion, be construable as wrecking. This amendment might be one of them, in a certain context, but that does not necessarily mean--I say that looking straight at the Chair--that it is so conceived. For example, an amendment to remove a line, a subsection or a clause may be tabled to illicit information on the Government's intentions or to point out drafting difficulties. That is the spirit in which the amendment has been tabled--it is a probing amendment.
<P>
For the benefit of new Members, there is another type which will arise in a moment--the so-called paving amendment. Such amendments are tabled to pave the way for new and greater excitements later on. Conservative Members are not seeking to wreck the Bill with amendments, but they want to probe the Government's intentions. The amendment makes a good start.
<P>
My reading of the Bill led me to certain words with potential for omission, not because I want to wreck the Bill but because I want the Minister of State to explain who is an employer. Somewhere at the back of my mind was the epistle to the Hebrews, which is probably more familiar to others. It says, as well as I can remember, that where there is a testament, there must of necessity be the death of the testator. In the same spirit, where there is employment, there must be an employer and an employee. Clearly, without an employer, there could not be an employee, employment or a national minimum wage.
<P>
In that sense, the amendment looks like a wrecking amendment--I take that accusation on the chin before the Minister makes it. The amendment's purpose, however, is to probe the issue of who the employer is. I shall draw on another well known saying: it is a wise child who knows his own parents. The registration data shows significant evidence of a national failure to report the identity of the parent. In that spirit, I believe that the Committee should examine the nature of an employer.
<P>
I shall refer briefly to an anecdote from my past. My late father was my business partner, and died suddenly. I asked my solicitor to tell me whether the business was still a partnership and whether I was now a sole trader. I asked about the legal position and how it related to the bank. As the Minister will know, there are constant, entirely proper, necessary and sometimes inevitable changes in the profile of employment. As sole traders die, executors take over. Even if the employer does not change, it is increasingly difficult to know who one's employer is in a world in which the old certainties of going to work five days a week in regular hours for a single employer are breaking down, in which greater emphasis is given to part-time employment--which is an important part of the Bill--and in which flexibility is an accepted concept. It is perfectly reasonable to work for two or three employers in the course of a week, with contracts of employment or for services, which many people do. Overlaying structures of employment are possible, under which a person could be employed by a subsidiary but be on a payroll that is administered centrally. The identity of the employer would then be uncertain.
<P>
I suspect that most of us in the real world, if we are reasonably happy with our employment, do not ask about the small print unless something goes wrong. A person could have more than one employer. Thinking aloud, I suggest that circumstances could arise in which the nature and form of employment could affect responsibility for the minimum wage. As I recall--I am subject to correction--the employer at the beginning of the week takes the lead in dealing with liabilities for national insurance payments.
<P>
Some employers may offer more than the national minimum wage while others may not. That is not a trivial point. With the debate at its present stage and without regulations, it is not clear whether an employer doing everything by the book and paying the national minimum wage could be sandbagged by someone else, employing the same person on a part-time basis, who would bring down the average rate of remuneration to below the average of the national minimum wage. That point requires consideration. In a Committee, the hard cases should be looked at up front and decisions must then be made.
<P>
The amendment is intended to probe, and I should like to make two more points. First, it is logically possible--and it happens--for people to be employed primarily in the United Kingdom or within the jurisdiction of this very comprehensive clause 1 and to have an overseas employer. It is not clear whether the overseas employer would be covered and, if so, how, or whether he would be excluded.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
A question also arises concerning recovery. I refer not to the normal changes resulting from business evolution or natural events, but to deliberate and conscious policy by cowboy employers. It is not difficult to change the name of a company and to become a different employer the next day. The Government owe us an explanation of what will happen if the employer changes and the first employer goes out of business. At the back of my mind is the thought that provision for redundancy normally falls on the outgoing employer and if an employer no longer exists because he has done a runner or has gone out of business, it may be possible to recover redundancy payments from a fund. I do not know whether the Government have considered whether there should be a backstop power for employees who can establish that they have been remunerated at below the national minimum wage for the relevant period, whatever that period may be, so that a payment can be made to make up the shortfall from the disappearing employer. I have not thought through the implications of that or considered who would finance it, but we must consider that example of the sort of difficulties that may arise because the matter is not simple. The devil is in the detail and in the administrability of the Bill. If a vulnerable person is done down, it is important to consider mechanisms whereby that person can be recompensed and treated fairly.
<P>
This is a probing amendment and I shall be grateful for the comments of other members of the Committee and for the Minister's response to our constructive and well-intentioned remarks.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chris Pond </B>(Gravesham): I welcome clause 1 as drafted because it provides every employee in Britain with the right to a basic national minimum wage. For almost 20 years before entering the House, I worked for the Low Pay Unit and saw the effects of poverty pay and the way in which it was promoted by those on the Conservative Benches. It created hardship and resulted directly in economic waste and business inefficiency.
<P>
Clause 1 is important because it provides a basic, universal right. That right is comprehensive and covers groups such as home workers who previously had only partial coverage under the system of wages councils, which were abolished by the previous Government. Some of the most vulnerable workers will become entitled to that basic human right. As the universal declaration on human rights states, that is a matter of basic human dignity.
<P>
There are two reasons for drafting the clause broadly. First, it provides groups such as home workers with that basic protection; it brings them into the umbrella of coverage. Along with some other hon. Members, I am grateful for the briefing provided by the national group on home working, which includes the quote from one home worker:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``It's demeaning to work for 50 pence an hour.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is even more demeaning for some of the people who came to the Low Pay Unit to tell us that they were being paid 1p for each petticoat that they sewed, or 5p for each dress--not as home workers but as inworkers in the clothing sector.
<P>
It is important in terms of justice for such people that there should be broad coverage, but it is also important in terms of the effectiveness of compliance and enforcement of the minimum wage. One of the major criticisms of the wages councils, although they were an important, basic foundation to the wages structure and did provide minimal protection to some of the very poorest, was--
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I am a little confused as to why the hon. Gentleman has risen to make the specific point about home workers in relation to the amendment. If the amendment were passed, there may be difficult consequences about which the Minister will no doubt tell us shortly, but one of the implications of the amendment's deletion of the reference to the employer would be to leave home workers in a much simpler position. Representations that I have received show that home workers are often anxious about the question of employment status, which arises at the beginning of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pond:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for that intervention because it allows me to clarify the matter. It is true that many home workers are anxious about their status. They are often treated as self-employed, when in fact they are employees and should have the right to this sort of protection.
<P>
Home workers are just one example of the groups that are covered by the national minimum wage as defined in clause 1. It is important not only to provide protection for such people, but to make sure that we have a clear statement that the minimum wage is to be paid by the employer. That helps to promote productivity and business efficiency.
<P>
One of the major arguments for a national minimum wage, in addition to the social justice arguments, is that it clearly helps to promote better productivity and use of resources, including labour. If employers are allowed to undervalue any resource in the productive process--especially labour--there will be a tendency for that resource to be undervalued. Therefore we need to place a responsibility on the employers to ensure that they observe that basic universal right. It makes good business sense as well as contributing to social justice.
<P>
Although Opposition Members are having difficulty working out how the employer would be defined, that does not appear to be a problem in any of the industrialised nations that already have a minimum wage mechanism, which includes virtually all the advanced industrialised countries.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Green:</B> I am delighted that my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry has tabled this probing amendment as it illustrates at the outset of our deliberations that the devil is in the detail of the Bill. There may be particular problems that affect not just employers generally but especially small businesses and employers.
<P>
One of the consequences of the Bill--no doubt unintended--will be to drive some employers, especially small employers, into attempting to find ways to circumvent the regulations. All hon. Members would agree that one of the advances that we have seen since the darker economic days of the 1970s is that by and large, employers, small and large, get on with the job of creating wealth and thereby creating jobs. They do not spend an excessive amount of their time attempting to deal with detailed regulations that try to tie them down. That advantage is recognised at all points of the political spectrum.
<P>
One of the Bill's effects--which the amendment illustrates--is to drive employers back to spending a disproportionate amount of time worrying about regulations. Employers at the margin--who may not be the most scrupulous--will try to find ways around the regulations. One way of doing that might be to order their affairs so that they are not regarded as employers and the people working for them--who may well be on low pay--are not regarded as employees. I hope that all hon. Members will deprecate the culture in which employers try to get around regulations and in which low pay persists unnecessarily. It is important that the amendment is placed in that context, as we have already heard the incorrect statement from a Labour Member in this morning's debate that Conservative Members are in favour of low pay or paying people less than their economic worth, and that there are many predatory Dickensian-style employers who wish to do that. That is simply not the case.
<P>
The British Chambers of Commerce puts the point very well in its evidence to the Low Pay Commission. It is important to recognise that the British Chambers of Commerce is not by and large the representative of big businesses. Its survey represents more than 2,500 businesses and nearly half the businesses it represents employ fewer than 10 people. In many cases, therefore, the companies represented are precisely those at which the amendment is aimed--especially those small companies that might be wondering about changing their status. The BCC says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Businesses recognise that a low wage policy leads to a vicious circle of low morale, low performance and low productivity.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is therefore important for us to recognise that the business organisations--the employers themselves--do not want to enter that vicious circle. The BCC goes on to say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``In an increasingly competitive labour market, where employees are mobile, and new skills are increasingly in demand, employers are responding to the need to improve working conditions.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is a clear signal that an efficiently run, internationally competitive economy can deliver precisely the kind of high and rising wage levels that the Bill seeks to deliver through unnecessary administrative means. The BCC also makes the point that employers will be faced with a range of options if the Bill is passed, all of which are unpalatable. That is why some companies at the margin might seek not to be employers any more.
<P>
The first option for employers faced with increased costs as a result of the Bill would be to employ fewer workers, thereby increasing unemployment. That is especially relevant to the amendment: if employers believe that they can avoid such an option by not being employers, they may seek to take that course of action.
<P>
The second option would be to reduce the working hours of their employees, which would be bad for employees--especially low-paid ones, who might well be pushed over a borderline into poverty--and would also have bad economic consequences. Clearly, if an employer employed the same number of workers for fewer hours, overall productivity at that company would be reduced, thus reducing the competitiveness of the economy at the margin and country's ability to generate jobs.
<P>
The third option for an employer would be to increase prices. That would have a damaging effect on the individual business and on its employees, as there would be fewer jobs available if the business became less competitive.
<P>
The fourth alternative is to reduce profits. I dare say that there was a time when Labour Members would have welcomed that as a sign that capitalist fat cats were getting away with less, but I hope that the terms of economic debate in this country have improved over the past few years so that we can all welcome high and increasing profits, both in themselves and for the wider economic benefits that they bring, not least to the work force.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The fifth option, identified not just by the British Chambers of Commerce but by other employers' organisations such as the Confederation of British Industry, is that such businesses will try to eliminate part-time workers altogether, because if part-time workers are to be granted all the privileges of full-time workers, employers may feel that they are more trouble than they are worth. That important consequence is raised by the amendment of my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry. If an employer who employs a network of part-time workers becomes responsible for paying those workers a minimum wage and, through the knock-on effect of differentials, higher wages, he may well feel that his business would no longer be economically viable in those circumstances. There would therefore be less work available for those part-time workers, some of whom might become completely unemployed. I cannot believe that the Government intend clause 1 to have such an effect, but there is a serious danger that the clause and the Bill would increase unemployment. Clearly, that would not help those at the margins of the labour market, many of whom are poorly paid--those about whom the Government say that they are particularly concerned.
<P>
The sixth and most drastic option facing an employer is to close the business. I suspect that in many cases the business would not simply be closed for good. It would be closed and re-opened under another name, turned into a partnership or the employer would become a sole trader. Various ways of stretching the rules--``fiddling'' is too strong a word--might be found by an employer in order to avoid the economic consequences of the Bill.
<P>
Another option would be for an employer to decide to close the marginal businesses within a larger company to concentrate on its core activities. Such a move, could be constructed so that the employer was no longer an employer. Again, the effect of that would be to reduce overall employment and therefore probably increase poverty.
<P>
The final option for an employer, as identified by employers' organisations, is to reduce non-wage benefits. That would be very difficult for even these massively detailed clauses to catch, but it may well be that the overall welfare of workers at the bottom end of the economic spectrum would not be improved by the Bill because their non-wage benefits would be reduced to compensate for the increase in basic pay. If their overall welfare is not improved, it makes it much less necessary to take the potentially dangerous step of introducing a minimum wage with its risk of increasing unemployment.
<P>
It is impossible for any of us to say which combination of those eight options employers will choose. We can, however, know with some certainty that some combination will be attractive to a number of employers. Because of that, the Bill may well worsen the overall welfare of the work force--in particular the welfare of those whom the Government are seeking to help. In its submission to the Low Pay Commission, the British Chambers of Commerce said that companies' reactions would depend on the level of the minimum wage, but it noted that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a group of well-known restaurants would consider closing up to 20 of its less profitable or loss making businesses if the rate were above &#163;4.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am sure that we have all seen various examples of how employers would respond in certain circumstances. As I understand it, the purpose of my hon. Friend's amendment is to make clear the basic response of many employers: simply to cease to be employers. One example, which is of great relevance in my constituency, is that of small shops. There is a feeling that the big retailers will be able to cope better with the Bill. Small shops are often one or two-person operations with an employer and one employee and will be particularly threatened if they are forced to meet onerous requirements. Clearly, the big retailing chains, which have already caused small shops lots of damage as a result of the growth of out-of-town superstores, will be better able to absorb the effects of the minimum wage. One of the responses open to small shopkeepers will be to find ways around the regulations as the amendment suggests. Another option will be to close down, which will continue the loss of village shops. That is a particular worry in my constituency, and it concerns hon. Members on both sides of the Committee.
<P>
I shall close by making the overall point that one of the dangers of the Bill--this is particularly apposite to clause 1 and the amendment--is that it will bring back a culture of trying to get around the regulations. For several decades, that culture was incredibly damaging to the British economy. I hope that the Minister can give us some reassurance that the net effect of the clause and of the Bill will not be to bring back that culture, which would take us back to some dark days.
<P>
<B>Gillian Merron </B>(Lincoln): Opposition Members have suggested that the amendment is about generously protecting the basis of the National Minimum Wage Bill. Yet we have heard damning indictment after damning indictment of the Bill's fundamental provisions.
<P>
Clause 1 is about paying workers at least the minimum wage. The Bill is about paying a national minimum wage; it is not about a minimum income from a variety of sources, which is what the amendment would leave us with.
<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry said that he and his colleagues would not seek to derail the work of the Low Pay Commission or the Bill's progress. Regrettably, however, the amendment would do both. It is not about clarifying who the employer is; it is about wrecking the Bill's fundamentals and broadening the source of remuneration.
<P>
What is a wage? That question often comes up in regard to employment legislation and it is part of the basis of the contract between employer and employee. It is dealt with under employment legislation and, if needed, the Minister will doubtlessly clarify it further.
<P>
By deleting the words in the amendment, we would add confusion, not clarity.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The hon. Lady makes an interesting argument. I agree with her point that the national minimum income is a different issue, but does she agree that my amendment does not remove the word ``remunerated''? There would, therefore , still be the concept of payment for services or employment. Our concern goes to the nature of the employer, and I look forward to the Minister's response.
<P>
<B>Gillian Merron:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for those comments, but I cannot agree that that is the point of the amendment. If we remove the words ``by his employer'', it is no longer clear where responsibility lies. It is one of the Bill's strengths that we are clear about responsibility and application.
<P>
The amendment deals with who is an employer. Many people are quite clear about who their employer is and, when they are not, they can seek to clarify that. The Low Pay Commission, which visited my constituency of Lincoln last month, is clear about who employers are. It talked to employers, employees and voluntary groups. On the same day that the Low Cost Pay Commission was in my constituency, the jobcentre advertised the following job: ``Reliable person required to work in a 42-bed nursing home; 8.45 pm to 7.30 am; preferred--previous experience; essential--own transport''--and all for &#163;3 an hour. That indicates high expectations but low wages.
<P>
For the mimimum wage to work well, it must be explained clearly, widely advertised and effectively enforced and it is the job of the Committee and many others to introduce it with care. If that is done--I believe that it will be--the national minimum wage will be largely self-enforcing. Because the rate will be national, it will be understood. Businesses in my area, as across the country, are welcoming the national minimum wage. We heard from the hon. Member for Ashford (Mr. Green) that, somehow, there will be a massive rush to duck and dive to avoid the Bill's provisions. I do not believe that that will be the case, although it is crucial to police them effectively.
<P>
Business in my constituency are welcoming a levelling of the playing field. That is particularly important to those who run businesses that rely heavily on people and have labour at the heart of their costs--the deliverers of services and goods. For many years I represented people who clean toilets in schools, care for the frail and cook for the housebound. Job after job went after company undercut company and the floor became lower in the scramble for contracts.
<P>
The minimum wage will restore sanity where there has been waste and distraction, but people must be clear about its application, who is responsible for it and the level at which it is set. The amendment pulls the rug on all those points. Indeed, it challenges the fundamental of the Bill: who else but an employer can pay a wage? It would be far more helpful to leave in the Bill the words ``by his employer''. That offers the strength and clarity to ensure that the Bill does the job that it sets out to do.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> My hon. Friends have set out the arguments behind the amendment. They are complex, indeed. I should like to make a different point in support of the amendment and pick up on points made by the hon. Member for Lincoln (Gillian Merron).
<P>
I echo the words of my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry: I am not a lawyer and I hope that you, Mrs. Dunwoody, will forgive me if I err. Under clause 2(4), the Secretary of State, on recommendations from the Low Pay Commission, will make regulations about what is and is not to be included within the definition of remuneration. However, clause 1(1) refers specifically to remuneration by the employer. That appears to preclude the Low Pay Commission--and thus the Secretary of State--from considering an important area of the remuneration of many workers in the catering industry, where tips comprise a significant part of income.
<P>
Will the Minister say whether clause 1 precludes the Secretary of State from making regulations that allow tips to be taken into account in determining whether the minimum wage has been paid? I would find it bizarre if it were determined that an employee who was earning, say, &#163;2.80 an hour at Planet Hollywood and another &#163;5 an hour in tips was being paid less than the minimum wage, even though he was taking &#163;7.80 an hour; indeed, the Inland Revenue would regard the tips as part of his remuneration on which he must pay tax. That appears to be the unintentional effect of including the reference to the employer in clause 1.
<P>
<H5>12.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Lansley </B>(South Cambridgeshire): I will not engage in rhetorical flourishes--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Oh, why not?
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I will try to speak simply to the amendment. During the debate, we have begun to expose some of the questions arising from the amendment and they will be important as we proceed with the Bill. The hon. Member for Lincoln asked what a wage was and said that an employer had to be responsible for it. In his comments immediately after, my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond) responded by asking, ``When is a wage not a wage?'' and answered, ``When it is remuneration.'' If we adopt the amendment and focus the Bill on remuneration rather than employment, we might find that it works rather better.
<P>
I want to illustrate that point by reference to some of the Bill's internal requirements, which support the view that the Government have drafted the Bill in such a way as to make employment and an employment contract the basis of clause 1. I am sure that the Minister knows this better than I do, but if we consider clause 16--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. That we will not do.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> No? Forgive me, but--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Perhaps I should explain the relationship. I am in charge of the Committee and the hon. Gentleman is a member of it. I have decided that we shall take the clauses one after another and that is the way in which we shall proceed. If the hon. Gentleman wishes to discuss another aspect of the Bill, he must wait until we get to it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Tell me if I am wrong, Mrs. Dunwoody, but let me explain why I want to refer to three other clauses. I will not talk about it at length, but clause 16 is designed to treat as an employment contract what would not be a contract between an employer and employee for the purposes of other employment legislation. Clause 31 refers to agency workers and treats as an employment contract something that does not exist. Clause 32 relates to home workers and creates an implied employment contract between home worker and person. I am finished with those clauses and will not discuss them any more. I simply wanted to illustrate, with your indulgence, Mrs. Dunwoody, that the Government have set out in clause 1 to make the employment contract the basis of the question of what is remuneration.
<P>
We are just starting our deliberations on the Bill and I want Ministers to explain why it is necessary for the employment contract to form the basis of the question of whether a national minimum wage is provided. Why can that not be decided by remuneration? We all know that the question of whether an employment contract exists--whether one is self-employed or a sole trader or whatever--is a vexed and vexatious issue for many people in relation to tax legislation and so on. The Government are now implying a contract of employment between individuals for the purposes of a national minimum wage. Many people will be unhappy that the Government have decided that they are self-employed in one context, but have employed status for the purpose of the national minimum wage.
<P>
We should set out by saying that we will deal with the matter on the basis of not the employment contract but remuneration. As my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry made clear, remuneration is not the same as income and we are not talking about a national minimum income, but national minimum remuneration. It would be perfectly possible to redraft the Bill in a simpler and more effective way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I put it to my hon. Friend that the lack of clarity in the definition of whether someone is an employee could have serious tax implications. Someone may find himself or herself defined under the clause as an employee, which would have severe tax implications--clearly there are tax advantages in being self-employed. One of the effects of the clause would be to create further confusion and difficulty for individuals, who could find not just that their status had been changed or was different in two different parts of their life, but that their taxation status had been damaged.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend. I am not a tax lawyer, so I could not begin--particularly at such short notice--to assess the possible implications of the Bill in relation to other legislation. Clause 1 and subsequent clauses seek to imply a contract between an employer--or a person--and another person for the purposes of employment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I have a brief point, supplementary to what my hon. Friend the Member for Ashford said. Does not the clause also have significant national insurance complications? I have already referred to the operation of national insurance regulations. Because they are not the same as the tax regulations--tax accrues on an annual basis, whereas national insurance is levied on the basis of weekly remuneration--there could be all manner of complications, not only in assessing what was or was not to have been paid in national insurance but also in subsequent recovery if the scheme has been badly set up.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> My hon. Friend has helpfully brought me to my final point. It seems to me that one of the things we do not know is what pay reference period the Secretary of State is likely to apply. The notes on clauses helpfully tell us that the Secretary of State might treat a week as a suitable pay reference period for a weekly paid employee and a month for a monthly paid employee.
<P>
We return to the question of the relationship between an employer and an employee--the employment contract--and the terms of that employment contract as the basis for the pay reference period. In many circumstances, the pay reference period may not be applicable because there is an ad hoc remuneration of casual workers, piecework, home work and so on, of a kind that does not fit easily into a pay reference period. In a sense, the amendment tellingly challenges the Government to say why they have chosen that path instead of the path of remuneration.
<P>
It is not our business to make a better argument for the national minimum wage for the Government, but the amendment might achieve that. The Government are setting out to create an expectation that remuneration will be at not less than a single hourly rate--not that wages will not be less than a single hourly rate, but that remuneration will not be less than that rate. We may find that by deleting the words ``by his employer'' we create the expectation that the labour component--even including self-employed persons--of itemised bills for contracted services, such as piecework or a range of other activities, will be undertaken at not less than the national minimum wage rate, rather than basing it all on an employment contract.

<B>Ms Dari Taylor </B>(Stockton, South): I am finding the debate very interesting--perhaps that is because I am a new Member of Parliament and my level of expectation is not as it should be.
<P>
I see the words ``by his employer'' in clause 1, yet I hear Opposition Members talking about the ambivalence that that use of language apparently conveys and its lack of definition. I wonder where that comes from--it seems to be more political speak than sensible speak. I say that not just because I have worked in industry for the past seven years, but because I have taken the time to speak to employers in my constituency. They have responded in writing. I have written to probably two thirds of them to date, and it is of value to point out that, while they have stated their concern about the establishment of a statutory minimum wage, none of them has expressed a sense of uncertainty about being employers, nor do they find it difficult to talk about people to whom they subcontract, and with whom they have agreements, as employers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Will the hon. Lady give way?
<P>
<B>Ms Taylor:</B> I shall not for the moment. I shall finish making my point. In my constituency, there are engineering employers who employ skilled people, and others who employ semi-skilled and unskilled workers. They are saying to me that setting the rate is crucial. They are asking how training will be accommodated and saying that it is very important. 
<P>
and saying that it is very important. More profoundly, they talk about how the industry works, how they make a profit, how they spend their time. That element is very compulsive. The employers are saying that now is a profound moment at which to start operating a level playing field: I shall not talk about rates; I shall not say that I have to take six months out of a year to talk to unions or to my constituents about rates of pay; I have not got to consider employers elsewhere in the same sector and what rates they pay; I say to myself, ``I know the rates, and I can accommodate them''--

<B>Ms Taylor:</B> I shall give way to you, but I shall make one point. While a lot of what you said will be the meat of much discussion, and while employers and the Government will examine many of your points, much of what you said exposes--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The only ``you'' in the Committee is me, and I am not making a speech on the national minimum wage, although I may have the odd word to say in certain circumstances.
<P>
<B>Ms Taylor:</B> Thank you, Mrs. Dunwoody. I am afraid that my newness does sometimes show itself rather starkly.
<P>
I was making my point passionately--I have spoken to employers, and I think that hon. Members have to cut away from political speak. This morning, the Opposition spokesman said that the Committee would hear a focused argument, in terms of sentiment and deliberation, and that it would not be in political speak but I suggest that it has been no more than that.
<P>
I shall make one more point. After having done so, I shall willingly give way. If the Committee does not accept that employers define their own status, who on earth should hon. Members ask for that definition?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I am most grateful to the hon. Lady especially for her final sentence. It is precisely because of Opposition Members' anxiety that employers might define their own status, and redesignate employees as self-employed consultants, that we tabled the amendment. The hon. Lady said that she had consulted employers. Has she sent the Bill to employers in her constituency? It focuses minds and raises issues, queries and doubts that would not otherwise arise.
<P>
<B>Ms Taylor:</B> I would not be so presumptuous as to tell employers in my constituency, who are incredibly capable people, how to run their affairs. They know how, and they have done so for many years. They have experience that would probably put the experiences of most members of the Committee into a thimble by comparison.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Will the hon. Lady give way?
<P>
<B>Ms Taylor:</B> I shall finish. The debate has focused on the question of who defines the nature of an employer. I am confident that employers will make that definition. I am also confident that although the previous Administration used political management and self-employment as a cop-out from employment responsibilities, that will not occur as a result of the Bill. My hon. Friend the Member for Lincoln made it clear that the people who are responsible must now be defined, and that it must be ensured, more especially, that they fulfil their responsibilities.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I have listened with great interest to the hon. Lady and I have two concerns. First, she simply does not understand the rationale behind our amendment and, secondly, she is somewhat confused. It is clear that she does not appreciate our rationale because she attributes unworthy motives to us. My hon. Friend the Member for Daventry tabled a sensible, probing amendment inviting the Government to explain what the words ``by his employer'' mean. The hon. Lady does not acknowledge that; she believes that there is a sinister motive behind the amendment. There is not. Of that I can assure her. There is no such sinister motive whatever.
<P>
Secondly, the hon. Lady is confused because a few moments ago, as the record will show, she observed that it was clear who the employer was and that an employer was not in any doubt that he was an employer for the purposes of the Bill. Towards the conclusion of her comment she said, in effect, ``We must decide what is to be defined as an employer.'' I do not believe that I am being simple, but--
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Ms Taylor:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman consider what I said and how I said it? I told the Committee that employers in my constituency have no problem in defining who they are and what they are. That was the statement I made to you--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> To the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
<B>Ms Taylor:</B> I am sorry, Mrs. Dunwoody. I shall get there eventually.
<P>
My concluding comment was a statement that responsibilities must often be defined visibly so that society can see that responsibilities are accepted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I am grateful for the hon. Lady's intervention, but the thickening fog has become thicker still as a result. I would that it had disappeared, but I regret that it has not.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that we have no difficulty with what the hon. Lady is saying about mainstream employers? She has obviously written to employers in her constituency and they have no difficulty in defining themselves. The problem, which will recur throughout the Bill, concerns the marginal cases--the one-man band and the person at the very margin of formal employment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Yes, I think that that is correct. Moreover, there is genuine concern about family businesses and the employer-employee relationship in that context. That is a matter to which we may legitimately turn our minds. I was mildly offended by the hon. Lady's reference to political speak, against which she inveighed. She said it was important to be practical, realistic and sensible and that we should avoid political speak. We are not engaging in derogatory political speak but legitimately examining the precise words in the Bill. We are concerned with those words and their practical implication.
<P>
With the greatest respect to the hon. Lady and the hon. Member for Lincoln, it is not good enough to be content with tautology. There is none better than that in the Bill, which includes words to the effect that an employer is someone who employs someone. We are concerned about the matter precisely because of the uncertainty about what constitutes an employee--if there is an employer, there must be an employee.
<P>
The hon. Member for Stockton, South did not respond to my question, but I am sure that it was an inadvertent omission. Did she send the Bill to the employers whom she has prayed in aid? It seems likely that she did not. She responded to me rather angrily by saying that those people were sophisticated, intelligent and probably knew a great deal more about these matters than members of the Committee do.
<P>
I was not impugning the intellectual ferocity of the employers of Stockton, South--or indeed of any other hon. Member's constituency. What I put to the hon. Lady was that if she consults in general policy terms the employers in her constituency about whether they favour a minimum wage, the level at which they want it and the exemptions that should apply, she will receive answers to those questions. If, however, she were to present the Bill to them and ask, ``Are you confident that it is water-tight? Is there any way that an employer less worthy than you could extricate himself or herself from it?'', she might receive a different response.
<P>
I agree in general terms very powerfully with my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge when he argues that in most cases it is clear who is the employer, and that the problem arises in some of the marginal cases. I am afraid to say that there is, however, another problem as well. As a result of the wording of the Bill, an employer could decide in advance of its enactment to change his or her status for the explicit purpose of evading its central provisions. I am not alleging that any employer whom the hon. Member for Stockton, South has consulted intends to do that--I am not familiar with the good burghers of her constituency, still less with the employers, and I make no such suggestion. There will, however, be some employers who want to exempt themselves from the provisions, and from--and I use the word advisedly--the burdens entailed by the Bill when it is enacted.
<P>
I should like to know, and will happily give way to the hon. Member for Stockton, South, or the hon. Member for Lincoln or anyone else who can tell me, whether there is in the Bill a foolproof guarantee that an employer who is so minded cannot operate in such a way. That is hardly the hostile attitude of someone who is seeking to obstruct the Bill, or to destroy it. It is in fact an inquiry based on an interest in discovering whether the Bill will meet its purpose or whether, because of its worrying wording, clever and shifty employers will succeed in evading its purpose.

<P>

<B>Mr. John M. Taylor </B>(Solihull): I support my hon. Friend and other Opposition Members who say that they accept that in a very high preponderance of cases, the identity of the employer and the employee will be perfectly clear, and that the relationship between them will be that of employment. When, however, he talks of the marginal cases, which I am sure Opposition Members are right to explore, is not that margin that which is known to lawyers as the difference between a contract of service and a contract for services? Is my hon. Friend referring to some employers who might quite legitimately, quite properly and with no ulterior motive, reconsider the nature of their arrangements--whether to move from a contract of service to a contract for services?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. My affection for the hon. Gentleman is undimmed, and will always, I hope, remain the same. However, like all good lawyers, he does occasionally misunderstand that in the House of Commons he is not being paid by the word. Interventions, even from so important and informed a source, must be brief.
<P>
<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> In humbling myself before that correction, my admiration for you, Mrs. Dunwoody, knows no bounds either. On this occasion, however, I am speaking without a fee at all.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> There is always hope.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I have also to declare an interest of sorts. Before that arouses the suspicion of Labour Members, I should like to make it clear that it is not a pecuniary interest, but what might be described as a potential, which might become an actual, family interest in the subject of the minimum wage.
<P>
My mother--obviously I regard my mother as the litmus test of sensible opinion on most matters most of the time--is currently a full-time, mature student. I hope that she will not take action against me if I observe that she is also a mature student of advancing years. I hope that she will graduate next summer.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I think the hon. Gentleman means that she is of a certain maturity.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I defer to you, Mrs. Dunwoody, in this matter. I have made no comparison--it would be most improper to do so--between my mother's age, Mrs. Dunwoody, and your own. I would not seek to do that.
<P>
My mother might seek to re-enter the employment market after her graduation from university next summer. In those circumstances, the point that I raised about the definition of an employer and the potential for an employer to use the Bill's wording to extricate himself from its effects is of direct concern to her, and I shall happily explain why. If she undertakes work on an ad hoc basis for a number of different people, at different times and with no written contract of employment, is it not possible that one or other of the people who use her services--I use the expression advisedly--might decide either that he does not wish to be considered her employer, or that he has never really been her employer. He might then decide to instruct her that her status is changed. In those circumstances, she might cease--having previously been eligible--to be eligible for the national minimum wage.
<P>
A serious point is therefore at stake. I do not deny the principled commitment of Labour Members to the concept of a minimum wage. I put it to them, however, that that is not sufficient; it is necessary in this Committee to justify the particular wording used. The hon. Member for Stockton, South inveighed against political speak but, if I may say so, Labour Members are relying on their political conviction that a minimum wage is a good thing. It is necessary, however, for the wording of the Bill to be accurate.
<P>
<B>Ms Dari Taylor:</B> I have listened with great care, and I will make no comments about what I thought might be the hon. Gentleman's agist remarks. I will resist that temptation. I am concerned, however, about the references that have been made in this Committee to clever and shifty employers. If I am to believe that that is not political speak, I think that it would be appropriate if I were to receive a list of such clever and shifty employers. If such a list does not exist, how can I be convinced that such employers are active in Great Britain today?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I blame myself, Mrs. Dunwoody. I gave way generously to the hon. Lady, as she gave way to me, in the hope that a profound point would be made. Sadly, I was to be disappointed. I never thought that the day would come when a Labour Member with a great expression of sincerity on her face would enjoin a Conservative Member to name unscrupulous employers. If the inference is that the hon. Lady is not convinced of the existence of such employers, that is the most eloquent testimony imaginable to the onward march of new Labour.
<P>
<B>Ms Taylor:</B> I ask the hon. Gentleman simply to name those employers. It is important for us to grapple with realities.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I am most grateful for the request. I do not recall precisely the relationship that I enjoyed in the summer break when I was at university with someone for whom I worked briefly. I cannot recall whether it would have constituted an employer-employee relationship. Moreover, I have not taken any legal advice on this point. While I understand the hon. Lady's desire to get to the heart of the matter, it would be quite wrong--and most imprudent--to start naming names. It suffices to say that there will be general agreement that there could be abuse.
<P>
I wish briefly to move on to the question of tips--
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Has my hon. Friend considered another point raised by the hon. Member for Stockton, South. The employers in her constituency wrote back to say that they were quite happy with the Bill as it created a level playing field. With his distinguished knowledge of economics, my hon. Friend will recognise a barrier to entry when he sees one. Does he think it likely that existing firms will be happy about the creation of any barriers to the entry of new firms, precisely because it gives them an advantage?
<P>
It being One o'clock, The Chairman adjourned the Committee without Question put, pursuant to the Standing Order.
<P>
Adjourned till Thursday 15 January at half-past Ten o'clock.
