<H4><center>[Mr. John Maxton in the Chair]</center></H4>
<H3><center><A href="/pa/cm199900/cmbills/054/2000054.htm">Postal Services Bill</a></center></H3>
<H4><center>Clause 6</center></H4>
<H4><center>Restriction on provision of postal services</center></H4>
<P>
<H5>9 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Duncan </B>(Rutland and Melton): This is a unique opportunity to point out the sad and lamentable absence of the Minister, at whose form I normally look at this time in the morning with such pleasure. Lo and behold, as a postman, he knows that sometimes things are delivered late. There was no stamp on his back saying ``Guaranteed this day delivery''. The system has failed. We know what a shambles the Department of Trade and Industry is in.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lindsay Hoyle </B>(Chorley): Obviously, the hon. Gentleman was not aware that there was a second delivery today.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> The Minister is beautifully wrapped in his Armani suit with string around him that is of the highest quality, but I will give him the name of my tailor later.
<P>
Perhaps we can now devote a bit of attention to clause 6. We understand that the clause is setting the parameters of restrictions on the provision of postal services. In the sense that the reserved area is defined in this clause, there is an arbitrary limit below which no one may compete. It is set at the moment at £1, although we know how ambivalent the Government are about whether that should be £1 or 50p. Anyone found to be in breach of that licensed area restriction would be subject to a fine. We understand the purpose and the practice of the definition, as there is a price to pay for preserving the universal service obligation and the ability to deliver a letter to all the far-flung corners of the United Kingdom. We understand the purpose of the Bill. We accept its content, but there are various issues to which we shall be devoting some attention later.
<P>
<B>The Minister for Competitiveness (Mr. Alan Johnson):</B> I apologise for my late arrival. I remind hon. Members that the service standard advertised to the public is delivery by 9.30, but it was remiss of me to be late. I was in deep consultation with my officials. I am pleased to hear the comments of the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton (Mr. Duncan) about the need for the clause to protect the reserved area, which is the primary duty of the commission under clause 3. It cannot be in doubt. It is also important to retain the civil and criminal proceedings in order to protect the reserved area, although it should be pointed out that criminal proceedings are a deterrent, and we hope that any breaches can be dealt with under civil law.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 6 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 7</center></H4>
<H4><center>Exceptions from section 6</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Brian Cotter </B>(Weston-super-Mare): I beg to move amendment No. 113, in page 4, line 36, leave out `£1' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`50p'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss amendment No. 114, in page 4, line 38, leave out `350' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`200'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Cotter:</B> I, too, prefer keeping to the second delivery stage—9.30 at the earliest—because I improve as the day goes on. Amendments Nos. 113 and 114 are an attempt to find out from the Minister why the lower boundaries for licences are set at £1 and 350 g. We want the Minister to respond to our proposal for a lower limit for the issuing of licences, and we look forward to his comments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> The amendments contain measures that the Government would like to take, but do not have the courage to take. If we are in any doubt about that, we need only look at their laying of a statutory instrument on the matter, only to seek its annulment once it had been laid—I imagine as a result of pressure from the unions or from one of the Minister's old chums. The amendments tabled by the Liberal Democrats merely echo Government policy. The Government may not have made a pledge about that, but it is clearly an aspiration. Indeed, it is an aspiration that they said had already been met.
<P>
I have in front of me—I am grateful to the Minister for sending it to me; it was courteous of him—the facsimile of an advertisement placed by the Government in The Sunday Times of 16 September 1999 for the post of chairman of the Postal Services Commission. The copy that I have even specifies that the advertisement was 170mm high and 170mm wide. So proud were the Government of their achievement in creating the commission and of their wish to appoint a chairman, that they placed an extra big box in The Sunday Times to advertise the vacancy.
<P>
In the text of the advertisement, the Minister very boldly—he may come to regret the words—said that the Government
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>is granting the Post Office greater commercial freedom but is convinced that successful reform requires more than this. It requires greater competition in the postal market; already a major first step towards liberalisation has been taken with the halving of the monopoly currently enjoyed by the Post Office to 50p from 1 April 2000.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
So there we have it. The Government paid to publish a text that claims credit for greater liberalisation—exactly matching the proposal of the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare in his amendment.
<P>
So the Government want liberalisation, the Liberal Democrats want liberalisation and the Conservatives also want liberalisation. However, on 8 December last year the Government tabled a motion to revoke the statutory instrument that they had laid before the House in October and my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) had to speak on the Floor of the House to protest against the Government having revoked their own policy. We heard no argument that a small detail needed to be altered or that some massive change had occurred that required or justified that complete change of Government policy. The Government promulgated the policy, advertised that they had done it, laid a statutory instrument before the House to effect it, and then, a matter of weeks later, stood up and said, ``Sorry, guv, it's no longer acceptable''. Perhaps the original motion had been delivered to the wrong address. I am not just having fun with the complete shambles that is becoming the hallmark of the DTI. It is also important to point out the inconsistency of the Government's serious attempts to liberalise postal services in the UK.
<P>
The Government have said that reducing the price of the monopoly on postal items from £1 to 50p is essential to the process of the liberalisation that they want to champion. Indeed, the quid pro quo for liberalising the Post Office monopoly and expecting other competitors properly to perform within the sector is a narrower monopoly, confined to items of 50p or less.
<P>
What pressure did the Government bow to when they decided to throw away part of the picture of Post Office liberalisation? The Government introduced the Bill without considering the other side of the equation, namely, how to put it into effect. They are in a bit of a mess; it is a perfect example of their saying one thing and doing another. They said that they wanted to liberalise the postal delivery market, but the reality is a continuation of the status quo.
<P>
The annulment of a statutory instrument was designed to help new Labour to stand up to old Labour and day by day the fragile coalition behind the Prime Minister divides into two categories—the old rebels and the new robots. We are seeing the Labour party's policy on this issue, as on many others, crumble. I want a convincing explanation of why the Government did not stick with their original intention, of which they seemed to be so proud, to reduce the limit from £1 to 50p.
<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Johnson:</B> This is a mischievous amendment. The hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare seemed seriously to suggest that the Liberal Democrats wanted to reduce the monopoly limit from £1 to 50p; but in the debate on 8 December, after the revocation of the order, they trooped through the Division Lobby to vote in favour of the monopoly limit staying at £1. I am curious to know why, only three months later in Committee, they suggest that it should be reduced to 50p.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tony Baldry </B>(Banbury): Earlier, I explored the reasons why the Liberals had anything to do with the Labour party. Has the Labour party now realised that they are just a bunch of mischievous troublemakers? Why do the Labour Government have any truck with the Liberal party?
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> I shall seriously consider that point over lunch; perhaps I shall have a different approach this afternoon.
<P>
There is something rather sad about the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton scouring the situations vacant pages of The Sunday Times and coming up with a quote. He should have looked not at that newspaper but at the White Paper published last July. The Government's view then was clear that we should reduce the monopoly level before we set up the Postal Services Commission. The hon. Gentleman asked for a clear explanation of why we changed our mind. He asked who put pressure on us; who took us down to the torture chamber and put the thumbscrews on us.
<P>
There are three members of the Select Committee on Trade and Industry on the Committee, one of whom—the hon. Member for Banbury (Mr. Baldry)—has just left the Room. The eloquent and persuasive cross-party argument advanced in the Trade and Industry Committee's report, published on 14 September 1999, was that having decided to set up a regulator, having given that regulator the power to set limits to the reserved area, and the duty to police the area and to protect the universal service obligation, it would be wrong to reduce the reserved area on 1 April 2000, at the same time as the commission took up its role. That was a very persuasive argument; once the toothpaste is out of the tube, it cannot be put back. If the monopoly limit is reduced to 50p and on taking up its duties the commission says that the limit will jeopardise the universal service obligation, all those who legitimately set up companies with a 51p tariff would suddenly be declared illegal, which would be wrong. The views of the Select Committee on Trade and Industry were persuasive, so we decided to revoke the statutory instrument. A debate took place in Parliament, in which it was decided that our arguments were persuasive, and the Liberal Democrats followed us through the Lobby on the issue.
<P>
<H5>9.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The amendments are not entirely consistent with the Government's proposals. The Liberal Democrats, in their endearing way, have managed to botch it. They suggest a weight limit of 200 g. They must have read the wrong column in the postal services guide. We suggested that there should be a reduction to 50p and 150 g. I do not know where the figure of 200 g came from, but it is inconsistent with the order that was laid before the House last July. This is a rerun of an argument that we had on the Floor of the House on 8 December. We make no apology for being persuaded by organisations and groups such as the Trade and Industry Committee.
<P>
The Opposition argue that we say one thing and do another. I point out once more that the Conservative party's 1992 election manifesto—the last election that it won and probably the last that it will win for many a year—stated that as well as setting up an independent regulator for postal services a Conservative Government would reduce the monopoly limit to closer to the price of a first-class stamp. That was a clear commitment. There was nothing in the commitment; one could hold it up to the light and sprinkle it with rose-water, but find no reference to privatising the Post Office. However, having been elected in 1992, the Conservative Government tried to do that. What they did not do in all their five years in office was attempt to reduce the monopoly limit to closer to the price of a first-class stamp.
<P>
It is ironic that the Conservatives now accuse us of saying one thing and doing another. We have been completely open. We believed last July that it was right to reduce the monopoly limit to that level. Having been persuaded by the arguments made by the Trade and Industry Committee, we have now decided that it will be a matter for the commission alone, in its own good time and using all the evidence that it can accrue, to decide where the monopoly level should be set. It would be wrong for this Committee to do that in advance of the commission's deliberations. The Liberal Democrats, having voted against the proposal on the Floor of the House, have shown inconsistency with a capital I by suggesting that the Committee should do so.

<P>

<B>Mr. Cotter:</B> I feel extremely hurt at the suggestion that the Liberal Democrats are ever mischievous. Perish the thought. I am also upset that I introduced the amendment briefly and did not elaborate like the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton, who starts the day off extremely well but, as it wears on—[HON. MEMBERS: ``Deteriorates.''] No comment. The Minister may call it mischievous, but I call it probing, to discover where the Government are at this stage. I accept that, as the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton pointed out, the advertisement for the chairman of the Post Office Services Commission referred clearly to 50p. The commission plans to look into what the levy is to be and will come back to us. The Minister was right to say that we, as he did, accepted the arguments that were put before the House. I am glad that he has reiterated the position. On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

</FONT>Question accordingly negatived.
<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Johnson:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 95, in page 5, line 1, leave out from `letter' to end of line 2.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take government amendment No. 96.
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> This liberalising amendment is the first of a number of technical amendments tabled to clause 7. These clarifications relate to clause 7(2)(d) concerning outward-bound overseas letters. The wording of the Bill follows that used in section 67 of the British Telecommunications Act 1981. However, practice in the market has, over time, moved ahead of the legal definition and for practical purposes the Post Office regards all outward-bound overseas letters as being outside its monopoly, whether transported by air—the only reference in the existing legislation that is copied into the Bill as it stands—sea or Eurotunnel. We do not wish the exception to be narrower than current practice allows and nor would the Post Office or its overseas competitors.
<P>
In summary, outbound cross-border mail is now in effect outside the monopoly. In 1981 that related only to messages sent by aircraft or messenger. It now relates to any mail that goes abroad, whether by ship, aircraft or Eurotunnel, and we want to reflect the existing arrangement in the Bill, rather than carry in the 1981 Act.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> I think that I agree with the Minister on this. I have had a brief from the Association of International Courier and Express Services, which the Minister will know. Comparing it with the Bill, I think that the association has misunderstood the intent of the Minister's amendment. He said specifically that the conveyance of an overseas letter is outside the monopoly area. The briefing that I have received to put before the Committee essentially argues that outbound mail has effectively been liberalised for years. The association's concern was that the Bill would bring it into the monopolised area, whereas it does the opposite. There seems to have been a misunderstanding on the association's part, unless I am being particularly silly about what it says. Comparing my reading of the Bill with what I believe to be the association's argument, I have concluded that the proposals are consistent with the wishes of the AICES, and therefore we have no objection. Under an existing EU postal services directive it would in any case be unlawful to reserve cross-border mail that has been liberalised in this way, and any remonopolisation would be illegal under EU law. The Minister's attempt at precise consistency with existing practice and law is sensible and we support it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Johnson:</B> The AICES has misunderstood the situation. There is a difference between inward cross-border international mail and outward cross-border mail. Under the amendment, one of the exceptions to the reserved area under clause 7 would be
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the conveyance of an overseas letter out of the United Kingdom.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Reference to an aircraft would be removed, because the conveyance of such letters could be by any means. The precise aim the AICES will be met by the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> I am brainstorming a little, but will the provision cover the amount paid for the electronic transmission of a letter?
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> The clause would refer to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the conveyance of an overseas letter out of the United Kingdom.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> In considering the definition of conveyance, we could be in new legal territory. Does conveyance have to mean something that is physically lifted, transported and delivered or can it be transmission by electronic means, which is conveyance of a message in the usual way from the point of view of the sender or the recipient?
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> I am not sure, but we do not have to worry about that under the clause. We are concerned with the conveyance of physical mail. Electronic mail is not covered by the clause. We are liberalising the market for physical mail and doing what the AICES wants us to do.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Amendment made: No. 96, in page 5, line 3, leave out
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`by means of that aircraft—[Mr. Alan Johnson.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 97, in page 5, leave out lines 37 to 39 and insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) the conveyance of letters between document exchange facilities by persons who are not members of the document exchange concerned, and the collection and delivery by such persons for that purpose of letters delivered to such facilities for exchange within the document exchange,'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Governments amendments Nos. 103 and 104.
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> We have a general policy of replacing the current regime with a system of licences under which anyone who operates within the reserved area needs a licence. Anyone who operates outside the reserved area who currently needs class licences will not need them any more. The clause specifies where people can operate within the monopoly area and not breach the law. We have suggested a definition of document exchange centres. They were introduced under the British Telecommunications Act 1981 as an exception to the monopoly area, but, after further consideration, it is necessary to amend the wording of the exception and the definition.
<P>
Document exchange is a system used by many professionals, especially lawyers and insurers, to exchange documents with other members of a document exchange A document exchange operator provides facilities for the exchange of documents, including the transportation between document exchange facilities. It is not intended that the system should offer door-to-door delivery. The system originated in provincial towns and around the Inns of Court to enable local lawyers and other professionals to have a pigeon hole system to exchange documents without relying on the postal system. Such centres exist elsewhere in Europe, but almost uniquely in the United Kingdom the document exchange system has become more sophisticated and now includes collection and delivery between document exchange by third parties.
<P>
For example, a solicitor in London can take material to the document exchange of which he is a member, which can then be transported to a document exchange in Liverpool for collection by a solicitor. The intention is not to permit end-to-end delivery and provide a potential viable alternative postal system to that of the licensed universal service provider outside the scope of the licensed area. Members must go to their own document exchange to drop off and collect mail. Document exchange is at present covered by licences in the United Kingdom. As the Committee knows, we are not planning to continue the use of class licences. The Postal services directive also deals with document exchange centres, requiring that they should not fall within the reserved area. That is why it is set out in the Bill as one of the exceptions to clause 6.
<P>
The reason why we seek to clarify the wording is that there has been difficulty with sham document exchanges being set up in an attempt to undermine the monopoly—for example, by creating a document exchange with a single member that is then serviced by a document exchange operator. It ends up as a door-to-door delivery within major cities in direct contravention of the reserved area and makes end-to-end delivery possible.
<P>
While it is recognised that it is extremely difficult to prevent abuse of the exceptions in clause 7, the amendments would limit the possibility of widespread abuse of the document exchange exception that could undermine the universal service.
<P>
<H5>9.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> I seek some clarification from the Minister, to ensure that existing legitimate practices are not unfairly caught up in an amendment the purpose of which we can understand. I take as an example a matter with which I am familiar, but the hon. Member for Chorley (Mr. Hoyle) will be less so. The internal mail system of Oxford university, strictly speaking, does not include a document exchange. It is a well-established intra-university mail system. It involves pigeonholes and people who work for the colleges going round on bicycles, moving mail from one college to another or between university departments. At the moment, there is no charge per individual item, but it is possible that in future, depending on how the legislation is structured or whether universities suffer Government cuts and need to claw back some money, there might be a notional charge. A university system will not charge 26p or 23p for an item to go half a mile down the road. Students would expect that a message to their tutor, saying, ``I'm terribly sorry, I've got a hangover; I can't make my tutorial'', would get there and cost only 10p. Whether it is 5p or 10p, the university network has an internal mail system, not a document exchange facility as defined in amendment No. 97. It is a legitimate practice that can hardly be described as challenging the postal monopoly or the reserved area.
<P>
We must ensure that if St. John's college, Oxford, not only my alma mater but that of the Prime Minister, whom the Minister serves so efficiently, wanted to send comments to Brasenose college, or if Cambridge university—poor, secondary organisation that it is—wished to do the same, it should not fall foul of the legislation. Clearly, that would be as absurd as the museum that reproduces first world war items for school kids and wants to sell them in pounds and ounces for pounds, shillings and pence being forbidden to do so by an EU directive. It is a nonsense.
<P>
No such nonsense should stop a legitimate internal mail mechanism, on which a notional charge might be levied on individual letter items, being operated. I seek an assurance from the Minister that what is being designed for the big, wide world will not adversely affect sensible arrangements that exist now or in future for internal systems.

<br>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Alan Johnson:</B> I can give that assurance. The provision is not designed to apply to internal mail systems. A series of exceptions is listed in clause 7. If, as the hon. Gentleman described, a charge were levied on a system that at present did not include a charge, that would have to comply with other parts of the clause. However, an internal system in a company or organisation is covered by clause 7(2)(i), which says that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the conveyance and delivery of letters by a person who has a business interest in those letters, and the collection of letters for that purpose<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
does not contravene clause 6(1). ``Business interest'' would include the interests of a university.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> That last sentence may have given me the assurance that I seek. I do not think that an intracollegiate mail system is a business interest, and according to the letter of the law, it would not appear to be one. However, if the Minister says that such a system would count as a business interest in an academic institution such as I have described, I am satisfied. I hope that any ridiculous challenge will be pre-empted. For instance, a new licence holder in the Oxfordshire area, as well as an existing monopoly, could make a challenge. The Minister's assurance would make all the difference; if he could make it absolutely specific, I would be happy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> I have no problem with the mail system in Oxford university that the hon. Gentleman described. My concern is only with the situation that he described, in which the university might introduce a charge. If that was done, the university would have to be careful. That is nothing to do with document exchange centres, which I will deal with shortly, because it would not breach any other part of clause 7. Nothing in the amendment will change the right of companies, universities, the Houses of Parliament and so on to have an internal mail distribution centre.
<P>
I will clarify what I said earlier about document exchange centres, because I would like to set the record straight. They were not an exception to the monopoly in the 1981 Act, but were dealt with by the Secretary of State in a class licence made under provisions in that Act.
<P>
Hon. Members need have no concerns about the amendment as it relates to document exchange centres. The biggest document exchange centre, Hays falls within the amendment's scope. People in that centre are as concerned as we are about sham document exchange centres, which use that disguise to provide a door-to-door delivery service and breach the monopoly. The amendment tightens up the wording and ensures that such breaches will not occur, although we cannot be 100 per cent. sure about that.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 98, in (page 5, line 39, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) the conveyance and delivery of brokers' research, during the relevant period and by any person who has printed it, from the business premises where it is printed to the premises of any person who is to convey it onwards,
<P>
( ) the conveyance and delivery by any person of brokers' research within the period of 24 hours starting with its delivery to his premises or its collection by him during the relevant period from a collection point, and any such collection.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we will take Government amendments Nos. 101, 102, 106 and 107.
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> I do not want to keep everyone awake for another hour, but I need to explain the rather esoteric topic of brokers' research. I hope that we do not need to go into the details, but as hon. Members are aware from the explanatory notes and our discussions, our policy is to replace the present system for defining activities that do not infringe the Post Office's exclusive privilege. At present, class licences and exemptions are used. In future, we will not use class licences that permit all persons to perform a class of activity. All exemptions will be provided for in legislation, and Parliament will have the opportunity to consider any changes to them.
<P>
Brokers' research is time-sensitive research used by traders in stocks, shares, foreign exchange and similar items. A licence in relation to brokers' research was granted to a single company, Deltec, to operate in the monopoly area. That was a niche licence; class licences cover document exchange centres. As far as we know, that is the only niche licence in relation to just one operator. However, we are aware of several companies that want to offer a similar service and we have been considering whether it would be more appropriate to make brokers' research the subject of a class licence under current legislation. Under the Bill, we are moving away from class licences, so it is appropriate for that activity to be added to the exceptions in clause 7.
<P>
To ensure that we do not create too wide an exemption to the licensed area, the definition of brokers' research in the Bill specifies the type of material that may be conveyed, and the times between which it can be conveyed. Again, that ensures that we do not have a sham brokers' research centre, which is set up only to breach the monopoly.
<P>
This is a liberalising amendment. Currently, only one company operates under a niche licence, but five or six others want to enter the market. That would not breach the principles of the monopoly and should therefore be set out as an exemption.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 100 and 105.
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> The amendment clarifies the definition of ``bank'' used in clause 7 and thus the scope of the exemption relating to the conveyance and delivery of banking instruments in clause 7(2)(j). The amendment adds two technical clarifications to the existing definition, so that it covers all organisations that deal with banking instruments, as defined in the clause.
<P>
First, the definition of ``bank'' will be extended to include building societies. There have been several changes in the banking market since 1981, when the exemption in the British Telecommunications Act 1981—on which the exemption in clause 7(2)(j) is modelled—was drafted. Building societies are in direct competition with banks, and our change will place them on an equal footing in this area.
<P>
Secondly, the exemption will cover European authorised institutions that have lawfully established a branch to accept deposits in the UK. That is in line with their single market rights, which were extended by the Banking Co-ordination (Second Council Directive) Regulations 1992. The amendment provides for the continuation of the existing exemption.
<P>
Our amendments also extend the definitions to reflect the situation that exists in practice, which the Government want to preserve. The Post Office regards the definition of ``bank'' as applying to central banks of member states of the European Economic Area, rather than only to those of the European Community. That means that Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein are included.
<P>
The definition of ``bank'' has been lifted from the 1981 Act. However, there have been many changes in banking since then—not least in the position of building societies—and we want to reflect those accurately in legislation, hence the need for the amendments.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.

Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> I reiterate the point that we made earlier: if there is to be genuine liberalisation, one should consider not only the structure of the reserved area and people's ability to seek a licence to compete therein, but the ceiling on the value and weight of reserved items. Competition will cause prices to fall, and the sector is more efficient, so I regret that the Bill specifies £1 rather than 50p. I accept that there is provision for amending that, which we shall discuss shortly, but I hope that, in due course, there will be a freer sector with more competition and a smaller reserved area.
<P>
<H5>9.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
In the telecommunications industry there is competition, and that is creating massive benefits. I accept that there may need to be more protection in relation to the physical delivery of letters, because there will be technological competition as well as the physical challenge of delivering to outlying areas. However, the Government wanted to reduce the level to 50p—although, in fact, they did not do so—and, as many people are saying, competition will give rise to all sorts of new products, opportunities and business methods, so the reduction should be made in due course. If the Bill is enacted, the Minister should keep alive his interest in reducing the price from £1 to 50p, so that there can be the most lively and fruitful competition possible in the sector, to the benefit of all consumers.

<P>

<B>Mr. Cotter:</B> I am pleased that we have debated the proposed amendments to the clause. The Government are making a number of technical additions to the clause, for which the Minister has provided clear justification. I am also pleased that the £1 rate remains in place for the time being, although there had been some uncertainty about that earlier, and that the commission will consider the matter, thus ensuring that there is no uncertainty. On that basis, I look forward to the Minister's summing up.
<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Johnson:</B> I reiterate that the Government think that ours is the right approach. It is not a question of where I think that the monopoly level should be, or of my continuing what the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton called my interest in reducing that level. The point is that we shall hand the matter to the independent regulators. We want them to consider, as an absolute priority—their first job of work—the first stage of a reduction in the monopoly level, and whether there are any grounds for it. After that first step, they should consider what other steps could be taken. We believe that competition is very important, and that a reduction would encourage competition, to the consumer's benefit. However, the point of the reserved area is to ensure that people do not cream-skim, making it impossible for the Post Office to fulfil its obligation to deliver six days a week to all 27 million addresses in the country at a single uniform tariff.
<P>
The public are not interested in monopolies or reserved areas: they are interested in a universal service at a uniform tariff. That has long been cherished, and long may it continue. Unquestionably, the commission will consider the level of the reserved area as a matter of urgency. The acceptance of the recommendation of the Select Committee on Trade and Industry will cause a delay, but not a huge one. It is right that the commission should do a proper job, and this is by far the best way to do it.
<P>
I would say to the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton that the monopoly level has been set at £1 for nineteen years—we can wait just a little longer. I repeat that the honourable Gentleman's party did not act to reduce the reserved area when in government, despite a manifesto commitment. The current Government will act, but in the proper format, with an independent regulator whose principal duty is to protect the universal service at a uniform tariff.

<P>
Government amendments Nos. 110 and 111.
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> This is a small technical amendment designed to avoid any doubt by clarifying the Government's intention that the Postal Services Commission should consult that body and those persons before making a recommendation to the Secretary of State about a modification of clause 7. Given the possible significance of the changes to clause 7 that might be made under clause 8, we believe that the commission should consult the main players with am interest in such matters, before making that recommendation. That does not commit the commission to following the opinion of those players, but it gives them a chance to air their views.
<P>
With this amendment, we restore our inconsistent harmony with the Liberal Democrats. They have tabled amendment No. 115, which rightly suggests that the commission consult the council. However, their amendment does not go as far as ours, which extends the consultation to
<P>

<B>Mr. Cotter:</B> I am pleased to see amendment No. l09. It takes on board our point about the council, and adds two more categories, strengthening the consultation that is required. In view of the key debate that we had under clause 7, I am delighted to see that the council has been included, and that other people have been added to that consultation process. That is a worthwhile step forward.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> We have now amended the clause, but there is still scope in it for a contradiction of what the Minister said earlier. He made it clear that he was passing to the commission the responsibility to decide whether to reduce the monopoly price from £1 to 50p, and to take other decisions of that sort. He said that he wanted to keep Ministers out of that decision-making process. However, there is still scope under subsection (3) for the Secretary of State to intervene; he could refuse to accept a recommendation from the commission to reduce the sum from £1 to 50p, for example.
<P>
The clause still gives the Minister the opportunity to be quite political. We have already seen that happen once. The Government have not given us a convincing explanation for backing off from their original decision to reduce the sum from £1 to 50p. Not only did they advertise the fact that they would do it, but they did in fact do it—as we have already discussed. They laid a statutory instrument and then sought to annul it. If the Minister's most convincing argument is that the Government will not take that decision because they want the commission to do so, that sits uncomfortably with clause 8(3), which gives ample scope to the Secretary of State not to endorse its decision. He has an open opportunity for a veto, but it is not made clear why he might use it. The only grounds that I can envisage are the political ones that have been acted out over the past few months on the Floor of the House.
<P>
I want a proper understanding of why the Secretary of State, having allowed the decision to be contracted out, wants to retain the right to refuse to let it be taken. That will allow me to decide whether the clause is of any use. He is giving with one hand and taking away with the other. He trusts the commission with wonderful powers and proper equipment to take the decision. Why does he think that he can second guess it and take a better decision, unless there is a Government with a tiny majority, a few rebels and insufficient robots in the House to pass the statutory instrument? In that situation, he may want to use the power for blatant political interference in the wishes of the body that he has equipped to take the decision competently.
<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Johnson:</B> It is right that Parliament has a role to play. The clause is necessary. Subsection (2) makes it clear that no order to reduce the monopoly—which is the example being used—should be made except on the commission's recommendation. The subsection ensures that the decision will not be made on the recommendation of the Secretary of State, the Post Office or the licence holders. Only the commission will be able to recommend a modification to clause 7.
<P>
Subsection (3) states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Where the Commission makes such a recommendation but the Secretary of State decides not to make such an order,<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
he will have to explain why in a report to Parliament. I cannot think of an example of when the Secretary of State would decide not to follow a PSC recommendation, but he would be obliged to give reasons before both Houses of Parliament if he did.
<P>
It is not consistent to argue that we have backed off. The lily-livered, pseudo-liberalising Opposition did nothing about the monopoly limit for 19 years, despite a manifesto commitment. We allowed Parliament to take a decision to revoke the order so that we could leave the decision to the commission. Under the Bill, the commission will have sole authority to make recommendations on the reserved area.
<P>
On an issue as important as the perceived threat to the uniform tariff and universal service of the Post Office, the public would expect there to be a parliamentary backstop. If the elected representatives of the people believe, for whatever reason, that the commission has made a mistake and that universal service will be jeopardised, they should have the power to go before both Houses of Parliament and explain. That is the only reason for the clause. Future Governments of any political persuasion will believe that it is important to protect a service greatly cherished by the public.

Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> I rise to compare clauses 9 and 10 and to ascertain why separate powers are necessary. One is a general power to suspend the restriction, and the other is an emergency power. I understand the emergency power. If we are afflicted by pestilence, plague or war, the distribution of post must continue, and special arrangements may be put in place to overcome a peculiar and unfortunate state of affairs. I imagine that if fires are blazing and bombs are falling, dramatic measures will be necessary. We shall discuss clause 10 in a moment, but the two go hand in hand. If the Queen's peace ensues and all is happy in the land, in what circumstances might a suspension under clause 9 be necessary or justified?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Alan Johnson:</B> Three clauses modify clause 7. Clauses 8 and 9 are linked. The logical sequence is clause 8, under which the commission makes a recommendation to modify clause 7 and the reserved area, followed by clause 9, which allows the Secretary of State to implement that recommendation on much wider grounds than under clause 10, which relates to a temporary suspension in an emergency.
<P>
Clause 9 allows an order to be made to suspend the operation of clause 6, but it is linked to clause 8 in that no such order would be made except on the commission's recommendation that a reserved area is no longer necessary. In other debates, we discussed a possible future outcome in which a reserved area is unnecessary and the market can be completely liberalised. However, a universal service obligation would still be necessary, and we made amendments to that effect. The clause provides for circumstances in which the commission decides that a reserved area is unnecessary. Clause 9 allows the Secretary of State to implement that recommendation. Clause 10 relates only to emergencies.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> I understand that clauses 8, 9 and 10 rise by degrees, but might a suspension made under clause 9 be permanent? What would the terms of the order be? Would the suspension have a time limit, or, would it, like the emergency powers, be for six months? Would it be renewable? Clause 10 provides an emergency power that can last six months, but clause 9 seems to provide an open-ended power to suspend, perhaps permanently, as though following such an order the Bill would lie dormant, perhaps to be revived in 100 years' time.
<P>
I should like the Minister to give us a clearer picture of the mechanism through which a suspension might be imposed. Would such a suspension have a time limit? Would it have an alarm built in to trigger reconsideration? Would a permanent suspension be effected only by reconsidering and amending the Bill through the Postal Services Act 2000 (Amendment) Bill to revoke clause 8 to allow such a suspension:
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> Under the clause, the restriction in clause 6 may be suspended indefinitely. Under the European directive on postal services, the reserved area can be maintained only to the extent that it is necessary to ensure the provision of a universal service. Before making recommendations, the PSC would have to consider carefully whether a reserved area was necessary to maintain a universal service at a uniform tariff. Potentially, the PSC could find a solution in future if it considered that it should recommend that the licensed area be suspended indefinitely. Clause 9 covers that possible scenario. A licensed area could be suspended indefinitely, but the PSC could recommend suspension only if it were satisfied that the universal service could be maintained. That function of the commission is subject to the duty in clause 3 as are all its other functions.
<P>
Were the PSC ever to recommend the suspension of the licensed area, the Secretary of State would have to make the appropriate order; the whole postal market would be liberalised and the licensing regime established by the Bill would be suspended. Accepting that clause 9 should stand part of the Bill would allow that.

<H4><center>Licences: general</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 112, in page 7, line 28, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(5) A licence holder shall have no exemption from traffic regulations.'.
<P>
</UL></FONT>I seek here to promote an understanding in the Committee of what equity there will be in the way in which the existing Post Office and future licence holders can conduct their business. At present, legally, the Royal Mail has no special exemption from traffic restrictions. Although in urban areas—and, I am sorry to say, even in the rural idyll of Rutland—traffic wardens are becoming slightly more aggressive, when a beautifully driven red van stops by the pavement, the driver nips into a property to deliver a package and then hops back into the van, a warden will probably turn a blind eye. There is seldom a risk of fisticuffs when a van parks, the driver delivers the mail and then moves on.
<P>
There is a clear recognition, born of habit, that the insignia of the Royal Mail on its vans conveys a purpose that is well understood. Everyone knows them and the business they are doing. The Royal Mail van is part of our life and there is a clear working relationship—usually acceptable, but occasionally frosty—between people who have to make sure that drivers do not park on double yellow lines and postmen who have to go from door to door to deliver the mail on time.
<P>
In future, some inequity could arise. The Royal Mail, with its recognisable insignia emblazoned on the side of its vehicles, will have an advantage over, say, Johnson Postal Services Limited, which is granted the first pioneering licence to deliver in the London area as well. Its brand image—including its vehicles—will be treated differently. The amendment calls for equity. I am not terribly bothered about whether postal delivery vans are treated strictly or with leniency. It is common sense to treat them slightly differently from other vans, because one knows that they will move on quickly and their drivers are not pulling a fast one. But there should be a level playing-field. An established practice with existing systems for delivery should not be treated differently from—and better than—what becomes established practice for competitors. All carriers should either have an exemption or be subject to the same traffic rules.
<P>
<B>Mr. Russell Brown (Dumfries):</B> I seek clarification. Is the hon. Gentleman saying that at present and in the future Securicor, for example, should be treated differently from Royal Mail?
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> I think that they are already, because Securicor probably has a rougher time. The AICES tells me that, on average, its four largest members paid over £125,000 each on parking tickets in 1998. That is quite a whack. I am sure that the Minister will give us the figure for the Post Office, but because it is a universal service provider with more vans it may be greater. If Securicor is handling or delivering cash it would be unwise for a traffic warden to slap a ticket on its vans. Licence holders working in the same area should be treated on a similar basis. To achieve clarity, there should either be no exemption, or a measure of exemption—perhaps granted under a bylaw or licence—but not privilege for one and cost for others.
<P>
Will the Minister assure us that there will be fair play and equity, so that any licence holder working in the same area will be treated on the same basis as the Royal Mail?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoyle:</B> The hon. Member for Rutland and Melton made a strange comment about like for like and fairness. That will not be achieved. He was carried away by Postman Pat and his black and white cat, Jess. The reality in the high street should be explained. There is no like for like. Securicor, Panic Link and others are not operating a national service in the same way—far from it. Unlike the Post Office, they do not have postboxes to empty up and down the country in addition to making deliveries. Post Office vans are obliged to park on double yellow lines to do that. Other companies do not give a universal service and cannot be compared with the Post Office, nor do they compete with it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> I agree with the hon. Gentleman. I do not deny the truth of what he says, but those who are subsequently licensed should thereafter be on the same footing as the Royal Mail. I am not arguing that, if they are in a different business but happen occasionally to drive up the same road, they should be accorded the same rules.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoyle:</B> I cannot believe that other postal companies will come into competition with Royal Mail and have exactly the same number of postboxes and vehicles, as well as post boats operating between islands and so on. That would be a universal service, but I do not believe that any company will equal that provided by the Post Office, which therefore needs to be granted special conditions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Johnson:</B> There is no need for the amendment. Although he did not say so, the hon. Gentleman seems to assume that there is a general exemption from traffic regulations for the Post Office. Given that the Royal Mail or Post Office will in all probability be the first licence holder—let us get that straight—there will be no general exemptions. That has been debated over the years in Select Committees. I understand the concerns of the private couriers. I met them recently and heard the argument about parking fines. We do not have figures on the parking fines inflicted on the Post Office because, as I was told in answer to a written question, such figures are not gathered. There are, however, fines. I remember, when I was a postman driver, having my collar felt in Slough high street; it nearly saddled me with a police record. The fact is that exemptions are written into local traffic regulations and they are generally for Royal Mail liveried vehicles engaged in the collection and delivery of mail. Those are local matters, however, and they are not appropriate for primary legislation.
<P>
<H5>10.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The most usual exemption is in relation to yellow line restrictions. My hon. Friend the Member for Chorley was right: the Post Office is obliged to collect mail from about l20,000 pillar-boxes every day and from l8,500 post offices and it has to deliver to every address in the country. It would be fair for some local authorities to decide that, if a vehicle is used for transporting cash so that pensioners can be paid, it should not be parked miles away, creating a security hazard for staff.
<P>
It is our intention that there should be a level playing field so that, if the Post Office as a licence holder has these exemptions, any other similar licence holder should also have them. In that respect, therefore, I can give the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton that assurance. That is our intention. Under this amendment, the one licence holder at the moment, the Post Office, would have considerable difficulty in carrying out its duties when the legislation was enacted. I hope that, having explored this area, the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment. If he will not, I shall invite the Committee to reject it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 9, in page 7, line 32, leave out subsection (2).
<P>
This simple amendment removes these words:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Commission may, in particular, require the application to be accompanied by such reasonable application fee as it may determine.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That may sound reasonable, but we are attempting to amend the provisions relating to licences in order to limit payment to the annual payment of an amount necessary to finance the regulator's functions. In the White Paper ``Post Office Reform'', the Government stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>It is intended that the Regulator will be funded by a contribution from the Post Office itself, and in due course any other licensees as appropriate. This is in is in line with the financing of regulation in the utilities.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am concerned because the proposed application fee is not linked in any way to the regulator's funding, as it is in the cases of, for example, Oftel and Ofgem. I cannot see anywhere in the Bill a requirement for the amount charged to be commensurate with the regulator's need to cover costs and expenses. There is too much scope for the licence application fee to be enormous. Can the Minister say how much the licence application fee might be? It could be 1,000 quid, 10,000 quid, 100,000 quid, I do not know. The magnitude of the payment is important. It is a potential barrier to entry. We need an assurance from the Minister not only that the application fee should somehow be linked to the costs of the commission, but that there should a pro rata link to the costs of the commission.
<P>
If a licence is being sought for a peculiar delivery to, say, Orkney and Shetland, where there is a sparse population, the applicant should not, in seeking that licence, have to pay anything like the amount paid by a licence applicant seeking permission to work in the reserved area in a major capital city. The cost of delivery to the Scilly Isles or the Shetlands may be only a few hundred quid to the applicant who, perhaps linking up with other organisations, takes on responsibility for the reserved area. That applicant may do the Royal Mail a favour. However, if someone were looking at a potentially profitable venture to compete in Leeds, Liverpool or over all of Wales, the fee would be much larger.
<P>
Will the Minister say something about the magnitude of the application fees envisaged, confirm that a predetermined annual fee—rather than any kind of subsequent random charge­may apply and give an assurance that the scale of the fee will be in line with the scale of the licence applied for?
<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Johnson:</B> We are probably talking about the wrong clause in terms of the hon. Gentleman's valid interest in what licence fee is to be charged. Clause 12 is about the commission being able to charge an application fee, which means that it could charge for the cost of processing the application. That is quite common­we have to pay when applying for a driving licence or a passport. I am talking about the cost of processing the application, not the cost of the licence. We are saying not that the commission will have to do that, but that it may do it. It is hard to conceive of the need for this amendment. It is an established pattern of utility regulation that a reasonable fee for the processing of the application should be charged. I stress the word ``reasonable''­I cannot put a figure on it, as the commission has not yet been set up and we have no idea of the cost of processing an application. We are codifying the commission's power to require an application fee. The charges will have to be in accordance with the established fees and charges guidelines that are used in many areas of government.
<P>
The proper clause under which to discuss the valid questions raised is 13, although I cannot say how much a licence application fee from Inverness will be compared with a Post Office licence application. Those issues have to be determined in the light of experience. If the clause is removed, the commission, practically alone out of all the utility regulators, will not have the opportunity to say, ``If we are going to process applications for licences, we will at least charge a fee for the cost of the paperwork involved.'' That is all that this clause refers to. I ask the Committee to accept that and, if the amendment is not withdrawn, to reject it.

<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his explanation. On the basis of what I have heard, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<B>Mr. Baldry:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 108, in page 8, line 17, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(3A) It shall be a condition of a licence that the licence holder shall arrange for and fund the carrying out of annual independent reviews of the efficiency and economy of its operations and submit to the Commission a report prepared by the body which carried out the review.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Ministers can deal with amendments in Committee in various ways. They can reject them outright, but, if they are kind, they will say that they will take them away and think about them. Emboldened by such a large majority, the Minister has been going through amendments like a farmer with a scythe. I ask him to reflect on the amendment, not least because the magazines to which it relates offer the Royal Mail its third largest revenue stream. If those operating that industry feel that they are not treated fairly or competitively, that is not good news for the Royal Mail as a whole.
<P>
The amendment's purpose is to try to build safeguards into the Bill that require licence holders to analyse and evaluate their efficiency levels annually. It would compel a licence holder to arrange an independent review of the efficiency and economy of its operations and to submit that to the commission. That would enable benchmarking, which would draw parallels between the Royal Mail and the private sector for the first time. That must be good news for everyone.
<P>
Much of our discussion has been about changes of ownership and checks and balances, but we must also ensure that postal services are as efficient and competitive as possible. The mechanism that I suggest would be important because the Royal Mail needs to be encouraged to be competitive and to provide better value. It needs to look beyond its current methods and explore opportunities to modernise its systems. Businesses that will continue to use Royal Mail services will want postal deliveries to be as cost-effective as possible.
<P>
I have some historical, although not present, interest in the magazine industry, which has expressed specific concerns about such issues. Although it is outside the reserved area and is free to use private operators, I suspect that it is justified in feeling that other service providers will not be able to offer a universal postal service for some time. Therefore, it will have to continue to use the Royal Mail. The magazine industry does not necessarily want to shift its loyalties to another provider. However, following an independent report by SMT which was commissioned last year, it has evidence that the Royal Mail needs to sharpen its act.
<P>
Over the past 10 years, the cost of Royal Mail deliveries has risen from around a third of non-editorial costs to about a half. The Minister said that the real costs of the Royal Mail have come down, but, in a competitive world, so have the real costs across industry. The effect on the customer is significant. The magazine industry is achieving greater efficiency in other areas, but it cannot avoid the cost of postage, which is increasing disproportionately. The Post Office has frozen the fast programme of investment in sorting equipment to handle magazines, which undermines further efficiency opportunities. Unsurprisingly, the industry believes that real savings by the Royal Mail should be possible, and that a realistic price for posting magazines would be between 20p and 24p, as opposed to the current average of 32p. That would offer a saving of around 30 per cent.
<P>
Only 11 per cent. of consumer magazines are delivered by the Royal Mail, as news-stand delivery is a cost-effective alternative. In other countries, the proportion of delivery by the national carrier is far higher, sometimes being up to 90 per cent. If the Royal Mail were more competitive, it might increase its market share considerably. Although the proportion of business-to-business deliveries by the Royal Mail is higher, some publishers are forced to reduce their circulation to minimise their delivery costs.
<P>
As I said, magazines are the Royal Mail's third largest revenue stream: 700 million magazines are posted each year, which is worth about £250 million in postage fees. One would hope that the Royal Mail would be willing to seek ways to retain and perhaps increase that core business, while better satisfying its customers. One would also hope that it would not shirk from an opportunity to measure and benchmark its efficiency and to develop strategies to improve its service. This modest amendment, on which I hope the Minister will reflect before scything it down, tries to ensure decent benchmarking and comparison of costs between the various providers.

<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> I shall speak for only a few seconds. The amendment is interesting. So much of the discussion on the Post Office has traditionally been a political ding-dong. The amendment would enshrine the requirement to shift analysis about what is good and bad in postal services and postal communications from the political arena to a proper commercial assessment of what works well and less well. The amendment asks essentially for a proper efficiency comparison between the existing Royal Mail and new licence holders, so that, instead of having political arguments about an important service, we can consider it from the proper, commercial point of view.

<P>

<B>Mr. Alan Johnson:</B> I understand the purpose behind the amendment, but I do not think that it is necessary. Opposition Members should be careful about discouraging organisations from coming into the licensed area. All the discussion has been about the Royal Mail, but a pretty onerous obligation would be placed on those wanting to come into the licensed area if they had to arrange for and fund an annual independent review of the efficiency and economy of its operations and submit to the commission a report prepared by the body carrying out the review. All the talk from the Opposition Benches has been about promoting competition and encouraging people to move into the reserved area and apply for licences, but the amendment would in practice constitute an onerous and possibly discouraging burden.
<P>
I accept the valid points made by the hon. Member for Banbury (Mr. Baldry), but we do not need the amendment to achieve his objectives. The quality of service of the Post Office is already monitored independently; to its credit, it was the first organisation, back in the 1980s, to arrange such monitoring. Most other European postal administrations that were saying that 96 per cent. of their mail arrived the next day found, when they were measured independently, that that figure went right down—as it did for the Royal Mail when it introduced independent measurement. The Post Office is also obliged to publish an annual report and it must agree a strategic plan with the Government. However, more importantly in relation to the points raised by the hon. Gentleman, there is the new licensing regime and the regulator. The regulator will have the power to set prices, which we expect—as we say in the White Paper, we cannot require this, but we expect it—to be done using a retail prices index minus formula, or RPI-x. That will be a great driver of efficiency. I think that that important innovation will be particularly welcomed by the magazine market.
<P>
The amendment is therefore unnecessary. Of course there should be as much independent measurement of quality and efficiency as possible, but the amendment does not relate just to the Royal Mail, which might be able to afford it—although it has many other obligations to carry out in that area. Opposition Members must consider potential licence holders who would see the requirement as an onerous burden and perhaps a disincentive to compete in the area. It is principally for those reasons—and not because we disapprove of independent measurement—that I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Baldry:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his explanation. It is helpful to have it on the record because, in due course, the magazine industry and others may need to bring to the attention of the regulator the Minister's assurances about the quality of services, the strategic plan and, more importantly, the commission itself to ensure that the service provided is as competitive as possible. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Cotter:</B> Under the clause, if the licence holder does not consent, the commission will be entitled to make representations. The amendment would make it compulsory for the commission to consult the council on the set of circumstances delineated in the clause. As it stands, the licence holder does not have to have the consent of the council, but only that of the commission. I should like to hear the Minister's response before I comment any further.
<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Johnson:</B> The hon. Gentleman has come up with another important point. We agree that the council should be consulted by the commission when the consent of a licence holder to a modification is sought. I note that the amendment was tabled by the hon. Member for South-East Cornwall (Mr. Breed). He is not in the Committee at present, but he, not the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare, may be responsible for its drafting deficiencies. I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment on the understanding that the Government will consider tabling an amendment on Report to deal with such an anomaly.

Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> If my comments seem slightly esoteric, it is only because so does the clause. This is a matter of great importance, and a topic on which I am sure that the Minister is one of the world's great experts.
<P>
The clause relates to the Judgments Act 1838, under which interest may be charged. That seems some time ago, pre-dating even the birth of the Father of the House. I am puzzled about how it operates, because many changes have taken place in the banking system since. Interest rates hardly existed in their present form in 1838. To what will an unpaid balance be subject under the Judgments Act 1838? We expect a very detailed reply.
<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Johnson:</B> It is unfair to ask me to comment on the Judgments Act 1838, which was carried into law only at 38 minutes past six last night—or perhaps that is the year that it was passed.
<P>
Why does a Bill for the United Kingdom refer to an Act for England and Wales that dates from two years before Rowland Hill introduced the modern Post Office? Many similar Acts use it, and we do not have a better alternative. My officials have discussed the matter with the Scottish Executive, and we shall introduce an amendment if we can find a better alternative, but no measure in the panoply of laws that have been introduced since 1838 meets the purpose of the Bill. That is why I, as a renowned and established expert on the matter, ultimately decided to stick with the Judgments Act 1838.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> That is all very well, but what does the Act say?
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> We shall write with a full explanation—indeed, I shall pen it over the lunch break. The Judgments Act 1838 allows the application of interest to debts and is, I am told, widely used. However, I shall write to the hon. Gentleman and all other interested hon. Members to give chapter and verse—indeed, we shall probably publish it on the internet.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss the following amendments: No. 13, in page 16, line 39, leave out `the Commission considers that'.
<P>
No. 14, in page 16, line 41, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`, including the person's commercial interests.'<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> Clause 29(5) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>So far as practicable the Commission shall secure the exclusion from the register of any matter relating to the affairs of a person if the Commission considers that its inclusion would or might seriously and prejudicially affect the person's interests.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The purpose of the amendment is to beef that up. The current wording is too wimpish and fails adequately to protect the commercial interests of legitimate licence holders, whose efficiency and energy should not be threatened by the Bill. Following the removal of some words, the subsection would read:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The commission shall secure the exclusion from the register of any matter relating to the affairs of a person if its inclusion would or might seriously and prejudicially affect the person's interests, including the person's commercial interests.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In something of a repeat performance, the amendment would make the clause consistent with the detail of the July 1999 White Paper. In paragraph 32 on page 28, the White Paper states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Regulator will have . . . a power to publish information for the benefit of consumers and in the interests of good regulation, subject to tests relating to substantial harm—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and here's the rub—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>including matters of commercial confidentiality and public interest.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
What is in the Bill is much weaker than what is in the White Paper.
<P>
The need to protect commercial interests was further recognised in the White Paper, with reference to the Post Office's five-year strategic plan. In paragraph 5 on page 41 the White Paper reads:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The aim will be to report—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
to Parliament—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>once the Strategic Plan has been approved (though commercially confidential details of the Plan will not be revealed).<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The amendment recognises the importance to potential licence holders of protecting information about their commercial interests that may be disclosed to the regulator as part of the application process. In particular, it would require the regulator to secure the exclusion from the register of confidential commercial information. We are trying to beef up, or toughen up, a clause that is a little soggy, enshrine a spirit of justice and fairness in the Bill, and make everything consistent with the objective that the Government have already stated in black and white.

<P>

<B>Mr. Alan Johnson:</B> My understanding is that the purpose of the amendments is to ensure adequate safeguards for the affairs of individuals. That is a worthy objective, on which we can all agree. However, we believe that the rights of individuals are protected sufficiently by the clause as drafted, and that the amendments would not increase those rights.
<P>
The amendments would impose an absolute duty on the commission and limit its discretion, without increasing the protection of individuals. For example, amendments Nos. 12 and 13, which propose, respectively, the deletion of ``so far as practicable'' and ``the Commission considers that'', would have the undesirable effect of leaving the commission with no discretion over entries in the register if a person were to object to an entry, on the grounds that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>its inclusion would or might seriously and prejudicially affect the person's interests.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That would not achieve the objective identified by the hon. Gentleman.<P>

<P>
The amendments do not even suggest which other person or body should judge what should be excluded from the register. Such a vacuum would result, inevitably, in delays, and the register would contain less information than would be desirable in the public interest. In the interests of good, fair and open regulation, the presumption must be that the entries will be made. Only in exceptional circumstances should an entry not be made. As the regulator of the postal market with clear duties and day-to-day responsibility for regulation, the Postal Services Commission will be best placed to weigh up the merits of an entry in the register and decide what is in the public interest.
<P>
Amendment No. 14 proposes that the Bill should refer explicitly to ``the person's commercial interests''. That is unnecessary. As the Bill stands, the phrase ``the person's interests'' subsumes his commercial and all other interests.
<P>
The clause provides adequate safeguards for the rights of individuals, so, although I recognise the hon. Gentleman's laudable aims in tabling the amendment in the first place, I hope that he will withdraw it. I hope that I have explained why it would not achieve his objective, but would damage the interests of individuals.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> I remain unconvinced. Simply to ``deem'' something to be acceptable for publication gives too much leeway to the commission and insufficient right to the person whose details are to be published to object. Clause 29(6)(a) states that if ``the person concerned consents'', they can be published; clause 29(6)(b) states that entering the matter in the register can be permitted if it is ``in the public interest''. There is not enough detail to instruct the commission not to publish. It is like the presumption of innocence or guilt: for the commercial facts of a company, which might emerge on the register, there should be a presumption of non-publication. In other words, the onus should be on the commission to prove that a company's accounts or history should be published. At present the commission may simply ``deem'' that the company has no legitimate objection. The presumption is the wrong way round.
<P>
I imagine that the details of a licence will appear on the register. It will contain commercial information that is essential to the publication of the licence details, such as the tariff charged, where the company may go and how many vehicles it may have. That information is relevant to the licence. It is commercial, but is not information to which a company seeking a licence could object. There may be other information about a company whose activities are broader than the performance of postal services which that company may not wish to see published by law on a register. The presumption is the wrong way round. It should be for the commission to prove that it has to publish the information, not for the commission simply to consider that it may include it. The emphasis is wrong, and we seek to press the matter to a Division.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and the Council'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This is a sensible and uncontroversial amendment, the purpose of which is to require the Secretary of State to consult the council as well as the commission before giving directions. Under the clause, the Secretary of State has power to give two directions, first, to impose as a condition of a relevant licence a requirement that the licence holder provide such free postal services to blind or partially sighted people as may be specified, and secondly, to direct it to bring that licence condition into force. The Secretary of State has the duty to consult the commission before making either direction. The amendment gives him the additional duty to consult the council before doing so.
<P>
The point of the clause is to provide a means, if circumstances require it, to ensure the continuation of the existing free services for the blind that we talked about on Tuesday. The Post Office currently provides those services on a voluntary basis; we need to ensure that its continuation is guaranteed.
<P>
The point of the requirement to consult the commission before making either direction is to ensure that it can express its views to the Secretary of State on what sort of services should be specified in the direction and whether the imposition of such a licence condition is necessary. On reflection, it makes sense for the Secretary of State to consult the council as well in order to receive its views. It represents the consumer—the user body—and the amendment will ensure that it is consulted along with the commission.
