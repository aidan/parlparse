<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100945000321"></a>Andrew
Selous:</b> I welcome you back to the chairmanship of our
Committee after the long summer break, Mr. Chope. I am sure
that the Ministers have had the same joy as Opposition Members in
getting back to speed on our earlier discussions. I am sure that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column236" />Column number: 236</div>we will all get back into the swing of our deliberations, which
proceeded in a focused and constructive manner in previous sittings.
The hon. Member for Rochdale will, no doubt, discuss amendment No. 45
in due course.</div><a name="07100945000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause makes a major change to the current system of child support by
repealing sections 6 and 46 of the Child Support Act 1991. Section 6
requires those in receipt of benefit to lodge an application for child
maintenance with the Child Support Agency, which is, in broad terms, a
reform that the official Opposition support. It will provide equality
of treatment to all sections of the population and will not force one
section to go down a route that they might not want to go down.
However, as with any change of this nature, that inevitably raises a
number of other questions, which I hope will provoke a debate and a
response from the Minister.</div>
<a name="07100945000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is worth putting on the
record a few facts relating to the abolition of section 6. At the
moment, only 31 per cent. of parents with care who are on benefit
received child maintenance in the previous three months. That comes
from the CSA&#146;s quarterly statistics of March 2007, table 13.1.
Therefore, the requirement in section 6 is not working, as 69 per cent.
of parents with care who are on benefit are not receiving child
maintenance to start with. Two thirds of the cases that are taken on
because a parent with care has claimed benefit never reach the stage of
an initial calculation and payment set-up. That information is also
from the CSA&#146;s quarterly statistics of March 2007, table 2.2. We
also know, as was explained by the Minister&#146;s colleague Lord
McKenzie in our evidence-taking session, that many parents with care
also withdraw before a calculation has been made, because they go off
benefit, so we understand and are broadly sympathetic to what the
Government are
doing.</div><a name="07100945000023"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="07100945000322"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Tim Boswell</b> (Daventry) (Con): Does my hon. Friend agree
that another important motive in the initiation of that structure was
saving public funds by recovery from the parent without care? Can he
advise the Committee, or hazard a guess, as to the amount of public
money that ought to be recoverable and is not or, conversely, the
amount that is scored in benefit and that is either reclaimed against
individuals or is not eventually recovered from the parent without
care?</div><a name="07100945000024"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100945000323"></a>Andrew
Selous:</b> I am glad that my hon. Friend has raised that
point, and he is absolutely right to do so. It is worth putting on the
record that the change is major, because one of the original objectives
was to ensure that the public purse did not lose out&#151;he will
have sat through those earlier debates with my hon. Friend the Member
for North-East Bedfordshire (Alistair Burt) and others who were
Ministers at that time. We have to say that that intention has had a
chequered history, as some of the statistics that I have read out have
shown. That point is worth making, so that we are all conscious of the
change that we are bringing about.</div>
<a name="07100945000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">Above all, we need to focus on
a system that works and that gets money to parents who are looking
after children. We must ensure that there is a focus on lifting those
children out of poverty and on ensuring that they have the income to
which they are entitled. My hon. Friend the Member for
Daventry&#151;indeed, the whole 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column237" />Column number: 237</div>Committee&#151;could regale you for some time with endless statistics
about how things have gone wrong in the past, but you would not allow
it, Mr. Chope. There is agreement on that issue, which is
why the Government have introduced the legislation. However, my hon.
Friend has made an important point and I am grateful to him for putting
it on the record.</div><a name="07100945000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission will be able to focus on
applications from parents who actively want to use its services, which
should make a difference. It will not be plain sailing, because there
is often severe antagonism between the parents, and there may be
recalcitrant non-resident parents who do not want to pay. Part of the
challenge for the Bill, and for the changed culture that we hope will
go with it, is whether there will be a change of heart as far as those
non-resident parents are
concerned.</div><a name="07100945000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">Section 6
of the 1991 Act provided a mechanism to bring parents with care who are
on benefit into the child maintenance system. There is a worry that
there may be parents with care who will not pursue a voluntary
arrangement when, perhaps, they should. My hon. Friends and I have
tabled an amendment that will allow us to debate that very point later.
However, there is an issue about the decision to delay the introduction
of a higher maintenance disregard until 2010. With the Bill likely to
gain Royal Assent and come into effect next year, there is a worry that
there will be problems between the later implementation of the
maintenance disregard and the Bill coming into effect. That is a timing
issue, and it is possible that the number of lone parents on benefit
seeking maintenance will decrease, because the current &#163;10
disregard is not a great incentive as far as they are
concerned.</div><a name="07100945000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not
know when the Government will announce the level of disregard for child
maintenance income, but I hope that it will be sooner rather than
later&#151;I understand that discussions are ongoing with the
Treasury and others on that point. Projections have been made about
higher levels of disregard, the number of children that would be lifted
out of poverty and the cost that would result from a higher level of
disregard. One Parent Families and other groups maintain that this is a
cost-effective means of lifting children out of child poverty. However,
we also need to look across the piece to see what the effect will be as
far as parents are concerned, and I will say more about that later. A
full maintenance disregard would cost about &#163;230 million.
According to some analyses, that would be cost-effective in terms of
lifting children out of poverty, compared with an increase in tax
credits, for
example.</div><a name="07100945000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
notification by Jobcentre Plus of the current &#163;10 disregard,
Jobcentre Plus must notify the agency, which must then split the
maintenance payments made by non-resident parents, so that only
&#163;10 goes to the parent with care and the rest is diverted to the
Secretary of State. When the parent with care goes back into work,
Jobcentre Plus must notify the agency again to redivert all child
maintenance to them. Those are some of the practical problems that
amendments Nos. 18, 19 and 20 seek to
address.</div><a name="07100945000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">Empirical
evidence from the United States, which can be found in the
Department&#146;s own research report No. 402 of 2007, shows that
increasing the level of the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column238" />Column number: 238</div>disregard has not had an adverse effect on the employment rate. I would
be grateful if the Minister would comment on that and let us know when
we are likely to have that key information, which is critical to the
future successful transfer of child maintenance, because, in a sense,
we are discussing this part of the Bill with a big hole in front of us.
I will be interested to hear the Minister&#146;s response to this
debate.</div><a name="07100945000031"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="07100945000324"></a><b class="B">Paul
Rowen</b> (Rochdale) (LD): I, too, welcome you back,
Mr. Chope, after what has been an unusual break. Some of us
did not know whether we would be completing this process
today.</div><a name="07100945000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to
discuss amendments Nos. 18, 19 and 45. We are considering the repeal or
abolition of sections 6 and 46 of the 1991 Child Support Act. Although
that move might be welcome, we have tabled the amendments, because we
are concerned that the it may have some adverse effects, as has been
mentioned by the hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire, and not
necessarily be of overall benefit. We are also concerned about the
delay announced by the Government to the point at which an increased
child maintenance disregard can come into
place.</div><a name="07100945000285"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.45
am</div><a name="07100945000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">The abolition
of child poverty is something that all three political parties can sign
up to. I shall quote the Prime Minister in July
2004:</div><a name="07100945000034"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the great and
unacceptable concentration of poverty amongst households with young
children&#151;is the greatest indictment of our country in this
generation and the greatest challenge of
all.&#148;</div><a name="07100945000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">That sums up what
we all perceive to be an important target. If the Government are to
meet their 2010 target of halving child poverty, child maintenance and
its payment has a part to play. We are concerned that the &#163;10
disregard, which will be introduced next year, will only affect some
47,000 parents. We know already from this year that the number of
children in poverty has grown. We also know, as has been mentioned,
that only 31 per cent. of parents with care on benefit have received
child maintenance. If section 6 is abolished without the increased
child maintenance disregard, the number of children who receive child
maintenance will fall. The figure of &#163;10 that has been quoted
may be the maximum amount paid by the non-resident parent.</div>
<a name="07100945000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">We must accept that section 6
has not been good value in terms of the amount of money recouped. Last
year, &#163;110 million was recouped, yet the administrative costs of
the agency were around &#163;425 million. Section 6 has not been
successful in its original purpose, and it has acted as a disincentive
for the formation of voluntary arrangements. That point was
acknowledged in the Government White
Paper:</div><a name="07100945000273"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;reclaiming most
of the money for the State, rather than passing it through to children,
still means that neither parent has a strong enough incentive to
co-operate. This undermines the extent to which child maintenance can
contribute to the eradication of child
poverty.&#148;</div><a name="07100945000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is a key
point. If we are serious about eradicating child poverty, we must use
the child maintenance system as a
tool.</div><a name="07100945000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">Consider the
comparison between the tax credits system and the child maintenance
system. If the Government were, for example, to introduce a
total  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column239" />Column number: 239</div>higher maintenance disregard, it would cost in the region of &#163;230
million. That is what we would like to see, and I know that the
Chancellor has received a letter requesting that he announces such a
change in today&#146;s pre-Budget statement. Using the child
maintenance system, it costs &#163;2,875 to lift a child out of
poverty. Using the tax credits system, however, the cost to the
taxpayer is &#163;4,300. Whichever way one looks at it, if the
Government are serious about eradicating child poverty and meeting
their 2010 target, they should consider the rapid introduction of the
full maintenance disregard.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100945000325"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> Will the hon. Gentleman take this as a genuine
comment? Is he not concerned with the equity of the position of
somebody who is in receipt of full benefits and who also receives child
maintenance&#151;albeit perhaps an inadequate amount&#151;compared
with somebody who simply receives benefits and who does not have the
advantage of the receipt of child maintenance? The needs of the child
are the same in each family, but the resources, whether public or
private, are very different, and the result in terms of poverty is also
likely to be very
different.</div><a name="07100945000040"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100945000326"></a>Paul
Rowen:</b> I understand the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point. At
the moment, the system is a barrier for parents who are going through
the process, because of the hassle involved. My concern is that if one
sticks at the &#163;10 disregard, or if it is increased to &#163;30
or whatever, that will be the amount that the non-resident parent
agrees to pay. That will not help to deal with the issue of child
poverty.</div>
<a name="07100945000041"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100945000327"></a>Andrew
Selous:</b> Although I agree with what the hon. Member for
Rochdale has said, everyone needs to take my hon. Friend&#146;s
warning note on board. It is the case that poverty in two-parent
families has increased. It has gone up from 57 per cent. in 2002-03 to
60 per cent. in 2005-06, according to the households below average
income figures for 2005-06. That does not run counter to anything that
my hon. Friend and I have said. My hon. Friend&#146;s warning must be
heeded, if we are to be fair to everyone and to ensure that we lift all
children out of
poverty.</div><a name="07100945000042"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100945000328"></a>Paul
Rowen:</b> I understand the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point. The
problem is that although we are dealing with child maintenance, this
amendment seeks to do something for one group of parents.</div>
<a name="07100945000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">Save the Children gave me some
interesting figures yesterday, which are apposite to the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s point. I am sure that members of the Committee have
seen the briefing from Save the Children on the elimination of child
poverty. If we carry on at the current rate, it will be 2049 before the
Government meet their target of halving child poverty. That is because
the disparity in income has grown between people at the top and at the
bottom, and there is therefore a disparity in the time that it will
take for parents to reach 60 per cent. of median income, which the norm
to which we aspire. It is frightening to consider the year 2049, when
we have a target of halving child poverty by 2010. Given that the costs
are &#163;200 million, we must ask ourselves&#151;I hope that the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column240" />Column number: 240</div>Minister can answer this&#151;what the real barriers are to
introducing the full disregard more quickly than is proposed at the
moment.</div> <a name="07100945000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">I accept the
point made by the hon. Member for Daventry that we must consider the
issues not only for single parents but across the piece. Given that
this measure would cost &#163;200 million and would have a dramatic
effect in reducing child poverty for a significant number of single
parents, why are the Government being so slow to introduce it? Also,
will the Government accept the concern that if section 6 of the 1991
Act is abolished without full income disregard, the effect may well be
that fewer parents, and therefore fewer children, will receive
child maintenance? We all want an increase, not a reduction, in the
number of parents receiving child maintenance.</div>
<a name="07100945000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that the Minister will
explain why we have to wait until 2010. We may have to wait only until
this afternoon, when the Chancellor will give his pre-Budget statement.
I hope that the Minister can answer those
points.</div><a name="07100945000046"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100945000329"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions
(Mr. James Plaskitt):</b> It is nice to be back,
Mr. Chope. I am sure that we will continue our deliberations
in the same constructive way as before the recess, and it is nice to
know that we will be able to conclude
them.</div><a name="07100945000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thank the hon.
Members for their amendments and comments. I am grateful that the
important reform at the centre of our proposals has been welcomed by
both hon. Members who have spoken. The reform is a major change, and it
is very important.</div>
<a name="07100945000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our aim is to encourage parents
to make arrangements for maintenance on their own, if they can, while
maintaining a statutory maintenance service for those who cannot. To
achieve that, we propose to repeal sections 6 and 46, making the
removal of compulsion the first step in moving to a new system of child
maintenance.</div> <a name="07100945000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">Hon.
Members have referred to the Government &#147;delaying&#148; the
implementation of the larger disregard. That implies that a clear
option was open to us immediately to go to the higher disregard level
and that a decision has been made to put it off. That is not the case.
It is not a matter of delay; it is a matter of doing all the necessary
preliminary work to ensure that the higher disregard levels can be
introduced.</div><a name="07100945000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">What has
to be done? First, there is research, which neither the hon. Member for
South-West Bedfordshire nor the hon. Member for Rochdale mentioned. We
must carefully consider the interaction between higher disregards and
work incentives. If the objective is to reduce child poverty, as both
hon. Members have said and as I agree, we must take that factor into
account. If we were not certain of the impact of the changes in terms
of work incentives, and we subsequently found that the change
encouraged more people to stay on benefit and not to seek work, we
might not be serving the objective of reducing child poverty. It is
therefore important thoroughly to assess all the
impacts.</div><a name="07100945000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
existing research, and the hon. Member for South-West
Bedfordshire has mentioned the United States. That is not
exactly the same system, so we cannot necessarily assume a simple
transference 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column241" />Column number: 241</div>from the American experience to here. We have commissioned some research
of our own specifically to consider the circumstances pertaining to the
UK. The research is very close to conclusion, and we hope to publish it
very shortly. We must think carefully before making decisions on the
implementation of the higher
disregard.</div><a name="07100945000052"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100945000330"></a>Paul
Rowen:</b> My understanding is that DWP research shows that
the vast majority of lone parents want to work. A 10-year study of
British lone parents and their children from 1991 to 2001 found that,
controlling for other factors&#151;in other words, aside from matters
such as education and occupation&#151;receipt of child maintenance is
positively associated with parents moving into work, and not the
opposite. There should be no need for any more evidence, because the
existing research shows that worklessness and being a lone parent are
not related. Lone parents are just as willing and eager to work as
other
parents.</div><a name="07100945000053"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100945000331"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:</b> The hon. Gentleman is right in the sense that so
far the analysis is encouraging. I hope that he agrees that it is
crucial to be sure that we have this absolutely right, so that the
reform, as we introduce it, serves our common objective of reducing
child poverty. I also want to stress that that is not the only aspect
of disregard reform. Other changes, such as the extension of the
&#163;10 disregard, will be introduced more quickly. There will
inevitably be sequencing to ensure that the systems work and that the
reform achieves our
objectives.</div><a name="07100945000054"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100945000332"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> We are having a consensual discussion. Does the
Minister agree that the research should take into account the relative
equity between persons who are, or should be, in receipt of child
maintenance on the one hand, and persons who may well be in other parts
of the benefits system but who are not affected by child maintenance
issues?</div><a name="07100945000286"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11
am</div><a name="07100945000055"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100945000333"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:</b> That is being looked at as part of our research,
as the hon. Gentleman will see when it is published. We will encourage
parents to arrange child maintenance alongside the repeal of section 6,
whether through making their own arrangements or through applying to
the statutory maintenance service for a calculation. As part of this,
as we discussed before the recess, CMEC will introduce a
high-quality information and support service. It will draw in
low-income families and support them to make an informed choice about
which maintenance option suits their circumstances best. In addition,
we have already announced our intention to extend the existing
&#163;10 disregard to all cases on the original scheme by the end of
next year. Around 80,000 children already benefit from the disregard.
The extension will extend that benefit to a further 55,000, which is
quite a significant step in terms of tackling child poverty.</div>
<a name="07100945000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have made clear our
intention to increase significantly the maintenance disregard for all
parents with care from 2010-11, which will deliver on our twin
objectives of reducing child poverty and supporting parental
responsibility. However, we also recognise that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column242" />Column number: 242</div>this is a complex issue, where many potential impacts need to be
considered. We need to ensure that we achieve the right balance between
the incentive to seek and pay child maintenance, and the incentive to
move into work. Securing that balance will provide the real child
poverty gains that we all seek to achieve. It is critical to get that
right. Continuing to overturn satisfactory arrangements or forcing
parents to justify why an application should not be made and imposing
benefit penalties on the most vulnerable parents are not
appropriate.</div> <a name="07100945000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">We will
encourage parents to make maintenance arrangements as soon as possible,
and we should not make the timing conditional on the significant
increase in the benefit disregard. There is enough in the new system
from the outset, in the extended disregard and the new information and
support service, to encourage positive parental choice. We will build
on that with the significantly higher disregard to ensure the
longer-term success of the new system. I hope that for those reasons
the amendment will be withdrawn.</div>
<a name="07100945000058"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100945000334"></a>Andrew
Selous:</b> I have listened with interest to the
Minister&#146;s response. I want to leave on the record my concern
that I am not sure that he addressed the issue of equity between
families on benefits who are not in receipt of maintenance and those
who are in receipt of maintenance. He said that the research was
looking at that, but I again have to express disappointment that it is
not before the Committee. It seems slightly the wrong way round to have
the research commissioned while the Committee is sitting, so that we
are conducting our deliberations without the benefit of research that
the Government are conducting. As I said, we are also ignorant of what
the proposed significant increase in the level of the disregard will
be, but having heard what the Minister has said, I beg to ask leave to
withdraw the amendment.</div>
<a name="07100945000059"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment, by leave,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100945000336"></a>The

person who is, at that time, the non-resident
parent.&#148;.&#146;.</div><a name="07100945000062"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100945000337"></a>Mr.
Weir:</b> It seems like &#147;Groundhog Day&#148; because
we are discussing matters that I have been raising ever since the
re-design of the Child Support Agency was first mooted. This is perhaps
the last throw of dice to try to persuade Ministers to look at the
matter anew.</div> <a name="07100945000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
introduction of voluntary maintenance agreements has been widely
welcomed. It provides the possibility of removing many people from the
statutory system and creating agreements that are acceptable and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column243" />Column number: 243</div>which work well&#151;something that the current CSA has, frankly,
failed to do. Unfortunately, section 4(10)(aa) of the 1991 Act will, I
believe, act as a serious deterrent to many people who would otherwise
go down the route of a voluntary agreement. I note in passing that Sir
David Henshaw in his report recommended the abolition of the 12-month
rule, but the Government have not gone down that route and I would be
interested to hear the reason for that.</div>
<a name="07100945000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">The brief history is that the
original 1991 Act intended that the CSA would take over child
maintenance, but that soon proved to be beyond the agency&#146;s
capabilities, and it clearly still is. Under the Child Support,
Pensions and Social Security Act 2000, the Government attempted one of
their many efforts to improve the agency by introducing the section
that allowed couples to reach an agreement, but they set a 12-month
time limit after which either party could apply to the CSA to overturn
the terms of the agreement. The rationale behind that was to give the
agency a breathing space during which couples could still reach an
agreement, but ultimately everything would come under the auspices of
the CSA.</div><a name="07100945000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given that we
are considering a change and, as the Minister said, we are encouraging
parents to reach their own agreement, the continued existence of the
rule will be a serious stumbling block to the widespread use of
voluntary agreements. I am sure he will say that we cannot have an
agreement that is set in stone for eternity. In essence, that is
correct, but the majority of agreements will have within them a
provision that allows for variations if there is a change of
circumstances. That was a standard clause in my previous life as a
solicitor when we entered into many such agreements prior to the CSA.
We recognised that child support was a long-term matter. It is not for
one year or five, but 16 or 17 years in some cases. There must be
allowance for variation. I suspect that the standard agreement produced
by CMEC will contain something similar to that&#151;unless it is the
Minister&#146;s intention that the CMEC agreement be renegotiated
each year, which will lead to some
friction.</div><a name="07100945000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">If voluntary
agreements merely mirror the statutory agreements, and if all we have
is a standard form into which the parties agree to pay statutory
percentages, an important chance will be lost to allow separating
parties to agree a clean break and reach agreements that reflect
accurately the particulars of the specific circumstances and provide a
much more solid basis for child contact to continue into the future,
which is the essence of such
matters.</div><a name="07100945000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the
Committee has discussed the matter, I have become slightly worried
about whether voluntary agreements will provide a serious alternative
to the statutory system. In our first evidence sitting, I raised
specifically the Scottish minutes of agreement, and Hilary Reynolds,
the civil servant in charge of the Bill, responded by saying:</div>
<a name="07100945000274"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It is
worth noting that when we have talked to some clients about what they
find important in a voluntary agreement, sometimes it is not regular
payments, but lump sums, mortgage or school uniform payments, or
whatever. What suits the parents of the child or children will be a
variety of things, not just the standard x amount per
period.&#151;<i class="I">[Official Report, Child Maintenance and Other

believe that it would be possible under the proposals. If such an
agreement were entered into by parties, CMEC can intervene after the
year has passed and overturn
it.</div><a name="07100945000069"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100945000338"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes a powerful case, to
which the Minister should at least give an answer. In his experience of
the current formulas, does he agree that a great deal of the concern
that is expressed by parents relates to agreements about particular
payments that are not taken into account in a formula and might
therefore be said to have left a lasting sense of
unfairness?</div><a name="07100945000070"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100945000339"></a>Mr.
Weir:</b> The hon. Gentleman is correct. We have all met
people in our surgeries who are paying for x and y and who have said to
the agency, &#147;Look, I have done this&#148;, but the agency will
not take it into account. To be fair, sometimes there is little
evidence of what people have been doing because the parties have
handled things in cash. I appreciate that that is a problem, but it
leaves a sense of bitterness in many relationships and poisons them
after the break-up.</div><a name="07100945000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
serious problem arose in respect of the Child Support Agency in that it
would in effect look only at the regular payments made by the
non-resident parent to the parent with care, irrespective of whatever
arrangements may have been agreed. In many cases, parties had entered
into a minute of agreement that might, for example, have transferred a
large capital sum or the whole matrimonial home to the parent with care
in exchange for a reduction in payments or instead of regular payments.
That may well have allowed the clean break, especially when new
relationships were being formed or other children were involved, which
is often the crucial point because the new relationship can start to
break down because of the pressures and payments in the old
relationship. Many of those agreements were overturned subsequently and
the CSA pursued the non-resident parent for increased child maintenance
irrespective of what had gone before. That was unfair and led to great
tension between couples.</div>
<a name="07100945000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the 12-month rule continues,
what is the point of entering into an agreement other than of the
standard variety? In our evidence sitting, Lord McKenzie
said:</div><a name="07100945000275"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The one
key change will be that, once the section 6 compulsion goes, a claim
for benefits by one or other of the participants will not break the
agreement. It will continue, subject to the 12-month rule, under which
either party can elect to come out of the
agreement.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;[Official Report, Child
Maintenance and Other Payments Public Bill Committee, </i>17 July 2007;
c. 5.]</div> <a name="07100945000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">In other words, a party
to an agreement cannot be sure that it will last for more than 12
months. The Minister assured the Committee
that</div><a name="07100945000276"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;an application can
be made to the statutory maintenance service at any point by either
parent. That would override any existing voluntary
arrangement.&#148;&#151;<i class="I">[Official Report, Child Maintenance and
Other Payments Public Bill Committee, </i>19 July 2007;
c.125.]</div> <a name="07100945000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is no
point in a party entering into a voluntary agreement that undermines
the essence of what the Bill is trying to do. As I said at the time, it
will undermine those who wish to make a clean break by agreeing to a
different method of dealing with ongoing support rather than periodic
payment. By implementing the rule, the Government are giving with one
hand what they are taking away with the other.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column245" />Column number: 245</div><a name="07100945000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not suggest that such an

not.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100945000340"></a>Andrew
Selous:</b><b class="B"> </b>The hon. Gentleman&#146;s point brings to
mind some of the questions that my hon. Friend the Member for
Weston-super-Mare posed to the Secretary of State on Second Reading
about the enforceability of private agreements. Would the hon.
Gentleman like the voluntary agreements to have legal force and for the
organs of the state to ensure that they are adhered
to?</div><a name="07100945000077"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100945000341"></a>Mr.
Weir:</b><b class="B"> </b>That is exactly my point. I cannot speak for
the English law, as I am not certain of the position in England, but in
Scotland once a minute of agreement has been entered into and
registered in the books it has legal force. It can be implemented in
the same way as a decree of court without any proper procedure for
going back to court. It is a very effective, clear way of dealing with
such problems.</div> <a name="07100945000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
reiterate the point: most agreements would recognise that circumstances
change. If there is a material change in circumstances, the parties
could go back to court and renegotiate the agreement. Most parties to
these agreements have undertaken independent legal advice on their
interests. It is not a case of it being imposed by one party on the
other; the agreements are usually negotiated with independent legal
advice in respect of the future.</div>
<a name="07100945000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">I tabled amendment No. 90 to
delete the clause that implements the 12-month rule. Resolution
approached me and pointed out that the effect of my amendment would not
be what I intended as deleting the 12-month rule may mean that someone
could go back to the court at any time; it suggested amendment No. 125
as an alternative. It made much the same point as I made, referring not
to the Scottish minutes of agreement but to the English system of court
order in which once a court order has been made either party can apply
to the agency for a calculation after a 12-month period, which only
serves to undermine the basis of agreements reached between the two
parties concerned.</div><a name="07100945000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
12-month rule clearly facilitates a non-resident parent to transfer
between the two state systems, using that as a delaying tactic for the
payment of child maintenance in the future. Practitioners say that it
has frequently been used as a tactical ploy, and has undermined any
trust that may have been created between the parties on reaching an
agreement.</div>
<a name="07100945000287"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.15
am</div><a name="07100945000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have raised
this important point on numerous occasions and I would like the
Minister to reconsider it. The Government are trying to get parties to
agree between themselves, which is the way forward, as agreement can
defuse much of the tension and bad feeling in the break up of a
relationship. However, if there is uncertainty and a period when either
party can simply go to the agency and overturn any agreement after a
period of 12 months, it will undermine the good work done in other
parts of the Bill. The proposal needs to be reconsidered and I shall be
interested in what the Minister has to say about
it.</div>
<a name="07100945000082"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100945000342"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:</b> I acknowledge the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
determination. As I think he knows, the existing 12-month rule applies
where parents have a consent order, or a minuted agreement in Scotland,
made on or 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column246" />Column number: 246</div>after 3 March 2003. It operates to prevent parents from applying for a
maintenance calculation for the first 12 months that a consent order or
minuted agreement is in place, but either parent may apply for a
maintenance calculation once the year has expired, thus overturning the
order. Amendment No. 90 would mean that parents who had consent orders
or minutes of agreements in place would be prevented from having access
to a maintenance calculation made by the Secretary of State or the
commission.</div><a name="07100945000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">We do not
wish to restrict any effective and agreed maintenance arrangements, in
whatever form, to 12 months or any other period. In fact, the repeal of
section 6 would break the link with the benefits system, so that any
existing maintenance arrangements will not be overturned simply because
the parent with care claims benefits&#151;only the action of one or
both of the parents can do that. We want to encourage dialogue and
agreement between parents that leads to effective maintenance
arrangements providing ongoing support for children. We hope that
parents will not need to turn to the commission for a calculation under
the statutory
scheme.</div><a name="07100945000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">The agreements
will continue and benefit the children for as long as both parents want
them to. However, if things go wrong or a parent decides that another
type of arrangement would be more suitable for their children, they
need a readily available route into the commission. Children must not
be left for considerable periods with no maintenance or inadequate
arrangements, and we should not lock parents into agreements that are
no longer working. The 12-month rule is an important component of the
overall child maintenance system. It encourages settlements that
contain fair levels of child maintenance that are broadly consistent
with the amount calculated under the statutory scheme and discourages
old-style clean break agreements that divide property and assets
between adults but leave children without regular ongoing payments of
maintenance.</div><a name="07100945000085"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100945000343"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> For clarification, when the Minister was talking
about the various circumstances in which the agreement may no longer be
appropriate, did he primarily have in mind cases where the agreement
had not been complied with by one of the parties and in that sense had
broken down, or where the agreement between the parties was no longer
fair? Those are somewhat different circumstances. If one could
introduce a sort of judicial process, one would like to be friendly if
the situation were unrealistic and perhaps more intolerant if the
situation was simply
non-compliant.</div><a name="07100945000086"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100945000344"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:</b> I understand the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point.
A number of circumstances can lead to a breakdown of an arrangement
and, whatever those are, it is important that we give parents the
chance to come to the commission, if they have to, to get the issue
sorted out. We must remember that the overriding interest is the flow
of maintenance to the children. Any number of circumstances can lead to
a breakdown. We want a system to be behind the parents to provide
support in resolving a disagreement and to put an alternative agreement
or arrangement in place to get 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column247" />Column number: 247</div>the maintenance flowing again. If parents are stuck in a court agreement
without the option of coming to us, that is not working in the
interests of the child or children who are being

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100945000345"></a>Mr.
Weir:</b> These agreements are enforceable. If one party is
not implementing the agreement, there is a route whereby that could be
enforced relatively quickly. It is not a case of there being no flow of
maintenance. The danger in what the Minister proposes is that, if an
agreement is entered into and one party suddenly decides after 12
months, for whatever reason, that they want to overturn it, it can be
overturned by going to CMEC, irrespective of whether it is fair. That
will lead to a dispute between the parties that will lead to people
being reluctant to enter into agreements in the first
place.</div><a name="07100945000088"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100945000346"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:</b> It is fair enough for the hon. Gentleman to
mention risks, but there are risks in what he is proposing as well.
That is why it is important that we try to strike a balance. We are
anxious not to have a situation where we revert to encouraging
clean-break arrangements with no account being made of the flow of
maintenance for the children. That has to be balanced against what he
says.</div><a name="07100945000090"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="07100945000347"></a><b class="B">John
Penrose</b> (Weston-super-Mare) (Con): I am intrigued by what
the Minister says about trying to discourage clean-break arrangements,
because the whole tenor of the rest of the Bill is to try to encourage
voluntary agreements between parents. They will understand what is best
for the ending of their relationship and for the children who have
resulted from it. The Government do not seem to trust them that far,
and seem to believe that if there is a division of assets, which may
then have an impact on income and therefore the ability to support the
children and provide child maintenance in future, that is not an
acceptable arrangement. I wonder why the Government
want to draw a boundary around that.</div>
<a name="07100945000091"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100945000348"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:</b> With respect, that is not quite the point that I
am making. The clean-break arrangements to which I am referring have
come out of the court system in the past, whereby the terms of the
divorce or separation settlement deal only with assets and property,
and do not deal with, or make provision for, ongoing child maintenance.
That is a different point. The hon. Gentleman is right: of course we
want to encourage parents to come to their own arrangements, and I
believe that the vast majority are capable of doing so. Some will need
support to do it, and that is why the support service is there. Some
who cannot do it, for whatever reason, need a statutory scheme to which
to refer in order to put the maintenance in place.
</div><a name="07100945000092"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100945000349"></a>John
Penrose:</b> If, for example, there were a situation in which
a parent with care had a modest income that would not be sufficient to
provide a decent upbringing for the children because he or she would
have to make mortgage payments on the family home, it is possible that
the parent who is leaving would say, &#147;You take over the family
home. You might be mortgage-free. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column248" />Column number: 248</div>That would therefore free up a lot of your income and you will be able
to provide for the children, and that capital sum is the equivalent of
an endowment instead of an ongoing income payment.&#148; Why do the
Government not accept that? Why are they actively undermining it and
preventing it from
happening?</div><a name="07100945000093"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100945000350"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:</b> I would not go so far as to say that that is
what we are doing. What we are saying under the CMEC arrangements is
that parents might want to come to their own arrangements or
agreements. They may come to an agreement of that nature, but the point
is that part of the advice and support service that we are setting up
gives separating parents an indication of what is reasonable to expect
and what they should be going for if they are not certain. We had a
lengthy discussion about that before the recess. It is not for us, at
the end of the day, to say that that is what people must do. We are
turning towards people&#146;s sense of responsibility, but we are
saying that there is guidance as to what we would put in place if
people were to refer to the statutory scheme. People could infer that
that is deemed to be a reasonable settlement, but it is important for
us to have in place, behind all those voluntary arrangements, a
statutory scheme that will put an arrangement in place if parents
cannot reach agreement.</div>
<a name="07100945000094"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100945000351"></a>Mr.
Weir:</b> In effect, the Government are saying that people
have to go down this route. Otherwise, why would anybody do it? Why
would anybody enter into an agreement where, in effect, the Government
are saying that that is what they expect? One party can go to CMEC
after 12 months, overturn the whole agreement, and go down the
statutory route. In effect, the Government are saying exactly what the
Minister seems not to be
saying.</div><a name="07100945000095"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100945000352"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:</b> We are getting stuck on this, because I do not
agree with the hon. Gentleman. It is about striking a balance between
the various risks that are at play, and we believe that by sticking to
our position on the 12-month rule, that is exactly what we are
doing.</div>
<a name="07100945000096"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100945000353"></a>John
Penrose:</b> Can the Minister give an example of an occasion
when it would make sense to suggest to a parent without care that they
should make some sort of up-front capital grant to the parent with care
in lieu of ongoing maintenance payments in, for example, the situation
that I have described where a family home is encumbered by a mortgage?
Why would that ever make sense under the situation that the Minister is
describing?</div><a name="07100945000097"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100945000354"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:</b> This is not as difficult a concept as we are
making it. It is the case that in some instances where couples separate
they might try to come to an arrangement about the asset that they have
jointly owned and contributed to. We know that that is a common
feature, and we have all dealt with such cases. However, the point is
what is done with that asset when the couple separates. Most people
will not assume that an arrangement about that is adequate to cover
child maintenance, which could be ongoing for many years. Most couples
would not want to see that as part of an accepted settlement and would
not feel it to be an 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column249" />Column number: 249</div>appropriate arrangement. That arrangement is made at one point in time
when couples break and is a decision about how to divide jointly owned
assets. There is then the ongoing issue of what provision is to be made
for the maintenance of children. At the point of separation couples
might need to buy separate homes. All sorts of other issues might occur
in the future that cannot be anticipated when the assets are divided
up.</div><a name="07100945000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">What couples want
to do&#151;and what the vast majority do&#151;is to decide on the
split of assets and then decide on ongoing child maintenance. Most see
those as entirely separate things. If parents are unable to reach an
agreement on that, there is a statutory scheme under the CMEC plan to
which they can turn and an advice service on which they can build any
agreement to which they are trying to come. That is an advance on the
current
situation.</div><a name="07100945000099"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="07100945000355"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mark Harper</b> (Forest of Dean) (Con): It is not the case
that an asset transfer is a one-off event? With a significant transfer
in assets, there is an ongoing income stream or a non-expense stream of
payments that have been avoided. It is an ongoing thing. No
professional adviser in this country would advise somebody to make a
capital payment if somebody can then come after them for income. No one
is going to advise that because it would be a failure of their
professional
duties.</div><a name="07100945000100"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100945000356"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:</b> We are trying to anticipate the very wide set of
circumstances in which couples separate. The whole thrust of the
legislation is to encourage couples to come to their own agreements and
arrangements. The decisions are for them to make about what is
appropriate. The whole thrust of this reform is to not draw people
unnecessarily into a system in which they do not need to be. However,
there needs to be a system in place to provide an arrangement for those
who cannot come to an agreement. It is not for me, or anybody else, to
say what a couple should do. There are plenty of sources of advice to
which they can turn in coming to a decision about how to make their
clean break. We are in the business of supporting couples who are
trying to make that arrangement, giving them an advice and support
service to help them decide how it is done, and, as a failsafe, having
a statutory scheme to which they can turn if they cannot reach
agreement.</div><a name="07100945000101"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100945000357"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> I think that we have rattled this quite firmly,
but will the Minister at least take away the thought that there could
be a couple&#151;not necessarily the typical couple&#151;in which
one of the parties might be quite disingenuous or cynical and enter
into an agreement on a voluntary basis in the sure and certain
knowledge that 12 months later, irrespective of how sensible the
arrangement, it can be pushed into the statutory CMEC formula? I cannot
give the Minister the precise wording and can understand how complex it
would be, but will he consider a change so that irrespective of child
maintenance, which I appreciate is its proper concern, CMEC could take
into account some of the circumstances which had led up to its
involvement and the reasonableness of the parties? I think that it
would be very difficult to do that, but the people who have raised this
issue have a serious point. We all want voluntary agreements if
possible.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column250" />Column number: 250</div><a name="07100945000102"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100945000358"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:</b> I understand that point entirely and appreciate
the way in which the hon. Gentleman makes it. I will consider it, but
we have given great thought to this issue and have thought very hard
about what Sir David Henshaw recommended. We have not agreed with his
recommendation for very good reason. I am happy to look at the matter
again, but underline that great consideration has been given to this
important subject. We believe that a 12-month period strikes the
balance between giving court orders a chance to bed in and work, and
providing the means to resolve difficulties quickly and keep payments
flowing.</div><a name="07100945000288"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.30
am</div><a name="07100945000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">When problems
arise in the first 12 months, the parties can return to the court and
reinforce the order. Where arrangements break down or circumstances
change, the 12-month period allows swift intervention by the commission
to keep maintenance flowing to children, which therefore puts parents
with consent orders or minutes of agreement on the same footing as any
other separated parent. I appreciate that there is great interest in
the issue. I certainly accept its importance, but I hope that, having
given those reassurances and responses to interventions, the hon.
Member for Angus will withdraw his
amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100945000359"></a>Andrew
Selous:</b> I have listened with great interest to the debate.
The hon. Member for Angus has made a sensible point. By tabling the
amendment, he has tried to help the Government to achieve the central
thrust of the Bill, which is to get more effective voluntary
arrangements in place. I think that he is actually on the
Minister&#146;s
side.</div><a name="07100945000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will not recap
the other points, other than to add that it is worth thinking for a
moment, on a human scale, of the effect of what the Minister is
proposing. The measure would involve removing children from the family
home, which they love and know, and from the place where they have
friends and attend school, because fewer non-resident parents will say,
&#147;You keep the house and that is part of my settlement,&#148;
which, as the Minister has said, can be undermined.</div>
<a name="07100945000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will not reiterate the other
points, because they were made clearly. I agree with the points made by
my hon. Friends the Members for Forest of Dean, for Weston-super-Mare,

amendment to a vote, we will support him.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100945000377"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss new
clause 1&#151;<i class="I">Application to Commission by third
party</i><i class="I">&#151;</i></div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;Where a
child&#146;s welfare is at risk because appropriate maintenance
arrangements have not been established, a third party specified by the
Secretary of State can, on behalf of the child, make an application to
the
Commission.&#146;.</div><a name="07100945000133"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100945000378"></a>Andrew
Selous:</b> New clause 1 gives a power to institute
maintenance arrangements, where they have not been put in place by a
parent with care. It would apply only in extreme circumstances in which
the parent with care is considered not to be acting in the best
interests of the child. The power would be exercised as an extreme
fall-back position in, hopefully, very few but none the less important
cases, if the welfare and financial well-being of the children
concerned is not being taken into account and promoted by the parent
with care. We are considering a case where a parent with care has
recklessly failed to pursue maintenance and is not acting in the best
interests of the children
concerned.</div><a name="07100945000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">Social
services or the courts might wish to exercise the power in question. In
some circumstances, parents with care are deemed by social services to
be fit and proper parents and can continue to care for their children,
but, perhaps due to addiction problems or a lack of willingness to
engage with the financial process, they might not see fit to approach
CMEC or to establish a voluntary arrangement to get the maintenance
flowing to them and their children. We do not imagine that such a thing
would happen in a wide range of circumstances, but, following our
debate on clause 15, many parents with care will come out of the child
maintenance system, because they cannot be forced into it due to being
in receipt of benefit. Do we imagine that all such parents with care
will want voluntarily to establish maintenance agreements? Hopefully, a
large number of them will do so, which is the Minister&#146;s wish
and the wish of all Committee members. However, there will be hard
cases where parents do not act in the best interests of children, and
new clause 1 would allow others to put maintenance arrangements in
place.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column252" />Column number: 252</div><a name="07100945000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">It goes without
saying&#151;although Committee members will, perhaps, raise the
issue&#151;that domestic violence and fear are real for all our
constituents, as are instances of people being pursued. I want
safeguards to accompany the exercise of this power, so that it is used
only if the safety of the parent with care is absolutely guaranteed.
The parent concerned may be in a women&#146;s refuge at an address
unknown to the non-resident parent, where their safety is
guaranteed.</div><a name="07100945000136"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100945000379"></a>Paul
Rowen:</b> Will the hon. Gentleman tell the Committee who he
envisages being able to make such an application? Which groups of
professionals does he mean? He was eliciting some examples of at-risk
situations, but how would he define &#147;at-risk&#148;, thereby
enabling people to make an
application?</div><a name="07100945000137"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100945000380"></a>Andrew
Selous:</b> The hon. Gentleman has asked two questions, the
first of which is who might make such applications on someone&#146;s
behalf? I am referring to professional people in contact with a family
and the parent with care who are charged with having an overview of
that family&#146;s welfare. We are talking about people working in
social services, court staff, Jobcentre Plus staff&#151;if they were
aware of the circumstances&#151;and accredited welfare rights
officers, perhaps at the citizens advice
bureau.</div><a name="07100945000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">For some
people, the whole world of finance is an unknown. Given the lamentable
state of financial education, our deliberations, and even knowledge of
the new Bill, will pass far over the heads of large numbers of our
fellow citizens throughout the country, who will never hear about this.
Under section 6, people were dragooned into the system, and we have
been through the arguments why that is not appropriate. The new clause
reserves an important residual power, which would be exercised with
discretion, caution and absolute concern for the safety of the parent
with care.</div><a name="07100945000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman had a second part to his question. Will he remind me what it
was?</div><a name="07100945000140"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100945000381"></a>Paul
Rowen:</b> It concerned the hon. Gentleman&#146;s definition
of &#147;at

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100945000382"></a>Andrew
Selous:</b> Any children who are in poverty or on benefits and
who could be lifted out of poverty by the receipt of regular child
maintenance are, by definition, children who would be &#147;at
risk&#148;. The clause would not be used in cases where wealthy
couples have separated. We are talking about people in dire financial
circumstances.</div><a name="07100945000142"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100945000383"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for tabling
his new clause. I have listened carefully to his defence of it, but I
think that he will understand why I am going to encourage him to
withdraw it. The more one considers the measure, the more one begins to
see the real problems in going down that road. There are several
problems that make the measure effectively
unworkable.</div><a name="07100945000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">I take the
point that the hon. Gentleman is talking about people in extreme
circumstances, but the problems arise when such circumstances are
looked into. For example, who are the third parties are going to be?
That is a real concern. In his speech, he made a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column253" />Column number: 253</div>few suggestions about who the third parties would be&#151;I was
keeping a list. He mentioned social services staff, perhaps the courts,
perhaps Jobcentre Plus staff, welfare officers or people who work for
the citizens advice bureau. There are real problems with the idea that
we could somehow designate these people and put them in a position of
taking the serious step of referring the welfare of another child, with
whom they have no relationship, to the commission. They would need to
instruct or request the commission to begin the process of determining
an agreement for that child, which would be fraught with difficulties.
Who will the Secretary of State accredit with the ability to do that? I
cannot see any means of coming up with a definitive list of who could
be accredited in those circumstances, which is the major difficulty
with the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
proposition.</div><a name="07100945000144"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100945000384"></a>Andrew
Selous:</b> I am a little surprised by the Minister&#146;s
comment that those people would have no relationship with the child. I
am not particularly suggesting that this category of professional might
be one who would instigate this. For example, an educational welfare
officer might be intimately involved with a family and visit them at
home because the child is not turning up at school. They might find
that the reason why the child is not turning up is a matter of finance,
due to deep poverty within the home. There are many professionals of
the state&#151;employees of central and local government&#151;whose
job it is to have an intimate relationship with that family and keep
the welfare of the children at
heart.</div><a name="07100945000145"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100945000385"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:</b> I return to the question of where we draw a line
to determine who can or cannot act in that way. With respect, the hon.
Gentleman cannot say where that line would be drawn. If we were to
pursue his new clause, the line would have to be drawn somewhere, and
it would be impossibly difficult to determine who is authorised to make
such
interventions.</div><a name="07100945000289"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.45
am</div><a name="07100945000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">A more
profitable route would be to consider the information and advice
service. I hope that people dealing with families in the circumstances
that the hon. Gentleman has discussed, and who are perhaps aware of the
risk to a child who is not receiving the maintenance to which it is
entitled, would refer to that service. That is the route that one
should take in order to resolve the issue, rather than one in which a
third party&#151;especially as there is an issue about who that
should be&#151;initiates a process when they do not have a biological
relationship with the child. It is better to refer to an information
service to encourage either of the parents to initiate the process in
support of the child. I am with the hon. Gentleman on his objectives,
but I think that the question is one of
means.</div><a name="07100945000147"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100945000386"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> We are having the right kind of discussion about
this difficult issue. I want to probe the Minister about something he
has just said. It is clearly sensible for the information and advice
service to advise the parties to do that and to give them all the
encouragement they need in what might be a daunting
process&#151;issues such as domestic violence may colour 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column254" />Column number: 254</div>things. I am not quite clear whether any party has the power to refer
the circumstance of the case to the information and advice service over
the heads of the individuals involved. There are data protection and
confidentiality issues that should perhaps be
considered.</div><a name="07100945000148"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100945000387"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:</b> I do not think that that requires a power. The
people working in support services will become aware of the service
that we are setting up. They will know of it and will be able to refer
to it, just like anyone else. Having done so, they will be able to
recommend what action an individual can
take.</div><a name="07100945000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are other
problems with the new clause. For example, who will make the judgment
that the circumstances pertaining to the child are not appropriate?
That is very much a judgment call. One individual, as a third party,
might look at the circumstances and say, &#147;They are not good
enough for the child.&#148; However, another third party might not
agree with that
view.</div><a name="07100945000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">Then there is
the question of how the commission will respond to such referrals and
how it will check their validity. I hope that hon. Members agree that
as we go further into what the hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire
has suggested, there are genuine practicality and workability issues.
Although I take on board the motive that has driven him to table the
new clause, those issues are fatal flaws in the practical step that he
has suggested. I therefore hope that he will not press the new
clause.</div><a name="07100945000151"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100945000397"></a>Paul
Rowen:</b> The clause deals with changes to the way in which
maintenance is calculated. I want to discuss amendments Nos. 46, 48, 49
and 47 and new clause
6.</div><a name="07100945000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to consider
the new clause separately, so I shall start with the four amendments.
The amendments address the new assessment process, which will be based
on gross income for the non-resident parent with the data coming from
HMRC. Although the change to using HMRC to provide the data is welcome,
there is a concern that the data will be one or two years out of date,
particularly for a self-employed, non-resident
parent.</div><a name="07100945000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill
allows for reassessment, but only if income has risen or fallen by more
than 25 per cent. The idea behind the amendments is to reduce the
administrative burden on HMRC created by reassessments, which might
mean that children end up receiving less under the new system. The
amendment asks for an investigation into the effects of varying this
level on the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column257" />Column number: 257</div>caseload of the CMEC. We also need more information on the proportion of
non-resident parents, both employed and unemployed, whose income
differs substantially from one year to the next and who may have spells
of unemployment in any one
year.</div><a name="07100945000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not
suggesting that that should happen annually, but given that we are
discussing a new structure and a new assessment, we need to predict the
effect of those changes on people in different income bands and the
difference that that would make in principle to the level of
maintenance that parents with care receive. I put it to the Minister
that that could be carried out fairly quickly once the Bill has
received Royal Assent, so that we can get some indication of the
changes. The Minister may well say that it is a matter for the
commission, as it is the body charged with dealing with that, but as
Members of Parliament who will be dealing with individual cases, we
need to know what information the parent with care will need to provide
in order to initiate an appeal. I hope that the Minister can give us
some idea of what the level of information will
be.</div><a name="07100945000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 6 is slightly different from new clause 2. Both new clauses
would place a duty on statutory authorities to investigate non-resident
parents. In the case of new clause 2, that investigative duty is with
HMRC, and in the case of new clause 6 it is with the commission. I want
to quote two pieces of evidence that were given at the start of our
deliberations about non-resident parents who are self employed.
Referring to the resident parent having to provide information to the
CSA, as it currently constituted, in order for it to initiate an
investigation, Stephen Geraghty said that if the CSA can provide it, it
will do
so.</div><a name="07100945000176"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100945000398"></a>Mr.
Weir:</b> I understand what the hon. Gentleman is saying, but
is his experience not the same as mine, that parents with care complain
that, although they have given the information to the CSA, nothing
happens and there is no investigation? The Minister has accepted that
that was because the CSA does not have investigative powers in a lot of
those cases, which is a serious defect.</div>
<a name="07100945000177"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100945000399"></a>Paul
Rowen:</b> I agree with the hon. Gentleman. The CSA has a
statutory right to investigate, but it does not have the resources to
do so as it is currently set up. Given the situation, I disagree with
the proposals to use HMRC. If one deals with a non-resident parent who
is a self-employed director of a company, it is quite possible for them
to arrange their financial affairs to be, as is said colloquially, more
tax-efficient. That may well reduce the visible income and, therefore,
the amount of child maintenance to be paid. I know that One Parent
Families and Gingerbread have provided a briefing that includes several
cases showing how it is possible for not only millionaires but
ordinary, self-employed people to change their tax affairs to make it
more difficult for the parent with care to pursue their
claim.</div><a name="07100945000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">I put it to the
Minister that we should not be putting the onus on the parent with care
to have to prove that, because the parent with care may have separated
in difficult circumstances and may not be in the best position to know
the ins and outs of the non-resident parent&#146;s income&#151;they
may only know background information. There is no requirement for the
non-resident parent to provide full information to the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column258" />Column number: 258</div>commission. Stephen Geraghty&#146;s comment says it all by putting the
onus on the parent with care.</div>
<a name="07100945000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also want to quote Janet
Allbeson, who asked us in the evidence sitting where the pressure would
come from. As she said, it will be parents with care who are not
getting anything at the moment who will think that at least they can
get something. However, where will they get the information from? New
clause 6 is important, because we are saying that we are introducing a
new arrangement, trying to encourage people to make voluntary
arrangements and setting up information and support services to enable
such voluntary arrangements, but, where a parent is clearly determined
to avoid their responsibilities at all costs, there must be statutory
back-up to make them declare what they are
doing.</div><a name="07100945000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">Turning to the
difference between new clauses 2 and 6, new clause 2 puts that
responsibility on HMRC. I put it to the hon. Member for South-West
Bedfordshire, who tabled new clause 2, that HMRC&#146;s primary
responsibility is the collection of taxes&#151;it investigates tax
fraud and is keen to ensure that such investigations take place. It is
not charged with the effective and efficient calculation of child
maintenance, which is still the responsibility of the commission. I put
it to the hon. Gentleman that new clause 6, which would give the
commission the power to order the non-resident parent to provide the
information, is a more appropriate way of going
forward.</div><a name="07100945000290"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12
noon</div><a name="07100945000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">HMRC will
have to be involved and it has the database that will be used to
provide much of the calculation. However, where a non-resident parent
has been tax-efficient and is therefore avoiding child maintenance
payments, perhaps by switching from earned income to dividends, the
issue, as far as HMRC is concerned, is dealt with. The issue, however,
it is not dealt with as far as the resident parent is concerned
because, while that is not earned income, it is still income that the
non-resident parent is receiving. I hope that the Minister will look at
that. As I said, the first few amendments are probing. We want an
assurance that a review will take place before the Bill is operational
so that we have an indication of the number of parents whose income
changes within a year and what effect that is likely to have on the
amount of child maintenance collected by the new procedure. Again, that
information should be available from HMRC&#146;s database.</div>
<a name="07100945000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, new clause 6 is very
important because unless and until we have the statutory back-up for
the new system&#151;we partly discussed this earlier&#151;we are
still going to let down those children in that particular situation. I
appreciate that Ministers may say, &#147;Well, it&#146;s only 7 per
cent. of all the cases involved.&#148; Nevertheless, for the children
involved that is 7 per cent. too much. We ought to be using this
opportunity to ensure that while we are encouraging voluntary
agreements, we have a statutory back-up for cases where one parent is
attempting to use the tax system to avoid their parental
responsibilities.</div>
<a name="07100945000183"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100945000400"></a>Andrew
Selous:</b> This important set of amendments and new clauses
cuts right to the heart of so many problems that the CSA has
experienced in recent years. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column259" />Column number: 259</div>It is important that we get this area of the Bill absolutely right. It
is a large and somewhat unwieldy group of amendments, so we will
probably be spending a little time on it as we go through everything.
It merits a serious debate, which I hope all members of the Committee
will contribute to fully.</div>
<a name="07100945000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 14 has the effect
of introducing provisions in schedule 4 from the moment that the Bill
receives Royal Assent, rather than delaying it. That is important
because it would give CMEC the power to use HMRC data straight away so
that the tougher enforcement powers, which I hope we will discuss
later, can be used on accurate assessments. I cannot stress how
important it is that the tougher enforcement powers go hand in hand
with the stronger enforcement powers because, as we all know from our
case loads as constituency Members of Parliament, faith in the system
will only be restored if the assessment process is more accurate and if
those accurate assessments are enforced.</div>
<a name="07100945000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">The National Audit Office
estimates that 65 per cent. of assessments put forward for enforcement
were incorrect. That is at the heart of many of the problems that
arrive in our mailbags week in, week out, and it is deeply unfair to
the non-resident parents who have incorrect assessments and highly
frustrating for the parents with care and, most importantly, for the
children who do not receive the correct amount of money. Amendment No.
14 and new clause 3 are important because they would allow HMRC data to
be used straight away and ensure that those powers link up with the
tougher enforcement powers, which are going to come in straight away,
as my hon. Friend the Member for Forest of Dean will no doubt tell us
later.</div><a name="07100945000186"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100945000401"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> Does my hon. Friend agree that it is important to
get it on the record that this is not a passive, investigatory exercise
between parties who just happen to have levels of income or expenditure
requirements as givens. Obviously, if somebody is in the
&#147;won&#146;t pay&#148; category rather than the
&#147;can&#146;t pay&#148; category, they will resort to various
devices, with which we are all familiar&#151;such as
self-employment&#151;to disguise the nature of their income, and a
vigorous, proactive investigation will be needed to get to the bottom
of where they really
stand.</div><a name="07100945000187"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100945000402"></a>Andrew
Selous:</b> My hon. Friend is right. He has, as he often does,
put his finger on it by talking about a sector of non-resident parents
who perhaps have their own businesses, are self-employed, are slightly
more financially literate than most of the population and are able to
arrange their affairs in such a way that they
can&#151;wrongly&#151;minimise their child maintenance payments. It
is important that we deal with those
issues.</div><a name="07100945000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">In discussing
this group of amendments, I want to explain further some of the
measures dealing with the matter raised by my hon. Friend. New clause 2
would give stronger investigatory powers and put a greater onus on Her
Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs to investigate and get to grips
with the current ability of non-resident parents to pay the maintenance
that they should be paying.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column260" />Column number: 260</div><a name="07100945000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hear what the hon. Member for
Rochdale says about new clause 6 and how the tough, investigatory
powers should primarily lie with CMEC, whereas my new clause 2 says
that the primary focus should be with HMRC. The truth is that we will
need the fullest possible co-operation between HMRC and CMEC if the
Bill is to be a success. All sorts of practical issues, in
terms of data sharing, IT systems and basic communications, will have
to be got right if we are to make a success of this. There are
different approaches in my amendment and the one tabled by the hon.
Gentleman. I will justify why I tabled new clause 2, rather than new
clause 6, as I proceed. However, I hope that he will agree that there
is, in essence, a fine divide because we will need full and good
co-operation between HMRC and CMEC if we are going to crack some of
these difficult
problems.</div><a name="07100945000190"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100945000403"></a>Paul
Rowen:</b> I understand the hon. Gentleman&#146;s points. We
will deal with IT systems under the next group of amendments. Does he
not accept, however, that CMEC&#146;s prime responsibility is child
maintenance and HMRC&#146;s prime responsibility is collecting taxes?
Therefore, the body dealing with child maintenance should be the
principal body, albeit working closely with the
other?</div><a name="07100945000191"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100945000404"></a>Andrew
Selous:</b> I understand that, but let me take the hon.
Gentleman back to his party&#146;s previous position, which he is
arguing against, if I remember it correctly. He wanted to transfer
virtually the whole of the Child Support Agency to HMRC. A little trip
down memory lane tells me that he has moved some way from a position
about which many of us had to listen to for some time and with which we
did not fully
agree.</div><a name="07100945000192"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100945000405"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> Is it not also a consideration that, although it
is accurate to say that HMRC&#146;s job is to collect taxes, along
the way it has become the expert in the assessment of income and the
avoidance of Spanish practices to disguise income? It is important that
it should be in the lead in smoking out people who seek to conceal
their real
situation.</div><a name="07100945000193"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100945000406"></a>Andrew
Selous:</b> My hon. Friend is right. Let us put ourselves in
the shoes of a non-resident parent who is playing fast and loose,
frankly, and is morally wrong in not providing the amount of
maintenance that should be going to his children. If the telephone
rings or a letter arrives on his desk&#151;in the days when we get a
postal service back&#151;and one is headed &#147;CMEC&#148; and
other is headed &#147;HMRC&#148;, I wonder which would make us
quake most in our boots. Whether rightly or wrongly&#151;and for many
of the right reasons&#151;HMRC has something of a Rottweiler
reputation. For hundreds of years it has pursued us to get money from
us, and most of us would say that they probably do that pretty
successfully. It has strong, tough powers to do so, and rightly so
because the Government need
revenue.</div><a name="07100945000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">People would
be more likely to jump if Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs took
the lead in assessing the right amount of income as it is HMRC data
that will be used. The hon. Gentleman cited 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column261" />Column number: 261</div>support for his approach to new clause 6 from One Parent Families, but I
draw his attention to page 5 of its brief, which
states:</div><a name="07100945000277"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;At
present, despite extensive powers to seek information and require its
production, the CSA simply lacks the confidence and financial expertise
to scrutinise the financial affairs of suspected non-resident
parents&#148;.</div><a name="07100945000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">One Parent
Families seems to be arguing slightly against its own case.</div>
<a name="07100945000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under new clause 2, HMRC would
have to refashion some of its priorities in pursuing non-resident
parents. No doubt, there are those high up in the Revenue who say that
the objective should be to go for those cases in which it can extract
the most revenue and to ignore some of the smaller ones. I hope the
Minister is having conversations with Treasury Ministers about the
Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission to ensure that when its
prior year data is being used, HMRC is committed to the objective of
preventing the past financial chicanery and of ensuring that there is
full and accurate disclosure. If the Minister has not had such
conversations with Treasury Ministers, perhaps he will assure the
Committee that he will do so, so that the proposal can work properly
and effectively.</div><a name="07100945000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 14 is about the importance of all Departments, non-departmental
public bodies and the courts sharing and providing all the information
necessary for CMEC to do its job. I forgot who said it, but in a
previous sitting&#151;in an evidence session or perhaps on Second
Reading&#151;we heard about a case in which a non-resident parent
pleaded poverty to the Child Support Agency, saying that he could not
possibly make the unreasonable maintenance payments demanded of him, at
the same time as he was presenting himself to the Home Office as a man
of substantial means who could well afford to support the new foreign
bride he was hoping to be allowed to bring to this country.</div>
<a name="07100945000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">The message needs to go around
Whitehall loud and clear that there should be basic data sharing among
Departments, which should link up and speak to each other. I hope that
the Minister and his colleagues are taking the lead in that respect,
and that they have been round, knocked on doors and had conversations
to ensure that the data flows. We know from the intractable problems in
the past that unless there is the greatest possible sharing of
information between Departments to build up a full and accurate picture
of the non-resident parent&#146;s state of affairs, we will not crack
the problems presented by these serious
issues.</div><a name="07100945000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill
touches on some important matters about the nuts and bolts of getting
enforcement to work: using HMRC data straight away; being fair in
respect of the tougher enforcement powers; using only accurate
data&#151;the data is inaccurate in 65 per cent. of cases; and
ensuring that information is shared. This is a large, unwieldy group of
amendments, but these are important issues and I look forward to
hearing what the Minister and other members of the Committee have to
say about
them.</div><a name="07100945000291"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.15
pm</div><a name="07100945000200"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100945000407"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:</b> I shall give a full response to this large group
of amendments and I hope that the Committee will bear with me, as there
are many very important issues to be considered. I will divide my
response into three broad areas.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column262" />Column number: 262</div><a name="07100945000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, there are those
amendments that require the Government to publish statistical reports
before the new arrangements for calculating maintenance come into
effect. Secondly, there are amendments that have an impact on the
timing of the commencement of different parts of the Act, including an
amendment which means that collection and enforcement powers could only
come into force from the time the changes to the calculation of
maintenance come into force. There is also an amendment that would mean
that the new calculation arrangements would come into force on the day
that the Bill receives Royal Assent. Thirdly, a set of amendments would
provide ongoing obligations once the new arrangements are up and
running. In particular, they would require routine investigations into
all non-resident parents&#146;
incomes.</div><a name="07100945000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 46 and 47 would require the Government to publish a report
outlining the impact on cases of the move to use gross rather than net
weekly income when making statutory maintenance calculations, and to
make a motion in each House about this report. Using gross income data
already held by Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs rather than
asking the non-resident parent to supply net weekly income details,
will remove one of the significant causes of delay in making
maintenance
calculations.</div><a name="07100945000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
intention is that the effect of the move from net to gross weekly
income should be broadly the same across the income range. That is the
reason for the new percentages for basic rate cases. I would add that
that intention resulted in changes to the rates originally announced
last December in the child maintenance White Paper. In particular, it
resulted in the introduction of a second set of percentages to be
applied to higher income
levels.</div><a name="07100945000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">We already
published in May this year information showing the impact of moving
from net to gross weekly income in our response to the Select Committee
on Work and Pensions&#146; fourth report. The amendments would
require publication of analysis showing the actual impact of the change
on individual cases at the point at which it is implemented. In
reality, such analysis is unlikely to be available. The first reason
for that is because the composition of the case load is likely to
change as we start to allow parents to make their own arrangements for
child maintenance. At this time there is no way of knowing precisely
which cases will remain in the statutory maintenance service and which
will leave. Secondly, we would need to make estimates of what
non-resident parents&#146; incomes would be in 2010, and, again we
have no way of knowing how accurate such estimates might turn out to
be.</div><a name="07100945000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 48
would require the Government, before bringing into effect the new rules
for calculating statutory maintenance, to publish a report on the
effect on maintenance assessments of different levels of income
variation. The new calculation rules will include provision for an
annual review, so that more recent HMRC data can be used, enabling
calculations to be updated. Parents will be able to ask for an
alternative calculation based on the current income of the non-resident
parent where this differs from the HMRC income data used by at least 25
per cent. That threshold will provide more stability for parents in the
amounts to be paid and allow the commission to concentrate on getting
money flowing. The amendment 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column263" />Column number: 263</div>calls for a report showing the effect of different levels of income
variation. For the same reasons as those that I gave for rejecting
amendments Nos. 46 and 47, it is not possible to produce robust
analysis at this time. I should add that the regulations to be made
under the Bill, which would provide among other things a definition of
gross weekly income and the 25 per cent. income tolerance rate, will be
affirmative. We will, therefore, produce relevant analysis to assist
Parliament in its scrutiny of those
regulations.</div><a name="07100945000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 49 would require the Government to publish a report outlining the
information that a parent with care would be required to provide when
appealing against a maintenance calculation, and to make a motion in
each House about the report. We are not planning to change the current
process, and parents will have the same rights to query and challenge a
decision by the commission as they currently do. That means that there
will still be no requirement for an appellant to provide supporting
information for their appeal. The only information required will
continue to be that necessary for the administration of the appeal to
proceed. With that in mind, it is difficult to identify the practical
benefits to be gained in publishing a report of the type proposed in
the amendment.</div><a name="07100945000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 3 would unnecessarily delay the implementation of the new
collection and enforcement powers until the changes in the method of
calculation of child maintenance are introduced, which is not expected
to be until 2010. The purpose of the Bill is to help the commission to
collect more maintenance for children. In order to provide the
commission with the tools to take firm enforcement action at the
earliest possible opportunity, we want to introduce the new collection
and enforcement powers as soon as they can be operationally effective.
Delaying that can lead only to worse outcomes for
children.</div><a name="07100945000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">In contrast
to the previous amendment, the effect of amendment No. 14 would be to
bring forward changes to the new calculation rules under the Bill so
that they would take effect from Royal Assent, not in 2010 as currently
planned. It would also require HMRC to investigate the reported
earnings of non-resident parents from the earlier time. In looking to
introduce new maintenance calculations from 2010, we are being careful
to avoid the mistakes of the past. We know from previous experience
that a maintenance calculation scheme cannot be delivered successfully
without an efficient and well-tested IT infrastructure. That is
particularly true in terms of the need for robust IT to support the
commission in its use of HMRC income
data.</div><a name="07100945000209"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100945000408"></a>Andrew
Selous:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for his further
elaboration on matters. HMRC data are so important. It is one of the
parts of the Bill that we are most enthusiastic about because, as I
shall say for the third time, the National Audit Office says that 65
per cent. of assessments are wrong. Is he saying that the reason for
not using HMRC data is down purely to IT? I want to probe him further
on that. It does not strike me that we necessarily need complex
computer systems to achieve a basic level of communication between HMRC
and CMEC to start using the data sooner.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column264" />Column number: 264</div><a name="07100945000210"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100945000409"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:</b> No, it is not down to that. The matter concerns
part of the deliberations that we must go through at this stage. As the
hon. Gentleman has referred to it more than once, I return to his
allegation that 65 per cent. of assessments are wrong. We touched on
that before the recess. He knows that we dispute that figure on the
basis of how it has been defined &#147;incorrect&#148;. We are
certain that, in reality, the number is much
smaller.</div><a name="07100945000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">I wish also
to respond to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point about the importance of
data sharing. I agree with his view. He wants to know whether we are
having conversations with HMRC about data sharing. Yes, of course we
are. They have been under way for some time. It is important that the
data-sharing process is robust precisely for the reasons that he
outlined. My general point concerns getting the sequence of the changes
right, which is why I am responding to his
argument.</div><a name="07100945000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the
proposed scheme were to commence before the link conveying HMRC data
has been fully established, the efficiency gains from direct access to
the data would be lost. Further inefficiencies would be bound to occur
if the commission was not given sufficient time to train its staff
fully or to develop all the processes needed to administer the new
service. The second effect of the amendment would place an ongoing
obligation on HMRC to ascertain the financial circumstances of every
non-resident parent. In that respect, it is virtually identical in its
effect to new clause 2, which would require HMRC to take reasonable
steps to investigate and verify such income. The new clause would also
add a requirement on non-resident parents to provide HMRC with any
information necessary for it to complete that
task.</div><a name="07100945000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is important
to remember that the information that the commission will use to work
out the statutory maintenance liability will already have been
looked at by HMRC for historic income data and the Department
for Work and Pensions for those in receipt of benefits. To recheck that
information for every application to the commission, which we estimate
would occur more than 100,000 times a year, let alone at other times
when the question about income arises, would be a prohibitively
expensive and largely superfluous process. It would remove any
efficiency gains from the commission&#146;s direct access to HMRC
data and would result in delays to the flow of maintenance, as the
commission would have to wait for the income figure to be validated
again before a calculation could be made.</div>
<a name="07100945000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
commission will be able to undertake appropriate investigations into
any income information, where it believes it to be appropriate, and
will still be able to pass on such information to HMRC.
Non-resident parents will still be required to submit to the commission
such information, if needed, to make a calculation. Failure to provide
such information, or providing false information, would leave
people open to prosecution. Furthermore, parents will continue to have
access to the variations regime, which helps to ensure that maintenance
liabilities accurately reflect non-resident parents&#146; ability to
pay.</div><a name="07100945000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 6
would provide an identical obligation as that set out in new clause 2
to investigate and verify non-residents parents&#146; income, except
that it places that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column265" />Column number: 265</div>obligation on the commission instead of HMRC. My points about the
inefficiencies arising from the duplication of effort and the
possibility of adding significant delay to the calculation process
apply equally, therefore, to this
amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100945000410"></a>Paul
Rowen:</b> Given the Minister&#146;s earlier comments, and
the comments that Stephen Geraghty made in the evidence sessions, what
step is he planning to make to ensure that the commission or HMRC have
employed the relevant people to enable those investigations to take
place?</div><a name="07100945000217"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100945000411"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:</b> This leads us back to the more general
debate. We do not want to burden the commission with
huge duties of investigation that it is not empowered to carry out. It
was that mistake that led to some of the current difficulties with the
CSA. However, there are particular circumstances&#151;especially if a
parent with care reports and provides evidence&#151;in which the CSA
can require information and carry out an investigation. The commission
will inherit exactly the same powers. It is important that it has the
ability to do that. How it does it, the resources that it brings to
bear in undertaking that task, and the skills set that it has to carry
it out, are all the responsibility of the commission. It must ensure
that that is part of its package, in order that it can act on the
authority that it has.</div>
<a name="07100945000218"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100945000412"></a>Paul
Rowen:</b> I understand the Minister&#146;s point, but given
the quote that I gave from Stephen Geraghty, where the onus is being
placed on the resident parent with care, does he not accept that it is
often very difficult to provide evidence? What we should require is
that when a complaint has been made, rather than evidence submitted,
the commission then investigates. That is a lower level of
responsibility than requiring evidence, which is what the Minister is
suggesting.</div><a name="07100945000219"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100945000413"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:</b> First, we have the switch to relying on
HMRC income data. That is a big step from where we
are now. It is far more robust and, as several hon. Members said, HMRC
is better equipped to extract that information and people will report
changes to it because they are fearful of the consequences of not doing
so. That is a quantum change in terms of the quality and robustness of
the information that the commission will have about parents&#146;
income. However, it will still have the power to pursue an
investigation if, for example, a parent with care refers to it for
consideration evidence of a suspicion that the non-resident parent is
not giving the correct information&#151;perhaps because there is a
mismatch of lifestyle information. We all accept that the CSA has not
carried out that function very effectively. There is a duty on the
commission, knowing that it has that power and an obligation to perform
it effectively, to ensure that it has the right equipment and skills
set to carry out that function. I suspect that there will be far less
need to do it, given that the essential body of information about
income is coming in from a more developed and robust source than is the
case at the
moment.</div><a name="07100945000292"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.30
pm</div><a name="07100945000220"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100945000414"></a>Andrew
Selous:</b> I must quibble with the Minister&#146;s
arguments against new clauses 2 and 6. He used similar arguments
against both me and the hon. Member for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column266" />Column number: 266</div>Rochdale, saying that our new clauses would weigh down HMRC and CMEC
with endless bureaucracy and unnecessary extra checking. I simply draw
his attention to the small word &#147;reasonable&#148; in both new
clauses, because it is neither my nor, I am sure, the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s intention that HMRC and CMEC should waste a
millisecond on cases which are clear and which do not need
reinvestigating. Without a provision such as new clause 2, however, I
fail to see how we will place a legal duty on HMRC to take action in
cases that it is not currently investigating because they are not high
value.</div>
<a name="07100945000221"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100945000415"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:</b> I know that the hon. Gentleman wants to be
reasonable&#151;he is a reasonable man&#151;but the trouble is that
he is opening the door to the possibility of the commission being
swamped with references for investigation, and we do not want to get
into that situation. That would not be an appropriate response, given
that the income information from which the commission will work in
carrying out its functions will in future come from
HMRC.</div><a name="07100945000222"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100945000416"></a>Paul
Rowen:</b> I hope that the Minister appreciates that this is
an important part of the Bill. Given what he has just said, what
assurance will he give us that the DWP will issue instructions to the
commission to ensure that the relevant arrangements are put in place?
As he has rightly said, the CSA can statutorily do the things that we
are talking about, but it does not. We therefore need to see that steps
will be taken to ensure that action is taken where people evade
payments.</div><a name="07100945000223"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100945000417"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:</b> I think that the hon. Gentleman knows that the
commission is charged with delivering in accordance with the criteria
set down in the Bill and that it remains accountable to Parliament
through the Secretary of State for doing so. We therefore expect it to
address all its functions and secure them in the appropriate way, which
is the whole point of setting it up. It is not for me, at this stage,
to prejudge or determine how it will do that, because that is a
commission responsibility. However, we obviously want to ensure that
that responsibility is met.</div>
<a name="07100945000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">In most cases, it is highly
likely that the additional effort that we have discussed would result
in no change, because the majority of non-resident parents do not
manipulate their income, and the information obtained from HMRC
regarding their financial position can, as I have said, be safely
relied on.</div><a name="07100945000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">The final
provision in the group is new clause 14, which also imposes obligations
in relation to obtaining information. It would require all Departments,
non-departmental public bodies and the courts to provide the commission
with information when a request is made. Such a request would have to
be made for the purpose of enabling the commission to make a
maintenance calculation or to locate the non-resident parent, but only
where maintenance is
unpaid.</div><a name="07100945000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to
assure hon. Members that the commission will continue to be able to
request information from a wide range of sources, including employers,
accountants, local authorities, the Driver and Vehicle Licensing
Agency, the Prison Service and credit reference
agencies.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column267" />Column number: 267</div><a name="07100945000227"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100945000418"></a>Andrew
Selous:</b> On that point, I remember the hon. Member for
Hendon (Mr. Dismore), when he and I were on the Select
Committee on Work and Pensions in the last Parliament, putting to the
CSA&#146;s then chief executive the point that mobile phone companies
knew non-resident parents&#146; addresses when the CSA did not.
Forgive my ignorance, but will anything in the Bill enable CMEC to
require a mobile phone company, or any other utility company, to
furnish a non-resident parent&#146;s
address?</div><a name="07100945000228"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100945000419"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:</b> The matter of the address is important, and I am
glad that the hon. Gentleman has raised it. At present, the answer to
his question is no. I would not want to pursue the matter via the
mobile phone companies, but we are looking at the possibility of making
further amendments to the Bill to introduce an obligation to report
addresses, so the issue is very much in our mind, and I am grateful to
the hon. Gentleman for raising
it.</div><a name="07100945000229"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100945000420"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> On sanctions, perhaps the Minister will elucidate
the following point. If somebody were to give inaccurate information,
they would clearly face sanctions. If, however, they were to refuse to
give information and did a vanishing act, although they were still
living in the house and the letter had been correctly delivered, would
that be a breach of the law? Of course, there might be indirect
sanctions against them in the form of the imposition of a maintenance
order. If such a refusal is not a breach of the law, is that another
area that should be tightened
up?</div><a name="07100945000230"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100945000421"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:</b> As I understand it, it is a breach of the
law&#151;unless I am subsequently corrected. It is an existing power,
and there is a potential fine. That is already in statute, and that
power will transfer to the new commission. Therefore it is an offence
not to provide the requested
information.</div><a name="07100945000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">Schedule
6 will also allow the commission access to information held by Her
Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs, the Department for Work and
Pensions and the Northern Ireland Office. Existing provisions already
enable parents to disclose information relating to certain proceedings
to the agency, if it is required for the purposes of making a statutory
maintenance
calculation.</div><a name="07100945000232"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100945000422"></a>Paul
Rowen:</b><b class="B"> </b>I have listened to the Minister&#146;s
reassurances. On the amendments, I accept the information and
assurances that he has given, but I want to press new clause 6 to a
vote.</div><a name="07100945000233"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100945000423"></a>The
Chairman:</b> We cannot have a vote on new clause 6 now, but
we can have one later on. I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that
indication.</div><a name="07100945000234"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100945000424"></a>Andrew

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100945000426"></a>Andrew
Selous:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 115, in
schedule 4, page 63, line 6, leave
out paragraph
2.</div><a name="07100945000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">Schedule 4 is
really what clause 16 is all about. Although we have had considerable
debate on clause 16, it is only two lines long. Schedule 4, to which it
refers, is the real meat of our discussions and gives effect to the
important changes that we have been debating within the last
group.</div><a name="07100945000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
115 is a probing amendment. I do not want to remove paragraph 2 from
the Bill, but I want to use this opportunity to put a number of
questions to the Minister about whether the move from net to gross
income and the other measures in schedule 4 will achieve greater
simplicity and operational
efficiencies.</div><a name="07100945000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of
the big changes that schedule 4 gives effect to is the use of HMRC data
from the latest tax year for which HMRC has details, which is a
sensible move. However, as has been brought out in the previous debate,
much will depend on the sources of information within HMRC to which
CMEC has access and how that information will be accessed. It is worth
noting the number of different IT systems within HMRC, all of which
will have to work well and communicate seamlessly with CMEC, as I
believe happens in Australia where there is a direct data link with the
Australian transport agency. The Minister knows that Australia is one
of my favourite countries when we discuss child support. Perhaps the
Minister will tell us what he and his officials have learned that he
thinks will be of use with regard to data sharing and direct computer
links between HMRC and CMEC.</div>
<a name="07100945000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">On those different IT systems,
it is worth putting on the record that there are different systems
within HMRC for dealing with self-assessment cases, pay-as-you-earn,
repayment of taxes owed, national insurance and tax credits, of which I
will have more to say later in our
discussions.</div><a name="07100945000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">Questions
arise from the combination of earnings from self-employment and from
employment. How will that work? What will happen when someone has more
than one job on which they pay tax through PAYE? HMRC does not
routinely link PAYE records in cases where a person has one or more
jobs simultaneously. HMRC collects information on employment-related
benefits that form part of gross income, but, again, that is collected
from employers through a different process from
PAYE.</div><a name="07100945000244"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100945000427"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> Will my hon. Friend give consideration to
circumstances that may still apply&#151;although there are rules to
deter the practice&#151;for individuals who park their income into a
corporate structure that may not actually be recorded as their personal
structure, although it may be available to
them?</div>
<a name="07100945000245"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100945000428"></a>Andrew
Selous:</b> My hon. Friend is absolutely right to raise that
point, but I think that you would rule me out of order, Mr.
Chope, if I went into a detailed discussion of it now. In future
sittings, the Committee will discuss a series of amendments that
address those issues. However, as ever, my hon. Friend is absolutely
right, and he has yet again put his finger on a key issue 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column269" />Column number: 269</div>that we must get right, namely the ability of some non-resident parents
to structure their affairs in a way that may be perfectly legal as far
as the tax authorities are concerned, but is frankly morally wrong, and
should, in my view, be legally wrong when it concerns the avoidance of
maintenance payments to children who need them and are entitled to
them.</div><a name="07100945000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">Returning
to the IT challenges that will face both HMRC and CMEC, paragraph 4.9
of child support White Paper, which was published in December 2006,
states:</div><a name="07100945000278"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Discussions
between the Department for Work and Pensions and HM Revenue &amp;
Customs about the precise configuration of the data gateways to support
the necessary movement of information to C-MEC are under
way.&#148;</div><a name="07100945000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">Can the Minister
give us an update on those discussions? I appreciate that due to
commercial confidentiality there are limits to what he can say, but it
is important to get it right. It is also important that members of the
Committee are fully briefed as to the Minister&#146;s intentions and
what work has been undertaken in this area so
far.</div>
<a name="07100945000293"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.45
pm</div><a name="07100945000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
115 touches on issues regarding what the rules will be as far as HMRC
is concerned, and the sharing of income information from a non-resident
parent with the parent with care. At the moment, HMRC quite properly
has a duty of confidentiality to all taxpayers. Will that be the case
going forward with its new role where the parent with care is
concerned? It is a perfectly legitimate argument to say that the parent
with care has an interest in having information about the non-resident
parent&#146;s income. That is particularly true given that the
standard line at the moment from the CSA to parents with care in cases
of suspected under-declaration of income to reduce maintenance is,
&#147;Go and find it out yourself. Be your own private
detective.&#148; Those are the sorts of conversations&#151;perhaps
not those exact words, but along those lines&#151;that the CSA has
with our constituents. Those issues are important and need to be teased
out.</div><a name="07100945000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">If I may make my
final comments on the amendment. I recently met officials from EDS, a
company that will be familiar to the Minister, as it is on the verge of
being a wholly owned subsidiary of the Department&#151;there is
certainly a close working relationship between them, although there is
nothing necessarily wrong with that. Some 3,000 of its staff work for
the Department. In a recent letter to me, EDS said
that</div><a name="07100945000279"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;until the Bill has
received Royal Assent and the commission is established, it is unclear
what system will be needed and who therefore might choose to bid for
the contract (or contracts).&#148;</div>
<a name="07100945000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is legally correct. Of
course, no one would expect EDS to say anything else, because there is
legal form, but I would be incredulous, as would all Committee members,
if detailed advance discussions were not held about the IT that we will
need to make the system work. I am not asking the Minister to breach
commercial confidentiality, but given that a range of
Departments&#151;not just the Minister&#146;s&#151;have a
chequered history with large-scale IT contracts in recent years, I
cannot overemphasise how fundamental that is to CMEC&#146;s
functioning smoothly and being the success that we all want it to
be.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100945000429"></a>Paul
Rowen:</b> The hon. Gentleman has given a succinct review of
the issues and concerns addressed by the amendment. I remind the
Minister of the bold statement in the White Paper on the announcement
of plans for the new child maintenance
system:</div><a name="07100945000280"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Using
information from a single known source could significantly reduce the
time it takes to make a maintenance calculation. For parents, this
increases the prospect that they will receive child maintenance shortly
after the initial application. For the body responsible for
administering child maintenance, it offers the prospects of clearing
initial applications much more swiftly, so that a backlog of
applications does not build
up.&#148;</div><a name="07100945000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is a
laudable aim. The hon. Gentleman has asked&#151;I hope that the
Minister can give us a response&#151;what will be done to the IT
systems to allow that process to happen. At the moment, as he has
pointed out, HMRC operates a number of IT systems that do not talk to
each other. What steps is he taking to ensure that a single gateway
will be operational as soon as the new arrangements are implemented, so
that information can be transferred from HMRC about various income
sources&#151;whether tax credits, dividends or PAYE&#151;to ensure
an accurate assessment? If we do not have that assurance, the
statement, although laudable, will end up like much else in the CSA in
the past&#151;something aimed for but never
delivered.</div><a name="07100945000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
second point relates to the earlier argument about income data sharing.
The Minister stated that the parent with care should provide evidence.
Will he or HMRC permit the sharing of the non-resident parent&#146;s
income data with the parent with care, or with one of the information
agencies advising and supporting them, to ensure that when an
application or claim is made, it will not fall between the stools, and
that the parent with care will be able to state clearly on the basis of
information provided by HMRC that a reassessment needs to be made? That
will give the parent with care much more confidence to pursue claims.
Often the forms and paperwork are complicated and not intelligible to
most people. If that information is revealed, it will make parents with
care much more determined to pursue child maintenance, where the
non-resident parent is clearly seeking to avoid it. I hope that the
Minister will update us on those issues and ensure that there will be a
workable
gateway.</div><a name="07100945000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
work is HMRC doing to ensure that its systems respond to one another,
which they do not currently do? Will the Minister ensure that the
information transfers to the Department for Work and Pensions in a
single stream? If that has to be done manually, as happens at present,
a backlog will accumulate.</div>
<a name="07100945000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">My second
point is about HMRC sharing data, subject to certain privacy rules.
When a child is involved, there is a clear case for making information
available, so will the Minister ensure that HMRC makes data available
to the parent with care to assist them in the pursuit of their
claim?</div>
<a name="07100945000256"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100945000430"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:</b> Naturally, the discussion of the amendment
strays into the question of IT, because it is crucial to ensure that
that works. I am grateful to both the hon. Members for South-West
Bedfordshire and for Rochdale for their comments on the matter. It is
of course important that the connection works, and I shall attempt to
give reassurances.</div>
<a name="07100945000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
already a fair amount of data transfer between HMRC and the DWP and it
works smoothly, particular in respect of information received from
taxpayers 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column271" />Column number: 271</div>who have completed their self-assessment PAYE forms. I also reassure the
hon. Gentlemen that the discussions about evolving the system so that
the necessary platforms are in place for the transfer of data envisaged
under the commissioner arrangements are well advanced and have been
ongoing for some
time.</div>
<a name="07100945000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of course,
the Government seek the same reassurances as the hon. Gentlemen on the
robustness of the system. It is our duty to lay down the specifications
to ensure that there are no unnecessary barriers to prevent its
working. The issue of who is contracted to do the job is an entirely
separate issue on which I ought not comment. Contractors may have their
views about that situation, but they would say that, would they not? We
are clear about our obligations, the specifications and about ensuring
that the system is there and that the data transfer required to make it
work will function and run smoothly. All I should say at this
point&#151;this is a public sitting&#151;is that the discussions
are advanced.</div><a name="07100945000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
recognise the principle behind the amendment and agree that we ought to
consider whether the commission should have a means of dealing with
non-resident parents who intentionally deprive themselves of income to
reduce their maintenance liability. However, we must consider the point
at which it is most appropriate to take account of intentional
deprivation. If the power were included in the main scheme, the
commission would be required to decide whether an observed reduction
was intentional or reasonable in the case of every non-resident parent
whose income fell, which would cause significant delays in processing
of cases.</div> <a name="07100945000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
the Secretary of State currently has powers to make such regulations
and has done so for the 1993 scheme, the powers were not used for the
2000 scheme for the sake of simplicity. We believe that that remains
the right approach. To introduce regulations to tackle
the small number of non-resident parents who
successfully deprive themselves of income into the main scheme would
add unnecessary complication and additional delays to the process of
finalising a maintenance calculation and ensuring the flow of money to
children. If the powers were applied to the main scheme, we would risk
creating considerable additional work for the commission by, in effect,
casting doubt on the income information supplied by all non-resident
parents. However, if we decide to take a power to treat non-resident
parents as earning income when they intentionally deprive themselves of
income, the variations regime is the right mechanism by which to deal
with those rare and complicated cases.</div>
<a name="07100945000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have a power to introduce
grounds for a variation to cover intentional deprivation of
income. Paragraph 9 of schedule 4 to the Bill will carry
forward powers to estimate income when information relating to a
non-resident parent&#146;s income is believed to be inadequate or
unreliable.</div>
<a name="07100945000262"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100945000431"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> I was just wondering about circumstances in which
the Inland Revenue may have a taxpayer under investigation because it
feels that their income has been systematically under-reported. The
amendment is mainly about the system for the automatic transfer of
data. To put it simply, will there be powers for the Inland Revenue 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column272" />Column number: 272</div>to tip off the Department in order to generate the examination of a
variation of a maintenance
order?</div><a name="07100945000263"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100945000432"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:</b> That matter will be dealt with
by the annual settlement part of the regime, because the assessments
will be based on the previous year&#146;s tax liability. If Her
Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs were investigating someone and
found that there had been an irregularity or underpayment of tax, it
would recoup that by bills in subsequent years. There will be a
carry-over from the tax assessment into the maintenance assessment by
the mechanism of fixed-term maintenance agreements, which we envisage
the commission operating based on the previous year&#146;s tax data.
There should always be automatic catch-up of any correction that HMRC
is
doing.</div><a name="07100945000264"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100945000433"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> I am grateful to the Minister
for elucidating that process, because I was not aware of it. Does he
agree that there is huge sensitivity, which has been exemplified by
constituency casework, about the build-up of arrears of maintenance? It
occurs to me that if the Inland Revenue is looking for a substantial
recovery of unpaid tax, the recovery of unpaid maintenance will equally
be at issue. Will he give some consideration to the relative priority
of those two claims in relation to whether the revenue will go to the
children or
elsewhere?</div><a name="07100945000265"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100945000434"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:</b> I do not want to get the two things tangled up
too much. It is important to remember that moving to a system of annual
awards based on gross income will automatically fold
information that HMRC gains about income into the maintenance system. I
do not want to over-complicate the system, because we have been there
and know the problems that that creates. I think that the degree of
automaticity between HMRC data and maintenance that we envisage in the
new system will cover the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
concerns.</div><a name="07100945000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are currently meeting stakeholders, including One
Parent Families, to discuss the best way to deal with such cases and
whether we can make such a power work in practice. We will also take
advice from the new commission before coming forward with secondary
legislation. Depending on the outcome of those discussions, we will use
existing powers to make regulations to deal with cases in which
non-resident parents intentionally deprive themselves of income as part
of the variations regime. Having given what I hope are sufficient
reassurances, I hope that the hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire
will withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="07100945000267"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="07100945000435"></a>Andrew
