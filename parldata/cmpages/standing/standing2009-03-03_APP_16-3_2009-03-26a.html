<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032772000519"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b><b class="B"> </b>It is good to see you fresh and alert,
Mr. Chope, on this Friday morning. I just spent half an hour
asleep in the office, among the moths, and I now realise that MPs do
not need a second
home.</div><a name="09032772000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
88 relates to proposed new section 550ZB(6)(b) in the
Education Act 1996, which requires that a person carrying out a
search</div>
<a name="09032772000434"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;must be of the
same sex as
P&#148;,</div><a name="09032772000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">P
being the pupil being searched. Subsection (4)(b) states that, if off
premises, a search may be carried out only if the member of staff
has</div><a name="09032772000435"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;lawful
control or charge of
P.&#148;</div><a name="09032772000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
exemption we seek would be for either a small school where the teachers
are of one sex, and that sex is different from that of the pupil being
searched, or a school trip with no members of staff of the same sex as
that of the pupil being searched.</div>
<a name="09032772000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Association of School and College Leaders raised the following
concern:</div><a name="09032772000436"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
believe that detailed provision for conducting searches should not be
on the face of the Bill... There may be occasions (particularly in
small schools or on small school trips) when it is important to search
but all the conditions cannot be fulfilled. There needs to be some
flexibility if senior school leaders are not to be exposed to risk of
legal action when doing their duty. Under the Bill a minimum of four
staff (two of each gender) must accompany any school trip where there
may be a possibility of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column840" />Column number: 840</div>drugs, alcohol or weapons being carried or bought - clearly this is
impracticable and would put an end to many school trips. Given that
this is a reserve power for use in emergencies, we think there should
be some allowance for emergency use when there is a risk of serious
disorder or physical
danger&#148;.</div><a name="09032772000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is a pragmatic amendment to an important clause giving powers to school
staff to search pupils suspected of having on them a prohibited
item.</div><a name="09032772000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
89 relates to subsection (6)(c), which states that
someone</div><a name="09032772000437"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;may
carry out the search only in the presence of another member of staff of
the same sex as
P.&#148;</div><a name="09032772000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment is similar to the previous amendment, but concerns situations
in which there is only one member of staff of the same sex as the pupil
being searched. The requirement is that there be more than one.
Amendment 91 would leave out line 33 on page 131. That line
just reads: &#147;P; and&#148;. It deals with a search of a
pupil&#146;s property in the presence of the pupil. Subsection (7)
states:</div><a name="09032772000438"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;P&#146;s
possessions may not be searched under section 550ZA except in the
presence of...P...and...another member of
staff.&#148;</div><a name="09032772000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is also of concern to the Association of School and College Leaders,
which
stated:</div><a name="09032772000439"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
are concerned, however, that the effect of these clauses is that no
belongings may be searched except in the presence of the pupil
concerned. There are occasions when a school may, for example, find it
necessary to have a general locker or bag search while pupils are in
class to find stolen or forbidden items without arousing the suspicion
of the pupils concerned. To have every child present while this is done
would be wholly impracticable. The term &#145;possessions&#146; is
defined as including any goods over which a pupil has or appears to
have control. This is helpful in preventing the pupil from saying
&#145;it&#146;s not mine, it&#146;s my friend&#146;s&#146;,
but we seek clarification that the term &#145;possessions&#146;
does not cover pupils&#146; lockers or desks. We believe that there
should be a distinction between the power to search clothing with force
and the search for
possessions.&#148;</div><a name="09032772000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
would be helpful if the Minister responded to that question about the
definition of possessions in the Bill. Alternatively, if the Minister
accepts amendment 91, which would delete line 33, that would remove the
problem.</div><a name="09032772000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
amendment 96 would essentially remove the same provision for college
students, which requires a person of the same sex to be present while
their belongings are searched. Again, there may be occasions on which
the college authorities need to search bags or lockers to find items
such as drugs without wishing to alert the student under suspicion to
the search. It would be perfectly pragmatic to remove that prescription
from the Bill. I look forward to the Minister&#146;s
response.</div><a name="09032772000050"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032772000520"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> May I welcome you back to the Chair, Mr.
Chope, and say good morning to Committee members and those listening to
our proceedings in the Gallery? May I particularly thank the staff of
the two Departments and the staff of the House who have remained with
us? They have been extremely patient in spite of the fact that they
have probably had to deal with unusual circumstances and have perhaps
slept in places where they have not slept before. That is very much
appreciated.</div><a name="09032772000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments are important. I confess that I considered tabling something
similar. These requirements seem onerous. There are concerns that
schools are becoming inclined to shy away from school trips because of
their real and perceived health and safety obligations. Some of those
concerns may not be genuine, and schools may 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column841" />Column number: 841</div>have excessive concerns over the risk of legal action, but some concerns
are genuine, and they relate to issues such as those specified in these
provisions. They are highlighted particularly in the earlier amendments
tabled by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and
Littlehampton.</div><a name="09032772000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">Sad
though it is, I understand that we live in an age when these powers
must be exercised very carefully by school staff. Their activities are
open to great scrutiny, and claims are sometimes made by pupils and
others about inappropriate activity by staff. I appreciate the need for
proper protections not only for pupils but for staff members who could
be at risk of having their reputations impugned. That is what caused me
to shy away from my natural inclination to try to amend these
provisions to make them more reasonable. I am attracted to the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s earlier amendments because they focus on small
schools or schools with a restricted number of teachers of one or both
sexes. In that situation, there is a particular reason for providing
greater flexibility than we might otherwise, and for ensuring that the
reasonable actions of teaching staff are possible and that we do not
inadvertently deter schools from taking their pupils on school trips,
where such issues often
arise.</div><a name="09032772000053"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032772000521"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> The existing legislation on the powers to
search for knives and other offensive weapons includes a number of
important safeguards to ensure that power is not used
inappropriately.</div>
<a name="09032772000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before I go
any further with my remarks, however, I must beg your indulgence,
Mr. Chope. Hon. Members may have noticed that the hon.
Member for Plymouth, Devonport was not with us last week. Her father
was very seriously ill, and I regret to inform the Committee that he
has since died. He was previously an hon. Member, and I am sure that
the Committee will wish to pass on its condolences.</div>
<a name="09032772000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
safeguards include a requirement that the person conducting the search
must be of the same sex as the learner, and that the search must be
carried out in the presence of another staff member who is also the
same sex as the learner. They also require that searches of the
learner&#146;s possessions are conducted in the presence of the
learner and a second member of staff. Several of the safeguards were
introduced during the passage of the Violent Crime Reduction Act 2006,
in response to concerns about human rights issues, and I understand why
hon. Members would wish to remove them in certain circumstances.
However, they are important safeguards that are intended to protect the
learner and the member of staff conducting the search.</div>
<a name="09032772000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">One instance
that the hon. Members for Yeovil and for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton
both mentioned was school visits, but our guidance on those says that
if a power to search is required, people should call the police. Most
secondary schools and colleges, which are much more likely to use the
power, will have a mix of staff, so it is likely that the issue of not
having staff of the same gender as learners will apply only in primary
schools, and we do not think that that justifies removing the
safeguards from the entire school and college system.</div>
<a name="09032772000057"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032772000522"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> The hon. Lady will have seen statistics that show
the very small proportion of male teachers in primary schools. I do not
have the data here, but it is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column842" />Column number: 842</div>very likely that a significant number of even medium-sized primary
schools will have no male members of staff, although they will, of
course, have male children. What does the Minister envisage in those
circumstances? Is she saying that the power will not apply to that
significant number of primary schools?</div>
<a name="09032772000058"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032772000523"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> The word that we need to use is
&#147;proportionate&#148;, and we should also point out that the
provision is a power, not a duty. If it is not appropriate for a school
or college to undertake a search, it is not required to do so. The
powers are much more likely to be used in secondary schools and
colleges, and that is why, on balance, we should not remove the
safeguards.</div>
<a name="09032772000059"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032772000524"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> The Minister must be a little out of touch if she
has not been reading about&#151;or, given her position, heard first
hand&#151;that violence is increasing among very young children.
There is, therefore, a strong likelihood that they will possess
contraband, so I am surprised that she uses
&#147;proportionate&#148; and &#147;power, not a duty&#148; in
relation to the clause. There seems to be a hole in the clause, because
she admits that the provision is not applicable to a significant number
of primary schools, where the amount of poor behaviour, violence and,
undoubtedly, children with banned and illegal products, is
increasing.</div>
<a name="09032772000060"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032772000525"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> The other point is that we are discussing a
certain power without consent, but schools can, of course, require
children to turn out their pockets. The safeguards are important, and
we have come to the view that we need to keep them in the
system.</div>
<a name="09032772000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is worth
noting that the requirement that the learner be present while his
possessions are searched is to protect not only learners&#146; basic
human rights, but the member of staff conducting the search against
accusations of theft or of planting evidence. Failure to comply with
that requirement might render any evidence unreliable.
&#147;Possessions&#148; covers lockers, and schools can make it a
condition of having a locker that pupils consent to a general search of
lockers.</div>
<a name="09032772000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">I appreciate
hon. Members&#146; reservations about the approach, but, by
enshrining those important safeguards in the Bill, we will ensure that
the powers are used appropriately and protect the rights of staff and
learners. I invite the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09032772000478"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">8.30

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032772000526"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> That is not really a satisfactory response.
Essentially, the Minister is saying that this provision has been put in
the Bill to give teachers what she believes is an important power.
However, it is only a power, not a duty, and should not be used where
primary schools have no male members of staff or if there is a school
trip where there are no male members of staff. In those
circumstances&#151;be it in the Peak district, the middle of the
countryside and so on&#151;staff in charge of pupils should call the
police. That would no doubt be the Minister&#146;s advice in a
primary school where there were genuine grounds for suspecting that a
male pupil had in his possession something that could potentially harm
another child or teacher, such as an offensive weapon. In those
circumstances she recommends that the primary school calls the police
to deal with the five, seven or nine-year-old.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column843" />Column number: 843</div><a name="09032772000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">In our school
system, we are seeing increasing numbers of examples of police being
called out to deal with fights in the playground&#151;a direction of
travel that the public do not want. They do not want nine-year-olds
arrested and taken to the police station for hitting another child.
With that policy we are going down a pathway that potentially
criminalises young children&#151;an experience that could traumatise
them.</div>
<a name="09032772000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was never
naughty as a child, so I would not know what happens, but I understand
from others that even being sent to the head teacher or out of the
classroom is a traumatic experience for a young child. Imagine what it
would be like if a policeman suddenly appears and asks to see a six or
seven-year-old child in a primary school. It seems bizarre. It is
particularly frustrating, because the problem could easily be solved by
the amendments, which do not put a coach and horses through the
legislation but merely make a small exemption for circumstances where
there are small primary schools or school trips with no male teachers.
I am surprised that the hon. Lady does not accept the amendment and I
am tempted to press it to a vote. On the other hand, we want to make
progress, so this might be something that we can discuss again on
Report.</div>
<a name="09032772000066"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09032772000527"></a><b class="B">Bill
Wiggin</b> (Leominster) (Con): As a parent of young children,
I cannot imagine how horrified I would be if, having signed the consent
forms and allowed my child to go off to the Lake district or wherever,
I found that the police had been summoned to such an event, even if the
child in question was not concerned at all. That is absolutely wrong.
It sends all the wrong signals and does not provide the sort of
confidence that parents expect. Does my hon. Friend agree that such an
issue should be discussed on the Floor of the House? It is a serious
matter that other colleagues might wish to discuss.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032772000531"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> The amendment was suggested by the National Union of
Teachers, and Liberal Democrat colleagues have subscribed to it. It is
a joint tour de force, and as such I am sure that it will find favour
with the
Minister,</div><a name="09032772000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">Essentially,
the NUT says that although it is appreciated that the provision is
intended to confer a power, there are circumstances in which it may be
found that there is a legal duty to exercise a power when it is
necessary to do so in order to protect children from harm. The NUT
acknowledges that there are situations in which teachers might need a
power to search and would wish to have that power clearly defined so
that they need not fear contravention of the Human Rights Act or
prosecution for an offence against the person.</div>
<a name="09032772000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
teachers are not law enforcement officers, and they have no reason to
risk assault by insisting on searching a pupil who is capable of a
violent reaction. They say that their power to search should be linked
directly to their responsibility for the health, safety and welfare of
pupils under their supervision and care. Teachers have serious worries
about using powers to search or restrain pupils, and the law tends to
be uncertain for them. Section 96(1) of the Education and Inspections
Act 2006 uses the word &#147;proportionate&#148;, and the burden is
on the teacher to prove that his or her action was proportionate and
therefore lawful.</div>
<a name="09032772000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is too
much of a burden, and the consequence is that teachers often do not
wish to use the powers. That is a great shame. The powers are useful in
maintaining order in schools, but they can also be important in
protecting the child in question as well as other children, teachers
and staff in a school. The amendments would be useful in crystallising
the legal position. It would be interesting to hear the
Government&#146;s response, and I am sure the NUT would be grateful
to hear
it.</div><a name="09032772000080"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032772000532"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I support the amendments, obviously, as we have also
signed them. I commend the National Union of Teachers for its assiduous
lobbying of both Opposition parties. You will be grateful to hear that
I will not repeat the arguments, Mr. Chope, as I have the
same briefing note as the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and
Littlehampton and am therefore likely to make similar arguments.
However, I would like to address one point on which the NUT raised
concerns and suggested amendments. Neither he nor I tabled those
amendments, but they relate to amendment 359, which he underplayed with
typical modesty.</div>
<a name="09032772000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 359
deals with what an individual should do with confiscated items. We have
not signed up to the amendment; it was tabled by the hon. Gentleman and
his party colleagues alone. Essentially, it relates to page
132 of the Bill, and would omit a large chunk of the lines 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column845" />Column number: 845</div>between 12 and 40, inserting a subsection (4) placing a responsibility
on an individual who seizes any item other than alcohol and its
container to deliver the item to a police constable as soon as is
practical. In other words, any items confiscated must be handed over to
a police constable, unless they are
alcohol.</div>
<a name="09032772000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is not
what the Bill says at the moment, which is why the hon. Gentleman is
seeking to amend it. The Bill contains provisions that make it
necessary to hand weapons over to a police officer, but in the case of
controlled drugs, the individual who confiscates them has a choice
either to deliver them to a police constable as soon as practical or
dispose of them if the person thinks that there is good reason to do
so. In relation to stolen articles there is also a provision either to
deliver those to a police constable or to return them to their
owners.</div><a name="09032772000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
can understand why the provisions are included. They are included for
the sort of reasons that the hon. Gentleman and I often raise: because
the Government probably do not want there excessive bureaucracy to fall
on those people who confiscate items. For example, the provisions allow
the head teacher, teachers or other individuals concerned to return a
stolen item&#151;presumably, some minor item that belongs to a pupil
or an item in respect of which its ownership is clear&#151;directly
to their
owner.</div><a name="09032772000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
assume also that the provisions in subsection (4) on page 132 are
designed to allow a teacher or head teacher who confiscates a small
amount of drugs essentially to just flush them down the toilet or
dispose of them in a waste paper bin, or by some other process.
However, the National Union of Teachers has raised an issue that
amendment 359 touches on: whether it is sensible to allow such
flexibility and freedom. The note that the NUT provided to the hon.
Gentleman and me, and to my colleagues, said that it believes that the
Bill</div><a name="09032772000440"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;should
restrict the seizure, retention and disposal
powers&#148;</div><a name="09032772000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">and
that,</div><a name="09032772000441"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;since
teachers are not law enforcement officers and therefore, should not be
deciding whether to dispose of property they confiscate other than
perhaps
alcohol&#148;,</div><a name="09032772000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">it
is concerned about the provisions, particularly in relation to drugs
and also, to some extent, in relation to stolen
items.</div><a name="09032772000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
did not table a load of amendments ourselves, straight off, because I
anticipated the Minister&#146;s response. This is one of the few
areas in which the Government do not want to add to the burden of
bureaucracy on schools and do not want to end up with some hugely
convoluted process whereby a mobile phone that has obviously been
stolen from another pupil has to be returned to the local police
station, or a tiny fraction of some drug has to be returned to the
police, who are likely to be supremely
uninterested.</div><a name="09032772000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are serious concerns about the circumstances in which individuals
should be returning items to police officers and under what
circumstances they should be handing them back. Those circumstances
have implications in respect of stolen items&#151;if people are
making judgments about who the ownership resides with&#151;and, in
respect of drugs, it most certainly has important significance, because
if the teacher or head teacher simply retains those drugs, particularly
if they have a significant market value, all sorts of accusations may
be made against them about improper behaviour.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column846" />Column number: 846</div><a name="09032772000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">I invite the
Minister, in responding to amendment 359, to say a little
bit about the Government&#146;s thinking here and how these
discretionary powers should be
used.</div><a name="09032772000090"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032772000533"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> Amendments 354 to 356 relate to the role of
school security staff. Collectively, the amendments would allow a
member of school security staff to seize items found during a search,
even if that member of security staff did not conduct the search, and
would restrict the power to seize items found during a search that are
suspected of being evidence of an offence to school security staff
only.</div><a name="09032772000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have proposed this new legislation to strengthen all schools&#146;
disciplinary authority, not just those with security staff. Removing a
teacher&#146;s authority to seize items found during a search,
whether those are prohibited or suspected of being evidence of an
offence, lessens the effectiveness of this power, which is not
something that I wish to
see.</div><a name="09032772000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause enables members of the security staff to undertake a search when
the head teacher feels it is appropriate and authorises them to do so.
Furthermore, the person undertaking the search should be able to make
the decision on how to deal with any items found during that search,
whether they are a member of the school teaching staff or security
staff. Amendments 359 and 357 would require that where a person seizes
anything other than alcohol they must deliver it to a police constable
as soon as is reasonably practical. We would not want to restrict the
handling of all seized prohibited items in that way, although I agree
that that should be required in relation to knives and other offensive
weapons. However, I do not agree that that is always necessary or
desirable with regard to some stolen articles and controlled drugs. It
is appropriate for the person seizing such articles to have discretion
about whether to contact the
police.</div><a name="09032772000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause requires that controlled drugs and stolen articles must be
delivered to a police constable as soon as it is reasonably practical,
unless the person who has seized it considers that there is a good
reason not to take that course of action. The hon. Member for Yeovil
spoke about drugs. Our Department&#146;s drugs guidance for schools
states that the law permits school staff to take temporary possession
of a substance suspected of being an illegal drug for the purposes of
preventing an offence in relation to that drug being committed or
continued, providing all reasonable steps are taken to destroy the drug
or deliver it to a person lawfully entitled to take custody of
it.</div><a name="09032772000479"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">8.45
am</div><a name="09032772000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have anecdotal evidence that many schools simply flush small amounts of
drugs down the toilet, rather than involve the police. Our policy
intention is to allow that practice to continue. We are also aware that
in some areas, schools and police forces have locally agreed protocols
for dealing with that sort of issue, and we want those sorts of
arrangements to continue. It is also our intention to avoid situations
in which the police might be called to a school to deal with trivial
incidents, such as a stolen pencil. In coming to their decision, the
person will have to have regard for our Department&#146;s guidance
and we will ensure that our guidance is clear on that issue.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column847" />Column number: 847</div><a name="09032772000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments 397
and 358 relate to the defence for school staff who act lawfully in
confiscating, retaining or disposing of items belonging to pupils.
Under the current law, members of staff are required to act lawfully
and reasonably in their treatment of pupils. The legislation places the
onus on the school staff member to show that the confiscation,
retention or disposal of an item is lawful. Seizing, retaining and
disposing of a pupil&#146;s property is an infringement of their
rights under article 8 and article 1 of protocol 1 of the European
convention on human rights. Therefore, any legislation permitting that
and providing a defence in the case of damage or loss must be clear,
justifiable and proportionate. I am sure that hon. Members would agree
that there must remain an overriding obligation on school staff to act
lawfully and reasonably. I therefore invite the hon. Member for Bognor
Regis and Littlehampton to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09032772000096"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032772000540"></a>The

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032772000541"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> The clause is another important provision. Amendment
86 would take out lines 36 to 38 on page 136, which actually
means removing proposed new section 93A(1)(a), which states that the
governing body of a school in England must ensure that a procedure is
in place for</div>
<a name="09032772000442"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;recording each
significant incident in which a member of the staff uses force on a
pupil for whom education is being provided.&#148;</div>
<a name="09032772000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment would
remove the requirement to record those
incidents.</div><a name="09032772000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
210 would simply add a phrase to the end of proposed new section
93A(1)(b). As currently drafted the Bill provides that the governing
body must ensure that a procedure is in place for</div>
<a name="09032772000443"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;reporting each
use of force incident...to each parent of the pupil as soon as
practicable after the
incident.&#148;</div><a name="09032772000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
leaves no discretion for a head teacher or the governing body of a
school on reporting an incident to parents. I can understand the
purpose of the clause. Of course, if a child is physically restrained
at school by a member of staff, a parent has the right to know that has
happened. I am aware of incidents in some of my hon. Friends&#146;
constituencies in which force has been used, but no report was made to
the parents of the child, and it caused a massive row when the parents
eventually found out. There is thus a case for ensuring that all
incidents in which force is used are reported to the parents. Amendment
210 does not change that. It just adds the phrase</div>
<a name="09032772000444"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;subject to the
discretion and professional judgement of the
headteacher.&#148;</div><a name="09032772000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
reason for that requirement of discretion is that there may be
circumstances in which reporting the use of physical force may cause
that child even further problems at home. It may even lead to abuse at
home. That was the view of Chris Keates from the National Association
of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers. In our evidence session on 5
March, he
said:</div><a name="09032772000445"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Though
it is right to report incidents of this sort to parents, we think it is
important that the school has the flexibility to determine how that is
done. For example, there could be a child who is at risk of abuse at
home, and reporting directly to the parent about an incident might put
that child at even further risk of abuse from the family. The school
must have the flexibility to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column849" />Column number: 849</div>say that it would report to the parent but through an agency that might
already be dealing with the family, such as social services. So,
reporting to parents is the one area where we think clarification would
be helpful.&#148;</div>
<a name="09032772000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the Minister
respond to the important point made by Chris Keates about whether some
guidance or clarity might be provided to schools? However, I cannot see
how guidance could overrule the very explicit provision that the school
must report the incident to parents. That was also the view of John
Bangs of the National Union of Teachers. He
said:</div><a name="09032772000446"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;If
a head teacher decides not to report a significant incident to a parent
because they believe that to do so endangers the child because the
parent may take it out physically on that child when that child returns
home, you are caught in a bind. Do you seek to protect the child
because the incident is over and done with&#151;the restraint has
taken place&#151;yet the parent is likely to exacerbate it? We do not
know where this has come from and we are concerned about
it.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report, Apprenticeships,
Skills, Children and Learning Public Bill Committee, </i>5 March; c.
88-89,
Q221.]</div><a name="09032772000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
concern could be quite easily addressed if the Government were to
accept amendment
210.</div><a name="09032772000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
87 takes out lines 3 and 4 on page 137, which, in essence, is taking
out subsection (3) from proposed new section 93A, which
states:</div><a name="09032772000447"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
procedure must require that a record of a use of force incident is made
in writing as soon as practicable after the
incident.&#148;</div><a name="09032772000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
proposal is similar to amendment 86, which removes the requirement to
record such incidents at
all.</div><a name="09032772000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
94 would add guidance to the clause. It
says:</div><a name="09032772000448"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Guidance
issued under subsection (4) must not advise the retention of incident
record forms beyond a period of three
years.&#148;</div><a name="09032772000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">Currently
the guidance says that any written record of use of force has to be
kept for 10 years, which seems an excessively long period to keep a
record. For a school to keep records of every incident for 10 years is
a large administrative
burden.</div><a name="09032772000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
ensure that the provisions are justified, it would be helpful for the
Minister to explain why existing guidance states that records must be
kept for 10 years. Most records are kept for six years&#151;certainly
those for tax purposes. Although the issue is far more serious than
tax, I cannot understand why it would be necessary to keep records for
such a long time. The concern is that the more administrative burdens
that are placed on schools that use powers to maintain order and
discipline, the less it is likely that teachers will use those powers.
We need to clarify the law, so that there is no risk that teachers
inadvertently sway beyond what the law
permits.</div><a name="09032772000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
need to make the law crisp and clear. We also need to make it simple to
administer and functional, which means reducing as far as possible the
administrative burdens that can deter a teacher from using powers that
are important if a school is to maintain law and order on its premises,
which is essential if children are to be happy and safe during their
school years. I await the Minister&#146;s response with
anticipation.</div><a name="09032772000123"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032772000542"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032772000543"></a>The
Chairman:</b> That is a very constructive suggestion from the
hon. Gentleman and I endorse that
approach.</div><a name="09032772000125"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032772000544"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I am grateful, Mr. Chope. However, the
bad news is that I think that this is an extremely important part of
the Bill, and one that we might come to regret if we pass the Bill in
its existing form. I would like to have a close look at the rationale
for the proposals in the Bill and to reflect on some of the evidence
that the Committee was given in the evidence sessions. If it cheers up
other members of the Committee, although I make no promises not to
speak again, this is the last big part of the Bill that I shall have a
real rampage across. I hope that Ministers will feel inspired by
that.</div><a name="09032772000126"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032772000545"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> Although some of us on the Government Benches
thought earlier that the hon. Gentleman was going on a
bit&#151;sometimes, we felt, almost deliberately&#151;it would come
as a source of considerable disappointment to many of us if he
curtailed his remarks on the rest of the Bill. The hon. Gentleman has
enlightened
us.</div><a name="09032772000127"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032772000546"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I am cheered. I was saddened when the Minister
implied yesterday that I was filibustering. He needs to speak to his
right hon. Friend the Minister for Schools and Learners, who would tell
him that is the normal length of my speeches on such occasions. In
fact, I thought that I was being rather brief, given the time of
night.</div><a name="09032772000128"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032772000547"></a>Emily
Thornberry:</b> If the length of time that the hon. Gentleman
was speaking last night is a normal amount, but he is having a full
&#147;rampage&#148; now, would he be able to give us a rough idea
of how long that might
take?</div><a name="09032772000129"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032772000548"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> The hon. Lady is safe to go for a cup of coffee, if
that is what her question is
about.</div><a name="09032772000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause is an important part of the Bill. The whole issue is whether
guidance that already exists for recording incidents of the use of
force should be made obligatory and a statutory duty on the school. We
took a lot of evidence about that during the Committee proceedings when
we took evidence from the teaching unions. The hon. Member for Bognor
Regis and Littlehampton, with typical fairness, acknowledged that one
of the teaching unions, the NASUWT, was broadly supportive of the
power, with some concerns and reservations. However, the two other
teaching unions from which we took evidence&#151;the NUT and the
Association of School and College Leaders&#151;provided powerful
evidence that supported the views that I had come to in any case, which
are very similar to those of the hon. Gentleman. Those views are that
the provision is not necessary and will be
counter-productive.</div><a name="09032772000480"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9
am</div><a name="09032772000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
had a debate about a particular case, on which I invited the leaders of
the three big unions to comment. We were talking about a situation in
which a teacher, seeing a fight between two students in the playground,
had to decide not only whether to intervene to break it up, but, if the
fight had to be broken up with the use of force that was mild but
caused one of the pupils to fall over and marginally scrape his or her
elbow on the ground, whether that would be regarded as significant
enough to have to be recorded&#151;significant enough for all the
paperwork to have to be filled in. The Government impact assessment
estimates that it will take 20 minutes 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column851" />Column number: 851</div>on average to do that work and that there will be a cost of &#163;9.22
per school per day for the cases that may have to be taken
up.</div><a name="09032772000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">Not
only will the incident have to be recorded as a statutory duty even
when there are considerable doubts about whether it was a significant
event, but the school will have to write to the parents of the child
against whom force was used&#151;I do not know whether that means
both the child who was pushed slightly and the child who happened to
fall over&#151;to notify them of that. That is not only unnecessary
and incredibly bureaucratic, but quite dangerous, because it is likely
to stimulate many complaints from parents, who probably will be
receiving letters about incidents of a quite minor nature. At the
moment, those parents would not be notified, but in the future, if this
becomes statutory, there will be much greater pressure on staff to
notify.</div><a name="09032772000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
contrast the excessive regulation in this case with the quite sensible
comments that the Minister made a few minutes ago about the need not to
be over-bureaucratic with schools when it comes to the confiscation of
items and their return to people from whom they may have been stolen,
or the disposal of small amounts of
drugs.</div><a name="09032772000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
well as the evidence that we took in Committee, there is an interesting
paper&#151;the Government impact assessment&#151;that discusses in
commendably concise terms the proposals in the clause. On pages 148 and
149, that assessment goes through the reasons why the proposals make
sense&#151;why it makes sense to move from guidance to a statutory
duty&#151;and it talks about the benefits to three groups of people.
We need to consider whether those benefits are real or whether there is
not a degree of living in a parallel universe where the statements and
claims that have been made just do not ring
true.</div><a name="09032772000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
first benefit from the changes is supposed to be
this:</div><a name="09032772000449"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Pupils
will feel safer in schools knowing that they and their fellow pupils
will only be restrained by use of force as is reasonable in the
circumstances to prevent a pupil from doing, or continuing to do, any
of the
following&#148;.</div><a name="09032772000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
assessment then lists the relevant
actions.</div><a name="09032772000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would be staggered if any pupil felt any safer after the Bill came into
being, because it is already the case that any responsible member of
staff would properly police incidents in schools in which there was
ill-discipline. They would break up fights. They already have clear
statutory guidance in that regard. It is not remotely likely that
pupils will feel
safer.</div><a name="09032772000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
fact, pupils might feel considerably less safe, and I shall explain
why. If I were a teacher, were on one side of the playground, saw a
particularly ferocious fight between two 15 or 16-year-old students and
had to decide whether to sprint over to the other side of the
playground and break that fight up, I would be no more inclined and
perhaps less inclined to do so&#151;I hope that the professional
teachers would be equally inclined, and no doubt they would
be&#151;if I knew that if I broke up that fight and used what might
be regarded as significant force, I would have to write all that down.
I would be less inclined to do it if I knew that I would have to take,
on the Government&#146;s own estimate, 20 minutes&#151;the cost
would be &#163;9.22&#151;to fill out some forms to specify what I
had done in case someone challenged whether I had used force in a
significant way.</div>
<a name="09032772000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would also
be very worried about the process of having to write to the parents of
those children to notify 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column852" />Column number: 852</div>them that I had taken that action. What possible response could there be
from parents to a formal letter or a telephone call from a school to
notify them that a teacher had had to use significant force or
restraint against their child? I would hope that the more responsible
among them might support the teachers and head teachers but I fear that
there are quite a few parents out there who instinctively take the side
of the child against the school. They have had bad experiences at
school themselves and are inclined to regard teachers and head teachers
as threats, rather than as people who are on their side. I fear that
this will lead to many more instances of parents making complaints to
schools and pursuing these matters in a way that would cause an
enormous amount of bureaucracy.</div>
<a name="09032772000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are told
that parents might feel more confident knowing that they would be
contacted if their child had been restrained at school. This is the
only area that I can see where there could be any benefit from the
measure. My hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole
raised the issue in the evidence session. That type of intervention may
be more frequent with special needs youngsters, and if such
interventions are being made, there should be a greater degree of
responsibility on the school to ensure that the parents know about
it.</div>
<a name="09032772000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">It may well
be that action should be being taken and it probably is being taken.
However, the provision should ensure that these types of problems are
being dealt with. Even then I am not necessarily sure that it outweighs
the other costs and whether in some of the more marginal cases parents
would want to be notified in that way. Concerns would be raised in a
way that led them to believe they were extremely serious when actually
the incident may not be serious at all.</div>
<a name="09032772000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other
group, the staff, who are supposed to be the great beneficiaries of
this, are almost inevitably losers, too. The impact assessment
says:</div>
<a name="09032772000450"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Staff
will benefit because there is a written record with witnesses and
justification of the use of force. It should also help to improve the
relationship between school and parents as there will be seen to be a
more open flow of information, with a proper system of recording
incidents of staff restraining or otherwise physically interacting with
pupils.&#148;</div><a name="09032772000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
goes on to list a series of supposed benefits to staff: legal
protection will be offered to staff in cases where a parent seeks to
prosecute; and school staff will be less likely to refrain from
physical contact for fear of malicious allegations against them. That
is frankly the complete opposite of the conclusion that many people,
including me, would draw from the
changes.</div><a name="09032772000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
proposals will make the position no better for pupils; possibly they
will make it more dangerous. The benefits for parents are ambiguous
except in the case of special needs youngsters. I would imagine that
the number of cases where they are not notified of the behaviour of
their children is relatively small. Certainly for staff this provision
will make the situation much worse. There will be much more bureaucracy
and much more reticence to intervene in such cases.</div>
<a name="09032772000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">Interestingly,
the regulatory impact assessment is unable to come up with any
estimates in the aggregate, either of the costs or the benefits of the
project. It
states:</div><a name="09032772000451"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
majority of schools are already recording and reporting significant
incidents where use of force has been used and reporting them to
parents.&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column853" />Column number: 853</div><a name="09032772000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">In other
words&#151;the point was made by a number of people in evidence to
us&#151;where this needs to happen the guidance is already having
force. The risk is that in making these duties statutory we will extend
them in ways that are completely unwelcome. That is presumably why the
Committee has received so much critical evidence on the subject. A
number of representations have been made by the NUT and there was a
powerful representation from John Dunford, one of the most experienced
and wise leaders in the education field. He
said:</div><a name="09032772000452"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;On
the use of force, we are clear that if there is a major use of force
then that is something the school would wish to communicate about with
a parent, and schools already do that. If, on the other hand, a teacher
goes into the playground to break up a fight and does so, we do not
want to get into a position where that kind of thing has to be reported
to parents&#151;we should just deal with it and get on with life. It
might be on the face of the Bill or it might be in guidance, but we
want to make it clear that that duty relates only to significant use of
force...Otherwise, frankly, we would not want another legal duty
in this area.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report,

hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton also cited John Bangs,
who has enormous experience in education and is a very respected and
senior member of the NUT. John Bangs also gave powerful evidence on the
issue:</div><a name="09032772000453"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
are concerned about the recording of incidents of force to control or
restrain pupils. We do not know where this has come from. We advise in

protection of teachers. I do not think that any other union would take
a different view. I am sure that we all take that
decision.&#148;</div><a name="09032772000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">Later
in the same evidence session, John Bangs, who has a lot of experience
in this area, referred to his own time in
teaching:</div><a name="09032772000454"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I
taught in a special school for 18 years. It was a secondary school for
moderate learning difficulties. It was a proxy for mild emotional,
behavioural difficulties. To prevent a child from running out of the
classroom door, you had to physically intervene. Did I have to record
that every time? No, because that was the nature of the children in the
school. The school had a restraint policy, which was understood
consistently. We also had a policy about intervening to help other
members of staff, not in terms of force, but
behaviour.&#148;</div><a name="09032772000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">He
concluded:</div><a name="09032772000455"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
danger with putting this into legislation and then identifying what is
significant is that the normal relationships that you have,

constantly have to check back to see whether you have to record it. As

is, John

we should think twice before we land schools with a great new

only an ambiguous benefit, if it has any benefit at all, for parents. I
must say that the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis
and Littlehampton on these matters are exactly right and deal with all
the deficiencies that have been identified in the evidence that has
been given to the Committee.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032772000549"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> Currently schools have powers to use
reasonable and proportionate force either to control or restrain
pupils, in order to prevent an offence being committed, injury or
damage being caused or serious disruption to school discipline being
created. However, what the law does not currently require is that
significant incidents of force be recorded or reported to
parents.</div>
<a name="09032772000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is a gap
in the current arrangements, which was highlighted in a case in late
2006-07; it may be the case that the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and
Littlehampton, who speaks for the Conservatives, was referring to. It
involved a young girl with special educational needs who had been
repeatedly restrained in school without the parent being informed.
Although the school&#146;s actions in restraining the child were
found to be reasonable, some hon. Members rightly expressed concern at
the lack of a requirement to record and report such actions to parents.
Therefore, the Government committed to closing that loophole.</div>
<a name="09032772000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">Most schools
already record incidents of force and many of them make reports to
parents. Both these practices are recommended as good practice in the
Department&#146;s guidance to schools on the use of force. The clause
consolidates that good practice. As a further safeguard, the clause
requires schools to have regard to the section of the guidance on the
recording and reporting of significant incidents. We are revising our
guidance. I think that the key point to remember is the word
&#147;significant&#148;, which is the point that the hon. Member
for Yeovil made when referring to John Dunford&#146;s evidence. Our
revised guidance will make it clear what the new legal duties on
schools regarding the recording and reporting to parents will mean in
practical terms and we will, of course, be consulting on that
guidance.</div>
<a name="09032772000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">Ensuring that
there is a proper written record will protect the interests not only of
pupils and parents but of staff, meaning that disputes about the
veracity of events can be minimised. It will make it less likely that
school staff will refrain from physical contact for fear of a
mischievous allegation against them. Furthermore, we do not envisage
that recording an individual incident should add a significant
administrative burden. The guidance to schools includes a one-page
model form for recording incidents, which should be fairly easy for
schools to complete. That section of the guidance also draws attention
to wider issues around pupil safeguarding and the circumstances when a
school might need to involve other
agencies.</div>
<a name="09032772000481"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.15
am</div><a name="09032772000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
appreciate that hon. Members are concerned to limit the requirements
placed on schools, but there are important reasons why clause 233 is
framed in the way it is. I am sure that I do not need to remind hon.
Members that the most important reason is child protection. I will
first speak to amendments 86 and 87. The recording of each significant
incident of use of force and keeping an accurate record will protect
both the pupils and the teachers involved. The circumstances leading up
to and surrounding incidents of use of force are often confusing and
emotive, and it is important that a contemporary, clear and honest
report is made of such an incident so that the appropriate facts and
time scales can be accurately recorded when they are still fresh in the
mind. Many schools have already implemented mechanisms for recording 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column855" />Column number: 855</div>and reporting incidents of use of force. The clause merely reinforces
existing good practice and should impose little additional burden on
schools.</div>
<a name="09032772000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">On amendment
210, I recognise that the requirement to report each use of force
incident might in a small minority of cases provoke an inappropriate
violent reaction from parents. However, that risk needs to be weighed
against the risk of keeping parents in the dark on such a serious
matter as their child being restrained. The clause properly requires a
procedure that ensures parents are always informed as soon as possible
of significant incidents where force has been used on their child. It
enables prompt action to be taken and helps to stop problems
escalating.</div><a name="09032772000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
giving evidence earlier in our deliberations, Sir Alan Steer made it
clear that he did not agree with withholding a report from parents. He
said:</div><a name="09032772000457"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;If
there has been an incident involving my child which has required
restraint to be used, I would be fairly militant about the fact that I,
as a parent, needed to know that. I accept that the example you gave
could occur on rare occasions, but there are ways around
that.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report,
Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Public Bill Committee,

<a name="09032772000160"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032772000550"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> I have listened carefully to the Minister. She has
made a compelling case for why parents need to be informed
automatically, but there is also a compelling case in the small
minority of cases that she refers to where the consequence of reporting
the incident could be very serious for the child&#151;extremely
serious. Is there not a compromise that can be reached where there is
an automatic process for reporting? If a head teacher has concerns,
could the reporting be made to someone in the social services
department who may or may not know the parent? If they know the parent,
that is dealt with. That could count as telling the parent. If they do
not know the parent, it could trigger a case conference and initial
inquiries to see whether it would be safe to tell the parent. In such
circumstances, the child would be protected. It would be a pity if we
passed the legislation and as a direct consequence a child
dies.</div><a name="09032772000161"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032772000551"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> The hon. Gentleman has anticipated my next
remark. The requirement to inform parents is also subject to wider
requirements to safeguard children, and the report to a parent need not
come directly from the school. It could in some instances come through
social services. Where a school is particularly concerned about a child
protection issue, they should always bring in other support agencies. I
think that that gives the hon. Gentleman the reassurance he needs. I
referred previously to an incident a few years ago involving a
six-year-old girl with special educational needs. That example alone
shows the importance of reporting incidents to
parents.</div>
<a name="09032772000162"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032772000552"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> It is good to hear what the Minister has said, but
my worry is that it is not in the Bill and would therefore not be on
the statute book. I wonder what she has in mind. Obviously, there is a
wider requirement to protect children in common law, and undoubtedly in
statute somewhere, but it is not in this piece of legislation. Our
concern is that a teacher or a lawyer looking at this will advise that
the teacher or head teacher has to tell the parent, and there seems to
be no leeway within the provision as regards telling the
parent.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column856" />Column number: 856</div><a name="09032772000163"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032772000553"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> The legislation
states:</div><a name="09032772000458"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
governing body...must ensure that a procedure is in
place&#148;.</div><a name="09032772000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
will be guidance that backs that up. Our revised guidance will make it
clear what it means in practical terms, given that there are the
general obligations under the Children Act 1989 and the wider
requirements to safeguard children. I am happy to confirm that we
expect to put in that guidance the incidents in the particular cases
that the hon. Gentleman refers
to.</div><a name="09032772000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
amendment 94, our general position is not to specify a time scale for
how long pupil documentation should be kept. The current pupil
information regulations, which cover the range of information that
schools keep on their pupils and which we are considering revising, do
not set such a time scale. Similarly, our current guidance on use of
force does not specify a time scale for keeping records, as we believe
that such decisions are best taken locally.</div>
<a name="09032772000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">The exception
is where a record has been handed to the police. Our guidance
recommends that in those circumstances, schools should retain the
record until the member of staff involved has reached normal retirement
age or for 10 years from the date of the allegation, in order to ensure
that a proper record is retained in case criminal or other proceedings
arise from the incident. We propose that the new overarching guidance
on the use of force that we will issue to follow the Bill should
continue to reflect that approach.</div>
<a name="09032772000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">I recognise
concerns that the record of an incident passed to the police for
whatever reason may appear on a subsequent Criminal Records Bureau
check, but if a teacher has misused the power and acted unlawfully, it
is right that that should form part of their CRB disclosure. In
deciding how long to keep records of such incidents, schools will also
wish to bear in mind the time limits for bringing civil actions for
damages. Where a person under 18 has suffered injury, the limitation
period does not even begin to run until they reach the age of 18, so if
schools destroy records three years after an incident, they may face
difficulties if a claim is made subsequently.</div>
<a name="09032772000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">In any case,
schools will wish to maintain accurate records of their pupils&#146;
progress for at least as long as they remain in education, and the use
of force record is likely to be considered by most schools as forming
part of that record. Schools may wish, for example, to monitor patterns
of use of force over a number of years. They must be left to make their
own decisions about how long to keep records of use of force. Many
schools will have good reason to want to keep the records for longer
than three years. With that, I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the

<a name="09032772000169"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032772000554"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for that full response
to the amendments, which raise serious issues. I am not totally
convinced that it will work. She is saying that primary legislation is
trumped by revised guidance, whose status is even less than that of
statutory instruments. I worry that we are relying on guidance to
provide a different interpretation of explicit legislation in new
circumstances. It will work if the guidance is read, the school is well
run, its staff have the guidance in front of them and all the teachers
are aware of it. The concern is that that will not
happen.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032772000555"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman not agree that
proposed new section 85D(4)
says:</div><a name="09032772000459"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
discharging their duty under subsection (1), the governing body must
have regard to any guidance
issued&#148;?</div><a name="09032772000171"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032772000556"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> Yes, I do, but the trouble is that people are not
lawyers out there. Teachers are teachers, bursars are bursars and head
teachers are head teachers. This way may look easier because we are
spending a lot of time ploughing through the Bill clause by clause, but
it is just one Bill among many to which teachers must have access.
Guidance is recommended in most clauses of education Bills.</div>
<a name="09032772000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">The reality
is that teachers do not sit at their desks with neatly filed guidance
connected to each provision in legislation. A poor lawyer, or even an
average lawyer, might not spot this point. Indeed, a teacher might not
even ask a lawyer; they will work out in advance what they can and
cannot do. A barrack-room lawyer view might arise that if a serious
incident occurs involving physical restraint of a child, the parent
must be told, and a jobsworth view might well emanate that it is better
to do so regardless of the consequences.</div>
<a name="09032772000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Lady
might be right. The matter might be so serious that head teachers will
be cognisant of the guidance because the consequences of not knowing
about it are so tremendous. However, the worry is that that might not
happen. We should be legislating to produce the best possible piece of
legislation. As the matter is serious, I cannot understand why it is
not being put into the Bill, just in case what I am saying is right.
Given that I am not the only one&#151;senior trade unionists are
saying it too&#151;I wish that she would think again. I leave her
with this thought. Rather than pressing the amendment to a Division, I
urge her to give the issue a little thought between now and Report and
to come back on Report with a small amendment, which we will endeavour
to give a swift journey on to the statute book. With that in mind, I
beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09032772000174"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032772000558"></a>The

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032772000559"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> We are now on the fairly controversial clause 235 on
school behaviour partnerships. The thing about such partnerships is
that most schools are in them&#151;I forget the actual percentage,
but I think that over 90 per cent. of schools are part of a behaviour 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column858" />Column number: 858</div>partnership with other schools in their area. Most academies are in the
same boat, because they want to co-operate in such matters with other
schools, make common cause, spread best practice and help one another
in dealing with the serious and growing problem of poor behaviour in
our schools. Schools are happy to enter into such arrangements. But the
problem comes when they are forced to enter into the arrangements by
legislation; it is like passing a law saying, &#147;You should be my
friend.&#148;, which will not be a genuine friendship if that is its
basis&#151;although I am sure that everyone in this Committee is very
friendly, particularly after
yesterday.</div><a name="09032772000180"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032772000560"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> On behalf of everyone on this side of the
Committee, I would like to say that we are all happy to be the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s friends, even without primary
legislation.</div><a name="09032772000181"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032772000561"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> I am very grateful, and therefore I will withdraw
that particular amendment that we will come on to later&#151;it is
obviously not necessary.</div>
<a name="09032772000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">Schools
should be encouraged, not forced, to form the partnerships. Amendment
84 would take out subsection (1)(b), essentially taking out
academies&#151;we will discuss the broader issue of voluntarism in
partnership later in the debate. Dr. Daniel Moynihan, chairman of the
Harris Federation, and a former principal of a very successful academy,
said when he gave
evidence:</div><a name="09032772000460"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;For
me the issue of school behaviour partnerships remains about voluntarism
for academies. It is true that most schools are part of behaviour
partnerships, but the kind they are in are quite different to the kind
Sir Alan Steer mentions in his report. The behaviour partnerships that
most schools are in are about sharing out hard to place pupils and
managing moves for
exclusions.</div><a name="09032772000461"></a><div class="hs_brev">In
this case, however, we are talking about much broader partnerships in
which groups have the power to employ specialist staff together, have
common behaviour management training, take on services in managing
attendance, offer staff training and work with primary schools, so we
could be looking at a bigger and potentially more bureaucratic
process...We really feel that it is important that we have the
choice of which schools we partner with, because partnerships per se
will not improve anything: quality improves
things.&#148;</div><a name="09032772000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">He
was not saying that he is against partnerships, but he was saying
that</div><a name="09032772000462"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;if
we do not get that, academies and other schools should at least be able
to determine who they partner with. I do not think that central or
local government should say, &#145;Here is your partnership and this
is how you should partner.&#146; I do not think that they are in the
best position to do that.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report,

</i>3 March 2009; c. 56, Q152 and
153.]</div><a name="09032772000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would
be helpful, if the Minister is not able to accept the amendment, if she
provided some comfort to senior figures such as Dr. Moynihan, who has
done so much to provide high-quality education in difficult parts of
London. Can he be assured that he can form partnerships with schools
that he chooses, and that they will not be chosen for him by local
authorities or existing school behaviour partnerships? With those few
words, I await the Minister&#146;s assurance on that point with
anticipation.</div><a name="09032772000482"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.30

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032772000562"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I would like to touch on amendments 371 and 84.
Amendment 371 is pretty straightforward. It would
add</div><a name="09032772000463"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
management committee of a school falling within section
19(2B) of the Education Act 1996...(pupil referral
units)&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column859" />Column number: 859</div><a name="09032772000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">to the categories that
are considered relevant partners for the purpose of school behaviour
partnerships. We would be interested to know whether the Minister
envisages including pupil referral units&#151;or short stay schools,
as they are to be known&#151;in those
partnerships.</div><a name="09032772000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
amendment 84, I probably would not say this if my hon. Friend the
Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole were here, because she would
throttle me, but whenever I hear the word &#147;partnership&#148;
in association with this Government, I tend to think that it is going
to be some bureaucratic monstrosity that involves a lot of meddling,
intervention, discussions and meetings for no obvious purpose.
Therefore, I start with the type of scepticism that I suspect the hon.
Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton has about these
organisations.</div><a name="09032772000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
heard the evidence given by Mr. Moynihan to the Committee on
3 March. He talked about his concern that school behaviour partnerships
were going to become more onerous and bureaucratic. He also said that
he believed that there should be an opt-in for schools and that there
should not be a forced marriage or forced friendship, which the hon.
Gentleman is so concerned
about.</div><a name="09032772000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
think I can satisfy my absent hon. Friend by putting it on the record
that I am happy with the provision as it is, without amendment 84,
subject to a couple of comments. The first reason I am happy is that
most schools are already part of a school behaviour partnership, as the
hon. Gentleman said. The provision will not be quite the imposition on
schools that has been suggested and the figures are slightly higher
than he indicated. According to the Library research note, 98 per cent.
of maintained schools and 94 per cent. of academies are members of
those
partnerships.</div><a name="09032772000483"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.34

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032772000563"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I was saying that I thought my hon. Friend the
Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole would be happy with me because I
feel comfortable supporting the Government&#146;s line on school
behaviour partnerships and reflecting on the fact that most schools
throughout the country seem to be in such partnerships. Indeed, the
Bill&#146;s economic impact assessment refers to the 55 schools that
are not members of a partnership. That sounds like an even smaller
number than I would have thought, based on a calculation of 2 per cent.
of a stock of 23,500 schools. Is the economic impact assessment right
to state that 55 schools are not members of a partnership? How many of
those are academies? We are talking about a relatively small number of
schools.</div><a name="09032772000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton made a different
argument that echoed comments made by the chief executive of the Harris
Foundation: schools should be free to choose their friends, and we do
not need to legislate and bully people into forming partnerships. The
problem with that argument is that sometimes people do not want to be
friends. It can be difficult for some people to make friends&#151;I
am feeling a little 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column860" />Column number: 860</div>friendless right now, given that there is nobody else on my side of the
Committee. However, I would like to deal with the Bognor challenge, so
to speak, because it can sometimes be difficult to partner up, which is
of concern, because many schools that will have problems finding
partners&#151;in relation to issues such as exclusions&#151;will be
those in the most deprived catchments with the largest exclusion
problems.</div><a name="09032772000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many
schools will ask, &#147;Why on earth would I want to partner up with
this school, which is excluding people left, right and centre, and has
all sorts of problems? I do not want to take on all the children from
those schools in this partnership.&#148; We could end up with a
residue of a small number of schools left out of partnerships. Also,
some schools will have to form partnerships with other schools that are
not obvious fits. Therefore, I am not as bothered as the hon. Gentleman
by the inclusion of academies and maintained schools in this
provision.</div><a name="09032772000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
only area where I have some sympathy with the hon. Gentleman is in
relation to the comments made by Daniel Moynihan in response to the
question from the hon. Member for Plymouth, Devonport, to whom we all
send our sincere sympathies, following the sad update from the
Minister. Daniel Moynihan was concerned that behaviour partnerships
will be too detailed and prescriptive, and involve many other issues,
such as buying in services, whereas when they were established, they
were fairly loose and
broad.</div><a name="09032772000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand how academies might fear that such a bureaucratic process
could start to compromise the independence that they so value. Will the
Minister reassure us that the Government will be careful in developing
the partnerships to ensure that they do not become too bureaucratic or
place too onerous a set of duties not only on academies, but on all
maintained schools, to which those issues are important? With that
reassurance, I would feel much more comfortable with the
provisions.</div><a name="09032772000197"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032772000564"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> Amendment 84 would remove the duty to
co-operate to improve behaviour and tackle persistent absence from
academies, city technology colleges and the city college for the
technology of the arts. The Government do not wish, in general, to make
academies subject to detailed education legislation. We are committed
to preserving the autonomy of academies to allow them to be innovative
trailblazers in education, but some things are just too important for
academies to be outside. We have debated one
already&#151;children&#146;s trusts&#151;and behaviour and
attendance partnerships are
another.</div><a name="09032772000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">Being
involved in such a partnership allows academies to draw on the
expertise of their partners in dealing with behaviour and attendance
issues, commission a greater range of support services by doing so in
conjunction with partners and work with other schools to find the most
effective solutions for pupils with behaviour and attendance issues.
Ninety-four per cent. of academies are already convinced of the
benefits of partnership working and are members
voluntarily.</div><a name="09032772000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
for behaviour and attendance partnerships to work effectively, every
secondary school in a local area must be involved. Refusal to
co-operate by even one school can damage local partnership working, as
it undermines the principle that all local children are the collective
responsibility of all schools and children&#146;s 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column861" />Column number: 861</div>services in the local area, not just the school that they happen to
attend. However, I can confirm to the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and
Littlehampton that schools will not be told exactly which other schools
to work with, but can make their own collaborative
arrangements.</div><a name="09032772000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
94 per cent. of academies and 98 per cent. of maintained secondary
schools are already working in partnerships voluntarily, the extent to
which partnerships work effectively varies. The hon. Member for Yeovil
asked about the 55 schools&#151;that came from figures for 2007. I
can confirm that eight of them were
academies.</div><a name="09032772000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
legislation requires schools to have regard to DCSF guidance on
behaviour and attendance partnerships. It reinforces and secures the
strength of partnerships, and increases the extent to which good
practice is
embedded.</div><a name="09032772000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
the same reasons, it is equally important that all pupil referral units
are members of behaviour and attendance partnerships. There are further
reasons why it is crucial that pupil referral units are full members. I
use the phrase &#147;pupil referral units&#148; because we have not
yet passed legislation to change the name to &#147;short-stay
schools&#148;. One of the aims of behaviour and attendance
partnerships is to build stronger links between pupil referral units
and other schools, so that the expertise on behaviour that exists in
many pupil referral units can be more easily shared, and joint decision
making about where a pupil should be placed can
occur.</div><a name="09032772000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore,
I am sympathetic to the motivation behind amendment 371, which would
include pupil referral units in the duty to co-operate in the Bill, but
our preference is to place the duty in clause 235 on pupil referral
units, using regulations made under schedule 1 to the Education Act
1996.</div><a name="09032772000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
legal identity of pupil referral units is different from that of all
other schools maintained by a local authority. They are also managed
differently, through management committees with local authority
involvement, rather than governing bodies. Those practical differences
mean that, usually, new legislative obligations on schools have been
applied to pupil referral units through secondary legislation. We wish
to maintain that legislative
consistency.</div><a name="09032772000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">Applying
the duty to pupil referral units through regulations will allow us to
tailor the exact details of the requirements to reflect the specific
features of pupil referral units, which are different from other
schools. For example, we may wish to tailor the duty on pupil referral
units so that they have to make arrangements with a maintained school
or academy, rather than with another pupil referral unit only. We also
want to ensure that primary pupil referral units are not covered by the
statutory duty, in the same way that primary maintained schools are
not.</div><a name="09032772000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
practice, pupil referral units will be full members of behaviour and
attendance partnerships in the same way as any maintained secondary
school, academy, city technology college or the city college for the
technology of the arts, but we will bring that about through
regulations, rather than primary legislation. I therefore ask hon.
Members not to press the amendments to the
vote.</div><a name="09032772000207"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032772000565"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for that response and
very reassured by what she said about amendment 371. I thought for a
moment that she would concede something to me during proceedings on the
Bill, and that I would have some amendment or part of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column862" />Column number: 862</div>legislation to look back on in old age. As ever, that was snatched from
me and the amendment transferred across to regulations, but I feel that
I may have to accept that modest piece of good news and not press my
amendment any
further.</div><a name="09032772000208"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032772000566"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> I am half pleased and half disappointed. The
Minister said that, in general, the Government do not want to subject
academies to general education legislation, which is encouraging to
hear but does not tally with what has been happening since the
Secretary of State took over as Secretary of State for Children,
Schools and Families. There have been significant changes to the
autonomy of academies in respect of the national curriculum and the
involvement of local authorities in the running of academies, and this
legislation includes two more changes that reduce their
autonomy&#151;this issue and children&#146;s
trusts.</div><a name="09032772000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister is being disingenuous when she says that those issues are of
such paramount importance that some of the autonomy of academies must
be taken away. That is part of a trend in recent years. The Government
are not committed to the success of autonomy and successful academies,
so they are quite happy to chip away at those freedoms whenever it
suits them. That is why I am
disappointed.</div><a name="09032772000485"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10
am</div><a name="09032772000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
was pleased, however, when the Minister said that schools will not be
told with whom to work or form partnerships&#151;she is not going
infringe the Bognor principle that friendships should not be forced. I
am sure that that will also please the academy movement. In view of
that, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09032772000211"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032772000567"></a>Mr.

page 138, line 7, leave out &#145;must&#146;
and insert
&#145;may&#146;.</div><a name="09032772000213"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032772000568"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss the
following: amendment 258, in clause 235, page 138,
line 12, after &#145;State&#146;, insert</div>
<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;, with any such guidance ensuring that
relevant partners shall not be forced into partnerships against the
wishes of the governing bodies of those relevant
partners.&#146;.</div><a name="09032772000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
262, in
clause 235, page 138, line 12, at
end insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(3A) For the
purposes of subsections (2) and (3), a relevant partner may only enter
an arrangement with another relevant partner if the governing bodies of
both relevant partners approve the
arrangement.&#146;.</div><a name="09032772000215"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032772000569"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> This debate will be almost the same as the one that
we have just had, except it applies to not only academies but all
schools. The amendments seek to bring about a little bit more
voluntarism in the behaviour partnership
arrangements.</div><a name="09032772000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
85 would mean that a relevant partner &#147;may&#148; rather than
&#147;must&#148;</div><a name="09032772000464"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;make
arrangements with at least one other partner in their area to
co-operate with each other with a view to...promoting good
behaviour and discipline on the part of
pupils&#148;.</div><a name="09032772000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
fits with what the Association of School and College Leaders has said.
The association welcomes the Bill, but the end of its briefing says
that it should be clear that schools will form such partnerships by
themselves, and that particular patterns of partnership should not be
imposed from outside by either the local authority or 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column863" />Column number: 863</div>by the Government or any of their agencies. The ASCL will be encouraged
by what the Minister said in the debate on the last group of
amendments, and because there is no intention to have local authorities
select the collaborative arrangements into which a school can
enter.</div><a name="09032772000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">Similarly,
amendment 258 means that &#147;any such guidance&#148; from the
Minister should ensure
that</div><a name="09032772000465"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;relevant
partners shall not be forced into partnerships against the wishes of
the governing bodies of those relevant
partners&#148;.</div><a name="09032772000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again,
that would mean that unless the governing body of a school wishes to
enter a partnership with another school, it should not happen, and the
Minister has confirmed
that.</div><a name="09032772000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
would be helpful to the Committee if the Minister were to confirm what
would happen if Mr. Nomates cannot find a partner, which the
hon. Member for Yeovil alluded to. Will the local authority force the
school to partner another school in the
area?</div><a name="09032772000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
amendment 262 states

the purposes of subsection...(2)...a relevant partner may
only enter an arrangement with another relevant partner if the
governing bodies of both relevant partners approve the

<a name="09032772000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is another way of
expressing the view that two schools should enjoy mutual attraction
rather than be forced into a shotgun marriage, if that is the
Government&#146;s intention. More reassurance on those points from
the Minister would be very welcome.</div>
<a name="09032772000223"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032772000570"></a>Mary
Creagh:</b> It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship
again, Mr. Chope, on this bright
morning.</div><a name="09032772000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have some concerns about the proposed amendments. They could weaken the
provisions and create a Johnny Nomates school, as the hon. Gentleman
put it. I should like to press the Minister on those issues. On Second
Reading, the Secretary of State said that he would think about the need
for accountability and reporting requirements for the partnerships. The
hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton and I may disagree on
what weight should be given to knowledge versus knowledge skills,
understanding, ability and knowledge in practice. The amendments and
the clause consider the how&#151;how we teach in schools and the
framework in which learning happens.</div>
<a name="09032772000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
absolutely clear that truancy and poor behaviour by a tiny minority of
individuals&#151;and, in some cases, their parents&#151;can totally
destroy learning for all other classroom learners. Consistent lateness,
poor attendance and poor behaviour can destroy the fabric of a school.
I am concerned about the amendments, as I think that they would give
certain schools the chance to decide that they are a bit too grand, too
special, too clever or too good to partner other schools. That is a
concern, because I do not want to end up with a self-selecting market
for school behaviour
partnerships.</div><a name="09032772000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">Wakefield
City high school, a high-performing state secondary school in my
constituency&#151;it is not an academy or anything like that, just an
ordinary comprehensive school&#151;is one of the top five highest
value-added schools in the country, and it is a specialist school for
maths. The head, Mr. Alan Yellup, provides fantastic
leadership. I had a letter from him about two weeks ago that discussed
the hundreds of schools that he has 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column864" />Column number: 864</div>worked with. As the head of a leading school, he is happy to share his
expertise across the sector, the county and the country. It is
important that good practice in beacon schools such as that, whether
they have a subject or a behavioural specialism, is rolled out across
the sector, and I am against any amendment that would weaken
that.</div>
<a name="09032772000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">How does the
Minister think we can take across some of the interesting innovations
that have arisen from such partnerships? How can we model the
outstanding, so that it becomes standard practice across the sector?
How can we roll out strong schools supporting weaker schools to attain
zero tolerance of poor behaviour and
truancy?</div><a name="09032772000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
was pleased to see the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Yeovil
on pupil referral units, which have a specialist role to play in
partnerships. They often have an important role to play in the
continuity of education, if a child is going back and
forth&#151;hopefully not more than once or twice&#151;between their
main school and the pupil referral unit, or whatever the new name is
for
them.</div><a name="09032772000229"></a>

Knight:</b> Short stay
schools.</div><a name="09032772000230"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032772000572"></a>Mary
Creagh:</b> Thank you. My brain is not functioning quite as
quickly as it was this time yesterday morning. I am reassured by what
the Minister has said about introducing regulations to make sure that
they are included. I just wanted to press her on accountability and the
reporting of
crimes.</div><a name="09032772000231"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032772000573"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> Amendment 85 would negate the new duty on
all maintained secondary schools, academies, city technology colleges
and city technology colleges of the arts to be members of school
behaviour and attendance partnerships. As I have said, school behaviour
and attendance partnerships are designed to support and improve
outcomes for pupils with behaviour and attendance issues, who are some
of the most vulnerable pupils in our schools, so it is important that
partnership working is as effective as it can be. Partnership working
on behaviour and attendance is also designed to improve low-level
disruption across the whole school and thus has a positive impact on
all pupils.</div>
<a name="09032772000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
important that partnership working is made a statutory requirement in
order to reinforce the strength of partnerships and ensure that good
practice is further embedded by making a statutory requirement for
schools to have regard to the DCSF guidance on partnership working.
Such legislation is necessary, because in order for partnership working
to be truly effective, all secondary schools must be involved. Refusal
by even one school can have a detrimental impact on partnership working
locally, as the partnership then cannot represent the needs of children
across local secondary schools and the principle of collective
responsibility at the centre of partnership work is undermined. Schools
need to be confident of their partners&#146; commitment and confident
that partnership working is a long-term approach. The legislation shows
that the Government are committed to that approach in the long term and
ensures that schools are also
committed.</div><a name="09032772000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
258 and 262 appear to be motivated by the same concern: a desire to
ensure that schools can choose the other schools with which to enter
into partnership. Once again, I reassure hon. Members that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column865" />Column number: 865</div>that is already the case. The clause merely places a duty to make
arrangements with at least one other relevant body. The Government do
not wish to prescribe the exact composition of individual partnerships,
which should reflect and respond to local circumstances. Schools will
not be told exactly which other schools to work with, and they will
decide that in collaboration with the other schools in their area and
the local authority.</div>
<a name="09032772000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our current
guidance suggests that the local authority should play a role in
facilitating links between schools and promoting partnership working,
and we would expect the local authority to support schools having any
problems arranging who is to be in which partnership. We will continue
to recommend that the local authority plays that support role when the
guidance is redrafted, as it becomes statutory. Ofsted also assesses
schools on how well they work in partnership with other organisations,
and the new school report card will include information on partnership
working.</div>
<a name="09032772000235"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032772000574"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> Will the Minister confirm that the local
authority&#146;s role in facilitating and supporting the arrangements
will not, in practice, become enforcing
them?</div>
<a name="09032772000236"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032772000575"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> We have no intention of coercing schools
into partnerships; local authorities will have other levers. They will
be able to direct funding to school partnerships and, if they feel that
such partnerships are not operating as they should, to withhold it.
Furthermore, Ofsted will have the power through inspection to see how
well schools are doing on partnership working. Local authorities have
no powers to force schools into
partnerships.</div>
<a name="09032772000237"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032772000576"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> The Minister hinted at funding. Will a school lose
significant sums of money for dealing with behavioural problems, if it
does not enter into partnership with a school of the local
authority&#146;s choosing?</div>
<a name="09032772000238"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032772000577"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> We do not expect local authorities to
undertake this measure coercively. There is no point having a
partnership if both partners do not want to be partners. Local
authorities will want to collaborate with schools to encourage
them.</div><a name="09032772000239"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032772000578"></a>Mary
Creagh:</b> Is not the point, however, that schools that do
not want to become partnered are often those with the biggest
problems&#151;where the head teacher may be isolated, defensive and
in need of greatest help? The Bill strikes the appropriate balance
between encouragement and saying, &#147;It&#146;s not good enough
just to put your head in your hands, hide under your desk and say,
&#145;It&#146;ll all get better with time,&#146; or,
&#145;These are difficult
children.&#146;&#148;</div><a name="09032772000240"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032772000579"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> I agree, which is why I do not support
amendments 258 and 262, because they would allow a school to refuse to
enter into arrangements with another school, which would undermine the
clause. I must reiterate to the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and
Littlehampton that local authorities will not give funding to the
partnership, but they will continue to fund schools
individually.</div>
<a name="09032772000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.
Friend the Member for Wakefield mentioned accountability, which is
really important. There are many ways in which we could strengthen the
accountability regime, and one option is an annual report to the
children&#146;s trust. That is an interesting way of extending 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column866" />Column number: 866</div>accountability, and it may meet my hon. Friend&#146;s requirements. I
shall reflect on it, and we may return to it after further
consideration.</div>
<a name="09032772000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although the
exact composition of local partnerships will be locally determined, as
I have outlined, the crucial point is that every secondary school
should be in a behaviour and attendance partnership with at least one
other school. I therefore ask the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and
Littlehampton to withdraw his amendment.</div>
<a name="09032772000243"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032772000580"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for again providing
some reassurance that schools will not have their partners chosen for
them by local authorities. It is good to have that on the record. I was
slightly alarmed when talk of funding crept into our discussion about
voluntary arrangements, and the idea that support from local
authorities would carry the stick that behaviour partnership funding
might disappear if schools did not accept the support with the alacrity
that the local authority expected. I was reassured by the
Minister&#146;s response to my concern, however, when she said that
she does not want local authorities to engage in coercion and that any
partnership that is not entered into voluntarily will not work. In the
light of those helpful words, to which I hope all local authorities
will adhere, I shall not press the amendment. I hope that any guidance
the Minister issues will be in that spirit. I beg to ask leave to
withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09032772000244"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032772000581"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I beg to move amendment 288, in
clause 235, page 138, line 10, at
end insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">&#145;( ) reduce
exclusion rates for pupils with special educational
needs.&#146;.</div><a name="09032772000246"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032772000582"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss
amendment 80, in
clause 235, page 138, line 10, at
end insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(2A) In
performing their duties under this section, relevant partners must seek
to ensure that all pupils are able to work, study and learn in a safe,
secure and ordered
environment.&#146;.</div><a name="09032772000247"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032772000583"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> The amendment would add to clause 235(2), which
specifies the details concerning relevant partners making arrangements
to co-operate with other relevant partners regarding specified
subjects. It adds to existing concerns about the promotion of good
behaviour and discipline by pupils and about reducing the persistent
absence of pupils. The amendment would add a new requirement to
consider the reduction of exclusion rates of pupils with special
educational needs, and would complement the other paragraphs in that
subsection.</div>
<a name="09032772000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is a
concern in many schools in many parts of the country that we have such
high exclusion rates of youngsters with special educational needs. We
must look not only at what we can do to reduce those rates, but at how
schools can co-operate, particularly where there is good practice to
draw on or where staff have expert knowledge of particular areas of
special educational needs within partnerships to reduce exclusion
rates. With this probing amendment, we invite the Minister to consider
whether 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column867" />Column number: 867</div>to add this consideration to the Bill, and to explain how the existing
duties will relate to youngsters with special educational
needs.</div>
<a name="09032772000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">I cannot help
thinking that there is some trick to amendment 80, because it seems to
fail the test of putting a &#147;not&#148; in front of everything.
It
states:</div><a name="09032772000467"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
performing their duties under this section, relevant partners must seek
to ensure that all pupils are able to work, study and learn in a safe,
secure and ordered
environment.&#148;</div><a name="09032772000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
seems difficult to oppose, but I suspect that the ingenious hon. Member
for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton has something lurking in there that
he will raise in a moment, so I look forward to hearing from
him.</div><a name="09032772000251"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032772000584"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> The lurking element is that we want to make schools
into safe and happy places for pupils and children. We need to ensure
that when behaviour partnerships are entered into, the desire to find
new places for children who have been excluded does not jeopardise the
safety, security and orderliness of any school to which they are sent.
That must be the overriding aim when partnerships are entered into. It
is almost tautologous, as the hon. Gentleman has hinted, to have that
as an overriding aim, but I am worried that the overriding aim in some
partnerships might be to find places in mainstream schools for children
whose behavioural problems are such that they ought to be not in
mainstream schools, but in high-quality, alternative education that
will help with their behavioural problems. I shall return to those
issues when we debate the next
clause.</div><a name="09032772000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
behaviour partnership should not lose sight of the fact that its aim is
to produce the kind of ordered environment in schools that, I am
afraid, is increasingly the exception rather than the rule. Children
are suffering from bullying at too high a level in our schools today,
and there is too much low-level disruption across the state sector
school estate. That is increasingly becoming the single biggest problem
facing education
today.</div><a name="09032772000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
know that Ministers are sincere in believing that school behavioural
partnerships are an answer to the problem, which they may well be,
especially if the partnerships are voluntary. However, they might just
be a revolving-door attempt to shuffle around the system children who
have severe behavioural problems that need to be addressed by
professionals with experience and expertise in helping children tackle
and deal with behavioural problems that are almost certainly not their
fault. If a child has behavioural problems, many people are to
blame&#151;their parents, society, the police for not patrolling the
streets and keeping order and, possibly, the school
environment.</div><a name="09032772000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
person who is not responsible for behaviour is the child. Children are
the creatures of us all. They are the creatures of the parents, of the
school and of society. There are children with behavioural problems who
need help. Simply shunting them off to another mainstream school that
also has behavioural problems will not help the child, and the child
being at the school will not contribute to the school&#146;s
effectiveness. The purpose of the amendment is to make sure that it
remains the prime aim of all schools to create a safe, happy and secure
environment when dealing with 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column868" />Column number: 868</div>behavioural problems and not to allow other aims to supersede that. I
look forward to hearing the Minister&#146;s
response.</div><a name="09032772000255"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032772000585"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> I appreciate the sentiment behind amendment
80. It is important that all pupils can learn in a safe, secure and
well-ordered environment. However, the clause already requires schools
to co-operate to promote good behaviour and discipline on the part of
pupils, and the intended outcome of such co-operation is just
that&#151;making schools safe and orderly places in which pupils can
learn.</div><a name="09032772000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">Schools
are already legally responsible for the safety and well-being of their
pupils. Head teachers also have a clear statutory power to exclude
pupils, when they think that it is necessary. We have repeatedly stated
that we fully support heads who make the difficult decision to exclude.
Behaviour and attendance partnerships aim to support head teachers in
developing strategies that reduce the need for exclusion. When there is
still a need, we fully support the right of the head to
exclude.</div><a name="09032772000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">School
behaviour and attendance partnerships help schools to support those
pupils who have behaviour or attendance issues, including through early
intervention, to address problems before they escalate. The intended
outcome of behaviour and attendance partnership working is that, both
as a consequence of targeted work, and as a result of other wider
strategies of partnership working, low-level disruption and behaviour
issues throughout schools are
reduced.</div><a name="09032772000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
288 would make a reduction in exclusions among pupils with special
educational needs one of the key areas with which schools must
co-operate. I am sympathetic to its aim, but it is not necessary. In
our current guidance on school behaviour and attendance partnerships,
we make it clear that we expect a reduction in the need for permanent
exclusions to be a key outcome of partnership working. That is an
expected outcome of co-operating with a view to promoting good
behaviour and discipline on the part of
pupils.</div><a name="09032772000259"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032772000586"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> Does the Minister understand that we cannot have in
guidance the ruling that there shall be fewer permanent exclusions? If
we make that a policy, it will be achieved, but it will not necessarily
improve behaviour in a school. It will simply be the case that head
teachers are deterred by such guidance from excluding permanently
children, who should be excluded permanently and receiving help for
their problems. It is no good expecting such guidance to be effective.
It will simply compound the problem both for the child by their not
receiving help and the school by having a disruptive child in the
school and not receiving the help that they
need.</div><a name="09032772000260"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032772000587"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> The whole point of the partnership is to
enable the strategy to get the early intervention work in place and to
learn from good practice in other schools, so that permanent exclusion
is not the first resort, but the last resort. We also state in guidance
that we expect schools to place emphasis on reducing the differential
rate for exclusions among black or minority ethnic pupils and pupils
with special educational
needs.</div><a name="09032772000261"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032772000588"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> Does the Minister agree that there are reasons to be
concerned by what the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton
has said about targets 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column869" />Column number: 869</div>to drive down exclusions, regardless of whether that is a good thing or
a bad thing? However, many schools are using new practices, such as
keeping children who are misbehaving in the school but teaching them on
Saturdays and in the evenings until they are ready to come back.
Sometimes that is a better alternative than excluding permanently. The
Government should be encouraging that, without getting into the sort of
rigid approach that the hon. Gentleman is worried
about.</div><a name="09032772000262"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032772000589"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> There are many examples of good practice, as
the hon. Gentleman has mentioned. Working in a partnership, those
examples of good practice can be shared, particularly on outcomes. On
another point, for the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton,
I did not say that we expect a reduction in permanent exclusions to be
the outcome;  I said that we expect a reduction in the need
for  permanent exclusions to be a key outcome of partnership
working.</div><a name="09032772000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
reiterate that our guidance expects schools to place emphasis on
reducing the differential rate for exclusions among black and minority
ethnic pupils and pupils with special educational needs. The current
guidance will be redrafted, as it becomes statutory, but it will
continue to include those expectations. Reducing exclusions among
pupils with special educational needs will therefore be a key focus of
partnership working. It is not necessary to state that in the Bill, as
it would give a message that SEN exclusions are more of a priority than
other issues, and would suggest that the issue has to be a priority
even for partnerships that have a low rate of SEN exclusions.
Therefore, I ask the hon. Gentleman not to press the
amendment.</div><a name="09032772000264"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032772000590"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> I listened carefully to the Minister&#146;s
response, and I was disappointed by it. The semantics about the
&#147;need&#148; for permanent exclusions to be reduced is
difficult to distinguish from almost-guidance saying that schools
should reduce their permanent exclusions. That is certainly true on a
quick reading, and given the volume of reading that heads are required
to undertake by the Government, that could well
happen.</div><a name="09032772000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
was interested in the observation by the hon. Member for Yeovil that
innovative solutions such as Saturday morning schools or exclusion
within the school campus are very effective. I agree that all such
methods should be adopted. There are all sorts of other things that
happen in comprehensive schools that I have visited around the country,
such as senior members of staff patrolling the corridors with mobile
phones&#151;every class teacher has one, so that if there is any
disruption in the class, such as a swear word or speaking out of turn,
the senior teacher comes along and takes the kid away. In such schools,
the procedure is remorseless and is always implemented when a child
steps out of
line.</div><a name="09032772000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
schools that I have visited where that happens, the behaviour is
immaculate. No remedial measures are needed for such schools. However,
what helps those schools have the authority to deliver such innovative
solutions is the ultimate deterrent, that the head teacher will exclude
pupils who are persistent disruptors and persistently misbehave,
notwithstanding all those effective and innovative procedures being in
place. If we make it difficult to exclude, we remove the deterrent and
make any innovative approach to behaviour policies ineffective, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column870" />Column number: 870</div>because the children know that there is no ultimate deterrent that can
force them to stay in detention or to attend school on a Saturday
morning.</div><a name="09032772000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
was disappointed, but we have had a discussion, and I do not intend to
press amendment 80 to a
Division.</div><a name="09032772000268"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032772000591"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I was more satisfied by the answers, both to my
amendment and to that of the hon. Gentleman. I understand the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s concerns about policy, particularly policy going
back a few years perhaps, when there was an obsession with reducing the
number of exclusions. There was perhaps perceived to be an obsession
with massaging down the figures to demonstrate that the Government were
delivering better conduct in schools. I completely agree with the hon.
Gentleman that schools must have the power, when behaviour is
completely unacceptable or when it is clear that a youngster is not
going to change their behaviour, to exclude permanently. Without that
sanction, which will hopefully not be used frequently, it is impossible
to control a school properly and to have the respect of youngsters for
the discipline in that
school.</div><a name="09032772000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman is no doubt familiar with many independent and private
schools, as he is with the many maintained schools that he visits. In
those independent schools, he will have seen the ability to exclude and
that a more robust position is sometimes adopted in relation to
permanent exclusion, although perhaps that is just a
perception.</div><a name="09032772000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
difference and problem in the maintained sector is that more youngsters
are at risk of being excluded. Also, the responsibility to seek to
educate those youngsters still falls on the local family of schools.
Although I am the first to say that the power to permanently exclude
must be used without some sort of political threat hanging over it, I
am also aware from my constituency&#151;and from many other parts of
the country&#151;of head teachers who are sometimes overly keen to
exclude in order to make sure that the composition of their intake is
more favourable. I know that there are head teachers who regard some of
their colleagues as having a somewhat irresponsible approach to
exclusions, although that is a small minority of head
teachers.</div>
<a name="09032772000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the hon.
Gentleman has recognised, lots of head teachers are beginning to use
original, unusual and innovative methods&#151;in fact, some of them
are not that innovative, for example, keeping youngsters on after
school or bringing them in on Saturdays. Those methods essentially mean
that the youngsters are out of their class and are not creating
disruption&#151;for example, they might be excluded, but within the
school during the day, or they might be forced to come back in the
evenings or on Saturdays. I have spoken to a number of heads, including
those in London, who use such mechanisms, and to my great surprise,
they are getting those excluded pupils back in at those times and are
often having success in dealing with
them.</div><a name="09032772000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">At
the same time, I have also talked to a lot of head teachers&#151;or
whatever they are called&#151;in pupil referral units, which we will
discuss in a moment. They talked to me about the problems when students
get permanently excluded and end up in PRUs, which often do not do a
very good job. Such pupils find it difficult to get back into
maintained schools and they do not always qualify for special
schools&#151;some of them maybe should, but 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column871" />Column number: 871</div>some probably should not and would not. There has been a problem in the
past with some of those youngsters, and we should have an expectation
that we can do better for the reasons that the hon. Member for Bognor
Regis and Littlehampton gave, which were rather extreme for a
Conservative. I think that he actually said that young people were not
really responsible for their own behavioural problems and that it was
the responsibility of the society in which they have grown up and of
their parents and so on. I agree that there is a strong link there, but
even I would not have gone quite as far as he did in suggesting that
youngsters have no responsibility at
all.</div><a name="09032772000273"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032772000592"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> Of course they have responsibility, but they are not
to blame for their position. If a child can be taken away from all the
things that have damaged them and put somewhere else&#151;for
example, with the hon. Gentleman&#146;s family when he was being
brought up&#151;they would not have such
problems.</div><a name="09032772000274"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032772000593"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> The hon. Gentleman is clearly on the
ultra-progressive wing of the Conservative party. I am only relieved
that the hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings is not here,
because he would be choking on whatever dinner he had been eating in
the small hours if he had heard that. I am encouraged by the fact that
the hon. Gentleman recognises so clearly the connection between family,
economic circumstances, aspirations, school results and
behaviour.</div>
<a name="09032772000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman should be a little more positive about the possibility of
schools doing better than they have done in the past. Permanent
exclusions should be available, and they should not be seen as a last
resort or to be tied up in bureaucracy. However, there are many other
ways in which schools should be working to keep youngsters engaged and
included. The policies of many schools of simply excluding pupils and
then incorporating them back into a class have been something of a
disaster.</div>
<a name="09032772000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">On amendment
288, which I moved, I am satisfied with the Minister&#146;s response.
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09032772000277"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032772000594"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> I beg to move amendment 338, in clause 235,
page 138, line 10, at end
insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(2A) In performing
their duties under this section, relevant partners must require as a
condition of admission to the school, the agreement of
&#147;home-school contracts&#148; between the school and each
pupil, establishing the required levels of compliance with the rules of
the
school.&#146;.</div><a name="09032772000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment would introduce home-school contracts into clause 235. It is
an important part of Conservative party policy to have home-school
contracts in place as a condition of admission, but it is something
that the Government seem intent on resisting. If we have the
home-school contract signed after admission, they really are pointless
and people regard them as not being worth the paper that they are
written on. However, if such contracts are a condition of admission,
people know that their child&#146;s stay at that school is
conditional on fulfilling the promises made in the contract, and so the
contract becomes something very real.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column872" />Column number: 872</div><a name="09032772000280"></a><div class="hs_Para">The argument
that Ministers make is that some parents are so hopeless that they
refuse to sign and that the people who suffer in those circumstances
are the children rather than the parents. Therefore, Ministers argue,
it is unfair to discriminate against those children in those
circumstances. However, I made the point earlier in our deliberations
that if that is the case&#151;if a parent is not saying to the school
that they will ensure that their children obey the school
rules&#151;that is indicative of something very serious in the way in
which that parent is raising that child. It is perhaps something that
the social services should be aware of, but it certainly should not be
a reason for letting that child into the school. It may be that no
school will have that child while their parent refuses to sign the
agreement, in which case there is a very serious problem that needs to
be tackled. Such issues should be tackled early, because they are a
clear sign that poor parenting is going on, which needs to be tackled
straight away.</div>
<a name="09032772000281"></a><div class="hs_Para">I strongly
believe that home-school contracts should be a condition of entry into
a school, and they would be effective if they were pursued in that way.
They are one of a range of measures that we will introduce, if we win
the general election next year, to focus on raising standards of
behaviour in our schools. Poor behaviour is a serious problem that
requires serious and radical measures. I look forward to hearing what
the Minister has to say about these
proposals.</div><a name="09032772000282"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032772000595"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> God help the poor children whose parents
feel unable to sign a home-school contract in the unlikely event that
the hon. Gentleman&#146;s party wins a general election next year. It
is totally wrong to penalise children whose parents refuse to sign an
agreement. We think that such agreements are a powerful tool to help
parents, schools and children to work together to improve outcomes for
a particular child. However, I cannot accept the argument that some
children should be refused entry to a school because consensus cannot
be reached between home and school about the content of a home-school
agreement.</div>
<a name="09032772000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
home-school agreement is not a contract in the legal sense, and we do
not believe that it should be. It is a statement of shared objectives
between home and school, setting out the expectations and
responsibilities of each party. It is an opportunity for the parents to
discuss the school&#146;s policies and their role in supporting their
child as a member of the school. The agreement should be the outcome of
productive and supportive discussions between home and school, and not
something that is forced on parents
involuntarily.</div><a name="09032772000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
invite the hon. Gentleman to withdraw his amendment, because I cannot
support
it.</div><a name="09032772000285"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032772000596"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> This issue clearly divides the parties, and I think
that it is an issue that it is not for this Committee to vote on, not
even later in our deliberations&#151;perhaps we will cover the matter
then, but it is really an issue for a general election. I think that
the public will side with us on this issue, regarding our party as one
that is serious about tackling poor behaviour.</div>
<a name="09032772000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">I repeat
again the point that I made when I introduced the amendment, that if
there are parents out there who refuse to sign these home-school
contracts, knowing full well that, as a consequence, their child will
not get 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column873" />Column number: 873</div>into a particular school or indeed any local school, that is a sign that
there is something seriously wrong with their parenting. The Minister
said, &#147;God help the child&#148;; I think that such an action
is an indication that that child needs help and support with their home
life.</div>
<a name="09032772000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">We will
return to that issue later in the proceedings and as we approach a
general election. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09032772000288"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment</i><i class="I">,</i><i class="I">

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032772000599"></a>The

amendment 98, in
clause 236, page 138, line 28, leave
out &#145;short stay school&#146; and insert &#145;prospect
school&#146;.</div><a name="09032772000296"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032772000600"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> These simple amendments challenge the
Government&#146;s choice on the new name for pupil referral units.
Amendment 97 would delete the phrase &#147;short stay school&#148;
and insert the more prosaic &#147;school for alternative
education&#148;. Amendment 98 would replace &#147;short stay
school&#148; with &#147;prospect school&#148;, which is the
previous name dreamt up by the Government. It will be interesting to
hear the reasoning behind the choice of that name, which must have
taken place in the Department over several months. The name was changed
relatively late in the day from &#147;prospect school&#148;, which
appears in the Government
documents.</div><a name="09032772000297"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032772000601"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I thought we had already received an explanation of
that; perhaps it was only in our briefing from the Minister and others.
Was the hon. Gentleman not told that &#147;prospect school&#148;
was the brand name of some other school organisation or school? Was
that not the Minister&#146;s
concern?</div><a name="09032772000298"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032772000602"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> I do not recall that, but it will be interesting to
see whether the Minister makes that point. There is a genuine policy
concern about the phrase &#147;short stay school&#148; and it comes
from the Association of School and College
Leaders:</div><a name="09032772000468"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Our
only comment on the proposed renaming of pupil referral units to short
stay schools is to recall Government reassurance that no school should
be required to take a pupil who is not ready to return from permanent
exclusion&#148;.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column874" />Column number: 874</div><a name="09032772000299"></a><div class="hs_Para">The phrase &#147;short
stay&#148; implies that stays at such schools will last for just a
matter of months, and certainly less than a year. It implies that the
pupil will return to a mainstream school regardless of whether their
behaviour has
improved.</div><a name="09032772000300"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
must ensure that pupil referral units or short  stay schools
become high-quality institutions staffed by teachers with a great deal
of experience in helping children with behavioural problems. They must
be trained and experienced in this field because PRUs have been one of
the weakest parts of the state education system. A significant number
have been or remain in special
measures.</div><a name="09032772000301"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
my constituency, two pupil referral units or special schools for
children with behavioural problems have had notices to improve or have
been in special measures. On visiting one in the period running up to
special measures, I was dismayed by the quality of education. It must
be a focus of Government policy to improve the quality of schools for
alternative education. They must provide help and education for
children who have behavioural
problems.</div><a name="09032772000302"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I said in an earlier debate, my view is that children are not
responsible for the way they are. When they become adults, they are
responsible for the way they become. When they are children, they are
children. If they have behavioural problems, they must be helped to
tackle them. For many children, the best setting is a smaller one with
teachers who are particularly well trained in helping children with
such
problems.</div><a name="09032772000303"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
would be helpful if the Minister addressed the concern of the ASCL and
said that there will not be an expectation of children being sent back
to mainstream school regardless of whether their behaviour has
improved. It does not matter whether it is the school that they came
from or another one within the behavioural partnership; children should
not be sent back before their behaviour has been sorted out. Will she
also explain the history behind the decision to rename PRUs as short
stay
schools?</div><a name="09032772000489"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.15

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032772000603"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> There appears to be a less serious point and a
serious point lurking among the amendments. I will start with what I
consider the less serious point, which is the name of these
institutions.</div><a name="09032772000305"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am getting increasingly worried about the hon. Member for Bognor Regis
and Littlehampton. Previously, there was an intriguing balance on the
Conservative Benches between the progressive Conservative&#151;the
hon. Gentleman&#151;and the less progressive hon. Member for South
Holland and The Deepings, who perhaps represents the less liberal wing
of the Conservative party. I am sure he will not mind us saying that in
his
absence.</div><a name="09032772000306"></a><div class="hs_Para">Since
the hon. Gentleman left us, we appear to be seeing the
ultra-modernising tendencies of the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and
Littlehampton, who has come forward with some extraordinary suggestions
for renaming pupil referral units and short stay schools. I am
surprised at the suggestion to call them &#147;schools for
alternative education&#148;, as that sounds like the sort of
left-wing, peacenik, lovey-dovey drug-smoking stuff that the hon.
Member for South Holland and The Deepings would be violently opposed
to. I am horrified by the thought that he might be reading this
assiduously at his 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column875" />Column number: 875</div>breakfast table, or over a long dinner in a couple of days&#146; time.
I hope he has nothing in his mouth when he reads the suggestions that
are being made.</div>
<a name="09032772000307"></a><div class="hs_Para">I imagined
that the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton might have
thought of something more consistent with his own principles: phonic
recovery schools, perhaps, or discipline schools or short, sharp shock
schools&#151;something of that kind. He has come up with an odd name,
but we must wait for the Minister to confirm why &#147;prospect
school&#148; was turned
down.</div><a name="09032772000308"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am not sure that I particularly care what the name is&#151;what is
important is what happens inside those institutions&#151;but I
welcome the fact that, whatever else, these institutions will be called
something &#147;school&#148;. The pupil referral units are part of
the same gobbledegook of education speak, and perhaps much else,
whereby the name obscures what is going on, rather than shedding light
on it. When I was first elected MP for the Yeovil constituency, I heard
about my local pupil referral unit and was not clear about what it was
there to do. Transparency in such matters is important.</div>
<a name="09032772000309"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
more important point, which I will touch on now. I will not return to
it during the clause stand part debate. The hon. Member for Bognor
Regis and Littlehampton also referred to the fact that these
schools&#151;whatever they are called&#151;have been seriously
underperforming for many years. That has been confirmed by the Ofsted
reports. It is long overdue for the Government to treat these schools
as a higher priority, and to ensure that youngsters are not encouraged
to be in them for a long period and that there are good connections
with other mainstream schools, as the Under-Secretary of State for
Children, Schools and Families mentioned. We should not write off the
youngsters in these institutions. What matters is not the name, but
what they do, and how they help youngsters to recover from the chaotic
circumstances that they were often in when they entered these
institutions.</div>
<a name="09032772000310"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032772000604"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> Amendments 97 and 98 would rename pupil
referral units &#147;schools for alternative education&#148; and
&#147;prospect schools&#148; rather than &#147;short stay
schools&#148;. In our White Paper, we stated our intention to rename
pupil referral units. We asked for suggestions for the new name and
received more than 100. We also asked for suggestions from the
ministerial stakeholder group on behaviour and attendance and the
National Organisation for Pupil Referral Units. The name &#147;short
stay school&#148; was chosen because it includes the word
&#147;school&#148;, thus emphasising similarity with the
mainstream, rather than differences. &#147;Short stay&#148; offers
a broadly accurate and neutral description of what those schools do
differently from other
schools.</div><a name="09032772000311"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
appreciate that, in some cases, pupils may spend an extended period in
a pupil referral unit. Examples of that might include pupils at key
stage 4, for whom it makes sense to do their exams and complete their
schooling in a pupil referral unit, or pupils with long-term medical
needs. We expect placements to be short term in the majority of
cases.</div><a name="09032772000312"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
clear message that we received from many consultation respondents was
that they did not want the new name for pupil referral units to include
words such 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column876" />Column number: 876</div>as &#147;centre&#148; or &#147;alternative&#148;, which they
felt emphasised difference from the mainstream and obscured the fact
that the units are schools and the main focus is on teaching and
learning.</div>
<a name="09032772000313"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032772000605"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> Is my hon. Friend saying that they are to be called
&#147;short stay schools&#148; because they are schools in which
pupils will ideally stay for a short
time?</div><a name="09032772000314"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032772000606"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> That is what it says on the tin.
&#147;Prospect school&#148; was suggested in the consultation
process. We thought that it was a good suggestion and investigated it
further, but, as the hon. Member for Yeovil said, four schools in
England already use &#147;prospect&#148; in their titles. After
consulting with those schools, we decided that using the word could
lead to confusion in the areas where the schools are
placed.</div><a name="09032772000315"></a><div class="hs_Para">Changing
the name of PRUs in legislation makes an important statement, which
sends a clear message that the Government are deeply committed to
bringing about a step change in the quality of alternative provision.
The name change marks a positive new beginning for the sector and sheds
the baggage of negative attitudes that have grown up around the term
&#147;pupil referral unit&#148;. As I have just said to my hon.
Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Innovation,
Universities and Skills, &#147;short stay school&#148; is the most
appropriate name. I ask that the amendment be
withdrawn.</div><a name="09032772000316"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032772000607"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> I take on board the Minister&#145;s point about
wanting the institutions to sound as similar as possible to mainstream
schools, so I agree that &#147;school&#148; should remain in the
title. My progressive title also had &#147;school&#148; in
it&#151;school for alternative education. I am intrigued that there
seems to be a move among some schools to cease calling themselves
schools and to use the phrase &#147;learning centre&#148;. Let us
hope that that phase and fad will cease and &#147;school&#148;
remains the title of all schools, not least so they remain consistent
with the new short stay schools being
created.</div><a name="09032772000317"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that we see improved quality in this sector of education, because
it is important that children in those institutions get an education,
as well as have their behavioural problems addressed. We have had a
short and fairly interesting debate, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw
the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032772000610"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> Clause 237 is about information about planned and
actual expenditure. Under the clause, the Secretary of State can direct
a local authority to provide information about its planned and actual
expenditure in connection with education and children&#146;s
services. Amendment 78 would add a new subsection. The point that it
contains may seem to be an obscure one to bring to our deliberations,
but the amendment raises a specific concern that reflects wider
concerns about some of the architecture and buildings that have come
out of the Building Schools for the Future programme. Some people have
termed it &#147;Building Schools for the Sixties&#148;, because a
lot of the architecture is designed to reflect an approach to education
that is progressive in the pejorative
sense.</div><a name="09032772000323"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032772000611"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> Alternative.</div>
<a name="09032772000324"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032772000612"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> Well, I use &#147;progressive&#148; there as a
pejorative term, rather than the benign term it usually is when I use
it. I would be grateful if the hon. Gentleman did not convey any of
that to my hon. Friend the Member for South Holland and The
Deepings.</div><a name="09032772000325"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is genuine concern about some of the architecture being used. The
National Deaf Children&#146;s Society has raised particular concerns
with me about the acoustics in some of the new buildings. It said in
its briefing to the Committee that open-plan teaching spaces were being
promoted without proper consideration of how to ensure high-quality
acoustics in such spaces, which is a real concern for deaf or
hearing-impaired children, and we need to address
it.</div><a name="09032772000326"></a><div class="hs_Para">Light
is also an issue. Several years ago, Sig Prais of the National
Institute of Economic and Social Research did an interesting study on
the architecture of schools in Switzerland. He concluded that some of
the old-fashioned Victorian buildings with high ceilings and ample
window space were the best environments in which children could learn,
rather than some of the buildings that were thrown up in the 1960s with
flat roofs, low ceilings and fluorescent lighting, which is very
damaging for
children.</div><a name="09032772000327"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that this probing amendment will trigger the Government and those
involved in the architecture of schools looking at the specific case of
the acoustics of classrooms in new-build schools. Moreover, they should
use that as an instance in the wider issue of architecture so that we
have an evidence-based approach to school building and design, as well
as an evidence-based approach to education policy more generally. I
look forward to the Minister&#146;s
response.</div><a name="09032772000328"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032772000613"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> Turning first to amendment 78, I have some sympathy
with the concerns about building design. In particular, I mentioned
yesterday&#151;or some time this morning&#151;a Policy Exchange
report on the school systems in Sweden, the United States and England.
I recommend that the Minister read it when he returns home to South
Dorset later
today.</div><a name="09032772000329"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
report criticises some of the developments in relation to the academies
building programme and claims&#151;I suspect that this is accurate,
but I am happy to take an intervention if it is not&#151;that the
flexibility and freedom given to sponsors on the design of their
buildings has been eroded over the past few years. There has been a
greater tendency to go for a standard build, often 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column878" />Column number: 878</div>excluding the sponsors from direct involvement in shaping the buildings
that they are in. I understand that that may be motivated by desire to
keep down the cost of some of those projects. Some academy projects
have become quite expensive, but that might also relate to the
particular sites involved.</div>
<a name="09032772000330"></a><div class="hs_Para">I share the
concerns of the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton that one
of the risks of the Government&#146;s huge school-building
project&#151;I dare not touch on the college-building projects at the
current time&#151;is that we could build a lot of the same types of
building in a very short period. If we get the design of those
buildings wrong, we will end up repenting at leisure over the next 20,
30 or 40 years. We will then find that we have to spend huge sums to
fix all those
things.</div><a name="09032772000331"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
suggests that we should be very thoughtful about the design
characteristics of schools, including in respect of the details in
amendment 78. Moreover, it cautions us against having some sort of
blueprint that is in fashion at one point and rolling it out everywhere
until it is discovered to be the wrong model and replaced everywhere by
something else. A certain variety and experimentation are probably a
safeguard against getting everything wrong at the same
time.</div><a name="09032772000332"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
289 is also probing and designed to explore issues relating to
expenditure on people with special educational needs. As has been
pointed out, clause 237
says:</div><a name="09032772000469"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Secretary of State may direct a local authority in England to provide
information about its planned and actual expenditure in connection
with&#151;</div><a name="09032772000470"></a><div class="hs_brev">(a)
its education
functions;</div><a name="09032772000471"></a><div class="hs_brev">(b)its
children&#146;s services
functions.&#148;</div><a name="09032772000333"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment would add a third category to the requirement in subsection
(1)(b),</div><a name="09032772000472"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;expenditure
on pupils with special educational
needs.&#148;</div><a name="09032772000334"></a><div class="hs_Para">Its
purpose will probably be obvious to the
Minister.</div><a name="09032772000335"></a><div class="hs_Para">Parents
with children who have special educational needs frequently report back
concerns about the lack of transparency and of budget that schools and
local authorities have for special educational needs. They are
concerned about how the money is allocated, which often undermines
confidence in the authority and in the ability of the parents to secure
the education that they believe their children need, particularly to
overcome SEN
problems.</div><a name="09032772000336"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
duty to provide information about SEN expenditure would be one small
step in addressing the lack of confidence in local authorities and it
would help to enable parents to hold their local authorities to account
and to ask questions about existing provision in the education budget
and future plans. I hope that the Minister, in the spirit of that
probing amendment, will comment on those
issues.</div><a name="09032772000490"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.30
am</div><a name="09032772000337"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032772000614"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> I shall first speak to amendment
78. There is no need for further powers to gather information about
acoustic quality in schools. The Secretary of State has general powers
to collect information in support of his functions and the Department
has frequently conducted surveys on the condition, sufficiency and
suitability of school buildings. It would be possible to gather
information about acoustic quality under those existing
powers.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column879" />Column number: 879</div><a name="09032772000338"></a><div class="hs_Para">The acoustic
quality of new school buildings is covered by other legislation
including building regulations made under the powers of the Building
Act 1984. In addition, regulation 18 of the Education (School Premises)
Regulations 1999 provides that each room or other space in a school
building shall have the acoustic conditions and insulation against
disturbance by noise appropriate to its normal use. The particular
requirements of pupils with special educational needs, including those
with special hearing requirements, are catered for by the Special
Educational Needs and Disability Act 2001, which provides that every
local authority must have a strategy for improving the accessibility of
schools for pupils with a disability.</div>
<a name="09032772000339"></a><div class="hs_Para">As part of
the continuous review of the relevant regulations, the DCSF and the
Department for Communities and Local Government are currently reviewing
building bulletin 93, which gives guidance on compliance with acoustic
standards for schools. The two Departments are liaising with the
National Deaf Children&#146;s Society and other stakeholders to
ensure that the needs of deaf children, those with special hearing
requirements and those with speech and language communication
difficulties are fully considered in the review. The inclusion of the
amendment would not, in my view, produce any additional improvement to
the work already being undertaken in that
area.</div><a name="09032772000340"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
289 is an important proposal for the collection of financial
information from local authorities to see how they are supporting the
provision for pupils with special educational needs. It offers a
welcome opportunity to discuss the issue of funding for pupils with
special educational needs. Local authorities and schools are funded to
provide SEN services mainly through the dedicated schools grant. The
Education Act 1996 requires local authorities, schools and early years
settings to have regard to the SEN code of practice, which provides
advice on their statutory duties to identify, assess and make provision
for pupils with special educational needs. The code is clear that
schools have a statutory duty to do their best to ensure that necessary
provision is made for pupils&#146; special educational needs. It is
also clear that whole-school measures can be affected in addressing
some special educational needs and preventing others.</div>
<a name="09032772000341"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Department collects data on what local authorities budget to spend on
children with special educational needs and every mainstream school is
given a notional sum for SEN as part of its budget information. We also
collect outturn data on what is spent in maintained special schools and
on pupils who are supported in non-maintained special schools and
independent schools. However, as far as mainstream schools are
concerned, the way in which they use their funding to fulfil SEN
responsibilities does not necessarily entail having some staff who work
exclusively with children with SEN, while other staff work exclusively
with other children. In practice, most staff work for children with SEN
as part of their wider responsibilities. If schools were required to
account for the use of their funding for SEN purposes, they would have
to attribute a proportion of each member of staff&#146;s time to
their SEN responsibilities. It would be likely that different schools
would estimate their SEN spending in different ways, so the information
returned to the Department would have little meaning.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column880" />Column number: 880</div><a name="09032772000342"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, to
ensure that they are making the best use of their resources, schools
find it helpful to be able to estimate what they are spending on each
activity to fulfil different responsibilities, and what impact that
spending is having on pupil outcomes. In May last year an interactive
resource pack was published by the Audit Commission to help schools to
determine whether their spending on children with special educational
needs offers value for money and makes real improvements to outcomes
with those children. What matters most is the impact SEN spending has
on pupil progression and outcomes. All schools should be monitoring and
evaluating the progression made by children with SEN and considering
what additional or alternative interventions might have more impact on
progress. Inclusion of the amendment would not produce meaningful or
reliable additional information to the Department&#146;s already
comprehensive data collection. On that basis, I invite the hon. Member
for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton to consider withdrawing his
amendment.</div><a name="09032772000343"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032772000615"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for her initial
positive comments about amendment 289. I feared, however, that she was
toying with me when she led  me to believe that she was
suddenly going to adopt amendment 289. She then veered away from that,
but she gave us a full response and that will be useful to both the
Committee and to those in the wider world who are rightfully concerned
about these issues. For that reason, I am satisfied with the
Minister&#146;s
response.</div><a name="09032772000344"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032772000616"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> There were some encouraging words from the Minister
on amendment 78. She said that building bulletin 93, which sets out the
Government&#146;s standards on acoustics, is being reviewed, and that
the Government are consulting the National Deaf Children&#146;s
Society as part of that review. That is welcome to Conservative
Members, because
the</div><a name="09032772000473"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;NDCS
has uncovered evidence that new schools are being built which
effectively ignore the Government&#146;s standards on acoustics and
which make it impossible for deaf children to listen and learn
effectively in the
classroom.&#148;&#151;</div><a name="09032772000345"></a><div class="hs_Para">those
are the words of the NDCS itself. Therefore, I hope that the Government
review will go beyond simply changing the wording of building bulletin
93, and look into how that bulletin translates into design when it
comes to the Building Schools for the Future programme. According to
the NDCS, there is
yet</div><a name="09032772000474"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;no
statutory requirement to test the acoustics of a school pre-completion
to ensure that the standards have been met. Derogations from the
standards are permissible and leading school designers and builders
have told NDCS that this is
widespread.&#148;</div><a name="09032772000346"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore,
I hope that the Government, when reviewing the bulletin, will look into
that issue as well, rather than just carefully crafting a new
phraseology for the bulletin. However, given that the Minister has
reassured the Committee that there is a review under way, I beg to ask
leave to withdraw the amendment.</div>

were all tabled on Tuesday. If the Committee were meeting next Tuesday,
they would not have been starred. But because we are effectively still
meeting on Thursday 26 March, those amendments are starred. As I
indicated at the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032772000618"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second
time.</div>
<a name="09032772000366"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are now on
the new clauses and we are definitely seeing light at the end of the
tunnel. New clause 1 raises two important issues that should be of
interest and concern to this Government, for two reasons. First, we are
increasingly seeing a large number of young people transferring, or
potentially transferring, to a college setting from a school setting.
We may anticipate that that will increase as the new diplomas are
introduced, with the vocation elements, and as the 14-19 curriculum is
developed. I think that we will see more movement of youngsters around
the school and college sectors, in order to engage with that wider
curriculum. Also, it is clearly the plan of the Government that more
young people should stay on, or even be made to stay on, in education
and training beyond the age of 16.</div>
<a name="09032772000367"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore, as
well as having those pressures on the college sector in terms of
student numbers in the 14-19 age group, particularly the 16-19 age
group, we will see a commitment by this Government to try to improve
the uptake of school food and, presumably, food for all children. Since
the Jamie Oliver campaign a few years ago, we have seen a lot of effort
to try to improve the uptake in schools of school meals, both those
that are free and those that are not free. Of course, so far that has
met with, at best, very mixed success. The numbers in the secondary
sector have plummeted and they have fallen in the primary sector. They
only remained stable in the primary sector last year and they are
probably continuing to fall in the secondary sector this year. It must
be a concern of the Government that their strategy on free school meals
means that half the children in poverty in the United Kingdom are,
unbelievably, not entitled to free school meals. My new clause may help
to address that part of the problem.</div>
<a name="09032772000368"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 1
would give a responsibility to education authorities, where requested
by students at sixth-form or further education college who are in the
relevant age group and who would, in a school setting, have access to
school food, to ensure that meals could be accessed on the same basis
as in schools. We also want those young people to be able to get access
to free school meals on the same basis as happens in the school
sector.</div>
<a name="09032772000369"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was very
surprised when I checked the figures a few months ago and discovered
that a student in a college setting who would in a school be entitled
to free school meals is not entitled to them at present, and is
therefore 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column884" />Column number: 884</div>very unfairly treated. If the Government are concerned about the fact
that half of young people in poverty are not entitled to free school
meals, this is one way in which they could fulfil the pledge they have
made, just as they could also consider changing the rules that were
amended in the 1980s to stop the entitlement to free school meals of
people who were in work, but on low incomes and on family
credit.</div>
<a name="09032772000370"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new
clause deals with a particular injustice, which is the unequal
treatment of young people who have in all respects the same
characteristics as those entitled to school meals, but who are in the
college rather than school
sector.</div><a name="09032772000491"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.45
am</div><a name="09032772000371"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032772000619"></a>Mrs.
Hodgson:</b> I will not make a long intervention but, as hon.
Members are probably aware, the subject of free school meals is one of
my passions. I have been pushing for several years for them to be made
universal. Is the hon. Gentleman also referring to the threshold by
which free school meals can be claimed? Does he feel that it should be
raised? I want to prise out of him his view about universal free school
meals. Does he think that they would be a good
idea?</div><a name="09032772000372"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032772000620"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> The hon. Lady has raised two important points that
could be directly relevant to the amendment, because if the terms under
which free school meals were made available were to change for students
in the school sector, logically, under my new clause, they would need
to change for the colleges sector. My view is that it is unlikely that
in the near future a Government of any complexion will pay the
&#163;2 billion that would make all school meals free, but I agree
that we could reverse the change made by the Tory Government in the
1980s when they took away the entitlement that 500,000 children then
had to free school meals on the basis of family credit. That would be a
welcome change and, alongside the proposals to give justice to students
in college, it could make a real different to the number of young
people in poverty who get free school
meals.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032772000621"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> The hon. Gentleman&#146;s new clause would
create a scheme similar to free school meals entitlement, as he said,
but it would not take account of the different post-16 learning routes
now on offer to young people. Not all young people get access to
further education in a college setting. A number of young people are in
unpaid as well as paid work-based learning and would be excluded from
the scheme that the hon. Gentleman proposes.</div>
<a name="09032772000374"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, we
have some sympathy with the hon. Gentleman&#146;s intention. We
announced in the &#147;New Opportunities&#148; White Paper that we
published earlier in the year a review of financial support for 16 to
18-year-olds to ensure that the system supports the new duty to remain
in education or training until the age of 18. The review will look at
learner support and benefits and we will further consider the support
packages available in the light of that review. Obviously I will ensure
that the interesting comments of both the hon. Gentleman and my hon.
Friend the Member for Gateshead, East and Washington, West will feed
into that. I hope that, with that reassurance, the hon. Member for
Yeovil will feel able to withdraw his fine new clause, knowing that his
point has been made and well heard.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column885" />Column number: 885</div><a name="09032772000375"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032772000622"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I am grateful to the Minister and partly encouraged,
because if I heard him correctly, he said that the new clause was a
good thing and that the problem was that it did not go far enough. That
is not often said of Liberal Democrat amendments, although we have
obviously become much more prudent as the Government&#146;s fiscal
irresponsibility has become increasingly apparent. The more serious
point is that that is a live issue, because the Government are
considering the terms on which school meals, and meals for people under
the age of 19 in educational settings, should be
available.</div>
<a name="09032772000376"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Gateshead, East and Washington, West will be aware, because
the announcement was made by the Secretary of State for Children,
Schools and Families at last year&#146;s Labour party conference,
that the Government are piloting various ways of extending free meals
for young people. Some of those pilots are a bit of a tease, because I
am not sure that the Secretary of State has the slightest intention of
paying the &#163;2 billion cost for deliver those
undertakings.</div><a name="09032772000377"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032772000623"></a>Mrs.
Hodgson:</b> The hon. Gentleman has twice mentioned the figure
of &#163;2 billion. I asked the Library to investigate that, and it
came back to me with a figure of between &#163;0.9 billion and
&#163;1.1 billion as the cost, so that should put the record
straight.</div>
<a name="09032772000378"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032772000624"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Lady for that, but I think
that she is quoting the figure for making meals free in primary
schools, which I think the Government are looking at. When I tabled a
question to the Department, I was told that the figure was &#163;2
billion&#151;&#163;1 billion each for the primary and secondary
sectors. That is understandable, but in a sense slightly odd, because
there is currently more of a challenge in the secondary sector, where
young people are voting with their feet and not taking school
meals.</div>
<a name="09032772000379"></a><div class="hs_Para">My point is
that the Minister&#146;s suggestions are welcome, because if the
Secretary of State is not going to deliver free school meals in either
the primary or secondary sectors, the Government might be looking for
some other sensible things to do to ensure that they deliver the
objective, which I and, I am sure, many Labour Members share, of
ensuring that the 26 to 28 per cent. of youngsters in this country who,
sadly, still live in relative poverty are entitled to free meals at
lunchtime in an educational setting when under the age of 19. It is a
scandal that half the young people living in relative poverty do not
get that entitlement, and I am sure that the Minister is serious about
those
undertakings.</div><a name="09032772000380"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032772000625"></a>Emily
Thornberry:</b> Given what the hon. Gentleman has said, does
he welcome Islington council&#146;s recent decision to give free
school meals to all primary school children in the
borough?</div><a name="09032772000381"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032772000626"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> The hon. Lady asks me to comment on the decisions of
an individual council, but she knows that I, as a Liberal Democrat,
cannot do that, because we do not believe in dictating to local
authorities. I seek to influence national policy, which is our
responsibility here&#151;I do not want her to tempt me into the
shark-infested waters of Islington politics.</div>
<a name="09032772000382"></a><div class="hs_Para">I ask the
Minister to look first at the young people who ought to be entitled to
free meals in the college sector, and secondly at whether young people
whose parents receive working tax credits&#151;the equivalent of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column886" />Column number: 886</div>the family credit, which used to be a passport for entitlement in the
1980s&#151;could become entitled. That would be far more affordable
than making all meals in educational settings free, so I hope that the
Government will think about that in their review. I beg to ask leave to
withdraw the
motion.</div><a name="09032772000383"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Clause,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032772000627"></a>Mr.

again.</div><a name="09032772000393"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032772000628"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> The hon. Gentleman said around four hours ago that
he was speaking for the last
time.</div><a name="09032772000394"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032772000629"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> No, what I very carefully said was that it was my
last major speech, not the last time that I would speak. Having said
that, I apologise to the Committee, because we have been sitting for a
very long period. Members of staff and others, including Labour
Members, have been patient and the Ministers have moved into their
finishing-straight
positions.</div><a name="09032772000395"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
had assumed that the new clauses were not of crucial importance and
that we could discuss them at a later stage, but this morning, when I
looked at new clause 21, which is inspired by the National Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Children and my hon. Friend the Member for
Mid-Dorset and North Poole, I saw that it is actually rather important.
Despite the fact that the Committee has been sitting for a long period,
it would be unsatisfactory if we did not discuss the new clause,
because it relates to the concerns highlighted by the baby P case and
Lord Laming&#146;s report. The new clause contains an important
suggestion for Ministers, and I would appreciate a response from them.
I therefore ask for some tolerance from the Committee while I 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column891" />Column number: 891</div>outline some of the new clause&#146;s key elements. After the Minister
responds, I promise that I will not detain the Committee
longer.</div><a name="09032772000492"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12
noon</div><a name="09032772000396"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I have said, the new clause is inspired, and was drafted, by the NSPCC
and my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole, who has
considerable expertise on the issue. The new clause would introduce a
statutory duty to ensure that a key worker sees a child separately from
his or her parents. Some members of the Committee will probably know
why the new clause is important and
topical.</div><a name="09032772000397"></a><div class="hs_Para">Section
47 of the Children Act 1989 requires a local authority to make
inquiries when a child is suspected to be suffering or likely to suffer
from significant harm. A child protection plan is drawn up when the
local safeguarding children board decides that a child is at
significant risk of harm. Examples of when seeing a child separately
might not be practicable or reasonable are when parents refuse consent,
when the child refuses to be seen alone or is plainly distressed at the
prospect, when the child has recently been seen separately, or if the
child is asleep during the visit. It is not envisaged that the key
worker would necessarily see the child for long or that the child would
be subjected to any medical or forensic examination or interrogation.
The purpose of recording the reasons for the inability to see the child
is to allow for persistent obstruction by parents to be highlighted.
Even sensible reasons, such as the child being asleep, might become of
concern if
persistent.</div><a name="09032772000398"></a><div class="hs_Para">Currently,
there is no law on seeing children separately, but both legislation and
guidance note the importance of obtaining children&#146;s views and
perspectives. Section 53 of the Children Act 2004 placed a new duty on
local authorities to ascertain and give due consideration to the wishes
and feelings of children before providing services under section 17.
The statutory guidance on child protection, &#147;Working Together to
Safeguard Children&#148;, emphasises the central importance of the
child in safeguarding procedures, and we have seen that in the baby P
case and some of the other cases highlighted recently. That document
states:</div><a name="09032772000475"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Some
of the worst failures of the system have occurred when professionals
have lost sight of the child and concentrated instead on their
relationship with the adults. The child should be seen by the
practitioner and kept in focus throughout the work with the child and
family. The child&#146;s voice should be heard and account taken of
their&#148;</div><a name="09032772000399"></a><div class="hs_Para">perspectives
and
views.</div><a name="09032772000400"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
guidance emphasises that assessing the risk of significant harm depends
on effectively communicating with children and young people, including
those who find it difficult to do so because of their age, an
impairment, or their psychological or social situation. The local
authority children&#146;s social care has legal responsibility for
section 47 investigations, which it says should always involve separate
interviews with the child who is the subject of concern. The key worker
appointed at the child protection conference should regularly ascertain
the child&#146;s wishes and feelings in relation to that
situation.</div><a name="09032772000401"></a><div class="hs_Para">Ministers
might well ask why those obligations should be in the law rather than
in statutory guidance. The NSPCC, my hon. Friend the Member for
Mid-Dorset 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column892" />Column number: 892</div>and North Poole and I believe that they should be a legal duty for two
reasons. Firstly, seeing the child separately from the parents is the
only way in which the key worker can reliably fulfil their duties under
section 53 of the 2004 Act. Seeing the child separately is
also central to the effective protection of children. On reading the
serious case review of the tragic baby P case earlier this year and
last year, the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families
noted in his press conference statement
that:</div><a name="09032772000476"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Inspectors also highlight a failure to talk directly to the children at
risk; and where children were not seen alone, it worries me greatly
that the Inspectors find little evidence of management follow-up to
ensure that children suspected of being abused were properly heard and
able to speak up without
fear.&#148;</div><a name="09032772000402"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
one of the few, sadly, who has been able to read the baby P serious
case review, I can confirm that that is one of the major
considerations, and one of the major concerns that anyone looking at
the detail of how that case was handled would have. It is clear from
the three official overviews of child serious case reviews that the
guidance on the need to see children is not sufficient. The overviews
all note that there is little to no evidence that children subsequently
murdered or injured were ever seen or talked to directly. They stress
the importance of that point. The overview relating to the earlier
period&#151;the 2001-03 documents&#151;deals with the failure to
protect vulnerable children because of the loss of focus on the child
or their circumstances. That issue came up in Lord Laming&#146;s
recent
review.</div><a name="09032772000403"></a><div class="hs_Para">Such
a provision would help key workers in their extremely difficult task of
simultaneously supporting and policing parents. It would allow the key
worker to explain that they are simply following the law when
requesting to see a child alone, and that that does not imply a lack of
trust in the parents. That is an extremely important point, given that
many parents about whose children there are protection concerns will be
quite sensitive about the circumstances in which those key workers see
the child alone. A strong parent-child attachment is critical to the
child&#146;s healthy development, and it is essential that key
workers can nurture proper relationships with parents, which can be
done only if there is
transparency.</div><a name="09032772000404"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that you understand, Mr. Chope, why I felt it necessary
to give a proper airing to this important and substantive new clause. I
do not necessarily expect it to be included in the Bill immediately,
but I hope that the Minister will respond to it
positively.</div><a name="09032772000405"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032772000630"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> In what is probably our last exchange on
this Bill, I would like to thank the hon. Gentleman for his very
generous comments to me yesterday.</div>
<a name="09032772000406"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is an
important new clause on a matter that we take very seriously. It is
essential that social workers can see a child alone when making section
47 inquiries or when the child is subject to a child protection plan.
As the hon. Gentleman said, the Government&#146;s statutory guidance,
&#147;Working Together to Safeguard Children&#148;, makes it clear
that section 47 inquiries should always involve the allocated social
worker, who is also the key worker, undertaking separate interviews
with the child who is the subject of concern. &#147;Working
Together&#148; also addresses a situation in which a child cannot
take part in an interview, because of their age or level of
understanding. If the child is very young, and therefore 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column893" />Column number: 893</div>unable to communicate verbally, the social worker must carefully observe
the child with their family and, if appropriate, with other adults or
care givers. &#147;Working Together&#148; also states that the
child protection plan should be explained to, and agreed with, the
child in a manner appropriate to their age and understanding.</div>
<a name="09032772000407"></a><div class="hs_Para">Social
workers are expected to make all reasonable efforts to persuade parents
to co-operate with section 47 inquiries. However, if parents refuse
access to the child, or if the social worker is concerned that they
cannot see the child alone, the local authority has powers, under the
Children Act 1989, to apply for an appropriate court order. The local
authority may apply for a child assessment order, and the court may
direct the parents or care givers to co-operate with an assessment of
the child&#146;s health and development. If there is a risk to the
child&#146;s life or a likelihood of serious, immediate harm, the
local authority may apply for an emergency protection order, the making
of which will ensure that either the child remains in a safe place,
such as a hospital, or is removed to a safe place, for example with
foster carers. When the order is made, the local authority should
quickly commence section 47 inquiries. Following such inquiries, the
local authority must consider what action to take to protect the child.
That includes deciding whether to initiate care or other proceedings,
or to let the order lapse and the child return
home.</div><a name="09032772000408"></a><div class="hs_Para">Local
authorities and social worker are expected to record their work with a
child and family accurately and in a timely manner. Those records
should include whether the child is seen and who else is present. The
guidance states clearly that key records, such as section 47 inquiries
and child protection plans, should be recorded in a manner consistent
with the relevant exemplars in the integrated children&#146;s system.
The social worker should also record the child&#146;s wishes and
feelings. The child protection review record for the child who is the
subject of a child protection plan records the dates on which the child
was seen since the last review and whether they were seen alone. In the
planned revision of &#147;Working Together,&#148; we will ensure
that that same recording commitment is made explicit when a child is
the subject of section 47
inquiries.</div><a name="09032772000409"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
assure the hon. Gentleman that we take the matter seriously. We believe
that it is already embedded in statutory guidance and that the local
authority has the necessary powers to take appropriate action. On that
basis, I hope that he will withdraw the
motion.</div><a name="09032772000410"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032772000631"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for her response. It
was important to air that issue; we will want to return to it on
another occasion, when we will have a full opportunity to expand on
some of the points. I thank her for the positive way in which she has
responded not only to the new clause but for the past 24 to
48 hours&#151;I have lost track of how long it has been.
All the Ministers, to be fair, have been extremely constructive,
positive and helpful to the Committee, but I particularly appreciate
her response, given that she has had to deal with the Bill over such a
long period with so few breaks and with four Opposition spokesmen
against her.</div>
<a name="09032772000411"></a><div class="hs_Para">If you will
allow me, Mr. Chope, I would also like to thank Government
Members for their involvement and Conservative Members for their
co-operation with us on many issues, although not all. I thank you and
Mrs. Humble for the way in which you have chaired our 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column894" />Column number: 894</div>proceedings over the past few weeks, particularly you for chairing our
proceedings and steering us over the rocks during the past 48 hours.
Finally, I thank all the others who have supported the Committee during
the past few weeks, and the past 48 hours in particular: the staff,
police, Clerks, <i class="I">Hansard </i>reporters and officials from the
Department. They have done such a good job, particularly in the past 48
antisocial hours. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.</div>
<a name="09032772000412"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">C</i><i class="I">lause,
by leave, withdrawn.</i></div>
<a name="09032772000413"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question
proposed, </i>That the Chairman do report the Bill, as amended, to the
House.</div><a name="09032772000414"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032772000632"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> It is usual at this point in the Committee stage
of a Bill to extend the courtesy of thanking all the people whom the
hon. Gentleman just listed. In this case, there are exceptional reasons
why we should offer those courtesies, and with great feeling. I shall
not rehearse the sometimes tetchy exchanges that we have had in the
past hours; those are on the record anyway. I want to be much more
positive.</div>
<a name="09032772000415"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill is
not an easy one&#151;it is a long and complicated one. At times, it
more than tried the patience of all those involved. I am extremely
personally grateful to you and Mrs. Humble for your
forbearance, Mr. Chope, particularly your own forbearance
under the strains that you have had to bear during the past hours.
However difficult it may have been, hon. Members from both Front
Benches have demonstrated extreme competence and professionalism in
scrutinising the Bill. At times, they may have felt that they were not
given as much opportunity to prepare as they could have been given,
because of the number of amendments and so on, but they have gone about
their business in an extremely constructive way, and the Bill benefits
from that level of scrutiny.</div>
<a name="09032772000416"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
progressive hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton has been
exemplary in that regard. It is unkind that the hon. Member for Yeovil
has been labelled Johnny No-mates; I am sure that he has some.
Similarly, I feel that it is equally unfair for people to suggest that
the hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings might be verbose and
regressive in contrast with the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and
Littlehampton. I thank the other members of the Committee, especially
the Whips, and am particularly grateful for the interest shown in this
Committee at the most senior level by the Whips Office.</div>
<a name="09032772000417"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thank my
officials, from John the apprentice in the Bill team all the way
through to the lawyers, the policy officials and the rest of the Bill
team; the <i class="I">Hansard </i>Reporters and Badge Messengers; the police and
security staff; the refreshment staff and other staff of the House who
have sustained us over the past 27 hours; and particularly the Clerks,
who I know bear a great strain in keeping us on the straight and narrow
and advising all of us, and especially you, Mr. Chope. This
is a good Bill, and I am proud to propose that we should report it to
the
House.</div><a name="09032772000493"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.15

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032772000633"></a>Mr.

House officials, police and doormen, for all their work over the past
few weeks. My thanks also to the Clerks, Mr. Shaw and
Mr. Davies, for their work 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column895" />Column number: 895</div>and advice, and thanks to the <i class="I">Hansard </i>writers and the staff of
the House for their patience, particularly over the past 48 hours. On
behalf of all the Members of the Committee I would like to thank both
Chairmen, Mr. Chope and Mrs. Humble, for their
studious and fair chairmanship during what has been a long and troubled
Committee.</div>
<a name="09032772000419"></a><div class="hs_Para">I offer my
deepest sympathy to the hon. Member for Plymouth, Devonport on the loss
of her father&#151;it must be a terrible time for her. I am grateful
therefore to my hon. Friend the Member for Beverley and Holderness who
stayed away while she was away&#151;if not him, then somebody else to
take his place during the Committee.</div>
<a name="09032772000420"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would also
like to thank my hon. Friend the Member for Broxbourne for his lively
contributions to our proceedings and my hon. Friend the Member for
Basingstoke for helping out with her specialist knowledge on early
years and children&#146;s issues, and of course a great big thanks to
my hon. Friend the Member for South Holland and The Deepings for his
erudition and his careful scrutiny of the DIUS parts of the Bill. I
have worked on three Bills with him and it is always a pleasure,
despite our occasional disagreements on
philosophy.</div><a name="09032772000421"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032772000634"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for allowing
me to intervene, because this gives me an opportunity to right a wrong.
I forgot to mention the Children, Schools and Families Minister, my
hon. Friend the Member for Portsmouth, North, and the Innovation,
Universities and Skills Minister, my hon. Friend the Member for
Birmingham, Erdington. They have done an admirable job on their first
occasion to lead on a Bill as Ministers and I am extremely grateful to
them.</div><a name="09032772000422"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032772000635"></a>Mr.
Gibb:</b> Finally, I would like to say a big thank you to my
hon. Friend the Member for Leominster for his huge help, particularly
during the past 24 hours, which without him would have been extremely
difficult. This whole Committee has been difficult for me. The burden
of Committee proceedings falls on the Opposition and this has been the
most extraordinary Bill Committee I have served on in my 12 years in
the House, and I have served on many during that period. We have had
Ministers voting the wrong way on clause 49&#151;not just once but
twice&#151;we became inquorate, and we had Labour Members failing to
turn up for a 9 o&#146;clock start and as a consequence losing three
votes. Those things are forgivable and one could maintain a sense of
humour about them if it had not been for what then happened, which was
a totally unnecessary long session out of sheer petulance, an approach
I am sure will be monitored outside this House and about which I am
quite cross and angry&#151;as are other members of this Committee. We
met from 9 o&#146;clock on Thursday through to 4.30 in the
morning, with periodic breaks, and from 8.15 this morning until 12.20
today. We met for just four hours today. We could easily have concluded
our deliberations next Tuesday, especially with a longer sitting, as
had been agreed on Thursday. We have now finished this Committee and
yet we have a full day&#146;s Committee left in the programme motion.
The cost to the House of Commons in terms of taxi fares and other
expenses will run into thousands of pounds&#151;something I hope to
find out about through the Speaker&#146;s Office.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column896" />Column number: 896</div><a name="09032772000423"></a><div class="hs_Para">More important
even than that, is the disruption to staff who work in the House. More
than the disruption, which they are used to periodically, at no point
was any clarity given so that they could phone their families and tell
them what was happening to their working day, which I find deeply
uncaring and surprising coming from Members of a party which claims to
be caring for people in their working lives. I find it rather offensive
and difficult to understand. Ministers claim that there has been
filibustering&#151;I know what filibustering is, I have been in the
House long enough to identify it. Although the hon. Member for Yeovil
goes on a bit sometimes, as does my hon. Friend the Member for South
Holland and The Deepings, neither of them was doing anything other than
his normal thorough  scrutiny of the Bill, which as the
Minister said involved 256 clauses, 16 schedules and more
than 200 Government amendments.</div>
<a name="09032772000424"></a><div class="hs_Para">Hostility to
parliamentary scrutiny is a sign of arrogance and of the final months
of a tired and dying Government, as is the failure of Government Back
Benchers to be bothered to get out of bed to be here for the
Committee&#146;s 9 o&#146;clock start. That is all I want to say on
that matter, Mr. Chope. I thank you and Mrs.
Humble for your careful chairmanship of the Committee. I hope we never
again have proceedings in Committee so poorly managed by Ministers and
so petulantly directed from the Government Whips
Office.</div><a name="09032772000425"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am grateful to my hon. Friends for their support and to the hon. Member
for Yeovil for his support on some of our amendments and for his very
valuable contributions to the scrutiny of the
Bill.</div><a name="09032772000426"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09032772000636"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Before I put the question, I wish to express my
very great appreciation to my co-Chairman for all her work in
Committee. I must congratulate her on her foresight in accepting so
readily my invitation, which I gave to her almost 24 hours ago, to take
over the Chair from 4 o&#146;clock on Thursday. I do not think that
even she could have realised the extent to which that obligation would
extend. She has enabled our proceedings to go extremely well, and I am
glad that she has been able to fulfil some of the commitments that she
already had for
today.</div><a name="09032772000427"></a><div class="hs_Para">May
I also thank the Clerks, the <i class="I">Hansard</i> reporters, the Badge
Messengers, the police, catering staff and all other servants of the
House who have been involved in helping us in our proceedings.
Sometimes I think that the thanks given are almost ritual, but in this
case they are extremely heartfelt. I would like to put on record my
apology to the Members of the House and officials to whom I gave
information on the basis of information provided to me, which was that
the proceedings would be adjourned when we got to clause 215. I passed
that information on to them and it turned out to be
erroneous.</div>
<a name="09032772000428"></a><div class="hs_Para">During
today&#146;s proceedings I have put on record my concern at the
nature of communications with the Chair. I am sure that other members
of the Chairmen&#146;s Panel will wish to discuss it. It is
absolutely essential that the Chair is recognised by members of the
Committee as having an important part to play in being informed of what
is happening. I just put that on record again.</div>
<a name="09032772000429"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not
think that the Committee would have been able to operate on automatic
pilot, as it did on one occasion when I was a member of a Committee
chaired 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column897" />Column number: 897</div>by Mr. Ted Leadbitter. In the early hours of the morning, he
was in the Chair asleep and, when he woke up, he congratulated the
Committee on having been on automatic pilot without troubling him. That
is a reminder of the fact that it used to be pretty commonplace for
Committees to sit through the night. It is not so common now, but
perhaps new precedents have been set in the consideration of this
particular
Bill.</div><a name="09032772000430"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
can tell right hon. and hon. Members that I gain some comfort from the
fact that members of the Committee are now more familiar with some of
the rules of procedure and Standing Orders than they were at the outset
of our proceedings. That can only be to everyone&#146;s benefit. We
will find out in due course how our proceedings have been treated in
terms of precedents and whether Committees have sat continuously for
longer. I recall&#151;again, many years ago&#151;when the Greater
London Council 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column898" />Column number: 898</div>Paving Bill was being debated. I think that it went on for a day and a
half sitting continuously, and at the end of it all, the British
Printing Industries Federation sent those of us who had participated in
all Divisions a certificate of thanks because we had contributed so
significantly to the profits of the printing industry. I am not sure
whether any of us will qualify for such a certificate as a result of
our deliberations, but I hand out a hint to the printing
industry&#151;if it wishes to proceed in that way. Without further
ado, I shall put the motion to the
Committee.</div><a name="09032772000431"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question
