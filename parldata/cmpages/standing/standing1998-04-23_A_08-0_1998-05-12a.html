<H4><center>Overriding duties of the Secretary of State and the Director General</center></H4>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>‘.— (1) The 1993 Act shall be amended as follows—<P>
(2) In section 4(2) Overriding duties of the Secretary of State and the Director General)—<P>
(a) the words “do his best to” shall be omitted; and<P>

</UL></FONT><P>
Brought up, and read the First time.<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Spring </B>(West Suffolk): I beg to move, that the clause be read a Second Time.<P>
Rarely, can there have been such times as now in the history of democratic society, when manifesto commitments have come under so much scrutiny within 12 months of a new Government coming into office. We saw an example of that last night when assurances that had been given on the future of community pharmacies were overturned. Considerable gaps have emerged between the rhetoric that was given about education and the national health service before the election and during the election campaign and what has happened subsequently and those gaps are being filled by the raid on the lottery.<P>
During the past few weeks, we have had the incredible sight of Labour Members voting repeatedly against the manifesto upon which they were elected—rarely more so than under the Bill that we are discussing. We were told before the election, for example, that the New Opportunities Fund would be set up only after the money in the millenium fund had been used up. When we saw that great sticky finger arriving from the Secretary of State to raid the national lottery, it was along the lines of that wonderful advertisement for the lottery, “It’s for you.”<P>
Let us consider the setting up of the National Endowment for Science, Technology and the Arts. Hon. Members welcome in principle the objectives of that organisation, which would have been a national trust for talent. However, what has emerged is nothing short of a Government-sponsored quango, with increased powers for the Secretary of State running unremittingly through the Bill. NESTA will not provide a basis for developing talent; it will be a mongrel involving neither a charity nor a venture capitalist. However, even at this late stage in our proceedings, perhaps Labour Members can be persuaded to honour a manifesto commitment, which is what new clause 4 is all about. Given the experience of the past few weeks, I cannot say that my hopes are high, but the heavens always rejoice at the conversion of a sinner and perhaps I can entice Labour Members to consider the basis on which they were elected and to act accordingly.<P>
The success of the national lottery is due to the fact that the public have confidence in it and because it was attractively packaged, designed and sold. At the heart of its almost unique success is the profit motive. As in all spheres of national life, it has acted as a dynamic for innovation, for progress and for thinking up new and attractive ideas for selling a product to the consumer. That motive, which has been at the heart of the relationship between the Government and Camelot, has had the net effect of producing substantial sums of money for good causes. I shall not rehearse what those causes are, but they are traditional, under-resourced areas of our national life, including sports, arts and heritage. Recent innovations such as the mid-week draw continue to make the national lottery appealing and successful. <P>
If we compare the remarkable success of the national lottery with lotteries in other countries, we can take some pride in it. We believe that the lottery should not be organised and administered by the Government; rather, its success depends on the underlying profit motive. Indeed, the fact that so many countries have sought advice from Camelot or wanted a relationship with it bears out that point extremely well.<P>
In giving the Government the chance to accept new Clause 4, we are giving them the chance to honour their pre-election pledge. If they reject it, they will be admitting that they were wrong before the election to promise to appoint a not-for-profit operator. If the Government admit that they were wrong, they will have underlined the reason for the lottery’s success—the profit motive—which has resulted in the maximum amount of money going to the good causes so valued by communities throughout the country. The Government would be wrong because a not-for-profit operator could cut the amount of money going to good causes—that is certainly the experience in other countries—and an increased proportion of revenue could be allocated to costs. By any international comparison, the national lottery is presently run on a very low-cost basis, as we saw during the original bidding process.<P>
Before the election, it was attractive for Labour to sing a particular line on their view of the lottery—and of profit, pay and businesses. They did it successfully in political terms, but it was treated quite disingenuously as a populist issue. In retrospect, it was a pathetic way of getting the tabloid press excited on that subject and looking at Camelot in a particularly negative way. The truly over-the-top way in which the Labour party in opposition sought to exploit those issues was totally to their discredit.<P>
New clause 4 would give effect to Labour’s much-hyped and exaggerated promise, made in opposition, that a not-for-profit operator would replace Camelot after the expiry of its seven-year licence in 2001. That vein was richly tapped before the general election. It underlined the present Government’s exploitation of people’s distrust in the profit motive, yet it was the engine of success for the national lottery. Tabloid hysteria about the salaries of Camelot directors was ruthlessley expoloited by the Secretary of State in such a way as to cause maximum political advantage to himself, but it backfired.<P>
<B>Mr. Ivor Caplin </B>(Hove): Will the hon. Gentleman confirm that he wholeheartedly supported the salaries that Camelot directors took out of the national lottery?<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> Once again, the hon. Gentleman so completely and profoundly misunderstands the arrangements within Camelot and the national lottery that his question is hardly worth answering. It is entirely a matter for Camelot if it wishes to pay bonuses of X or Y out of its profits. Whether it was a good or sensible business decision is beside the point. The question that I hope the hon. Gentleman will seek to address, is that pre-election hype on a not-for-profit lottery, which has now flip-flopped around and which created much political excitement on the way, was totally unprincipled.<P>
<B>Mr. David Pior </B>(North Norfolk): Does my hon. Friend agree that that question from the hon. Member for Hove (Mr. Caplin) gives the game away? Behind it lies the assumption that somehow the Secretary of State knows what level of bonuses, wages or salaries should be paid. Labour Members cannot bear to leave the lottery to be run at arm’s length.<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> My hon. Friend is absolutely right. What the Secretary of State knows about the private sector could be written on the back of a postage stamp. Underlying the whole Bill is the Government’s desire to centralise and to accrete powers to the Secretary of State. Ultimately, that will be damaging because the Bill may undermine public confidence in the lottery and reduce the amount of money going to good causes.<P>
The Labour party manifesto commitment demonstrates a clear understanding that there is a conflict between maximising the return to the good causes and providing the operator with the motive to make a profit.  “new Labour because Britain deserves better”, published in April 1997, states:<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“Because the lottery is a monopoly intended to serve the public interest, it must be administered efficiently and economically. When the current contract runs out, Labour will seek an efficient not-for-profit operator to ensure that the maximum sums go to good causes.”<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
The Government have been flip-flopping around in an unprincipled way. <P>
The best way to ensure that the lottery serves the public interest is to ensure that the operator has the incentive to raise as much revenue as possible—that will enhance its own profit, but money will of course also flow back to the good causes, which we are so anxious to support. That guarantees that the good causes will be supported to the maximum extent. The very process of Camelot seeking to maximise its own profit, which is only about 1 per cent. of turnover—remarkably low by international standards—has maximised the return to the good causes. The projections of Camelot and the Government when the National Lottery, etc, Act 1993 brought the lottery into being underestimated the amount of money that would be raised for good causes by between £1 billion and £1.5 billion. The dynamic of the profit motive has been the engine pushing the process to such success.<P>
In its report on the process by which the licence was awarded, published on 7 July 1995, the National Audit Office endorsed the view that the best way to ensure the maximum return for the good causes—the common objective of all hon. Members—is to provide the operator with an incentive to generate as much revenue as possible from the lottery. It said:<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“The National Audit Office’s main conclusions were that the evaluation process was comprehensive, consistent, logical and properly controlled; that throughout the process the Director General acted in accordance with the statutory duties placed upon him; that following the competition the licence was awarded to the applicant who was shown by the Director General’s evaluation to offer the highest return to the Distribution Fund; and that the key commitments offered in the successful application were incorporated in the Section 5 licence issued.”<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
The report further states that any unexpected success for the lottery—we have talked about the global sums involved—would result in an increasing proportion of the proceeds being paid to the very good causes that we are all so anxious to support.<P>
The National Audit Office found that<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“The way in which applicants were required to structure their applications effectively guaranteed that, as sales increased, an increasing proportion of the revenue generated accrued to the Distribution Fund, thus ensuring the fund benefited from any unexpected success in the Lottery.”<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
The Governments own analysis of the responses to the White Paper also demonstrated the absurdity of Labour’s commitment to appointing a not-for-profit operator on the expiry of Camelot’s licence in 2001. That analysis, prepared for the Department in December 1997, states:<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“Only 71 respondents commented on this chapter . . . These figures demonstrate the very low response to that part of the White Paper. Many more respondents ignored this chapter than any other. It was noticeable that even of those who alluded to it, it was likely that they would merely suggest that the question of who operated the Lottery and how was not appropriate to them. The others suggested that it was irrelevant as long as the most money possible went to the good causes.”<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
Sadly, under the bill, those good causes will be robbed of a substantial amount of money to pay for the Government’s own political commitments.<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Labour party should have needed no further advice on its dogmatic pursuit of a not-for-profit operator, despite the watering down of a firm commitment to appoint a not-for-profit operator, to a commitment to “seek”one. Labour’s original intention clearly was to appoint a not-for-profit operator, as stated in its draft manifesto of April 1997, which states: <P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“The organisation itself”—<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
referring to the lottery—<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“as a monopoly”—<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
what a wonderful word Labour keeps using—<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“should be run efficiently, but not for profit.”<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
On Second Reading in the other place, Lord McIntosh of Haringey claimed that the Government were not abandoning their commitment to a not-for-profit operator, when he said:<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“The Bill does not explicitly mention a not-for-profit operator, but I assure the House that it has always been and still remains our intention to seek a not-for-profit operator, if such an operator will ensure the best possible return to the good causes. There is no need to change the legislation to make this happen; the existing framework allows a non-profit operator to bid. The Director General of Oflot and the Culture Secretary will be doing all that they legitimately can to encourage such applicants, but the key criterion for award of the licence is the money raised for the good causes, which is as it should be.”—(Official Report, House of Lords, 18 December 1997; Volume. 584, c. 731.)<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
The commitment that he gave was meaningless in the context of maximising the return for good causes.<P>
Unless the Government choose to exclude profit-making concerns from the bidding, when the licence is to be renewed, they will have gone back on their commitment and, in all probability, a profit-making concern will win the bid. The Government have been doing some wonderful flip-flopping. After all the political capital in the run-up to the general election, including attacks on the profit motive and the efforts to embarrass Camelot by exaggerated hyperbole, a shift has taken place as reality has begun to dawn. Ultimately, the Government are not prepared to bite the bullet. That ambivalence to profit, as opposed to the outright rejection of a profit-making operator, has come with the responsibility of Government and the realisation of the need to get as much revenue as possible, especially as the clear objective of the Bill is to rob the existing good causes and to put the money into Government-sponsored and Government-supported programmes for entirely political reasons.<P>
The Government’s commitment to their pledge is now so feeble that they even considered that there was no need to mention it in the Bill. On Second Reading, the Secretary of State said:<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“Before Opposition Members do so, let me draw attention to something that is not in the Bill. Look as hard as one will, one will not find any mention of a not-for-profit operator; nor will one find any mention for a for-profit operator. We said in our manifesto that we would seek a not-for-profit operator for the next licence, and we remain committed to that objective.<P>
There is no need to change the existing legislation to bring that about. We can achieve our aim entirely within the National Lottery etc. Act 1993. Let me stress that, in seeking a not-for-profit operator and assessing any other proposals, the National Lottery Commission will have one overriding aim: to ensure that the lottery delivers the best possible return for the good causes. I remain committed to our manifesto pledge, and that will be clear when we advertise the next operator’s licence.”—[Official Report, 7 April 1998; Vol. 310, c. 164.]<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
That is precisely the sort of sophistry or self-delusion that we nave come to expect from the flip-flopping adventures of the Secretary of State. The right hon. Gentleman says that there will be no reduction in money for good causes. We know how worried the distribution bodies are about that. We have already discussed the flagrant breaches of the additionality and the arm’s length principle that are inherent in the Bill. We have not had a satisfactory response. The right hon. Gentleman now claims that the Government hold firm to their pledge to appoint a not-for-profit operator. I do not believe that.<P>
Both in opposition and in government, Labour Members have consistently delivered a series of weasel words, reacting in the way that is most politically advantageous at the time. When the history of this Government is written, detailing how they sought to exploit the national lottery for political advantage both before the election and in this Bill, they will be condemned by all who favour supporting under-resourced elements—the existing good causes.<P>
If the Government are not prepared to enshrine in the Bill the not-for-profit principle, it is unlikely that there will be not-for-profit bids. What a contrast the Secretary of State’s words are to the clear pledge that the Labour party made in opposition, in the policy document produced by the Labour policy committee, of which the Minister for Arts was a member. That document states:<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“At the end of the current seven-year contract, the appointment of an efficient ‘not-for-profit’ organisation to run the lottery would have the benefit of retaining long-term public support. Alternatively, an effective cap on profits should be considered if a competitive not-for-profit organisation cannot be found”.<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
A total misunderstanding of the dynamics of the free-enterprise system lurks in the Minister’s soul. If profits are too high because people organise themselves effectively, to the advantage of good causes, the suggestion is to cap them. Such flawed involvement in the economy led us down the siren route of the 1970s to so much trouble. As he and other Labour Members demonstrated in that Labour policy document, an attack on the profit motive underlies his search for a not-for-profit operator.<P>
No doubt the Minister will rise in due course to acknowledge the Government’s error in not including the provision in the Bill and to accept the new clause. Throughout the formulation of the Bill, before the election, during the election and now, the Government’s action on manifesto commitments and policy documents and their response to the plethora of arguments surrounding the national lottery have changed and are changing. Unless people are rooted in some sort of principle, history will judge them badly. The clause fleshes out the Government’s inconsistency on the matter and underlines how the enormously successful national lottery will be undermined.<P>
When producing and supporting legislation, hon. Members should always be mindful of the need to consider the extend of ministerial powers and to ensure that the arm’s length principle is never undermined to this extent. This is an open door for future Governments to raid the lottery for party political reasons such as are already evident in the Bill.<P>
Manifesto commitments should be taken seriously. Only in the most extreme circumstances should they be overturned. The thread running through the Bill is that Labour Members were, quite dishonourably, prepared to support one view before the election, which they are now rejecting. The new clause gives them the opportunity to square their consciences at the eleventh hour.<P>

<P>

<B>Mr. Robert Maclennan </B>(Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross): The reality behind the rhetoric of the hon. Member for West Suffolk (Mr. Spring) is that substantially more unites the official Opposition and the Government than he would allow. Despite his talk of sophistry, of the desire to centralise, of the abandonment of the arm’s-length principle and of setting the principle of additionality at nought, the truth is that the Opposition set in train those processes when they established the lottery.<P>
The lottery was a major centralisation of gambling, and it drew such matters into the hands of a monopoly. The hon. Member for West Suffolk used the word “monopoly” as though it were peculiarly inapposite, but the lottery is a state monopoly, which has been permitted to draw into its hands millions of pounds.<P>
<B>Mr. Prior:</B> Does the right hon. Gentleman agree that the New Opportunities Fund will be more closely controlled by the Secretary of State than the previous distributing bodies were?<P>
<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> I will come to that point in a minute. The point that I am making is that from the beginning, lack of centralisation, the arm’s-length principle and additonality were honoured more in the breach than the observance. The reality is that from the moment the lottery was introduced, the principle of additionality was breached; the budget of the Department that is now called the Department of Culture, Media and Sport took a sharp downturn as soon as the lottery was set up.<P>
The lottery has been used as a reason to diminish the taxpayer’s direct input through the Department’s vote, but the official Opposition have never adequately admitted that fact. Of course the Government have accepted both that fact and the outgoing Chancellor’s budgetary proposals in determining the Department’s expenditure. Money that had been made available for the arts, sports and heritage through a vote of Parliament to the then Department of National Heritage was replaced by the lottery. That is the official Opposition’s objection to the Bill. They are saying that there are more opportunities for replacement by the lottery under the heading of the new causes. That specifically deals with point made by the hon. Member for North Norfolk (Mr. Prior).<P>
I think that the Conservatives protest too much. In setting up the Millennium Commission—a major distributing body—they decided that it should not be independent, that the Secretary of State should be its chairman and that it should be dominated by the then Government’s political priorities, which are being carried on in the plans for the millennium celebration at Greenwich. There is nothing arm’s-length about that—the arm’s-length principle is something of a myth.<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> The right hon. Gentleman makes a perfectly fair point about the Millennium Commission, but that represents only a fifth of the picture. It would have been easy to give the Secretary of State powers that applied to all the good causes, but a clear distinction was made in the original legislation between those good causes and the millennium projects. The right hon. Gentleman is putting a gloss on the matter as if the whole package of the original Act were centralising. That is not entirely correct.<P>
<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> It is the hon. Gentleman who has made statements about the unimpeachable principle of additionality. It is he who has treated the arm’s-length principle as unassailable. Frankly, that principle has been more honoured in the breach than the observance by successive Governments.<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I said earlier that it was the former Member for Putney who on the eve of the election, far from giving money to the arts distribution board to help the opera, signed a cheque for English National Opera to purchase the Coliseum theatre. There was nothing arm’s-length about that; it may have been wise and well done, but it was done by the Minister. Despite all the asseverations of successive National Heritage Ministers, and now Ministers in the Department of Culture, Media and Sport, that they still adhere to the arm’s-length principle, can we get away from that nonsense and start talking about realities?<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> I do not understand where the hon. Gentleman’s comments are leading. He is describing the situation as he sees it; does he approve of the proposed change? He appears to suggest that because such things happen anyway, the powers of the Secretary of State may be extended. I am not clear whether he approves of or rejects the situation as he summarises it. It would be interesting to know his personal view.<P>
<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> The hon. Gentleman spoke for about 25 minutes when developing his views. I have not yet finished the exposition of my position. If I may say so, I hope not to take as long to do so as he did.<P>
My personal view is that the time has come to recognise that there is not a great deal to be said for the arm’s-length principle. The arts, in particular, would be favoured by the recognition that Ministers should be accountable for the arts flourishing or dying, and that they should be prepared openly to answer charges that money has been misspent or misdirected or has not been forthcoming in amounts appropriate to sustain what the country perceives to be the needs of the arts. The time has come to abandon the arm’s-length notion.<P>
I believe that that principle was first developed in the thinking of that great Liberal, John Maynard Keynes, when the Arts Council was established with him as its chairman at the end of the second world war. It  was entirely understandable that the arm’s-length principle should have been espoused in the post-fascist, post-Marxist era, when Governments abroad had used the arts for the most improper purposes, and when it was feared that to give Governments power over the arts would be to run the risk of the power being abused. Those circumstances have long since gone.<P>
The arm’s-length principle has been invoked by Government—notably by the previous Government—as an alibi to cover up the lack of public support for the arts and to allow them to say that the arts are looked after by the various distributing funds. I find the whole thrust of the hon. Gentleman’s attack on the Government’s position to be misconceived.<P>
<B>Mr. Prior:</B> In the arts, does the hon. Gentleman see any distinction between tax revenues and lottery proceeds?<P>
<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> I see a substantial distinction. Tax revenues are a required payment, but lottery revenues are voluntarily given. The lottery’s ability to raise the funds comes about because of a decision taken by the Government and by Parliament. However, in the process of establishing such a great monopoly, some significant commercial interests were given a great deal of money.<P>
I go thus far with the hon. Member for West Suffolk: a certain amount of humbug was heard from the Government about a not-for-profit operator. Impressions were given prior to the election that, for better or worse, seem to have served their purpose and are unlikely to be met in the near future. Those impressions were given because of the widespread feeling that it would be difficult to justify and against the public interest to give such huge sums of money to the lottery operators. That was particularly so as Mr. Richard Branson has proposed a not-for-profit operation, which would be substantially more in the public interest, and that the benefits being reaped by the consortium of companies that put together the successful bid might be better directed towards the good causes.<P>
I do not think that Richard Branson entirely satisfied the scrutineers of the lottery bids that he was able to do that. In the event, however, the successful companies have distributed a lot of money—not only in bonuses to the well-salaried operators, but in the form of dividends. If one were to do a spot of arithmetic to determine how much money had been distributed to the shareholders as a result of their success in winning the management of the national lottery, one would run up a pretty big bill. It is therefore reasonable to ask whether the lottery could, at an appropriate time, be run for the public interest by a not-for-profit organisation.<P>
I do not take a dogmatic view about that, but it is certainly worth considering because many of the initial uncertainties have disappeared. Many of the modes of operation are now well understood. A subsequent operator may take a great deal less risk than the entrepreneurs who put forward the successful initial proposals. Whatever the position may be today, and however justified it may be for the companies operating Camelot and the national lottery to reap their rewards for their risk—in so far as there are risks—that position will not obtain when the franchise runs out. I hope that the Government will not entirely resile from their position, which was struck more with an eye to how it might affect the public’s voting intentions than with the firm intention to put right what was conceived to be a mistake. <P>
We are considering whether the private sector is best suited to run a public monopoly. Although the profit motive undoubtedly caused the companies to bid, the capacity to operate a project efficiently and effectively does not automatically, under the law of Medes and Persians, as it were, depend on the profit motive.<P>
The wish to serve motivates rich people. I have been struck by how many of them have established highly efficient trust funds with the same purpose as that of the good causes, although they are on a smaller scale. Those people want their money properly distributed and directed. The efficiency of the distribution of such funds, which can run to millions of pounds per annum, depends not on the profit motive but on the motivation of those involved in the process.  Profit is not an absolute sine qua non for the success of the management of the lottery.<P>
Furthermore, the profit motive has not been the dominant driving force behind the Foundation for Sport and the Arts. That organisation, which is funded by pools companies, is notably successful. It has been run on a shoestring, and at the beginning distributed £60 million a year without a great bureaucratic centralising hierarchy. If the foundation can operate without the profit motive, I do not see why a lottery operator could not operate similarly. The expertise of the Foundation of Sport and the Arts is germane to the Bill, and I hope that its place in the sun will be secured by the Government’s action. It has shown how a great deal of money from the betting industry can be successfully, efficiently and effectively channelled into good causes. It has blazed a trail that the national lottery has followed.<P>
It was a slightly cynical exercise for Conservative Members to table a new clause that their hearts were not in and to use it simply as a means of twisting the Government’s tail. However, I suppose that those in opposition act that way, and we learn to live with such devices for stimulating debate. I should like to know whether the hon. Member for West Suffolk will force a Division on the new clause. It would be interesting to have the Opposition’s position on the record, but I suspect that they will not go that far.<P>
It is plain that the Government do not require the new clause and that the Minister will give the repeated reassurance that they could move along the lines of the 1993 Act. We shall see in due course whether they will do that, especially given the new provisions for advising the commission on the choice of the subsequent franchise holder. I do not know whether they will take an oath of fealty to the cause of the not-for-profit operators in appointing advisers—the panel—to the new commission. I rather doubt it. It seems that the prospects of a not-for-profit operator being selected are dwindling.<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
That is a pity, but I do not expect the Minister to say anything else today to remove my expectations. I remember much firmer statements being made prior to the election about not using private operators for prisons and abandoning prison hulks, for example. Not only have those commitments not been adhered to, but the precedent established by the outgoing Government has been built upon, and prison hulks are very much a feature of the south coast—as indeed, are privately operated prisons.<P>
The hon. Member for West Suffolk is perfectly justified in having some doubts about whether the Minister’s enthusiasm for a not-for-profit operation will carry the day against the presentational arguments about the Government being committed to replacing a Conservative Government with conservativism.<P>

<P>

<B>Mr. Prior:</B> In our debates in the past few weeks, my mind has been taken back inexorably to Blakeney harbour in my constituency, where at low tide the mud is very thick and sticky. If one runs across the mud one does not sink into it, but if one stops for a moment to reflect upon the world, one sinks rapidly.<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> Unless one is the Prime Minister.<P>
<B>Mr. Prior:</B> He does at high tide.<P>
Thoughts of the harbour have come back to me often in our debates. Every time we have managed to get into serious debate on the Bill—I am thinking of three issues, in particular—we have sunk deeply into the mire. The first issue into which we sank without trace was the arm’s-length principle. The Opposition believe that that is extremely important, and I do not agree with the right hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (Mr. Maclennan) that the principle should be abandoned. It was regarded as important by the former Opposition, who are now in government, when the National, Lottery etc. Act 1993 was introduced by the Conservative Government. We are in favour of the arm’s-length principle, and we do not want the lottery to descent into pork barrel politics. We do not want the Secretary of State or his hon. Friends to have their own pet projects.<P>
The second issue causing us to sink is additionality.<P>
<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> Why should Ministers who are responsible for spending money on artistic projects be more at risk of pork barrel politics than Ministers who spend money on health or education projects? Surely the nation’s needs for education, health and the arts can be judged in the same way.<P>
<B>Mr. Prior:</B> Ministers set out their priorities clearly in the manifesto on which they were elected, but the moneys given to the distributing bodies are not subject to that manifesto; they can exercise considerable discretion on how to spend their money.<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> One of the more consistent themes during Prime Minister’s Questions has come from the right hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown) who has pointed out the Government’s wholly inadequate performance in such matters as education and health. The raid on the lottery is an attempt to fill the breach created by the Government’s inadequate performance compared with their promises before the election.<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I remind hon. Members that the clause deals with who runs the lottery, not how money is spent. We should concentrate our minds on that.<P>
<B>Mr. Prior:</B> The Government are locked on the horns of a dilemma in relation to the lottery operator. During a previous debate, in which I think the phrase “capitalist hyenas” was used, it became clear that many Labour Members greatly distrust the profit motive, yet others—perhaps new Labour—believe that profit is not a dirty word and that profit can be used to raise money for good causes.<P>
It is worth drawing the Committee’s attention to the wording of the new clause, which would delete the words<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“that the net proceeds of the National Lottery are as great as possible”<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
and insert the words<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“the selection of a not-for-profit operator.”<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
Implicit in the new clause is the acceptance that the two do not go together.<P>
I agree with the right hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross that it is unlikely—although it cannot be ruled out altogether—that an operator who is not motivated by profit could raise the maximum possible proceeds. It would be extremely difficult to find an operator, especially given the regime that the Government are imposing on the operator, who could attract as much money as possible on a not-for-profit basis. The Government have not properly addressed that dilemma.<P>
I end my short speech with this theme: none of the difficult issues—whether it be the arm’s-length principle, additionality or the role of the operator—has been properly addressed in the Bill. Opposition Members are entitled to say that the Bill is a triumph of populism and image over principle.<P>
<B>Mr. Nigel Waterson </B>(Eastbourne): I shall begin by commenting on the speech by the right hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross. I always think that the speech of a Liberal Democrat spokesperson is rather like a children’s birthday party; everyone comes away with something. On this occasion, the Government had a mild slap on the wrist for their populism and Conservative Members had a slightly sharper slap on the wrist for the alleged cynicism of new clause 4.<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> What about the sticky fingers?<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> I am sure that on mature reflection, the right hon. Gentleman will realise that were it not for this so-called cynical new clause, he could not have made such a lengthy speech on the important matter of a not-for-profit operator.<P>
This is very much on old Labour/new Labour point. It seems that the re-education of the Labour party during the 1980s and 1990s might have been only skin deep in some cases. My hon. Friend the Member for North Norfolk made the point that profit is still a dirty word in many quarters of the Labour party. However, there are honourable exceptions, including the Paymaster General.<P>
The thrust of my speech is to ask the Minister whether, despite all the problems that have been encountered with GTech, the regulator and so on, he believes—I hope that he tries to be dispassionate, although no politician can claim to be totally so—Camelot or any other operator could have done any better? Irrespective of the noises off, which have not affected the lottery’s central task and Camelot’s performance, could the lottery’s performance have been improved?<P>
As the rather good brief provided by the House of Commons Library points out, the issue is thether an operator holding a section 6 licence should be able to make a profit. My hon Friend the Member for West Suffolk touched on the fact that the National Audit Office endorsed in strong terms the view that the best way to ensure the maximun returns for the good causes—which, we all agree, is what the lottery is about—is by providing the operator with an incentive to generate as much revenue as possible.<P>
Several paragraphs of the Comptroller and Auditor General’s report of July 1995 made it clear that that was a key part of appointing an operator. The report went on to suggest that under the current system, any unexpected success of the lottery would result in an increasing proportion of the proceeds going to the good causes. The report States:<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“the way in which applicants were required to structure their applications effectively guaranteed that, as sales increased an increasing proportion of the revenue generated accrued to the Distribution Fund, thus ensuring the Fund benefited from any unexpected success in the Lottery.”<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
That surely underlines the importance of having a profit-making operator running the lottery.<P>
Bonuses are another issue dealt with in the Library brief. Shortly after the Government came to office, the payment of bonuses a year in arrears to the top managers of Camelot became an issue. Much was written about that in the papers. Of course, not only were the bonuses calculated in arrears, researsh reported in the Financial Times on 6 June 1997 showed that the United Kingdon lottery provided the largest proportion of its receipts to good causes of any state lottery in the world. That is a ringing endorsement of the way in which the lottery was set up and has been carried forward in its early years by Camelot<P>
Another interesting article in the The Economist quoted extensively by the Library brief bears repetition. It makes the point that not only were the bonuses paid a year in arrears but that they were paid entirely out of shareholders’ profits. It states:<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“However generous these payments, they have no effect on the Lottery’s donations to good causes, how much tax it pays, or the size of the prizes. So what is ther to get so indignant about?”<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> A headline.<P>
<B>Mr. Waterson:</B> My hon Friend has made the point in a word.<P>
Indignation was the stock in trade of the Labour party when in opposition. We have considerable experience of its indignation, especially on the subject of the lottery. As the right hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross made clear in his remarks, there is a big difference between synthetic indignation and outrage expressed in a woolly phraseology in opposition and what the Labour party is setting out to do in government.<P>
Let us keep it as a secret between us in this Room, but the reality is that the Government will almost certainly either reappoint Camelot or appoint another profit-making operator. I hope that, at the end of the day, the Government are as committed as we were when in government to having the best and most efficient operator to run the national lottery.<P>
I do not want to cover ground already covered by my hon. Friend the Member for West Suffolk, but as he said, relatively few people commented on the Government’s proposals for choosing a lottery operator. As the document states:<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“Only 71 respondents commented on this chapter . . . But the overwhelming majority. . . chose not to comment at all”.<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
I shall return briefly to the comments of Lord McIntosh on Second Reading in another place. As we have heard, he made it clear that the Bill does not explicitly mention a not-for-profit operator, but restated the Government’s intention to seek such an operator <P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“if such an operator will ensure the best possible return to the good causes.”<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
That is the Government’s escape clause. In its manifesto, “new Labour because Britain deserves better”, the Labour party said that it would seek an efficient not-for-profit operator. It is one thing to say such things in opposition; it is a very different thing to say them in government. There is a massive contradiction in the phrase “an efficient, not-for-profit operator”.<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Camelot is an efficient operator that makes a profit. The odds are that if the Government, as a matter of dogma, were to appoint a not-for-profit operator simply because it was not profit-making, the lottery could end up much less well-run. An inefficient operator will not normally make a profit in any event. As the right hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross said, that was a rather woolly election pledge, waiting to be broken. Does the Minister really believe, if he selects the most efficient bid through a genuine tendering process involving not-for-profit and profit operators, that ultimately a not-for-profit operator will necessarily run the national lottery?<P>

<P>

<B>Mr. Christopher Fraser </B>(Mid-Dorset and North Poole): I shall keep my comments brief and to the point about the operation of the lottery and the profit motive. If anyone is in any doubt, I shall present my points rather differently from what has already been said, so that the Government can understand what we are saying.<P>
As my hon. Friends have already pointed out, the role of the profit motive in maximising revenue for good causes is an important aspect of the Bill and how it proceeds. The incentive to be efficient and effective is vital. The development of a lottery requires massive investment. The current operator has a relatively short licence. If there were no incentive to invest in technology and people, the lottery would no longer be as efficient. If there were no incentive to re-bid at the end of the licence, I do not believe that Camelot could be innovative in generating funds for good causes effectively during its licence period. The lottery operator must have a commercial incentive to ensure the maintenance of public support for the lottery.<P>
The hon. Member for Hove (Mr Caplin) mentioned directors’ bonuses. Those are determined by a remuneration committee, which consists of non-executive directors. Like any for-profit operator, Camelot’s profits reflect the performance of the business, which has exceeded financial targets.<P>
Future lottery operators will seek a higher rate of return to hedge against the arbitrary and unfair penalties that the Bill is designed to introduce. The more penal the regime, the higher the price that future lottery operators will require to take over its running. Logically, the result will be less money for good causes.<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Waterson) has already said, the current operator operates on slimmer margins that any other operator in the world. With less than 1 per cent. profit return, the scope for error is extremely small. If things go wrong with the lottery system, the cost to the operator is potentially enormous. Its communications infrastructure includes twice as many terminals as there are bank cashpoints in the United Kingdom, the largest satellite network outside north America and more computing power than Heathrow airport’s air traffic control system. The risks of failure are significant. Therefore, reward must be built in. Considerable risks were built into the licence, such as failing to have the correct number of terminals in place at the launch. We are now discovering that fines will not be specific. That puts in great jeopardy the future security of a potential operator.<P>
The current operator bears the risk for wrongful payment by retailers, for example, prizes going to people under the age of 16. Furthermore, significant concessions and amendments regarding the licence have been made by the current operator Camelot. In June 1997, it was agreed that any interest accruing on the prize fund would be paid into the national lottery distribution fund. There is no obligation to do that under the terms of the licence. Camelot has also accepted responsibility for retrieving any prize money paid to a winner, when subsequent claimants determine that the purchaser of the ticket was under 16 years, and to redistribute the funds to other winners from the previous week. The potential liability will be equivalent to a single winner of any jackpot—that is, about £1.9 million.<P>
Given such considerations, it has to be said that a risk is involved, so there must be a reward. The situation must be balanced. Current operators have demonstrated that there is a philanthropic motive as well as a profit motive behind their activities. However, Conservative Members will not be swayed by our arguments and will no doubt vote in favour of the new clause to give effect to their pre-election rhetoric.<P>
<B>The Minister for Arts (Mr. Mark Fisher):</B> I am delighted that the Opposition recognise the popularity of our manifesto and the part that it played in our success and in their defeat last May. It is touching to see the way in which they have studied it in such detail and to note their conversion to it and their avowed kind concern that we should stick to every dot and comma. We are doing that by fulfilling our key five election, pledges on which we have already made good progress, such as the national health service, education, crime, which is falling in my constituency—[Interruption.] I am not wholly convinced that we need political advice from the Opposition. We did quite well without it last year.<P>
I am grateful to the hon. Member for West Suffolk for tabling the new clause. It is good to see the Opposition adopting a more flexible attitude. Its tabling proves that irony is not dead—certainly not in the hearts of Opposition Members. Although they have studied our manifesto, they do not seem to have read the Secretary of State’s speech on Second Reading. It made the new clause redundant.<P>
I shall set out the criteria under which we shall ensure that the commission awards the new licence for the not-for-profit operator. In awarding the next licence, the National Lottery Commission has clear statutory duties under the 1993 Act to ensure that the national lottery is run, first, with propriety and transparency and, secondly, to protect players’ interests and, subject to both of those duties, thirdly to ensure that the most money possible is generated for good causes and, fourthly, that it is operated with efficiency and that the operator can deliver the forecasts that are proposed. All the bidders will be required to meet those four criteria and objectives. Just to underline that, as it is so much in the Opposition’s mind, we said in our manifesto that<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“Labour will seek an efficient not-for-profit operator to ensure that the maximum sum goes to good causes.”<P>
As the right hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross said, the difference between the Opposition and the Government is almost non-existent, despite the amusing irony of new clause 4. We both want the maximum money to go to the good causes; we both want an efficient operator; we both want it to be a clean lottery, which it is, and one that is run with propriety; and, we both want it be run in the interests of the players, with their concerns being taken into account. Those attitudes are to be found in all parts of the House. As the right hon. Gentleman said, there is little between us.<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Waterson:</B> Does that mean that if the Government do not find an efficient not-for-profit operator, the licence will be awarded to a profit-making operator? And, does the word “efficient” encompass the ability to maximise revenue?<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> The Opposition are making a terrible meal of this. In response to the many interventions that he took on Second Reading, the Secretary of State repeatedly explained that we stand by our manifesto commitment to seek a not-for-profit operator when the current licence expires. However, there is no need to change the legislation because the 1993 Act allows not-for-profit bidders and for-profit bidders. Both are eligible and both are welcome to apply.<P>
Not-for-profit bidders will certainly be encouraged to bid for the next licence. It is quite possible that, by operating efficiently and removing unnecessary profit margins, they may be in the best position to return the most money to good causes—a criterion shared by both sides of the Committee. Unlike the Opposition, however, we do not want to be dogmatic. Whichever bidder is able to deliver the most for good causes will be awarded the licence, whether it is a for-profit or a not-for-profit operation.<P>
We reject the Opposition’s curious dogma as expressed in new clause 4, which is not to be taken entirely seriously, that only not-for-profit operators can be efficient. Not-for-profit or for-profit operators, will be able to apply, and it will be for the commission to judge which operator can generate the highest returns for good causes. We shall expect the commission to make that clear when it invites applications for the next section 5 licence. The National Lottery Commission will then need carefully to assess all bids, choosing the operator most able to deliver the best possible return—subject, of course, to fulfiling the other criteria that I spelled out.<P>
It could not be much clearer than that. The 1993 Act enables any bidder to apply for a licence, whether not-for-profit or for-profit. We stick by the 1993 Act. We certainly want not-for-profit bidders to apply, but it will be for the commission to decide which is the most efficient and most straightforward bid, which has the greatest propriety and which will deliver the maximum returns to the good causes.<P>
<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> What the Minister says is very clear. However, it is clear how the Government propose to seek a not-for-profit operator.<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> We shall advertise for applicants and we shall make clear the four criteria on which the applications should be made. We shall also make it clear that we are interested in a properly run, transparent, efficient operation, that protects the players’ interests and delivers the maximum to good causes. It will then be up to the applicants, if they believe that they can satisfy the commission and fulfil  those criteria better than anyone else. It could not be much simpler than that.<P>
The hon. Member for Eastbourne asked me a direct question: did I believe that Camelot could have done better? I believe that the then Secretary of State could have ensured that the 1993 Act directed the lottery regulator to negotiate more a flexible contract, which would have allowed for the unforeseen possibility that profits would exceed the forecasts. The contract contained none of that flexibility.<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> Is the Minister saying that if a Labour Government had been in power, they would have penalised Camelot for doing so well?<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> Certainly not. The problems that have arisen are mainly problems of perception, caused by the high profits resulting from Camelot’s efficient running of the lottery and the lottery’s huge popularity. As the hon. Member for Eastbourne said, the contract and the directions issued to Camelot quite rightly allowed for the possibility of failure. When the original contracts were drawn up, people were uncertain to what extent the lottery would succeed—and, indeed, whether it would work. Undoubtedly, a venture capital element was present, as we had never had such an operation before, and the capital investment to get it started was considerable.<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
That will not apply next time, and people will be bidding on a much more secure basis. That element of risk will not be present. Even with the element of risk, however, a more forward-looking set of conditions might have allowed for the possibility, which subsequently transpired, that profits would be much larger than anyone could have anticipated. The feared losses or very slow profits did not come about.<P>
Both sides of the House agree that Camelot could not have done better. Indeed, the Secretary of State has said on numerous occasions that Camelot is an efficient operator and that it has generated a great deal of money. It is not Camelot that is at fault; it is the weakness and inflexibility of the original contract.<P>
The hon. Member for Eastbourne asked whether I believed that we would end up with a not-for-profit operator—or whether I would select a not-for-profit operator. I shall not make the selection. The commission will do that. I do not know what sort of operator will be chosen. It will be for the commission to assess the bids that result from our advertising.<P>
The hon. Member for North Norfolk was turning phrases in almost every sentence—phrases such as “horns of a dilemma” and “sunk in the mud”. Like other Conservative Members, he made much play of the arm’s-length principle, but we have been over that territory so often during the past few weeks. The hon. Gentleman’s comments demonstrate the rather tired nature of the Opposition—so early in a Parliament, too. Conservative Members are going over matters that the Committee has already explored at great length. Ironically, both sides agree on the arm’s-length principle, because it provides independence of judgment. We also all agree on the need for additionality. Such a dilemma—with wonderfully fresh phrasing, the hon. Gentleman would have us caught on its horns—is not likely to come about.<P>
The hon. Member for North Norfolk finished by saying that the Bill was a triumph. Had I been of a more cynical disposition, I could, in the manner of West End theatres, have used a rather selective quotation: “The hon. Member for North Norfolk says, ‘This Bill is a triumph.’” I assure the hon. Gentleman that I shall not misquote him, but I am grateful for his qualified praise.<P>
There is nothing more to say. I have made clear the Government’s position on the criteria according to which we shall require the commission to judge the bids. The 1993 Act is serviceable, and it allows for for-profit operators or not-for-profit operators. It allows us to seek a not-for-profit operator, so long as the operator provides the maximum return to the good causes and is efficient.<P>
The commission will have to wait to see who is bidding and what the quality of their bids is. It is for the commission to make the judgment. We are setting out the framework in the Bill—and we are grateful to you, Mr. Gale, for overseeing the Committee so well. We are putting in place a new framework—a new commission, which we believe to be a better way to run the lottery, and which will allow a wider range of judgment and opinion, and greater public confidence. The commission will take the decision on the operator.<P>

<P>

<B>Mr. Spring:</B> Far from tiring the Opposition, what has happened in the past few weeks has reinvigorated us and inspired us to realise that there is still a yawning gap between ourselves and the Labour party.<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> Yawning?<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> Indeed, I use the word “yawning” advisedly. Even in those few remarks, in which the Minister had a chance to redeem himself, old Labour’s misunderstanding of the profit motive bubbled up. We are certainly not tired. In current circumstances, such remarks might be directed at the Foreign Secretary, who seems to be too tired to read his briefs, although he has been in  post for only about 12 months.<P>
We take the Bill’s subject matter very seriously. The game was given away when, in response to a point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Eastbourne, the Minister suggested that we should have known that Camelot would generate profits successfully, and that there should have been a way to deal with them. That comes back to the fact that capping profits was mentioned in the policy document with which he was involved before the general election, and it underlines the fact that virtually no Labour Member understands the dynamics of the private sector. Labour Members cannot stop their instincts bubbling up and attacking the profit motive.<P>
<B>Mr. Caplin:</B> rose—<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> Ah, I catch a salmon every time.<P>
<B>Mr. Caplin:</B> May I draw the hon. Gentleman’s attention to my CV? Before the election I spent 19 years in the private sector.<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> How tragic that after spending 19 years in the private sector, the hon. Gentleman shows by his observations, remarks and interventions that he has learnt little from that about how Government policy should be carried out.<P>
The Government face a terrible dilemma. An instinctive revulsion from the profit motive lies at the heart of the thinking of many labour Members—not all, but a considerable number of them.<P>
<B>Fiona Mactaggart </B>(Slough): Where is the evidence for that assertion that the hon. Gentleman and his colleagues have made?<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> I appreciate the fact that the hon. Lady, in her wonderful episcopal robe, has added a new dimension to the debate. I have admired its colour, and I keep thinking that the Archbishop of Canterbury has appeared in the Committee. None the less the hon. Lady does not understand that, time and again before the election, those who are now Cabinet Ministers, including the Secretary of State, directly and indirectly attacked both Camelot and the profit motive in the conduct of the lottery.<P>
<B>Fiona Mactaggart:</B> Evidence?<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> It has all been quoted. We have quoted from the Labour party documents that contain the evidence. The Labour party had a wonderful time getting tabloid headlines attacking the national lottery for party political reasons. For example, the Minister said that the problem lay in the high profits. There was no problem with high profits, but those who were then members of the Opposition, some of whom are now Ministers, sought to inflame the issue to gain political support.<P>
I have listened carefully to the Minister’s attempt to explain the position. Once again, promises made before the election have been broken. The Government are inconsistent in what they have said and continue to say.<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman believe that the four criteria are the right ones for choosing an operator?<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> I assure the Minister that the way forward for choosing an operator when the licence expires in 2001 is one that can maximise good causes.<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> Precisely.<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> The Minister is the one who has been leading through legislation that damages good causes in the first place, so his credibility is not especially high.<P>
Once again, we have sought to expose the pattern of broken promises—both pre and post-election—as the Government have sought to readdress the reality of the situation. We shall push the motion to a Division to make it plain how the Government have broken their manifesto pledge.<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman really vote in favour of limiting the operator to a not-for-profit approach? That is an interesting stance for him to take. We, on the Labour Benches—and, I think, the right hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross—thought that it was a probing new clause. This is a startling piece of news. Will the official Opposition vote in favour of only a not-for-profit operator? This is a startling event.<P>
<B>Mr. Spring:</B> In pressing the new clause to a vote, we want to draw attention to the points that I have made. I shall elaborate on that on Report.<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Before the Division is called, I should make it plain that when members of the Committee call a Division and call “aye” or “no”, they cannot then vote the other way. They may, however, abstain.<P>

The proceedings have been undertaken with good humour and no rancour. I thank both the Minister for Sport and the Minister for Arts for their contributions in that spirit. I am sorry that I am unable to thank the Minister for Sport in person, but I realise that he has gone to Stockholm, where he is no doubt seeking a photo opportunity with an elk or a reindeer in some park there. We hope that the poor beast does not have halitosis.<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I thank all members of the Committee who have participated—I am sorry that some Labour Members were inclined to be Trappist. I thank my own hon. Friends who valiently put up a stunning intellectual performance of great clarity. Thank you for allowing me to make those brief remarks, Mr. Gale.<P>
