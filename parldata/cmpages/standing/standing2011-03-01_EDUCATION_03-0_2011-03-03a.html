oral evidence from the Association of Learning Providers, the 157
Group, the Sixth Form Colleges’ Forum, the Association of
Colleges, and Sir Mike Tomlinson. Before calling the first Member to
ask a question, I remind Members that questions should be limited to
matters within the scope of the Bill—ish—and that we must
stick strictly to the timings in the programme motion. I hope that I do
not have to interrupt mid-sentence, but will do so if I need to. May I
also say to the panel that there are six of you, and we have 55 minutes
in which to ask questions, so colleagues will direct their questions
only to two named members of the panel? If we have all six of you
answering questions, we will get
nowhere.<a class="bkMark" name="11030364000016">&#160;</a>

                           </em> I think the freedoms will be immensely
valuable, John, in order to allow us to respond to the communities that
are in front of us. I think they represent in many senses a continuity
of policy from the outgoing Government, and it is one that colleges
fully stand behind in terms of the importance of apprenticeships as
valuable qualifications that combine work with learning. The extra
freedoms to do that will be much appreciated.<a class="bkMark" name="11030364000018">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">If there is a
sense that “The answer is an apprenticeship, now what’s
the question?” and that is reflected in providing the chief
executive of the Skills Funding Agency with a statutory requirement to
prioritise apprenticeships, the concern is that that might have the
potential to work against the admirable additional freedoms that
colleges have been able to give in response to their communities by
effectively constituting another control mechanism. We are very
welcoming, with only that slight remaining concern.<a class="bkMark" name="11030364000019">&#160;</a>

                           </em> If I could just add that I think the
college sector has been a huge success story over the last 10, 12, 15
years, and I think this Government have recognised that. They have also
recognised that it is a very mature sector, and therefore have given
it—I think correctly—the kinds of freedoms that
universities have, and we really welcome
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11030364000020">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
second point is that the apprenticeship is recognition that there is
more than one route to success. Sometimes, if you read the press, you
would assume that there is only the academic route to success: GCSEs,
A-levels, universities. The work-based route to
success—apprenticeships—is absolutely critical. I think
it is the key to success for many individual young people, and frankly
for the economy. If we get this right—and I think we are getting
it right—UK plc will be a much better place in the future for
that. We really welcome the
freedoms.<a class="bkMark" name="11030364000021">&#160;</a>

out in a speech at Frank’s college some five or six years ago,
is to create a more responsive system—the kind of thing Lord
Leitch and Andrew Foster speak about in the reports commissioned by the

                           </em> Thank you, John. I follow the comments we
heard before welcoming the emphasis on apprenticeships. You are aware
that independent providers are majority deliverers of that. I think the
flexibilities, especially if they extend across the dual departmental
role that you hold both within BIS and DFE, should enable us to look
very closely at what I call pre-apprenticeship provision. I think the
position of apprenticeship provision is well stated and well
supported—it is totally supported by my organisation. I think we
need to look very carefully at what we are doing for young people,
especially 16 to 18—and pre-16—to make sure that they are
properly prepared for the workplace and for ultimate entry into an
apprenticeship programme on a progression route. I do not think that we
are quite there yet. I am conscious that Alison Wolf is publishing her
report today, but I have had no chance to look at it. Putting all that
together would be critically important. The flexibilities,

                           </em> Without doubt, that relationship has
been developing, but it needs to, and can in some circumstances, go
further. I add employers into that mix. The provider has to be hand in
hand with local employers, both large and small. It is important that
the curriculum offered has relevance to the job in hand, and the job
tomorrow, and that through the relationship there is an understanding
that a skill set needs to be developed as well. Employers play a
crucial part in that. The problem is how small and medium-sized
companies can make that contribution, given the resource constraints
upon them.<a class="bkMark" name="11030364000027">&#160;</a>

every reason to look at how one incentivises small and medium companies
to participate in this crucial work. I suspect that, at the end of the
day, the only way is through some form of tax system, which has been
used for other parts of incentivising. That is crucial to free up that
little bit of marginal resourcing in small and medium companies, which
after all employ the largest proportion of people, just to help them to
participate in both thinking about and developing courses and, in some
cases, delivering
them.<a class="bkMark" name="11030364000028">&#160;</a>

                           </em> I would first characterise the 16 to 19 sector
as the most competitive within education. The greatest plurality of
suppliers already operates in this area, including independent learning
providers, sixth-form colleges, general further education colleges and
school sixth forms. Those are, significantly in the case of colleges
and sixth-form colleges, autonomous institutions sharing many of the
same characteristics as academies already. I would find it hard to see
what part in the ecosystem 16 to 19 academies would fulfil, but if
there is a clearly defined and a clearly argued deficit in an area that
has not been addressed otherwise, and a proper process of consultation,
I could not be closed to that possibility. But I find it hard to see
what gap it is
closing.<a class="bkMark" name="11030364000030">&#160;</a>

provision in the Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Bill to
stop the creation of any further 16 to 19 schools. Therefore, this is a
reversal of that process, although we understand that 16 to 19
academies will not be schools. They will be joining the academy family.
We have said for a very long time that sixth-form colleges, in effect,
are academies in everything but name. In fact, we have more freedoms
than academies. We 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 104<a class="bkMark" name="Column104">&#160;</a>
                           </div>have an additional freedom to borrow. We sometimes do not see that as a
freedom that is of benefit, but at least it does give us the difference

autonomy.<a class="bkMark" name="11030364000031">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
interesting point is that, if the ambition is to create the climate by
which institutions really want to improve, the sixth-form college
sector is a good example of that. We were freed up in 1993, and have
grown and prospered, not in the number of colleges, but certainly in
popularity, quality and delivery, and we also represent extraordinarily
good value. The problem as we see it—I will be quite candid
about this—is that at the moment there is no incentive to open a
new sixth-form college for 16 to 19-year-olds because of the funding
differential that will still exist between colleges and academies.
Academies can benefit from VAT tax exemptions and other financial
benefits that we still have to bear. At the moment, any due diligence
on provision would mean that people would want to set up an academy
before setting up a sixth-form college, which we think is a mistake,
because we deliver a first-class, world-class product, and it would be
crazy not to see us as a very important option for the
future.<a class="bkMark" name="11030364000032">&#160;</a>

Mike Tomlinson:</strong>
                           </em> I have not seen the report,
obviously, so I can only go on what has been said in various
newspapers. First, if as I understand it is being proposed that there
should be a sensible balance between general education and vocational
aspects of the course, that is a good move, because it continues to
give a degree of flexibility for young people and does not in any way
deny them a general
education.<a class="bkMark" name="11030364000035">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Secondly,
and there have been some conflicting statements here, if Alison Wolf is
saying that a vocational course—the first thing is to
distinguish between vocational and applied, which are not the same; one
is often used as a term to mean the other, which is not
right—has to have some element of on-the-job experience, that
would be a step forward, because an awful lot of vocational provision
at the moment does not have the young person in the employment
situation in any way. No other country that I know of would allow a
course to be called vocational without having that
element.<a class="bkMark" name="11030364000036">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">If
we can get those things right, which I believe we can, and have
employers involved, we can have good vocational routes. They have to be
simplified, and there has to be progression—that is the other
thing Alison Wolf is going on about. Too many young people are sold
short on some vocational applied courses, because they are not given
progression. In some cases, having done level 3, they are not given
progression to university, if that is their choice. She is right to
focus on that.<a class="bkMark" name="11030364000037">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We should end
up with vocational provision that is valued in its own right. Let us
stop comparing it with something else to give it credibility; its
credibility comes from what it is in its own right. That is what I hope
will come from the Wolf review, and the rethinking
and policy development around vocational. But I have left out applied,
which really needs sorting
out.<a class="bkMark" name="11030364000038">&#160;</a>

the point that I made in my submission was that too often the focus is
on the traditional academic route, and everything else is an
afterthought. The focus is on the academic route, frankly because that
is what most of us have been through. But that is not what most young
people go through, so we have to pay as much attention to the
work-based and vocational routes as the academic route. As I have said,
the Government are doing a good job in its thinking around
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11030364000039">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
have not read the report, but I met Alison Wolf and gave evidence to
her for her report. I think that it is much more nuanced than we heard
this morning on Radio 4, which frankly just rubbished the entire
vocational spectrum from NVQs to HNCs and HNDs. We need to split them
out. If I can leave you with just one thought today—there are
three routes to success. There is the traditional academic route, which
we all understand. There is the work-based apprenticeship route, which
is a fantastic development, with lots of interest, and which we need.
But that is not an issue solely for colleges. The main issue is about
getting employers to join up to the apprenticeship route—I think
Alison Wolf will reinforce
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11030364000040">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
third route, high-quality vocational qualifications which are
work-related, is incredibly important for young people. We send,
through our BTEC national science route, many students to HE, including
to pharmacy—Alison Wolf was saying King’s College London.
They have got to be high-quality, rigorous and work-related, and I
think that that is what we will hear. My understanding is that there
was a question about NVQs, but I think her report like many others will
commend the BTEC First-BTEC National-HNC-HND route, which is a
critically important route to success for young
people.<a class="bkMark" name="11030364000041">&#160;</a>

someone who is providing the training, an employer, and the student.
The employer could not be controlled by the legislation. While it might
have sent a signal, as a legislative condition, we were never persuaded

sending signals or not—a little bit of a debate in this
Committee—I want to ask a question of Frank, as a practitioner
perhaps, but Sue might want to comment, because we have not had an
opportunity to bring her in yet, and I apologise for that. Are you
aware of the provisions in the Bill around discipline in further
education colleges? Is almost identical provision in legislation around
search powers and so on appropriate for further education colleges,
which are all-age institutions, and for their teaching staff? Such
provision includes being able to confiscate an electronic device from a
student, to go through all the data on it and to delete that data
before returning or disposing of the device—all provisions in
the Bill. Do you have any concerns about the practicality of how the
legislation is currently worded? We will need to scrutinise this, but
my fear is that good headlines often make bad
law.<a class="bkMark" name="11030364000046">&#160;</a>

would want the same powers that the Bill gives to schools, because we
are dealing in the main with 16 to 18-year-olds. On how those powers

than a handful of occasions in the past 10 years that I have been the
principal when we would have wanted to use those powers. It is about
how you run it—the culture of the place, running a safe and
secure organisation. So although the powers are there, I can think of
very few cases in which we would need to use them. But to have them
applied in the same way is useful across all

Many qualified teachers in our sixth-form colleges are recruited from
the school sector, so transferability is

                           </div>second nature to us. There are issues about qualifications, but I know
that is not in the remit of the Bill. There is a big question about
what are appropriate qualifications and teaching qualifications.
Clearly there must be some standards and safeguards. But in
general, we would argue for completely open
transferability for those teachers who are teaching—particularly
in the 16 to 18 bracket—between schools, colleges, general
further education colleges and other forms. We do not see any reason
why there should be artificial distinctions or barriers at the teaching
or management level. We have had a lot of nonsense, particularly at
principal and head teacher level, about being able to transfer from
schools with large sixth forms to sixth-form colleges and vice versa.
That whole area needs to be looked at.<a class="bkMark" name="11030364000054">&#160;</a>

crucial elements of any of our education provision is the quality of
the teachers and their experience in delivering that which they are
expected to deliver. In vocational education, you want people who have
real vocational experience and expertise, but also teaching
expertise.<a class="bkMark" name="11030364000055">&#160;</a>

moment, the system is odd in that if you do not have qualified teacher
status, but you have all that I have just mentioned, you can teach in
schools only as an instructor. I would like a single framework of
qualifications that links QTS and qualified teacher learning and skills
with bridging provision, so that people can move across. We want those
who are most skilled and knowledgeable teaching our young people, which
means that we cannot afford to have arbitrary and rather unfortunate
distinctions between the ways in which they can be employed. We do not
have enough talent to waste; we have got to make use of it
sensibly—so I am all for it. As a side issue, the loss of
funding for FE teacher training is somewhat unfortunate given the
emphasis that we are putting on that side of
training.<a class="bkMark" name="11030364000056">&#160;</a>

work-based route is not well understood. The Government have, as the
previous Government did, put a lot of emphasis on impartial advice. It
has to be there, because it could get worse unless we recognise and
resource the importance of young people getting the right information

the country. That is because of the nature of the separate Connexions
services. The key point on the Bill is the extent to which good
information, advice and guidance on apprenticeships and other routes is
made available to all young people. There is a question mark over
whether that will apply to academies, which concerns me. We have to
ensure that in all pre-16 institutions there is access to independent
advice and guidance across the whole range for everybody—that is
paramount. I am not sure that that is locked in the Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11030364000065">&#160;</a>

to that, I am concerned that the career service—if I can call it
that, because that term went into some disuse—which is often
delivered by Connexions, is under threat on the back of the cuts to
local authority funding. The amount of money going into that service
seems to be patchy and disappearing. The universal careers service was
always, in my view, going to be the foundation of any all-age guidance
service. We are now moving towards that, I am glad to say, but I am
worried that the foundations on which that will be built are being torn
down at the same time. We must get critical information to all young
people on a completely impartial basis, but there must be a
comprehensive service for all young people as well, to build an all-age
service.<a class="bkMark" name="11030364000066">&#160;</a>

the moment because in the FE sector there has been a cut in the funding
for entitlement and enrichment activities. Part of that affects
internal careers advice and guidance and support services, and the
concern is that we will not be able to provide the comprehensive
service that we currently provide. In the case of sixth-form colleges,
much of our advice and guidance is about progression to HE and into
employment. We are very concerned that the quality of that will now be
diminished because we will not have the means to provide

                           </em> We are very concerned as a sector about
the removal of the education maintenance allowance. It has been hugely
successful for us. The suggestion is that students will still come
whether the EMA is there or not. That may be the case, but it is about
whether they can fully participate once they are in the system. The EMA
allows students to travel to college, buy lunch
and—critically—to buy books and go on educational visits.
These are young people from poor families. Seventy per cent. of our
students are young people in receipt of EMA and their family income is
less than £18,000 a year. It is not about whether they will come
in September and enrol, it is about whether they can fully participate
in the programme for one, two or three years. I am very worried about
that. One reason people pay to send their children to the independent
sector is because of some of the enriching things that those schools
offer.<a class="bkMark" name="11030364000072">&#160;</a>

a suggestion that the enriching funding into colleges will be removed,

the country. How do we get them there if we do not have the money to
take them on trips, and if students cannot do the additional bits such
as the Duke of Edinburgh award and all those things that admissions
officers in universities want to differentiate between young people? We
will be back to saying that it is the basic course and no more. When we
say that there is no money, we mean there is no money. We understand
that the climate is very different and that funding is tight, but my
worry is that this will have a big impact on the retention of students
and their achievement. They will come, but it is about whether they are
as successful. That is the critical point.<a class="bkMark" name="11030364000073">&#160;</a>

Doel:</strong>
                           </em> If you are talking about higher education
capping for part-time fees, our great concern is that the system has
been designed to meet the needs of full-time, three-year traditional
students. It has a number of entry points that are very limited and a
long lead-in period to getting those loans, and that will not be well
suited to be extended to part-time students who join in a more flexible
way and study over a longer period. Therefore, the system will need to
be adapted to fit that less-traditional route of study.<a class="bkMark" name="11030364000075">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
The
point about interest rates is as much a real issue as it is a
perceptual one. That comes down to a number of the changes currently
encompassed in Government policy. It is the perception that it creates
in learners—or potential learners—about the cost they
will endure as they go through their studies. There is a whole issue
about the sector being able to understand clearly the
Government’s intentions, and to work with them to portray the
offer in the most effective
way.<p class="tabbed">Frank
was talking about the EMA. It is getting perilously close to the last
point at which you can tell students what the arrangements are for them
next year. It is interesting to note that the changes around higher
education fees have been signalled at least two years in advance, and
time has been given to design a support system to meet those needs.
There has also been a long consultation about it. For the EMA, students
are about to start this September, but we still have no system of
support defined for poor students who are 16 to 18. They have already
come to the college, asking about the course that they are going to go
on to—before Christmas, in many of the recruitment
evenings—and colleges have not been able to tell them what
support arrangements will be in place. We absolutely must have a scheme
in place before the end of the Easter vacation. Students and their
families deserve to know what support arrangements will be in place for
their
study.<a class="bkMark" name="11030364000076">&#160;</a>

replacement fund for the EMA. We need to understand what that is and,
most significantly, how big it is. Initially I think it was said to be
around 10% of the current pot of money in the EMA fund. We need to know
quickly what that replacement fund is, its volume, and how we can use
it. I think that it is unlikely to be an entitlement fund, where we
pass money to young people as we currently do, but probably much more
about safety netting. Whichever it is, we need to know, as Martin said,
so we can begin to plan for that for next

The first is addressed to Frank McLoughlin and Sue Whitham. The
Government are committed to an all-age careers service. Would you
welcome the suggestion that we move towards a more professional service
that would be able to give good indications on the opportunities for
children to follow vocational guidance, rather than the current system
under Connexions, which talks more about lifestyle and is
generic?<a class="bkMark" name="11030364000084">&#160;</a>

McLoughlin:</strong>
                           </em> Frankly, careers advice has been an issue
since I was at school. No one has ever got it completely right, but I
think the Government recognise that it is critical. To answer your
question, absolutely, we must. One of the things that we must avoid is
giving young people poor advice that is often based anecdotally on a
teacher’s experience of their own time at school and university.
Frankly, too many people’s references are appropriate to that
period. When people think about apprenticeships, they think about the
1970s, but the world has changed entirely. In London, some of the
league stuff still holds true—50% of jobs in London will be
graduate-level jobs. Whatever the situation is, we need to prepare
people for a different world. What will the world be like for young
people in 2030? There are too many people talking about what the world
was like in 1970. Yes, it must be professional—it is critical.
If we do not get that advice right, we are just wasting human resources
and
money.<a class="bkMark" name="11030364000085">&#160;</a>

need to set up a service that we think is appropriate and then almost
leave it alone for a while. Connexions has in recent years suffered
incredibly, inevitably, from being reorganised and restructured
countless times. So we need now to concentrate on what we feel is an
appropriate service, let it do its work, and keep it under review.
However, it needs to be a structure that is left

money being wasted. We are talking about young people’s lives,

Martin. In my area, everybody recognises that sixth-form colleges and
further education colleges are among the most innovative of providers
because of the freedoms that they were given some years ago. Do you
feel that the Bill provides you with more freedoms to work more closely
with local schools? In my constituency of Stevenage, the college is
considering a proposal to provide the careers advice service for all
the schools and the college, because it sees itself as part of the
schools community network, and because it has some vocational courses.
It wants to work with schools rather than compete against them. Do you
think that the Bill gives you such opportunities?<a class="bkMark" name="11030364000087">&#160;</a>

Whitham:</strong>
                           </em> Yes, we have the freedom to develop such
contacts between colleges, and between colleges and schools, which is
something that has developed particularly in recent years. With the
direction that we were going in, that all came under the local
authority, and the 14 to 19 partnerships were developing quite
strongly. Although we do not have to follow that particular route now,
we would encourage sixth-form colleges to do so. They need to work with
as many colleges and local schools as they can for whatever provision
is needed locally, and they need to work together on that. Such
structures have started, a lot of them are working very well, and we
have certainly encouraged all sixth-form colleges to stick with it and
resolve those issues in whatever way is sensible for the area.
Obviously, that will vary from area to area.<a class="bkMark" name="11030364000088">&#160;</a>

such opportunities. My concern, if there is one, is that in a time of
economic retrenchment, there  is a danger that people will seek
to withdraw into their own institutions. I am certain that colleges
would not wish that to happen; they would wish to work in partnership
with their schools to the benefit of young people in their areas, and
to provide those varied pathways to success. In that regard, returning
to your earlier question, information, guidance, and giving young
people the information that they need to navigate the system most
effectively becomes important, not only for them, but to sustain
partnership working, because it induces that kind of direction of
travel.<a class="bkMark" name="11030364000089">&#160;</a>

Martin and to Sir Michael. I wanted to ask you briefly about what I see
as being a conflict over the supply into colleges and sixth forms,
where you have schools with sixth forms—clearly, funding follows
pupils, so there is an interest in keeping hold of pupils. There is a
concern, however, where schools are moving GCSEs into year 10 and
starting students on A-level courses in year 11, and where there is not
a meshing of the examining boards between the schools and local
colleges. Therefore, you are trapping young people, or they are wasting
a year—you are trapping them into the school because they need
to carry on with the second year of their A-level in the lower sixth
effectively, or they waste

restrict subject choices severely, because often, schools do not offer
the very broad spectrum of subjects that people can take, which
eventually, will restrict life choices, job choices, and everything
else. How do you see that being

working between schools and colleges, and for colleges having a role in
assisting schools to deliver in such areas, and working co-operatively
to do so. It seems that having specialist teachers and lecturers from
colleges going into schools, or having young people released from
schools to study at the most appropriate level for them, with expert
teachers in good facilities, is a solution to the issue that you have
identified.<a class="bkMark" name="11030364000091">&#160;</a>

                           </em> In part this does link back a little
with the point on careers education and guidance. It is true that, in
some cases, young people are advised to take up an A-level course and
remain on it when that is not the most appropriate route for them, and
the provision that is then in school is often not really appropriate
either. So, as Martin has said, it requires close work between schools,
colleges, and also employers, who are all too often left out of the
equation.<a class="bkMark" name="11030364000096">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
is therefore crucial that for young people—even if they do their
GCSEs a year early—their options remain wide and open as a
result of co-operation between schools and colleges. It requires that
funding is available to enable the colleges to make that provision in a
cost-effective way, without meaning that the school itself will lose
staff as a consequence. So it can be solved, but at the local level,
and by the sorts of co-operative arrangements that have grown up over
the last few years and are very strong in some cases. I am not sure
what the problem is that you are worried about with exam
boards.<a class="bkMark" name="11030364000097">&#160;</a>

is certainly the case that the careers education guidance element is
very important, and it is important well before 14—a lot of
decisions are made at that age now—so that is crucial. As far as
the boards are concerned, most schools and colleges work with a very
wide range of boards, not just one. Some colleges that I know of might
be working with 40-odd different awarding bodies, so it is not a single
pathway. If you pick on A-levels, there needs to be proper attention
given to ensure that all A-levels in a particular subject have a common
core related to the needs of higher education in general. That is not
happening, and it is a weakness of our
system.<a class="bkMark" name="11030364000101">&#160;</a>

further education, higher education or employers. In some cases, that

There has been so much discussion in the run-up to and post the
election, and I entirely understand why the Secretary of State has
decided that that is the right thing to do. The board of the Young
People’s Learning Agency has discussed it, is entirely happy
with the decision and is working towards a very smooth transfer of
responsibilities, being completely committed to seeing it through to
April 2012, which is the point at which we expect it to
happen.<a class="bkMark" name="11030364000119">&#160;</a>

the education funding agency and that there will be some other
functions from the core Department itself that will be placed with the
education funding agency. However, the vast majority of the posts will
be from the YPLA. We have not quite settled our running costs budget
for 2011-12, the financial year that we are just about to go into, but
our major challenge will not be to reduce posts. It will be to cope
with the increased volume of work that comes from the increasing number
of academies. So I expect that most people from the YPLA will go into
the education funding agency, but we are not quite at the point of
knowing whether there will be some surplus staff and some who will go
elsewhere, because we have to plan that transition in the usual
way.<a class="bkMark" name="11030364000121">&#160;</a>

market, although there might be some specialist jobs in the finance
area where I cannot find resource within the broader Department for
Education and Skills family of organisations. The issues that the
Public Accounts Committee raised about capacity are in relation to
handling the growth of the number of academies. What we have been doing
in that regard is seeking to streamline, as far as we can, everything
else that we do, to release staff from the YPLA to support the
academies’ work.<a class="bkMark" name="11030364000125">&#160;</a>

quite a bit of that already. We took  80 posts into the YPLA
and we have probably got 130 or 140 people at the moment
working on academies. So it really concentrates the mind enormously
when you have got an area of growing business, a ceiling on recruitment
and a drive for efficiency, and we are streamlining as much as we can
to release resource. As I say, we have done quite a bit of that

at colleges—sixth-form colleges and general FE

here, because all the direction of travel seems to be towards academies
and free schools, and that’s where the attention of the

We have £1.7 billion in academies  this year,
£6.4 billion in the 16 to 19 sector and about

                           </div>£660  million in financial support for learners,
including education maintenance allowances. Clearly the academies
budget will go up and the learners’ support budget will go down
as we get to the end of the existing EMA programme. The budget for the
16 to 19 sector will stay roughly the same. So we need to maintain that
focus on the 16 to 19 sector and ensure that there are good liaison
arrangements, particularly with sixth-form colleges because we are the
sponsor organisation for them. Of course, the Skills Funding Agency is
the sponsor organisation for general FE
colleges.<a class="bkMark" name="11030364000128">&#160;</a>

                           </em> The recently published Public Accounts
Committee report, based on the National Audit Office report, makes
interesting reading in that respect. First, it was very complimentary.
I find it quite difficult to remember a Public Accounts Committee
report that was more complimentary than the one about the academies
programme, in terms of the success of the initial academies. It then
had some quite stern words to say to the Department, ourselves, and to
academies about the importance of financial rigour, propriety and
effectiveness —all the things one would expect the
Public Accounts Committee to say. We have an important programme of
work at the moment. We are working jointly with the academies to
simplify and cut out a lot of stuff that does not need to be there. We
are very rigorous about the standards of financial accountability that
should be applied. We must do that together with academies. There are
some very good precedents in the further education sector, which has
been independent for 20 years since incorporation in 1993. Standards of
financial accountability and governance are consistently high and take
very little of our time because it works on a self-assessment basis. We
monitor and intervene when things go wrong, but we do not micro-manage
or tinker. I am looking to establish some of those principles as we
take responsibility for financial accountability and governance in the
academy sector as well.<a class="bkMark" name="11030364000130">&#160;</a>

                           </em> Let me qualify what I said in two ways.
First, there will be actual costs. For example, as we go into the
Department for Education we will need to connect to its office
platform, but we will no longer be connected to another office
platform, so there will be savings and costs. We need to ensure that
there is money to pay for those costs. When I said achieve nothing what
I meant was that we want to maintain the standard of service. The point
about accountability, which the Minister asked about earlier, is that,
with the new arrangements, there will be a much clearer line of
accountability back to Ministers. In my experience on both sides of the
departmental and non-departmental public body divide, I have found that
when problems occur there is a very short line of accountability back
to Ministers anyway, so I can well see the advantage of establishing
that direct line of
accountability.<a class="bkMark" name="11030364000142">&#160;</a>

uncertain time. One of my responsibilities was to make sure that I kept
my staff informed and clear about the likely direction. The big benefit
from the change to the education funding agency is the opportunity for

recollection of the concerns that we raised is very different from your
interpretation of what it might mean for the Bill. To be clear, one of
our concerns was about accountability for spending, and the Department
was already overstretched in trying to deal with the academies. What do
you think could be done to ensure that we as parliamentarians get value
for money through the processes that will result from the Bill, given
the concerns that were expressed in the report? The stern test was the
fact that you were already struggling to deal with the academies that
we have in this

time that the National Audit Office did the work that led to the Public
Accounts Committee hearing, there were 203 academies. At the end of
February, there were 442, so more than twice as many. That illustrates
the scale of the challenge. If you look over a five-year
period—this is just an illustrative phrase—the managing
of open academies has gone from a cottage industry to a scale
operation. What we are now putting in place is the data and finance
systems that are needed for a scale operation. I believe the YPLA is
well placed to lead that work and then take it back into the education
funding agency. As I said earlier, we have the data handling skills,
the finance skills and the grant modelling skills
that we have used successfully.<a class="bkMark" name="11030364000156">&#160;</a>

provision. The very fact that there is a clear figure that everyone can
quote as the pupil premium is a significant benefit to the dialogue
about
funding.<a class="bkMark" name="11030364000165">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Although
there are some quite sophisticated ways of reflecting disadvantage in a
post-16 premium, I cannot sit here and say that the pupil premium is X
post-16, because it is a much more complicated formula. We have to have
the debate about simplicity versus sophistication, and we are planning
to have a public discussion about it in May or June to look at the
extent to which we can simplify the post-16
formula.<a class="bkMark" name="11030364000166">&#160;</a>

formal transfer arrangement, and they are fairly standard ones. If I
could give a more general answer, I think three things need to be
managed carefully to ensure a good transfer. The first one is good
communication, which I, with my chair, take responsibility for with my
staff and the people who the YPLA deals with at the moment. The second
one is good planning, so that we have a clearly set out process for the
making the necessary changes, including accommodation and routine
things such as systems, which, if we do not make properly, will fall
over. The third one is maintaining a strong focus on business as usual,
so that no one suffers as a result of the change. Our aspiration is
that our performance improves throughout the year that we are just
about to go into, 2011-12, which will be the second and final year of
the YPLA’s
operation.<a class="bkMark" name="11030364000170">&#160;</a>

First—I commented on this earlier—we have staff in
several offices around the country, so we are a distributed
organisation. I think that that helps us because we are

of the local issues that may be relevant, and I am keen to maintain
that. Whether we retain a regional structure is a separate issue. We
could have a single national structure, but have
people located in different offices around the country. I am not clear
yet what the organisation or structure of the new education funding
agency will
be.<a class="bkMark" name="11030364000174">&#160;</a>

                           </em> Two things would be lost. The first thing is
the closeness and understanding of local situations at the provider
level—schools, colleges, academies and independent providers.
For example, in 16 to 19 we currently deal with 3,000 providers.
Secondly, and this is also important, is closeness to local
authorities. I talked a lot today about the direct functions of the
YPLA, and one of our most important ones is supporting local
authorities. Local authorities have the local commissioning role, which
was set out by the schools White Paper. The YPLA is not, and the
education funding agency will not be, a commissioning or planning
organisation, unlike three predecessor organisations—the
Learning and Skills Council, the Further Education Funding Councils and
the Funding Agency for Schools, which were all commissioning and
planning bodies. Our role is much tighter and more focused on funding
and financial
insurance.<a class="bkMark" name="11030364000176">&#160;</a>

about making a primary school into an academy? They tend to have
governing bodies that tend to be less strategic, be smaller, or be a
long way from the sophisticated FE colleges with which you do business.

schools as academies? How would you cope if a lot of them went into

development of chains of academies. The sponsored chains are increasing
