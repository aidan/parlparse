							<a name="080115112000253"></a>The
Chairman:
						</b> I welcome all members of the
Committee to this first sitting. I have a number of preliminary
announcements to make. First, if Members wish to remove their jackets
during Committee meetings, I am happy that they should do so. However,
it is up to my co-Chairman, Mrs. Janet Anderson, to decide
whether that is also part of her instruction. Members should also note
that mobile telephones, pagers and other electronic devices should be
turned off or switched to silent mode. I become very blind if Members
whose phones go off then rise to catch my eye.</div>
					<a name="080115112000007"></a><div class="hs_Para">I remind the
Committee that there is a money resolution and a Ways and Means
resolution in connection with this Bill, and copies are available here
in the Committee Room. I should also like to remind Members that
adequate notice should be given of amendments. As a general rule, I and
my fellow Chairman do not intend to call starred amendments.</div>
					<a name="080115112000008"></a><div class="hs_Para">The process
of taking oral evidence in Public Bill Committees is still relatively
novel, so I will briefly explain what is proposed so that we can all be
clear as to precisely what should go on. The Committee will first be
asked to consider the programme motion on the amendment paper, on which
debate is limited to half an hour. I will then proceed to a motion to
report written evidence, and then a motion to permit the Committee to
deliberate in private in advance of the oral evidence sessions, which I
hope we can take formally. I look to both sides of the Committee for
their agreement. Assuming that the second of these motions is agreed
to, the Committee will move into private session. Once the Committee
has deliberated, the witnesses and members of the public will be
invited back in and our oral evidence session will commence. If the
Committee agrees to the programme motion&#151;I hope very much that
it will&#151;the Committee will hear oral evidence today and on
Thursday, moving on to the more familiar proceeding of clause-by-clause
scrutiny next week.</div>
					<a name="080115112000009"></a><div class="hs_Para">We come now to the programme
motion. I understand that an amendment is to be proposed. It would be
convenient for the Committee if the Minister moved the motion formally
and the Government Whip then moved his
amendment.</div>

					<a name="080115112000011"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is a
delight to be here and to be under your chairmanship, Sir Nicholas. I
am sure that we will make great progress with the Bill under your fair
and firm chairmanship. We look forward to that and to getting the Bill
through in good
condition.</div>
					<a name="080115112000012"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
programme motion gives us four sessions of oral evidence and enables
those who have made submissions to answer questions, to set out their
case and to raise their concerns. From the submissions that we have had
about the Bill, we know that there is broad support. I am sure that the
evidence sessions will enable us to hear that support and to hear
people&#146;s
concerns.</div>
					<a name="080115112000013"></a><div class="hs_Para">Sir
Nicholas, you referred to the timing of the start on Thursday 17
February. At the moment, the programme motion states 9.30 am, but we
want to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column3" />Column number: 3</div>move to 9.00 am, because otherwise we will be sitting for about 15
minutes, which would not make much sense and would not give the
witnesses much of an opportunity, either. That is the only area of the
programme motion that I would wish to
amend.</div>
					<a name="080115112000014"></a><div class="hs_Para">After
the evidence sessions, we will have the opportunity to have a proper
discussion about the detail of the Bill. The schedule of witnesses
needs to be agreed, so I hope that my colleagues will be able to do
that&#151;there have been some informal discussions. The 18
discussion sessions will enable us to have clause-by-clause scrutiny,
including a short break for half-term in February. I am sure that you
and Janet Anderson, Sir Nicholas, will be able to lead us through the
difficult parts. The Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, my
hon. Friend the Member for Warwick and Leamington (Mr.
Plaskitt), is going to assist me in handling the Government side of
some of the amendments, particularly in part 3, which will enable us to
deal with all those issues and in a full and proper
manner.</div>
					<a name="080115112000015"></a><div class="hs_Para">There will be
a new process with regard to Government amendments, which it is right
for me to mention at this stage; a short letter to you and Janet
Anderson, Sir Nicholas, informs you of that. We will be tabling a
number of amendments, some in response to discussions but others to
clarify parts of the Bill; we have already indicated some areas that we
still have to amend. What we will be doing is setting out an
explanatory statement with the amendment. That has not, broadly, been
done in the past&#151;it has been left to the Minister&#151;but we
will be providing an explanatory statement of the amendment and of its
effect. With other amendments, we will ask if other members of the
Committee wish to provide an explanatory statement to their amendments,
so that the Committee can see a paragraph in writing. If the Committee
members do not want to do that, my officials will contact them and see
if they can be of help in drafting the clarification statement. That
will enable us to have a greater understanding of the purposes of
amendments and to help prepare any contributions colleagues might wish
to make. During the course of the Bill, we will also be letting members
of the Committee have fact sheets and some Keeling schedules setting
out the effects of various amendments and how they will alter the text
of the Bill, where that is
appropriate.</div>
					<a name="080115112000016"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
sure that we will have a full and good debate according to the

							<b class="B">Mr.
Nigel Waterson</b> (Eastbourne) (Con): Thank you, Sir
Nicholas, you can tell how eager I am to get stuck into yet another
Pensions Bill.</div>
					<a name="080115112000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">May I
speak briefly on some of the issues raised both on the main motion and
the amendment? We will not be dividing; we support
both the motion as it stands 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column4" />Column number: 4</div>and the amendment. Had it not been for the amendment, the Pensions
Policy Institute would have had to distil all its wisdom and expertise
into a 15-minute session&#151;it would have been famous for 15
minutes, as the phrase goes&#151;which did not strike us as very
satisfactory.</div>
					<a name="080115112000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">Pensions
Bills are becoming an annual event under this Government and so far as
it goes, we welcome the latest one. I welcome all the hon. Members to
the Committee&#151;volunteers and pressed men both&#151;and
particularly my colleagues who have volunteered to help in our
deliberations. Evidence sessions on any view are going to move at a
brisk pace, if not in something of a blur. A whole week of oral
evidence sounds generous, but one can gauge from the number of
organisations that have been clamouring for the opportunity to give
evidence just how much interest the Bill
excites.</div>
					<a name="080115112000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have said
what I needed to say on the amendment&#151;it seems perfectly
sensible. I was pleased to hear what the Minister said, both now and in
writing, about amendments. We are, of course, particularly interested
to see the Government&#146;s amendments on the financial assistance
scheme and on giving full compensation to people who have lost their
pensions, or much of their pensions. No doubt there will be the usual
flurry of excitement as the Bill continues, about whether draft
regulations can catch up with the actual clause under which they are to
be introduced. I know Ministers always start off with the best of
intentions but those matters are not always completely in their
control. Obviously it would be helpful, given that many of the
important issues in the Bill are left to regulation, if those
regulations were in front of us during the relevant debates. I am sure
that the Ministers will do their level best&#151;likewise with their
amendments.</div>
					<a name="080115112000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
apologise that, despite the opportunity&#151;I do not think that
there is the obligation&#151;under the rules, most of my amendments
so far do not have an explanatory memorandum attached. I drafted them
over Christmas, so it was a choice between Christmas and explanatory
memorandums and Christmas won. I have checked with the clerks; one has
to table the explanatory notes at the same time as the amendments so
apparently there is no opportunity to put them in later, which we would
be perfectly happy to do. Members may also have noticed that the more
recent amendments&#151;I hope future ones&#151;all have attached
some attempt to explain what they are about. We of course do not have
the resources that are at the disposal of Ministers. We look forward to
seeing their amendments and their explanatory
notes.</div>

pleasure, Sir Nicholas, to serve under your Chairmanship and that of
Mrs. Anderson. I am sure that we will have a thoroughly
enjoyable few weeks&#151;particularly the half-term. Many of, but not
all, the issues in the Bill are based on the Turner settlement and an
element of consensus between the major parties, but there are some big
issues, and some issues on which we and the Government still disagree.
But I hope that we can, as they say, disagree without being

advance, as I will be absent on one or two occasions in the next five

information, the programme motion clearly sets out when we will begin
our sittings but can the Minister clarify where he expects the various
sittings to end? I am not clear about what happens on Thursday if we
start at 9.30 am. I am quite happy to sit in committee when question
times take place on the floor of the House as I think this is more
important. Other colleagues may have a different point of view. Some
clarification on when we think we will end would help because, as my
hon. Friend the Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Waterson) says,
we do have a lot of work on this Bill and it will help us to programme
how far we need to get if we know exactly how much time we have for
deliberation. In the meantime, we look forward to serving under your

Gentleman spoke about the need to table the explanatory note at the
same time as the amendment, but that could be possible that that could
be changed. The amendment could be tabled and the explanatory note
could follow. I do emphasise, therefore, that this is the second phase

						</i> This is a very large and complex undertaking.
Compared with a large occupational defined contribution pension scheme
today, where there might be one employer and 10,000 members, personal
accounts prospectively will be dealing with up to 1 million employers
and around 5.5 million active members in the early stages. As the
scheme matures, that number will grow relatively slowly, but it will be
complemented by large numbers of dormant members&#151;perhaps twice
as many&#151;as the thing settles
down.</div>
					<a name="080115112000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">You are quite
right to say that this is a significant challenge, and we are working
hard in our advisory phase at the moment to advise the Department on a
number of elements of that challenge. One of the most important things
for us is that the scheme remains as simple as it can be. I have
already described the scheme as &#147;beguilingly simple&#148;, in
the sense that we do not want to have bells and whistles on this
scheme. We wish it to be a simple scheme. But, already, unique
features, such as the contribution cap, no waiting period, and our EU
legal duty to allow people from across the EU to sign up, mean that
there are considerable administrative complexities. So our clear advice
is to keep the scheme as simple as is
practical.</div>

						</i> PADA is advising the Department for Work and
Pensions on the deliverability of its policy, in line with the remit
set out for us in the 2007 Bill. I can only reiterate Tim
Jones&#146;s answer that it is essential to keep the personal
accounts scheme simple, to keep costs down, to keep communications
simple and understandable to an audience who will be new
to  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column8" />Column number: 8</div>pensions, and to minimise delivery risks. Keeping it simple is critical
to the successful delivery of personal accounts. Every further bell or
whistle that is added to the scheme will have to be paid out of
people&#146;s retirement income. That cost will have to be reclaimed
from members&#146; accumulated savings. As the Bill passes through
Parliament, I would urge Parliament to keep this message in
mind.</div>
					<a name="080115112000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">A further
focus for PADA&#146;s work at the moment is preparing detailed plans
for implementation. This will be completed by the end of March. We are
already assembling the skills and competencies necessary, particularly
through the appointment of Tim Jones as chief executive. I would pay
tribute to the quality of the work that has already been done by DWP
staff in getting us as far as we are. From my perspective as a
businessman who has primarily worked in the private sector, the work
that has been done here by members of the DWP has been of the highest
quality.</div>
					<a name="080115112000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have also
had the first meeting of our consumer representative committee, chaired
by one of our non-executive directors. We will shortly be issuing a
consultation document on charges, and we have begun an extensive
programme of communication with stakeholders. We are a very open and
transparent organisation. We will be available to anybody who wants to
make representations to us as a supplier, a user, or somebody who has a
nexus with us. We will also be seeking to appoint additional
non-executive directors&#151;we have recently agreed terms with a
firm of executive research consultants to appoint additional
non-executives to our board&#151;and we will, in particular, be
looking for an employer representative on the board to balance the

Selous</b> (South-West Bedfordshire) (Con): Pursuing the
administrative theme a little further, the Department has not had a
happy history in terms of its computer provision over quite a number of
years. That fact has been looked into by the Public Accounts Committee,
among other bodies. Can you tell us anything about the computers for
PADA? They are going to have to be fairly substantial and will need to
work well. I do not know whether you are constrained by commercial
confidentiality considerations, but I would like to know whether you or
the Department will be running the computer systems, particularly in
terms of the long-term management of the computer schemes. The PAC has
picked the Department up on that issue in the past and has accused it
of not being capable of being an intelligent
customer.</div>

						</i> First, may I draw a brief distinction between
PADA and the trust-based scheme, the personal accounts board, which we
occasionally call PAB? PADA&#151;the thing that Paul is chairman of
and I am chief executive of&#151;is a relatively unusual animal. It
is going to be a non-departmental public body, stewarded by the
Department for Work and Pensions, but its role is to be a transient
NDPB to assist in setting up the trust-based scheme of personal
accounts and to assist the pensions regulator with compliance
activities in regard to the new employer duties. PADA itself will
therefore have relatively limited computer support&#151;it will
basically be limited to office support.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column9" />Column number: 9</div>
					<a name="080115112000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">May I refer your question to
the trust-based scheme&#151;the operational entity which will have
the job of running the 5 million-member defined contribution scheme?
Our intent in this area is to procure business services through formal
public sector procurement processes. It is not my intent to create an
IT system myself as the foundation as a set of business processes, and
nor do I think that it is the intent that the DWP will bid to be the
supplier of that. We are going through a process of market engagement,
and we have engaged with a wide variety of potential interested parties
from the private sector. Our intent is to procure a series of business
services from
them.</div>
					<a name="080115112000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">If I may add a
little colour to that answer, where we have been looking at fund
management and fund administration we have, I think, concluded thus far
that our requirements are not that different from the requirements of
other occupational pension schemes. Therefore the inherent risk in the
procurement of those business services is relatively low. On the scheme
administration side&#151;where member records are held and all
that&#151;the novelties in personal accounts of scale and nature mean
that that really is quite different and new, and I therefore expect to
focus a lot of my energy on managing out the inherent risks in the
procurement of that area of business
services.</div>

Ainger</b> (Carmarthen, West and South Pembrokeshire) (Lab): I
am sure that you have read the report of the Bill&#146;s Second
Reading debate in <i class="I">Hansard</i>. My hon. Friend the Member for Colne
Valley (Kali Mountford) raised an issue relating to people who are
below the &#163;5,000 threshold and perhaps employed in multiple
jobs. Would it be PADA&#146;s responsibility to encourage the people
who fall into that category&#151;the figures seem to indicate that
there are about 40,000 of them&#151;to opt into the personal
accounts? Is the system flexible enough to take account of the
likelihood that they are people who are going to be moving in and out
of different jobs&#151;all low paid and so on, with probably little
continuity? Bearing in mind your comments that we need to keep it very
simple, is there potentially a problem because of the complex nature of

that thresholds have to be set, but surely there are ways in which we

Following the question from Andrew Selous about administrative costs,
may I ask you, Mr. Jones, to consider clause 10 on
employers&#146; duties? There has been quite a significant increase
in the estimate of administrative costs between the publication in
December of the regulatory impact assessment and the current
assessment. Why do you think there is such an increase and what
assessment has been made in terms of the likely administrative costs
that will fall on small or
micro-businesses?</div>

						</i> You are correct that there has been an uplift
in the assessment of those costs. The reason for that was not any
change to the underlying activities that are being asked of businesses:
it was just a better assessment of the way in which that burden will
fall between the very largest and the very smallest enterprises. There
are some elements of a fixed nature, which obviously are a relatively
bigger burden for the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column11" />Column number: 11</div>very smallest enterprises because the employer will have to introduce
the concept of this scheme to the workforce. The reason that the figure
rose was a change to the methodology in the model of the way in which
the costs of the same activities were estimated to land in different
parts of the business community.</div>

touch on the employer&#146;s role in the provision of information and
on the burdens on and the safeguards for both employers and employees.
Obviously, employers will have the duty to provide information on
personal accounts. If that is correct, what form will this information
take, and is there a need for registration of receipt of the
information by the employee that will prevent possible future claims of
negligence and non-compliance when somebody says 25 years down the
line, &#147;My employer never told me about this; therefore I
didn&#146;t register; therefore I want to make a claim&#148;? That
in itself is both burdensome on the employer and the employee, but also
has built-in safeguards for both. I have two other brief points, but

first.</div>

						</i> I will be brief to give you time to ask your
further questions. Importantly, the employer will provide information,
not advice, and it is critical to understand that. Secondly, we will,
both at PADA and in our work with the employer panel, devise ways of
ensuring that the communication burden on the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column13" />Column number: 13</div>employer, in terms of cost, is kept to an absolute minimum. I would add,
in parentheses, that there is very real advantage here to employers who
previously had not been able to make workplace pension provision a part
of their offering to employees. I believe that many employers will rise
to the challenge and opportunity that this provides to embed better
relationships between the employer and the employee. So it is not
entirely a burden: there is a very significant opportunity here through
the communication exercise. The responsibility to ensure that an
employer has complied with their legal obligations in terms of the
provision of information will lie with the regulator, which in this
case will be the pensions
regulator.</div>

other employers who will do a less good job. We intend to provide
excellent information from the PAC scheme and, through our work with
the pensions regulator, we will see what role it has, although its role
is primarily around compliance. This is one of those areas where, of
course, we all want the employer to do the best job. In practice,
however, to reach the full set of the worker
community&#151;including, for example, agency workers, who will be
involved in this&#151;we think there is a role for the trust-based
scheme to be pointed out as an information source to workers quite

members, one of the things that is unique about personal accounts is
prospectively the ban on transfers in and out. Let us add to that the
large number of temporary migrant workers in this country that we have
seen over the past few years. I do not have a crystal ball and I do not
know whether these circumstances will continue into the future, but if
they do, it is entirely plausible that we will have millions of workers
from across the European Union who come to the UK, work, qualify, have
a national insurance number and a personal account, go back home and
have no further involvement with personal accounts until they
decumulate. I apologise&#151;until their pot turns into a retirement

difficulty of making these communications to millions of people. I am
very glad that the ban on transfers out has been brought up as a
subject for discussion in the 2017 review because, from an operational
perspective, I could make a case for allowing us to be able to transfer

business from any employer and any employee that is offered to us as a
business line. A commercial provider would, for instance, be able to
cross-sell other products to certain of the pension savers in a certain
type of product arrangement and would be able to transfer out small
balances and dormant accounts to another provider or oblige the holder
of those dormant accounts to transfer the business away if it was

right across the issue of the provision of workplace pensions. We have
a duty to provide excellent information in support of that decision for
people looking prospectively at personal accounts. It may well be that
we would encourage people to look beyond that and to make it clear to

arrangements in place for auto-enrolment into occupational schemes, so
the questions that arise under &#147;pay to save&#148; are not ones

are a feature of existing pension provision. Therefore, I believe that
the questions that the recipients of advice need to answer are not

meeting held with the Swedish PPM&#151;the Premiepensionsmyndigheten
initiative. We are casting the net reasonably wide for a set of
precedents. Interestingly, none of them are exactly the same as what we
are doing here, but there are overlaps and different learnings. We are
very cognisant of the fact that we need to look around the world and go
and talk to people to learn, but also, if we can&#151;as we have now
with KiwiSaver and with the thrift savings plan&#151;directly to
bring people into the team so that they can add their
perspective.</div>

personal accounts is a matter of major interest, because we are
establishing one of the largest and most complex pension arrangements
known, or currently planned to be operated, in the world. So there is a

						</i> The fundamental thing is that we want to be
part of a change to the outlook that people in employment have in the
UK that moves from &#147;Workplace pensions are something that some
people have&#148; to &#147;Workplace pensions are something that
everybody has&#148;. They become the norm; they become usual. That is
the key transformation that we wish to be a part
of.</div>
					<a name="080115112000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are a set
of reasons&#151;in a sense well rehearsed&#151;as to why the target
market that personal accounts are focused at has been difficult for the
private sector to address. Paul and I would both see that not as a
market failure&#151;the market correctly recognises that it is a very
difficult sector to address because of the very large number of small
employers and the costs of approaching it and so on. It is our job to
address that target market. Our aim is to work very
collaboratively&#151;we are talking directly to a number of the
leading players in the private sector, and people like the National
Association of Pension Funds and Association of British Insurers and
others who represent them&#151;to build a positive, constructive
working relationship. That is what is happening so
far.</div>
					<a name="080115112000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">We want to get
to a place where there is more, in real terms, private sector
provision, balanced by a thriving and successful personal accounts
scheme. That is the goal and we are therefore focused on meeting that.
I expect that the &#147;tonality&#148; and
&#147;salience&#148;&#151;as marketing people would call
them&#151;of personal accounts as we get them right for our target
market will make the scheme credible, valued and trusted. These are all
attributes a pension savings scheme has to have. But they will make it
distinctive and will leave, I hope, plenty of space for the private
sector to complement that. The upper earnings limit really does focus
the mind on a significant opportunity above the personal
accounts&#151;for higher-paid workers for
example.</div>

						</i> Only that levelling down has been a feature
of the pensions sector for some time, given the closure of
defined-benefit schemes and the move to defined-contribution schemes
with lower levels of contribution. It is very encouraging that the
DWP&#146;s own research has suggested that employers do not intend to
reduce contributions. Indeed, a significant percentage intends to
contribute more than the statutory minimum. If personal accounts
achieve their goal, we will awaken interest and awareness in pensions
so that they become something that the employee seeks in an employment
offer. About 7 million to 9 million people currently working in the
private sector have no occupational pension arrangement in place. We
want to introduce a climate where the employee expects pension
provision&#151;and, indeed, becomes familiar with making judgments
about and comparing pension 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column18" />Column number: 18</div>provision&#151;so that it becomes something that is to some extent
demand driven. That is one of our clear goals in terms of the
effectiveness of

						 You both rightly said that simplicity was the key
to dealing with issues such as charges and to ensuring that a scheme
could deliver for such a large number of people at a reasonable cost.
Some people, however, will want an element of choice: they might want

so on. To what extent do you intend to offer some degree of choice,

						</i> We spent some time with the Work and Pensions
Committee on this issue and on striking the right balance between
offering sufficient choice and so much choice that it confuses. All the
evidence suggests that a high percentage of employees will opt for the
default fund. Private sector experience here and the experience of
similar arrangements elsewhere&#151;in Australia, Sweden and
Denmark&#151;is that the default option proves to be the one that
most people choose. Therefore, we will have to do a great deal of work
around the design and articulation of the features of the default
option. Around that, we will create a range of funds that gives
sufficient, but not excessive, choice. Then, through the process of
consultation with the member panels and the employer panels, we will
test prospective new products. To some extent, I think it is refreshing
that the product range is one of the things that will work to sustain
interest in, and awareness of, the work of personal accounts. However,
we will always do that against the test that it should be
self-financing, and that we should not get cross-subsidisation from one
customer to another as far as product cost alone is concerned, as
opposed to the total cost of the
scheme.</div>

default scheme&#151;internal estimates are that up to 80 per cent. of
the money could end up there&#151;but we will also be setting out our

largely new to pension provision. Yes, there are social and ethical

some clarity on the subject from the Thoresen review. Until we have
that, it is impossible to make judgments about what is going to happen.

with personal accounts are no different from those that arise with
other retail investment products. Parliament and the FSA have clearly
determined the difference between products sold under advice and those
sold under information. Personal accounts will be sold under
information. That is equivalent, in FSA terminology, to execution only,
rather than advice. But, the Thoresen work&#151;and, indeed, that of

						 Two brief questions. Would it help the launch of a
successful personal accounts system if those people who, through no
fault of their own, had been auto-enrolled and then got no benefit in
retirement could have some form of restitution? Do not define what that
would be&#151;perhaps we all need to go away and think about that.
Would that help your job in selling this to the mass market, which we
would want to do for personal accounts to be a success? My second
question concerns some employers in really cut-throat industries where
margins are low who might offer financial inducements to their
employees not to join to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column20" />Column number: 20</div>save on their contributions. There would then not be a level playing

						 Coming back to the last question from Nigel
Waterson about levelling down, 75 per cent. of employers with an
occupational pension scheme are contributing more than 3 per cent. What
evidence do you have that, by introducing the new scheme with a 3 per
cent. contribution from employers, you are not going to see employers
either reducing their contribution in existing occupational pension
schemes, or even closing them down and moving their staff into the new
scheme that you are running? Is there any evidence internationally that
that has happened or has not

the foresight to put in place pension arrangements have acknowledged
the value to their company of having employees with good pension
