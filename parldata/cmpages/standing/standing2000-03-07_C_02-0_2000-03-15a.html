<P>
<B>Mrs Caroline Spelman </B>(Meriden): I beg to move amendment No. 10, in page 2, line 32, leave out ``, or both''.

<P>
This small amendment would remove the words ``or both''—words that might create considerable practical problems. It seems illogical that both the value of the delivery of the service and the value of the voucher should be on one piece of paper. There are wide variations in the cost of service delivery in different parts of the country, so the provision may unwittingly disadvantage people living in some areas.

<P>
If I give the Committee an illustration, what I am driving at may become clearer. A carer may be presented with a voucher that says that its value is £30 for the delivery of, say, a day's respite care for the cared-for person, but in some parts of the country a day's care may cost more than £30. The variation in rates of pay between, say, Surrey and Cumbria is substantial, and retaining the option of stating both the value of the delivery of the service and the monetary value of the voucher on one document could considerably disadvantage people in some parts of the country.

<P>
It is important to retain flexibility, and it is also important that cared-for people in areas where pay is high should not be disadvantaged by the system. This is a probing amendment, and I look forward to hearing a response to it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Tom Pendry </B>(Stalybridge and Hyde): I welcome you back to the Chair, Mr. Stevenson. As you know, I keep coming back to the idea of flexibility and the choice available to service users about the ways in which additional support is provided for them while their usual carer takes a break. The amendment would reduce that flexibility.

<P>
Time value vouchers will be exchanged for services provided by suppliers that already have a contract with the council or that the council has placed on an approved list. Service users may often be happy to use local service providers from such a list when they need additional support while their carers take a break. Sometimes support will be delivered so as to allow them to stay at home; sometimes the time value voucher will be redeemed against a short stay in a local residential home. The cared-for person may also choose to try different ways of meeting his or her need for additional support. People may wish to take the opportunity to go away themselves, perhaps for a short break such as those facilitated by the Parkinson's Disease Society.

<P>
For such flexibility to be possible, we need money value vouchers. People who need additional support while their normal carers take a break may not want to choose at the beginning of the year how they will have their support needs met later. Again, I stress the need for flexibility.

<P>
The time and money voucher offers additional flexibility to service users, so I hope that the hon. Lady will withdraw the amendment. It would remove the opportunities for disabled people to make a choice about how they are supported while their usual carer takes a much-needed break from the caring role.

<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Department of Health </B>(Mr. John Hutton): I shall briefly add to the accurate comments that my hon. Friend has made. He properly referred to the virtue of flexibility in the new services, and in the voucher scheme in particular. He was absolutely right; we want the scheme to provide maximum flexibility for the carer and the disabled person. Allowing the voucher to be expressed either in money or in terms of a particular service will give people the flexibility to choose which type of service they want.

<P>
It would be regrettable if cared-for people were not given the discretion to make different choices during the year if their needs or preferences change. At one time they may want a respite care package from an agreed provider, but later they may want to buy additional types of care from a different provider. That is essentially what the clause will allow. It is not an attempt to restrict choice or to make the scheme more confusing—far from it—but an attempt to make the scheme as flexible as possible. It puts the power in the hands of the person with the voucher to choose between obtaining a service provided under contract with a local authority, and purchasing a different care package from a different provider.

<P>
The words ``or both'' give the final choice to cared-for people as to how they redeem the voucher and what service configuration package they want to use. It is important, for all the reasons that my hon. Friend the Member for Stalybridge and Hyde (Mr. Pendry) has given, that we leave those words in the Bill. They empower cared-for people to make those choices for themselves, and give the greatest flexibility.

<P>
<B>Mrs Spelman:</B> I am glad that we tabled the probing amendment, because I am now clearer about how to interpret the subsection. I had misread it—as I am sure that others are capable of misreading it—due to my grammatical interpretation of the sentence. It says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> for the value of a voucher to be expressed in terms of money, or—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and here I understood the words ``of the value''
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>of the delivery of a service for a period of time.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
However, the Minister has explained that the Government's aim here is that the period of time will be protected, which is the very aim of my amendment. I am clearer in my mind about the Minister's interpretation of the clause, but I am worried that others will interpret it as I did. I now reallise that the Government's intention is to prevent the kind of disadvantage that I anticipated could arise from any variation throughout the country in the cost of delivering the services. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mrs Spelman:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 11, in page 2, line 33, leave out paragraph (b).

<P>
At the start of the discussion of the previous amendment, we received a hint that the Government have anticipated what I might say on this amendment. Incidentally, I want to make certain, for the benefit of members of the Committee, that a typographical mistake that appeared in the blue notice paper has been corrected: ``(6)'' should read ``(b)''. I see that the mistake has been corrected in the final version.

<P>
The purpose of this probing amendment is to ensure that local authorities should not be able to dictate who provides the services. It is tempting for them to try to ensure that their own providers deliver the services, but there is much evidence that local authorities are not always the best providers of services, and that they are increasingly widening their range. They are moving into the role of the enabler, and we support that move. The country has come a long way from the culture of providing jobs for the boys, and we want to guard against a reversal of that trend.

<P>
Through the best value programme, which in some respects bears a remarkable similarity to the Conservative system of competitive tendering, the Government have seen the benefit of having a variety of providers. The amendment would ensure that variety in provision remains available, and that local authorities would not be able to constrain that choice greatly.

<P>
<B>Mr. Pendry:</B> At first glance, the amendment has its attractions, which I shall mention shortly. As I said, the short-term break voucher scheme is intended to offer users and their carers more flexibility and choice than may be achieved by direct local authority provision of services. It will introduce an alternative way of achieving more flexibility and choice in the delivery of respite care than may be currently available through direct payments. Under the voucher scheme, it is intended that councils should approve suppliers of services, and users and carers will be able to exchange vouchers for services from those approved suppliers. The services may be delivered at a more convenient time for the user and carer, allowing for greater choice in the way in which assessed needs are met.

<P>
However, in light of the provisions of the Care Standards Bill, clause 3(3)(b) could be unnecessary. We shall reflect on that, and in that respect the amendment has helped us. I have discussed the matter with the Minister, and we shall consider what the hon. Lady has said. In view of my assurance, I ask her to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I shall add briefly to what my hon. Friend has said. The intention behind the provision was not to impose a straitjacket or any uniformity in the provision of such important care services. The clause is meant to ensure proper protection in the system, so that inappropriate people cannot go into people's homes to provide those services. As my hon. Friend accurately said, the Care Standards Bill, which is in another place, will provide a new independent regulation and inspection arrangement. The Committee may be aware that under the terms of that Bill, residential care home owners, nursing home owners and domiciliary care agencies will be regulated and inspected by the new National Care Standards Commission. That will substantially reassure users of community care services that there will be a proper, more effective and tighter system of regulation and inspection, which will prevent inappropriate care providers from providing community care services. That is our intention, so we do not want to mirror it, or set on top of it another approval mechanism, which would not add significantly to the protection of community care service users.

<P>
I am grateful to the hon. Member for Meriden (Mrs Spelman), as I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Stalybridge and Hyde is, for tabling the amendment. We shall reflect on the points that she made, and any necessary amendments to my hon. Friend's Bill will be tabled on Report.

<P>
<B>Mrs Spelman:</B> We are always pleased to hear that legislation will be streamlined or made redundant in some way, because of the perpetual problem of drowning in regulation. I had hoped to hear the magic word ``protection'' from the Minister, and I did, which sets my mind at rest. Protection is undoubtedly a good reason for having local authority approval in the process of providing services and substitute care for people who may be very vulnerable.

<P>
I look forward to debating the Care Standards Bill shortly. Protecting vulnerable people, and especially the cared-for person, is a good reason for having an approval process, although it may be superseded by other legislation. As long as it is there, I am satisfied that adequate provision has been made. Given the diminution of the role of local authorities—it is now that of an enabler—it becomes all the more imperative that there are checks to ensure that the people entering private homes to provide care or substitute care are suitable, and reliable and trustworthy enough to be allowed to impinge on someone's privacy. Given that there is protection in law, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>

<B>Mrs Spelman:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 12, in page 2, line 38, at end add—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(4) The regulations shall make provision regarding—<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) whether or not the vouchers are personal to the recipient or can be traded or exchanged; and

<P>
(b) whether or not, if the vouchers are expressed in terms of monetary value, they can be used in part payment for services with the recipient of the voucher paying any balance in cash; and

<P>
(c) how it shall be determined whether the voucher is to be issued to the carer or the person cared for; and

<P>
(d) the minimum period of validity of any voucher issued.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 16, in clause 6, page 4, line 39, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(4) The regulations shall make provision regarding—<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) whether or not the vouchers are personal to the recipient or can be traded or exchanged; and

<P>
(b) whether or not the vouchers are expressed in terms of monetary value they can be used in part payment for services with the recipient of the voucher paying any balance in cash; and

<P>
(c) the minimum period of validity of any voucher issued.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mrs Spelman:</B> The amendment would add a new subsection, and I shall deal with the paragraphs one at a time. Paragraph (a) is designed to increase flexibility and enable vouchers to be traded, perhaps between a carer and a cared-for person, which would overcome some potential rigidities in the system.

<P>
Paragraph (b) is also designed to increase flexibility in the use of vouchers. Part-payment would certainly address the problem of the monetary value of the voucher being insufficient to cover the cost of the service, which is perfectly possible in some areas. That relates to our discussion of amendment No. 10. Paragraph (b) would also allow topping up to occur. That is important because respite care is undeniably expensive, which is one reason why it has been difficult to provide respite for carers. It is a substantial item. It is possible to envisage people having substantial breaks, which they really need, through a system of topping up, with asistance from the state. If the £140 million available were divided by the number of carers, that would amount to £50 a head—if my sums are correct. It is quite difficult to have a decent respite break for £50 a head. Not everybody would use that money for respite care, but the flexibility to be able to top up the voucher could be important. I cannot resist the analogy with an air miles scheme, with which I am sure hon. Members are familiar. Parallels could be drawm between such a scheme and the idea of a social services air miles scheme. The flexibility of air miles schemes is much appreciated by consumers.

<P>
Paragraph (c) is designed to clarify to whom a voucher is issued. It is important to ensure that local authorities do not step round the issue by choosing the person who has the greatest means, as a way of trying to reduce their financial contribution to providing support. The new paragraph would increase the fairness of the measure.

<P>
Finally, paragraph (d) is the logical corollary of having a maximum period of validity for a voucher. Without such provision, there is a danger that the period of validity could be so short as to prevent people from having sufficient time to make use of the voucher. There is fairly good documented evidence of carers trying to make use of respite arrangements but being offered them at short notice. Setting up respite care entails difficulties, so if there is not a sufficient window of opportunity, the juncture may pass. By adding a provision for a minimum period of validity, we want to guard against a ``Here you have it, here you don't'' situation, in which the voucher arrives, but the opportunity to cash it in and use it is too short.

<P>
<B>Mr. Pendry:</B> This is another thoughtful amendment tabled by the hon. Lady.

<P>
Its purpose is to state that regulations shall make provision regarding specific issues such as topping up. The Department of Health has already had initial discussions with voluntary organisations such as Crossroads, the Association of Directors of Social Services, the Local Government Association and other interested parties in England on the introduction of voucher schemes. The situation is likely to be less well advanced in Wales. However, the National Assembly for Wales and the Department of Health will wish to ensure that full consultation has taken place before regulations are drafted.

<P>
The amendment would restrict the flexibility of the Department of Health and the National Assembly for Wales to consult fully on the framework for local council schemes that would best meet the needs in each country. The Minister may wish to say something on the thinking that is developing on issues such as topping up and the minimum period of validity for vouchers issued, but I hope that the hon. Member for Meriden will withdraw her amendment. It could reduce the opportunities in England and Wales for interested parties to be fully involved in the development of a framework for local schemes. I hope that the Minister has not closed his mind to the possibility of topping up, should consultation suggest that it is necessary. I look forward to his comments, as no doubt the hon. Lady does, too.
 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> As my hon. Friend said, we are discussing the technical and operational aspects of a future voucher scheme openly, as is right, with all the interested parties, including those from local government and carers' and disabled organisations. There are no limits on our discussions about how the scheme should work.

<P>
The hon. Member for Meriden will note that clause 3(1) gives the Secretary of State extensive powers to make regulations in all aspects of the voucher scheme. Clause 3(3) makes specific provision for some matters that the regulations may cover, but she and other hon. Members should not lose sight of those extensive regulations making powers. We expect the issues that she raised to be subject to consultation with all the interested parties.

<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Stalybridge and Hyde is right: we do not rule out topping up as an option in our intended regulations. Our watchword is to make the scheme as flexible and practical as possible. We are interested to hear what the organisations have to say about how we can make the voucher scheme successful. We need to retain as much flexibility as possible for regulation-making powers.

<P>
The hon. Member for Meriden will find that the clause gives wide-ranging powers to make regulations for all aspects of the voucher scheme. I hope that I have reassured her and other hon. Members. We have an open mind about all the issues that she raised. We have not ruled out anything on the eventual scope of the regulations. We want the process to be as open as possible. We shall be guided on topping up largely by what those who are directly involved in the interests of carers and disabled people say to us.

<P>
<B>Mrs Spelman:</B> I was interested to hear both explanations. The Opposition have little sympathy with the Government on the delay caused by discussions being less well advanced in Wales. I am not a huge enthusiast for over-complicated devolutionary tools. The differences in care provision throughout the United Kingdom are unlikely to be so substantial that it would necessitate holding up legislation. In response to my probing amendment, I was pleased to hear that the Government had not ruled out the idea of topping up. I remain a little concerned about how much power resides within provisions such as subsection (1), under which the regulations could apparently be used to amend in detail the practical application of the Bill. However, if flexibility and topping up were permitted, that would be a good thing.

<P>
As a parliamentarian, I find it difficult to debate legislation in detail when I have to take it on promise that it might be altered as a result of further consultation and regulation. I have to accept on a wing and a prayer the Government's declared good intentions. However, as I say, the Minister is willing to be flexible and open on the important matters of topping up and some of the other aspects that we propose. I am satisfied that the Government's intention is good. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mrs Spelman:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 13, in page 2, line 38, at end add—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(4) The Secretary of State shall make provision for local authorities to carry forward monies allocated for the purposes of this clause for the period of validity of the vouchers issued.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
This is another practical and probing amendment, which would enable vouchers to be carried forward. I made an analogy earlier with the air miles scheme; the more I thought about it, the more parallels I saw. The company providing air miles is legally required to carry them forward. All politicians know what happens with public money at financial year ends; if it is short, enormous pressure sensue and if in excess—a rare occurrence—it can be ``lost''. That can produce all sorts of strange purchasing patterns in the public sector.
 
<P>
The amendment is a probing one designed to get over the artificial rigidity of a politically determined financial period. As far as the cared-for person and the carer are concerned, financial year ends are irrelevant. Their needs and the pressures on them continue, day in, day out, beyond April. Carrying vouchers forward would overcome that artificial rigidity. It might also help with the problem that I raised earlier: if the period in which a voucher can be used is too short, the person being assessed for need may never receive what he or she is due, simply because of the rigidities in the system. The amendment is designed to increase flexibility and I look forward to hearing what the Government have to say about it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Pendry:</B> Councils can already carry forward money from one year to the next. They often hold contingency funds. As long as vouchers have a cash value, local authorities should have no problem accounting for them in their current financial systems. The only exception to that general rule is special grant moneys, which, under the rules for 2000–01 carers' grant moneys, must be spent in a year. That is relevant because of the 110 local authority carers' grant schemes implemented to date by the King's Fund. Four councils have voucher schemes, and 31, including the local authority in my constituency, Tameside, plan to introduce them using grant moneys either as start-up funds or to pay for breaks. Vouchers issued from ring-fenced grant moneys would need to be spent in a year.

<P>
If, following consultation, councils ask the Department of Health to withdraw the bar on carrying carers' grant moneys forward to year 3, the Department may consider that request. If the Bill receives Royal Assent, the Department of Health, or the National Assembly for Wales, will develop a framework for short-term break voucher schemes in regulations. Each local authority will want to develop local schemes based on regulations that meet local needs.

<P>
I hope that, following those assurances, the hon. Member for Meriden will withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mrs Spelman:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for that explanation. I hope that local authorities will take their cue from him in pressing for the removal of the bar in the outworking of their grant. There is a difference between the restriction on the carrying forward of money by local authorities and the effect of that restriction on the carer and the cared-for person. Rigidities in the system may be overcome by the local authority's having the most flexible arrangements possible in providing the service, or in this case, money, to the recipient. As it sounds as though the system might be even more flexible, I am encouraged to beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Pendry:</B> It has been an interesting and—I hope that the hon. Member for Meriden will agree—fruitful debate. She has received clarification on some important aspects. The Government's national strategy for carers identified voucher schemes as a way of giving users and carers more flexibility in timing carers' breaks and more choice for the cared-for person in how services are delivered to them while their usual carer takes a break.

<P>
The clause enables local authorities to offer people vouchers, to be redeemed in exchange for the delivery of additional services that will enable their carers to take a short-term break. Voucher schemes will offer more flexibility and choice than local authority provision of services, and will introduce a simpler way of achieving flexiblity and choice in the delivery of short-term breaks than is currently available to cared-for people via a direct payment scheme.

<P>
Vouchers may be exchanged, at a time of the voucher holder's choosing, for the support that the cared-for person has been assessed as needing while the carer takes a break. Department of Health guidance will specify that in some circumstances users may want the voucher to be issued in the name of their carers. Carers would then be able to redeem the vouchers when they chose to do so. That additional flexibility will allow cared-for people to offer carers more control over when they can take a break from their caring role.

<P>
It is obvious that carers often need breaks, and the people for whom they care need additional support while their usual carer takes a break. Additional services delivered to cared-for people while their usual carers take breaks constitute under the Bill not carer services but community care services. I hope that, as a result of this interesting debate, the Committee will agree that the clause should stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mrs Spelman:</B> I have been looking forward to this moment. A clause stand part debate is the appropriate point at which to discuss more widely the philosophy behind the clause, in this case the voucher system. I hope that members of the Committee will indulge me if I point out that, not so long ago, Labour Members were greatly opposed to voucher systems. I do not intend to stray outside the remit of the Bill, which will provide money and services to carers and disabled children, but some of the criticisms that were levelled at the nursery voucher system—

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am sure that the hon. Lady will forgive my pointing out that we are not discussing nursery vouchers. While the philosophy behind the voucher scheme proposed in the Bill is legitimate, I must draw the line about nursery vouchers.

<P>
<B>Mrs Spelman:</B> I mentioned nursery vouchers in case the Minister was unaware of the discussions to which I was about to refer. I shall have no need to mention the ``N'' word again. On 22 January 1996, some interesting points were raised about voucher systems on the Second Reading of the Nursery Education and Grant-Maintained Schools Bill, and they still apply today. They are part of the philosophy of a voucher system, something for which the Government must still be on their guard in the delivery of that system. The present Secretary of State for Education and Employment said that voucher systems were ``bizarre'' in the sense that they are a
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>system that results in spending public money on recycling bits of paper.—[Official Report, 22 January 1996; Vol. 270, c. 47.]<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
When the Government audit the effectiveness of the voucher system for delivering help to carers and disabled children, I urge them to study the administrative costs of the system. The Local Government Association said that the practical measures envisaged in the Bill would undoutably involve more staff and more staff time in assessing and delivering help in that way. Vouchers do not grow on trees; they cost money to print, provide and administer correctly and fairly. If the Government undertake such an audit, will they look at the effective uptake of vouchers?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> The hon. Lady began by saying how strongly she believed in vouchers. Unless I have misunderstood what she was saying, she is now arguing on a different track: that vouchers are too expensive to administer. I am sure that she will want to clarify that she believes in the voucher system, as we do.

<P>
<B>Mrs Spelman:</B> The Minister is putting words in my mouth. Leaving aside our political differences, the valid criticisms that were made previously should give the Government cause to consider carefully the inherent risks in voucher systems. It is good parliamentary practice to learn from the mistakes of others if that is not too inelegant a way of putting it. I did not say that I do not believe in voucher systems. The position is quite the reverse. As my party has demonstrated, it is one method of delivering services that cost money to the state to people who need them. I have no philosophical difficulty with that.

<P>
I would not go so far as to use the words of the Secretary of State for Education and Employment, such as ``recycling bits of paper'', because that would not be helpful, but it would be responsible to consider the administrative costs of operating the scheme in such a way. Some people find a voucher system complicated to cope with, as a result of which they do not use their vouchers. After a certain time, it would be right and responsible to examine whether the voucher system is subject to a good percentage uptake and is really delivering care and assistance to the carer and the disabled child.
 
<P>
<B>Mr. Paul Burstow </B>(Sutton and Cheam): I did not contribute to debate on the amendments because the clause is a permissive measure. It gives local authorities additional power and implies ``you can'', not ``you shall''.

<P>
I accept the logic of exploring such issues. Having listened carefully to the debate, I support the clause standing part. However, I wish to establish how local authorities' potential power will operate in relation to the carers' grant. Do the Government envisage changing the conditions that apply to the grant in future to signal that it is desirable for local authorities to take such action, or will they maintain a neutral stance on the grant's usage? Do any of the current conditions preclude moneys paid as a carers' grant being used to establish and operate such a scheme?

<P>
Some local authorities are already experimenting with such matters and are obviously constrained by the current legislation. They welcome the greater scope that the Bill would give them. However, will the Minister confirm whether the current carers' grant conditions would fetter local authorities in their exercise of such power?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I do not want to participate in the stand part debate, as I am sure that the Committee is anxious to discuss other parts of the Bill. However, I assure the hon. Gentleman that nothing in the existing grant arrangements would confine, restrict or inhibit local authorities' development of voucher schemes.

<P>
Obviously, we have not yet set the grant for conditional reports for subsequent years. We shall keep all the issues under review, but there are no such restraints at the moment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> The Minister has given a helpful assurance and I therefore support the clause standing part.

<P>
<B>Mrs Virginia Bottomley </B>(South-West Surrey): I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the stand part debate.

<P>
I have long been a supporter of vouchers and do not wish to cross you again by raising the matter, Mr. Stevenson. However, one is always delighted by conversion to a sensible concept. I observed the development of several preliminary voucher schemes and concluded that vouchers can empower carers. Otherwise, with the best will in the world, there is a tendency for people to think that men and women in Whitehall or, in this case, the town hall, know best. The Carers National Association has given me one carer's moving account of the problem. The carer says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I was supposed to have three weekends off this year. For the first they phoned up so late, I just couldn't get him ready in time, he needs a lot of preparation and they just didn't understand.

<P>
By contrast, people can decide when and how to use vouchers. The system is completely different from a local authority or home having an allocation meeting and deciding who shall have the opportunity to take up a respite bed. The power is therefore valuable and I trust that local authorities will make use of it. However, the power will not solve everyone's problems.

<P>
I am an officer of the all-party group on autism and I make a plea on behalf of children with autism or Asperger's syndrome. Finding a appropriate place for such children involves special needs and support services. It means more than providing a voucher. An appropriate response must be encouraged.

<P>
My previous contributions apply equally to clause 3. Complex issues remain on to balancing the rights of parents and children, as well as those of carers and those receiving care.

<P>
I welcomed the proposal, which is an important step forward. I hope that the voucher system will be applied to other social and Government policy.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and each local authority shall publish the criteria it shall use in reaching any decision under this sub section, which may not include reference to the relative means of the carer and the person cared for.'.<P>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take amendment No. 8, in page 3, line 27, at end add—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(5) In making a decision under subsection (4) above, a local authority shall not have regard to the financial resources of either the carer or the disabled person.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mrs Spelman:</B> At the Committee's first sitting the Minister gave an undertaking that an amendment to guard against charging carers and cared-for persons would be tabled on Report. The clause presents an opportunity to include a new, corrective subsection which would make the decision-making process more transparent to those who are assessed as needing help, by publishing the criteria on which the decision to provide a service is based. It would also help to prevent local authorities somewhat deviously targeting offers of help to potential recipients on those of greatest means.

<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> This group of amendments contains that tabled in my name and that of my hon. Friend the Member for St. Ives (Mr. George). I also support the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Meriden. We must ensure that the basis on which those in authority take decisions is clarified from the outset. Clear criteria for deciding eligibility for care are appropriate in every aspect of social care policy. I look forward to the Minister's response to the amendments.

<P>
Amendment No. 8 is an attempt to discover whether further clarifications of the guidance on financial assessments can be introduced. The amendment would ensure that service decisions were not taken on the basis of the financial resources of either the disabled person or the carer.

<P>
The National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990 and other relevant legislation is drafted in terms of meeting need on the basis of an assessment, and local authories have a duty to meet assessed need. In that context there is still some uncertainty, although it is generally understood that services cannot be withdrawn because of non-payment. But—there is always a but—under the Health and Social Services and Social Security Adjudications Act 1983, it is possible for local authorities to pursue a debt. That, too, is generally understood by local authorities. The issue is the timing of the assessment of need and of the financial circumstances of the person whose need has been assessed. The reality is that in practice those two assessments, which should be separate processes, take place together. The guidance is clear but brief: it states that financial assessments follow needs assessments. However, the concern behind the amendment is that when finance departments look at the opportunities that the Bill presents to them and their local authorities, they will consider ways in which to cherry-pick among services and among those who can afford to pay for them.

<P>
The Minister gave some helpful reassurances at our previous sitting. My amendment takes the discussion on to the issues of timing and the clarity of the two processes of assessing need and means, because often carers and disabled people are confused and misled over what they are entitled to. The amendment would introduce greater clarity. It picks up on a point that was raised in 1995 by the National Consumer Council, which did quite a bit of work on the rather confused and chaotic nature of local authorities' charging policies. It reflects the council's concern about the lack of clarity in the process that it expressed at that time.

<P>
<B>Mr. Pendry:</B> The amendments were intended to ensure that decisions about whether services that could be delivered to the cared-for person as community care services, or to the carer as carer services, under the Bill, do not take account of an individual's financial resources. I agree with the hon. Gentleman that people's needs should be assessed before financial means are considered. However, we come back to the question whether guidance should be in the Bill. The Government think that there should be full guidance but that it should not be in the Bill. As the hon. Member for Meriden said, it is also important that the Bill address concerns about the range of decision making, eligibility criteria and so on, and about the need for greater accountability and transparency. If the hon. Members for Meriden and for Sutton and Cheam (Mr. Burstow) agree to withdraw their amendments, after further discussion with the Minister we shall take away and reconsider this important issue of needs assessment not taking account of a person's financial resources and consider how best to take it forward, either on Report or in another place.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> Both amendments raise complex issues of policy and practice, and resources. Members of the Committee may like to know that, currently, local authorities recover approximately £250 million relating to non-residential domiciliary care charges. That is a considerable amount of public money which would to some extent be forgone if the Committee accepted either amendment. Also, we should not forget—this is part of the problem with the Bill that hon. Members and people outside are wrestling with—that the Bill is primarily about carer services. Amendment No. 4 would discriminate against disabled people. If it were accepted, it would cover only services for the cared-for person for which that person's financial means could be taken account of; it would not allow the financial means of the carer in assessing his or her liability to charge to be considered. Essentially, this would create a two-tier framework of charging. Carers would be entirely excluded from the charging regimes, but disabled people would still be subject to the charging framework. Our view is that, whatever decisions are eventually taken about the charging regime for non-domiciliary care services, it must be fair for carers and for the disabled. I accept that the amendment's purpose is to bring about a discussion on the future of the charging regime in relation to non-residential community care services. But the inescapable reality is that if either amendment became part of the Bill there would be the highly unsatisfactory situation of the disabled person's still being charged while the carer was not. That would not be consistent, fair or equitable.

<P>
The Government have made it clear that we wish to consider the charging arrangements generally for non-residential community care services. We are awaiting a substantial report from the Audit Commission, which is reviewing the operation of the charging regime for non-residential services provided by local authorities. We look forward to that important piece of work. We made it clear in the White Paper, ``Modernising Social Services'' that our ambition is to provide greater equity in the charging regime and reduce the current variations to which the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam referred.

<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Stalybridge and Hyde was right that such issues go much wider than services for carers; they relate to all community care services provided by local authorities. We shall have to debate those matters so that hon. Members can consider the Government's proposals. My hon. Friend is also right that this is not the appropriate Bill in which to make such changes. If we were to accept the amendment, we should discriminate against disabled people. That would not be right, and it is not what people would want us to do.

<P>
In addition to reviewing the non-residential charging regime, we are considering the charging regime for residential services as part of the work that we are undertaking on Sir Stewart Sutherland's report. In addition, we are working with local authorities to devise a fairer, more equitable system of eligibility rules. At present, substantial variations exist between the ways in which local authorities apply and operate eligibility criteria. We are trying to achieve a synergy between social service's eligibility rules and health authorities' long-term health care rules. That is a big programme of work.

<P>
We have made it clear that we shall make some announcements on all those complex matters in July, so the House will have plenty of opportunity to revisit the subject and express its opinion. This is not the right Bill in which to make such changes. These are certainly not the right amendments to include in the Bill, and I hope that the Committee will resist them if they are pressed to a Division. However, we accept that the issue will not go away. We have always accepted that reform is needed and we are committed to it, but at the right time and place.

<P>
<B>Mrs Spelman:</B> It has been interesting to hear the Minister elaborate on the Government's intentions, although we do not know how they propose to amend the Bill to deal with such matters. We are trying to achieve the same things. The Opposition do not intend to disadvantage disabled people by amending the Bill. However, the Bill is setting an important precedent on charging carers for the services delivered to them, so we need to raise the issues that may result.

<P>
There is no good reason to protect local authorities from the responsibility to be transparent and accountable in how they spend funds, such as the £250 million to which the Minister referred. On the contrary, in the culture of modern Britain, politicians and executives who take decisions involving public money are required to be all the more accountable. The purpose of the amendment is to ensure proper protection, given that charging for such services is becoming a practical reality.

<P>
My local authority, like many others, is required to increase spending on social services by more than the increase in the central grant. That involves taking difficult decisions on what should be cut to provide the necessary increase in social services provision and the unwelcome decision to introduce charging. Such matters are likely to receive increased public attention. The Minister is right that we need to debate charging. A precedent is being set in the Bill on the capacity to charge carers, and the amendments would protect both carers and cared-for people. We shall have to take the Minister's word that that is also the Government's intention. We shall look actively for amendments to be tabled on Report to satisfy us on that point.

<P>

<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> The hon. Member for Stalybridge and Hyde made the fair point that some matters would be dealt with in guidance. My only reservation about that is that the guidance about assessments under the National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990 is brief. Paragraph 3.31 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the assessment of financial means should  follow the assessment of need and decisions about service provision.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That seems clear cut and one would have thought that that is what should happen. However, it does not happen, so the effectiveness of the regime that monitors the implementation of that guidance comes into question. Perhaps further examination by the social services inspectorate is needed.
<P>

<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
I understand and appreciate the Minister's point. It is not my intention to tilt the balance in a discriminatory fashion against disabled people. However, in the context of the Carers (Recognition and Services) Act 1995, carers are entitled to an assessment of their needs. They are integrated into the disabled person's care plan if there is a need to be met and services—in theory at least, if not always in practice—will be provided to meet those assessed needs. Because the services are provided to the carer, the carer cannot be charged for them. The existing anomaly is that carers cannot be charged, but the Bill will start to charge them. That provision may deal with an inequity in the current legislation, but the amendment clarifies the position.

<P>
The charging regime needs to be clarified. The Audit Commission report has been a long time coming. I hope that it will be a quality piece of work, because so much will be based on it. It would be useful if the Minister could tell us when it will be published. We are all waiting for it because, hopefully, it will give us some answers.

<P>
<B>Mrs Spelman:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Pendry:</B> The clause deals with the inter-relationship between assessment and the delivery of services for both the carer and the cared-for person. Subsection (1) enables the local authority, when assessing a carer under the Carers (Recognition and Services) Act 1995, to take into account when it considers it to be material a previous assessment under clause 1(1) of the Bill. That might be helpful when a cared-for person changed his mind and agreed to have an assessment of his need and the carer no longer wished to have services in his own right, but chose to have his needs taken into account within the cared-for person's package. The subsection deals with the opposite situation to that dealt with under clause 1(2), whereby a local authority, when it considers it to be material, can take into account an assessment a carer had under the 1995 Act when assessing the carer's need for services in his own right under the Bill.

<P>
Subsections (2) and (3) deal with a different situation. They set out various assessment scenarios when the local authority has identified a need that could be met by delivering either a service to the carer under the Bill or a community care service to the cared-for person. For example, a laundry service or other domestic support could equally meet the test of helping the carer in his caring role or be delivered under community care legislation to the cared-for person. Under subsection (4), the authority must decide in each case whether it is providing a service to support the carer's needs under the Bill or a community care service for the cared-for person.

<P>
As I said in our debate on the amendment of the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam, the Minister intends to reflect on the issue to ensure that people's needs are assessed before their financial means are considered. I therefore hope that the clause stands part of the Bill.

<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<H4><center>Direct payments</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Pendry:</B> The clause enables local authorities to offer cash payments as an alternative to arranging social care services to meet people's assessed support needs. Direct payments offer more choice and flexibility in the timing and delivery of services and must be used to meet their assessed needs for social services support. The Government do not want to burden 16 and 17-year-old carers with inappropriate caring responsibilities. Local authorities would offer direct payments to young carers only after giving full consideration to the interests of the child and ensuring that those would best be met by a direct payment. I commend the clause to the Committee.

<P>
<B>Mrs Virginia Bottomley: The hon. Member for Stalybridge and Hyde makes the matter sound relatively straightforward. I repeat that it is not straightforward at all. I believe that it is the right way forward but will lead to disputes and difficulties and to extra pressure on advocacy schemes. Providing vouchers is simpler than providing direct payments, particularly for young individuals whose disability may throw into question their ability to deal with the scheme. Such comments always sound patronising and paternalistic, but we need to be realistic.</B><P>

<B>Mrs Spelman:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 15, in page 4, line 1, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`, save that where the child is being cared for by a parent the child shall only fall within this subsection where that parent gives consent in writing.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
We tabled the amendment because it links closely to the situation described by my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Surrey (Mrs Bottomley) who drew attention to the inter-generational conflict that can occur between parents and children of that age. To throw into relief the difficulty of facing the practical problems that the clause would create, I would like to read a case study supplied by the National Autistic Society, which highlights the kind of problems that may occur:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A young man with Asperger syndrome, for example, while normally depressed and dependent, was adept at convincing his social worker of his competence and ability to manage his life, while obscuring the level of dependence he had in reality on his carers. In this instance, this prevented effective assessment of his needs.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
One imagines that his carers, probably in the young man's case the parents, would very much have liked to have received help in dealing with the problems relating to his condition. However, a conflict could well ensue between 16 and 17-year-olds and parents in that respect. We also feel strongly that someone of 16 or 17 is still a child.

<P>
<B>Mr. Tom Clarke </B>(Coatbridge and Chryston): Having sat through the Children Act 1989 and other measures that may be relevant to the hon. Lady's argument, I would like to ask her to clarify who, if the amendment were accepted, would win the argument in the case of conflict between parents and 16 or 17-year-olds?

<P>
<B>Mrs Spelman:</B> From a previous clause, we know that the local authority must decide whether the service will be provided to the cared-for person or the carer. The Bill gives considerable power to the local authority, which is outside the family, to assess the family needs. That must be done by objective means when the cared-for person cannot articulate what his needs are.

<P>
<B>Mr. Tom Clarke:</B> The hon. Lady is making an interesting case. Does she realise that not regarding the rights of the child as paramount would tear apart the thrust of the Children Act 1989? That would be a new dimension.

<P>
<B>Mrs Spelman:</B> Parents have rights that must be balanced, too. Parents of a child with Asperger's syndrome bear a considerable caring load from when the child is at an early age. When children reach teenage years, inter-generational conflict can set in whether they have a difficult syndrome or not.

<P>
<B>Mrs Virginia Bottomley:</B> Surely the point about the 1989 Act is that the welfare of the child may be paramount, but it would be unwise to suggest that the child's judgment of its welfare was the principle on which to work. It is ensured that the judgment of what is in the child's welfare is made by someone else.

<P>
<B>Mrs Spelman:</B> I thank my right hon. Friend for that intervention. She has a great deal more experience on the matter than I do; I dread my children reaching their teenage years. She makes the point that when a family struggles, in the extreme situation of one of its members being a cared-for person with considerable needs, it often takes an objective outside assessment of the needs to get the balance right. Within that, it is important that the parental responsibility is accounted for. Although we applaud the efforts to give disabled children as much independence as possible, we believe that parental consent would help to reinforce parental responsibility and family cohesiveness. That is integral to ensuring that the Bill properly provides and balances the needs of the cared-for person and his carers.

<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I do not want to speak for long, but I want to raise a subject that was discussed at a meeting of the all-party disablement group yesterday evening. We had several presentations, one of which was from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. It presented some work on supporting disabled children and their families, and some of its findings were disturbing.

<P>
The amendment would tip the balance about vouchers and direct payments so that the parent's consent would be paramount. I understand that it is difficult to manage the transition through adolescence to adulthood when a person has had complex multiple disabilities and the carer has had the related burdens—or rather, responsibilities—for many years. It is in that context that I wanted to mention the report.

<P>
The presentation referred to the aspirations of many families in such circumstances. They want flexible support that can respond to emergencies and accommodate their lives, and planned services that provide some certainty. The Government have encouraged local authorities increasingly to provide services such as short-term break services and community-based services, especially for children with complex needs.
<P>

<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
The presentation also referred to direct payments, especially for disabled adolescents, to which the amendment relates, and to the importance of personal assistant support schemes that empower families to enable their child to become more independent. Although the Children Act 1989 requires social services authorities to find out the wishes of the disabled child, that is not often the practice, especially in cases involving multiple impairments, communication difficulties or Asperger's syndrome. However, techniques are available, if used by the right practitioners, to penetrate such communication barriers. The amendment might get in the way of encouraging good practice in social services departments to enable families to take advantage of direct payments for their children so that their children can grow and gain independence as far as possible in the context of their disabilities. What additional support, encouragement and guidance will be given to local authorities in this complex and delicate area of family relations? Although the amendment relates to an understandable anxiety, having heard the presentation at the all-party group yesterday, I am not sure that the amendment would be appropriate in allowing disabled people to become more independent.

<P>

<B>Mr. Pendry:</B> As the Committee has heard, the amendment touches on an extremely sensitive area. The amendment would prevent disabled young people from receiving a direct payment without the written consent of their parents. It proposes determining through primary legislation the sensitive balance between parents' rights and responsibilities and those of young people as they move towards adulthood.

<P>
As hon. Members will be aware, the progress of young people through their teenage years is sometimes tense and often stormy, with battles about who will have the final word in, for example, education, choice of friends and driving lessons. I can think of endless examples of friction. If the young person has an impairment or disability, that progress is often even more difficult. Indeed, it is not unusual for parents of 16 or 17-year olds to hold different views about the best rate of progress towards independent decision making.

<P>
The amendment would provide that parents should determine matters for 16 and 17-year-olds, in direct opposition to the Department of Health's policy for that age group, as specified in the Children Act 1989. I can envisage circumstances in which it would be right for a young person to receive a direct payment regardless of whether the parents agreed. For example, a young person with a physical impairment may move away from home to go to college, and may want to engage a personal assistant to help him get ready for college in the mornings, rather than rely on the local authority's home help service.

<P>
Existing Department of Health guidance states that services are intended
 <P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>to assist the parent and enhance, not undermine, the parent's authority and control.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The guidance goes on to discuss the need to allow older children and young people opportunities to participate in decision making. However it warns against making blanket assumptions about certain categories of disabled young people not being able to make good use of those opportunities.

<P>
On Second Reading, the hon. Members for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond) and for Poole (Mr Syms) stressed the need for clear policy guidance on that, and I agree with them. If the Bill receives Royal Assent, the existing guidance will provide a framework for new guidance based on the provisions of the Bill. I am assured that that guidance on policy and practice will be the subject of consultation with interested voluntary organisations, including those representing disabled children and young people and their parents. I want to ensure that a sensitive balance is struck between parents' rights and the rights of young people as they move towards full adulthood.

<P>
In the light of those comments, I hope that the Committee will accept that the best way to tackle the sensitive matter of balancing the views of parents and young people will be considered at great length, following consultation with all interested parties. I therefore hope that the hon. Member for Meriden will withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mrs Spelman:</B> I am not entirely convinced that that is the right way of dealing with the matter. Probably only time will tell. When consulting those organisations, I urge the Government to pay particular attention to the practical experience of parent carers with disabled children of that age. Fortunately, those of us in the Committee who have children do not face the particular difficulties that those other parents face. We would do well to learn from their experience. It is difficult enough being a parent of an able-bodied child of that age. I have a residual anxiety that the provision will undermine parental influence, and I am reluctant to see that happen.

<P>
The advice and practical experience that is shared with the Government during the consultation is vital in influencing the form that the guidance will take. Those who are listening to our debates and those who read then in Hansard should know that this is their opportunity to feed in their practical experience. I gave the example from the National Autistic Society, and I suspect that many others may wish to comment and help the Government to get the balance right. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Pendry:</B> The extension of direct payments to parent carers of young disabled people aged between 16 and 17 is welcomed by carers' organisations and voluntary organisations for children. I am aware that parents like to have as much freedom as possible when making arrangements for the care of their disabled children. The clause will give them far greater choice.

<P>
Clause 
<P>
<H5>6 amends part III of the Children Act 1989 to allow direct payments to be made. The clause therefore ensures that the legislative framework to promote and safeguard the welfare of children will still apply when parents choose direct payments.</H5>
</P>

<P>
Through guidance, the Department of Health can make clear how parents using direct payments can satisfy themselves that the person offering to help with the care of their child is suitable. As we heard on Second Reading, the Government intend to legislate as soon as possible to ensure that local authorities have the power to undertake criminal record checks on behalf of parents using direct payments to employ someone to care for their child.

<P>
Local authorities will offer direct payments to young disabled people aged between 16 and 17 if, after full consideration, they conclude that it would serve the best interests of the child. Direct payments will be particularly helpful to young disabled people leaving home—for example, to enter further or higher education, or perhaps to enjoy a more independent life style. Again, the word freedom comes to mind. That freedom will be manifest within the framework of the guidance given by the Department to local authorities.

<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take new clause 1—

<P>
Charging—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(1) Where a local authority provide any service under section 2, other than advice, guidance or counselling, they may recover from the carer to whom the service is provided such charge for the service as they consider reasonable.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(2) Where the authority are satisfied that the person's means are insufficient for it to be reasonably practicable for him to pay the charge, they shall not require him to pay more than he can reasonably be expected to pay.

(3) No person shall be liable to pay any charge under section (1) at any time when he is in receipt of income support, income-based jobseeker's allowance, working families tax credit or disabled person's tax credit.

<P>
(4) Any charge under subsection (1) may, without prejudice to any other method of recovery, be recovered as a civil debt.'.

<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I apologise to the hon. Member for Stalybridge and Hyde for daring to table a new clause to supersede his clause, because the Bill is admirable and deserves to become an Act of Parliament. However, the new clause is intended further to clarify the issues around charging policy. Perhaps our debate will illuminate the matter a little and reassure me and other people who are not members of the Committee.

<P>
Charging is an ever-present part of social care these days. That is not surprising, given that the standard spending assessment assumes that anything between 9 per cent. and 12 per cent. of domiciliary care budgets is met by charging. The Minister mentioned the figure of £250 million as the sort of income derived through charging policies. Clause 7 would widen the scope for charging. There is a pressing need for action. The Government's intention to present a new, fair charging policy setting out an operating framework for local authorities is welcome. The framework will exist in the context of what has been learned from the work of the royal commission on long-term care and the still-awaited findings of the Audit Commission. I should not think that there could be any dispute about the Government's aims on charging—that it should be fair, equitable and transparent.

<P>
New clause 1 would ensure that carers were not charged for services that are now free and would exclude carers who were on means-tested benefits from charging. It would not prejudge or pre-empt the outcome of the Government review already alluded to by the Minister, but would maintain the status quo pending the review. Subsection (1) would ensure that key services that are currently free remained so. It would not, however, preclude charging in all circumstances and is worded so as to permit the possibility of charging for newly-introduced services. Subsection (2) would reinforce principles already set out in the Health and Social Services and Social Security Adjudications Act 1983—there must be a way of abbreviating that title.

<P>
Subsection (3) would ensure that carers in receipt of certain means-tested benefits or tax measures would not be charged. There are precedents for that, the first of which is found in the 1983 Act, which established local authorities' power to charge for some social care services. During the passage of that Bill in 1982 it was stated that local authorities would, as steadily as circumstances allowed, move towards the elimination of charges to those on supplementary benefit. That aspiration of a previous Government has not yet been fully realised. The second precedent is from the Children Act 1989, which provides that parent carers on certain benefits should not be charged.

<P>
Subsection (4) of the new clause is a straightforward transfer or mirroring of provisions in section 17(4) of the Health and Social Services and Social Security Adjudications Act 1983.

<P>
In our debate on 8 March, the Minister said that the Government would table amendments on Report. That is welcome. The new clause highlights the concerns of organisations outside the Committee, which were shared by many hon. Members on Second Reading. Clarification is needed. It would be wrong to introduce charges for services that are currently free, such as information, counselling and advice services in carer centres that are paid for by local authorities.

<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>

<P>
A cash-strapped local authority might review its criteria to recoup some of the costs of services from carers. Given the savings that a local authority makes by enabling a person to continue to care, that is a false economy, but local authorities are sometimes forced into making false economies for short-term reasons. We need to ensure that we do not provide that temptation. Some people who receive income support are being charged, especially if they do not receive disability benefits such as the disability living allowance. Some local authorities have introduced charging policies to take that into account.

<P>
For those reasons, we decided to table the new clause. I look forward to hearing how the hon. Member for Stalybridge and Hyde and the Minister intend to tackle our concerns.

<P>

<B>Mr. Pendry:</B> The hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam must not apologise for new clause 1. I hope that the Minister will help both of us when he responds because I, too, had reservations about this measure. The purpose of the new clause is to mirror the charging policy in the Children Act 1989 for carer services. However, charges for carer services are dealt with in clause 7, which amends section 17 of the Health and Social Services and Social Security Adjudications Act 1983.

<P>
The new clause would use a different regime to levy charges for carers of adults from that used by councils in setting charges for community care service users. The Minister said that the Government believed that any charging policy for services for carers and services for those who are cared for should be consistent. The Department of Health is considering ways to reduce the inequities and variations between local authorities' charging policies. Consultation will take account of the Audit Commission report.

<P>
Finally, discussions with the Department convinced me to continue with this aspect of the Bill. A private Member's Bill is not a suitable vehicle to change Government charging policy. For those reasons, and with some reservations, I ask the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam not to press the new clause.

<P>
<B>Mrs Spelman:</B> This is the most problematic part of the Bill. It worries the Carers National Association more than any other proposal. At the risk of indulging in hyperbole, I am tempted to say that we might be allowing a stealth tax on carers to creep in. The new clause speaks into the vacuum. The Government have promised to put everything right, but because clause 7 is so important, it is difficult to let it pass without emphasising the problems. We do not want to give the impression to the wider world that we do not recognise the inherent dangers.

<P>
Standing back from the signals that the Bill sends out, we were keen at the outset to applaud carers who, through their good will and effort, contribute about £34 billion of care, yet the Government seem to be sending out a mixed signal by proposing to recover money from them in this way. Unless the Government are careful, introducing charges for the first time might discourage some carers from taking up services. If we consider the situation from the perspective of carers, who give so much time and effort for free, the charges might deter people from seeking the help that they have been assessed as needing.

<P>
The hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam made a valiant effort to speak into the vacuum, but I remain concerned that in trying to say what will happen with respect to charging, the new clause, especially subsection (1), raises some difficult questions. For example, what charges will be considered reasonable? Without any definition, that will be a subjective decision on the part of the local authority. Although I would have difficulty supporting the new clause, I understand that its aspiration is to provide protection for carers, especially those on limited means. In the absence of any details about what the Government will do in this respect, I register my considerable concern that the provision dilutes the signal that the Bill attempts to send to carers, without whom the state would face a considerable bill, as we have already acknowledged.

<P>
<B>Mrs Virginia Bottomley:</B> The clause is highly problematic. I hope that the Government will think again when Baroness Pitkeathley takes up the cause in another place. I have been considering the comments of Diana Whitworth, the new chief executive of the Carers National Association who took over from Baroness Pitkeathley. She says,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Our CarersLine  inundated with calls  from carers who feel undervalued, unsupported and isolated, and who struggle to make ends meet.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
To establish a precedent that carers may be charged for services will do nothing other than compound their difficulties. I have spoken at length to Mr. Leahy at the Parkinson's Disease Society in my constituency, to the leaders of the Carers National Association and to the carers support group. The Minister is aware that the high cost of living in my constituency means that the cost of care is enormous. If carers want any informal respite, they must pay £7 an hour for support at home. People who live in constituencies such as the Minister's do not properly appreciate the sort of sums that carers elsewhere can incur. In addition, carers find that they are hit by the earlier changes to pension contributions, as well as stealth taxes on petrol, which my hon. Friend the Member for Meriden has already mentioned. They find increased costs everywhere and if they are now told that they will be charged for services, I believe that the news will be extremly badly received. The group of carers who do not come within the provisions of the new clause will be worst hit. Frequently, those who are eligible for benefits find that they have a passport to a range of services, but those whose earnings are just above that level are comprehensively clobbered. As the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam will know from discussions with the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) and others, means-testing has serious implications and particular groups often pay the penalty.

<P>
I move on to the comments of Mencap. Many of us are delighted that Brian Baldock has recently taken over as chairman of Mencap and are aware of the excellent job that Lord Rix did in that job for many years. I hope that the Minister will accept Mencap's comments; I was not quite able to fathom whether its view was implicit in the remarks of the hon. Member for Stalybridge and Hyde. Mencap stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Mencap believes that government should have a duty to support carers of people with a learning disability, who are often devoting their lives to supporting others for no financial reward.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We see such carers time and again. They have often compromised their life chances and their opportunity for leisure and pleasure activities away from home. They do so lovingly and, extraordinarily, without resentment. Mencap went on to state:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>If local authorities do charge for services, then charges should be levied against the person who is cared for, on the basis of their income, not on the basis of the financial circumstances of the carer.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
Establishing the precedent of charging carers should be carefully considered, as it may be a very unwise move. If such charging is considered appropriate, it would be wrong to make it on the basis of the carer's income rather than that of the person who is cared for. Will the Minister respond to those points?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I shall try to respond to some of the important points that have been made. I do so in the knowledge that I have dealt with many of the concerns expressed on several other occasions during the passage of the Bill, both on the Floor of the House and in Committee.

<P>
We must be clear about one or two basic issues that Opposition Members did not raise. The position is clear: current legislation does not allow for the direct provision of a service to meet carers' needs. Service comes via the carer to the person who is being cared for, and it is that which we are changing. The Bill changes the law to allow carers' own needs to be directly assessed and provided in their own right. That is why we are discussing charging, an issue that has not arisen in the past. The right hon. Member for South-West Surrey will know that, as she was Secretary of State for Health with responsibility for such matters for many years.

<P>
The issue of charging has not previously arisen because the cared-for person currently bears the burden of the charging regime. That issue must be addressed; I accept that it is complex and that it involves some difficult politics. I do not think, however, that it is entirely honest for hon. Members who had direct ministerial responsibility for the social services charging regime to pop up and say that it is terrible for anyone to be charged. We are not naive. Hon. Members have to make some difficult choices, and the right hon. Lady herself had to make such choices when, as Secretary of State for Health, she was responsible for operating the charging regime for all of social services.

<P>
Let us try to keep a sense of balance and of context about the nature and origins of the charging regime. We did not invent the regime in 1997—it has been an aspect of social services for more than 50 years. We are trying for the first time to restore some equity, fairness and balance in the charging regime that we inherited when we came into office in 1997; I think that we are the first Government to make a proper effort to try to create such a regime. All hon. Members will accept that the current regime produces too much variation in charging. That is the legacy that was bequeathed to us by the right hon. Lady and her hon. Friends, and no Labour Members doubt our determination to sort out that mess. Hon. Members should understand that that is the basis of our argument. We are determined to enhance carers' assessments and to allow them to receive services in their own right, which no other Government have done, and we are determined to tackle inequity in the charging regime.

<P>
Sadly, I cannot say much more than I have already said about when or how we are going to do this. It will depend on the result of our spending review and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State's announcement on 2 December on the time scale for responding to the royal commission's recommendations. It is crucial that we should not lose sight of that history; this is the first time that it has been discussed. We should not lose sight of the Government's determination, repeatedly demonstrated and articulated on a number of occasions by Ministers, to put a sense of balance and fairness back into the charging regime that it does not have now.
<P>

<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
We must be honest about the fact that there are no quick fixes. However, the Bill is a substantial enhancement of rights and opportunities for carers. My hon. Friend the Member for Stalybridge and Hyde should not feel concerned; the legislation is progressive, significant and forward-looking. It responds to the needs of carers and it has been widely welcomed by them. All those issues are being addressed by the Government. We have made clear our priorities and how we intend to proceed.

<P>
The hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam asked when the Audit Commission report on charging for domiciliary services would be available. I understand that it will be published in April. We shall have to consider its recommendations. I assure the Committee that the Government are conscious of the arguments put forward on that aspect of the Bill. We want all groups to be treated equally and fairly and we want to improve the charging regime. However, we do not want it to discriminate against groups who need community care services, which would be the effect of new clause 1. We should avoid charging one group of people and not another. At least, in new clause 1, the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam recognises the possibility of reasonable charging, which is what we want to develop. However, setting up a regime that discriminates against one group would be wrong. It would be a bad start to the reforms that we want to make to the charging regime.

<P>
I accept that much needs to be done, but the Committee should not doubt the Government's determination to press ahead and find an acceptable solution that commands the broadest consensus.

<P>

<B>Mrs Virginia Bottomley:</B> The Minister has made some important comments. One of the tasks of the Committee is to consider carefully whether we are establishing a precedent that might have unintended consequences. Under previous community care legislation, a commitment was given to local authorities that money to help them support residential homes would be ring-fenced. When the Government came to power, they removed that ring-fenced money overnight. The price being paid in my area is the closure of a growing number of residential homes for older people. There has been an outcry among local people, because many of those homes were highly respected.

<P>
The Minister talks about establishing a precedent and suggests that we should trust the Government to use that precedent responsibly. He keeps talking about fairness and equality, but I have repeatedly made it clear that people on extremely modest incomes who live in an area where domiciliary help costs £6 an hour have difficulty surviving. They are already paying the price of all sorts of other Government measures that are just beginning to hit them. Last week an 82-year-old man came to see me—

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I hesitate to interrupt the right hon. Lady, but I am conscious of the need not to repeat arguments that have already been put forward. I am sure that she will understand.

<P>
<B>Mrs Bottomley:</B> I shall complete my remarks swiftly, Mr. Stevenson.

<P>
The Minister made several provocative comments. I simply wish to respond. The Committee needs to be confident that, if a precedent is established, it will not be used in a way that is destructive to the interests of carers. I have great reservations about that.

<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I share some of the anxieties that the right hon. Member for South-West Surrey expressed. The hon. Member for Meriden got it right when she said that we are talking into a vacuum. It is partly of the Government's making. The review process has been lengthy because it has been tied up with the royal commission, the comprehensive spending review and the Audit Commission report. The interrelation of those has denied us clarity at a key legislative time. As the right hon. Member for South-West Surrey said, the Bill will make a fundamental change to the law, which the Minister acknowledged. We hope that the change will be beneficial, but we should explore the possible down sides to reassure ourselves that they will not become a reality.

<P>
It is fair to say that instead of supporting carers so that they can care for longer, the clause could be the straw that breaks the camel's back. It could trigger someone into saying, ``That's it. I've had enough. I'm going to make other arrangements for care that do not involve me.'' That decision would be more expensive for society and less beneficial for the disabled person who is receiving the care. That is a genuine anxiety.

<P>
I take the point that the right hon. Member for South-West Surrey made about the drafting of the new clause. I accept that the Carers National Association, which did a good job in supplying the words, is not parliamentary counsel. It is always possible to find problems with the precise language of legislation. She was right to say that it does not cover those people who are just on the other side of the means test. I get many visits from constituents who, as the carer in the family, are victims of existing charging policies. Their families pay a great price, especially those at the heavy end of care.

<P>
I mentioned last night's presentation to the all-party group on disabled children and their carers. It costs a family that brings up a disabled child £99.15 a month—that might even have been the weekly figure—over and above what it would cost to raise a non-disabled child. The extra cost is not fully met, by any stretch of the imagination, by disability living allowance or any other aspect of the social security system. When we start to levy additional charges on carers, we must be mindful of the fact that they already shoulder substantial financial burdens. If that is not recognised in the Bill or by the Department of Health, it should be born in mind by the Department of Social Security.

<P>
The Minister explained why he cannot reassure us. On 8 March, he rightly said that the Government would table amendments on Report, but because they are still in the review process and unable to elaborate on their intentions, we cannot be reassured. We need to wait. In that context, it makes no sense to press the new clause. Its sole purpose is to explore, cajole and pursue important matters.

<H4><center>Minor and consequential amendments</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Pendry:</B> The clause is a technical one amending schedule 1 to the Local Authority Social Services Act 1970. It inserts a reference to the Bill in the entry relating to the Community Care (Direct Payments) Act 1996. The effect is that the local authority functions under the 1996 Act, as amended by the Bill, and the new local authority functions conferred by the Bill are social services functions.

<P>

<P>
Clause 8 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<H4><center>Clause 9</center></H4>
<H4><center>Financial provision</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> This question is probably more for the Minister than for the hon. Member for Stalybridge and Hyde. The Association of Directors of Social Services expressed the view, in its representations, that to give effect to the Bill it would be necessary to think about how to improve resourcing for social services departments. I welcome the carers' grant of £140 million, which is being paid over three years. It will be increased in the coming year and the year after. However, the directors of social services want to know what further consideration the Government are giving to the likely financial consequences. The presence of a money clause in the Bill shows that the Government recognise that there are potential financial consequences. Extending rights as the Bill does and giving carers separate standing in the care assessment process will have cost consequences that cannot and should not all be met through additional charging. There should also be additional income for local authorities.

<P>
Do the Government plan to increase the carers' grant in the comprehensive spending review? Is there any intention to review the adequacy of the standard spending assessments to reflect this matter?

<P>
<B>Mrs Spelman:</B> The Local Government Association is also anxious about this matter and makes the point that the carers' grant is already committed. The new duty of making assessments that the Bill will impose on local authorities will have to be paid for by some other means. I share the concern of the Local Government Association that there should be adequate provision to fulfil the expectations that will be raised about assessments. The Association of Directors of Social Services points out that 10 per cent. of eligible carers receive a care assessment at present—a quite low level. The legislative situation is changing, bringing the focus on to carers. We do not want the whole exercise to become meaningless because of a lack of money for proper assessments. We want people to benefit in practice.

<P>
<B>Mr. Pendry:</B> The clause is an essential safeguard against the possibility of increased charges being incurred by local authorities because of the Bill. The new functions conferred on local authorities have the potential to increase local authority expenditure. A new approach is also taken to social services by focusing on the important contribution made by carers and how social services may support them in their caring role and help them to maintain their health and well-being. I am sure that the Minister will detail the new money allocated by the Government to social services since 1997. However, I am assured that giving local authorities power to innovate in how they help people to continue to live in the community by supporting those who care for them need not cost money. I am sure that the Minister will also assure the Committee of that.

<P>
The new power to assess carers when the cared-for person has refused a community care assessment will allow the local authority to support that caring relationship and it will be cheaper than a residential home placement in the event that the caring relationship breaks down because the carer remains unsupported. The Bill gives local authorities the freedom to innovate in the delivery of support for carers. It does not demand that they spend more money but offers them the opportunity to spend more wisely. The clause contains an important provision and should stand part of the Bill.
<P>

<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> The hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam asked me to see if I could catch your eye, Mr. Stevenson, which I do not seem to have any problem doing. I shall not quote a long list of figures, tempting though that it is, but there has been some misunderstanding. Some Committee members seem to think that the only resource available to support extra services for carers is the £140 million carers' special grant, but that is not the case. The standard spending assessment for personal social serviaces has increased this year by twice the rate of inflation—a real-terms increase of 3.1 per cent. Additional specific resources are available to local authorities, particularly to help parent carers under the ``Quality Protects'' grant, which amounts to £375 million over the next three years, of which only £75 million has been spent. A further £300 million remains unallocated. The hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam said that some of those resources had already been committed, but that is untrue of the third year of the ``Quality Protects'' grant, which will be a substantial resource for local authorities.

<P>
We are making additional resources available, both through the increase in standard spending assessments and in specific new ring-fenced grants to local authorities to support additional expenditure that might be incurred as a result of the Bill.

<P>

<B>Mrs Spelman:</B> It is kind of the Minister to allow me to intervene on this point. Perhaps he can help me. If a local authority is ordered to increase its social services spending by 5 per cent., but it receives an increase of only 3 per cent. in its central Government grant, will not social services departments still be forced to beg, steal and borrow from everywhere else to meet the rising costs of the care that they are required to provide?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I do not know to which local authority the hon. Lady is referring. If it is to her local authority, I shall have to consider the relevant information. I quoted general figures. Some authorities will receive significantly larger increases than average—that is the nature of arithmetic. I am not a genius, but some authorities will receive more than the average and some less. I am trying to give as fair a picture as I can of the resources available to local authorities to support services for carers. Clause 9 will allow the transfer of moeny that has been allocated for other social services purposes within the existing personal social services settlement to be spent on the new functions conferred on local authorities by the Bill. That is another reason why the clause should stand part of the Bill.

<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Stalybridge and Hyde gave a fair and accurate description of what the Bill does and why clause 9 is important. One of the Bill's most important functions is to expand the range of carers who may benefit from the services provided by local authorities, especially those who care for a disabled person who has refused a community care assessment. There is no way of knowing precisely how many people will be involved, which is why we cannot be precise about the additional expenditure that local authorities will incur. However, clause 9 gives authorities the necessary legal protection to incur that additional expenditure within the expanding resources that are available for social services. The hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam asked what would happen in the next spending review. I am sure that he understands that I cannot make any announcements about the spending review; that will be done by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State at the appropriate time. As I have told carers' organisations many times, we are making a start on improving services for carers. There is no going back to previous circumstances, in which no ring-fenced resources were available specifically for carers. In 19 years of Conservative Government, there were never any ring-fenced resources for carers, but there are now. That is a significant achievement, which I know is welcomed by carers' organisations. We are making progress now and I anticipate making further progress in future years.

<P>
All Chairmen of Standing Committees are doubtless familiar with the view of the Opposition that too much in Government legislation is left to negative resolution procedure. The amendment is standard and is intendend to create less empty box legislation—a phrase used in our earlier debates. We are increasingly being asked to accept an empty box with the promise that the guidance and regulations will paper over all the difficulties that are highlighted in Committee. We have to rely on the reported statements of the Government in Standing Committees as a declaration of what they intend to fill the box with. By referring to another place, the amendment would also validate the role of the reformed upper House.

<P>
<B>Mr. Pendry:</B> I am assured that the amendment would mean that regulations made under the Bill would go through the affirmative rather than the negative procedure. The Department believes that the amendment is unnecessary and that employing the affirmative procedure would not be a good use of parliamentary time. The Department will consult widely about the regulations, which can, if necessary, be prayed against in the usual way. I hope that the Committee will reject the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mrs Spelman:</B> I notice the hon. Gentleman stepped round my reference to the reformed upper House, which may have been a touch too provocative. As a relatively new parliamentarian, I find the negative resolution procedure difficult to tackle and understand. It relies on the quick-wittedness of the Opposition to spot the occasions on which the praying can taken place. I have been wrong-footed by the fact that periods when the upper House is sitting but our own House is not count towards the time during which it is possible to pray against a measure. That means that we could return to this place after a break during which members of the other place had been about their business and discover that we had missed the boat. The procedure remains inscrutable, but I received the anticipated reply and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

Question propsed,That the clause stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I shall be brief. I hope that the clause stands part of the Bill. It is the last clause, so I wish to ask about commencement, which I hope will be as quick as possible. Will the Minister give an estimate of the likely timing?

<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> It is not this clause.

<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> It appears that I am out of order, so I shall sit down.

<P>

<P>

<H4><center>Clause 11</center></H4>
<H4><center>Short title, commencement and extent</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I apologise for my earlier enthusiasm.
 I want to raise a matter that relates to the commencement. Members of the Committee played an active part in trying to improve the Bill and explore the issues that it raised; we want to speed it on its way to enactment. In that context, I refer to a survey published yesterday by the St. John Ambulance brigade, which inspires me to believe that the Bill should commence as soon as possible. The survey found that the number of carers experiencing health problems increased in the past two or three years. That is not surprising, but I was surprised that the number of people who experience stress and back pain increased from one in five in 1997 to one in three today. In 1997, one third of carers reported chronic problems such as back pain and other serious health problems; now, half the people in the survey have chronic problems. The survey was on a fairly small scale: 1,000 people were telephoned and only 40 carers were interviewed, so one cannot draw many conclusions, but it is indicative of the problems that carers face. For that and other reasons we should welcome the Bill, which will put in place the mechanisms necessary to tackle the problems.

<P>
Will the Minister or the hon. Member for Stalybridge and Hyde say when the commencement orders that give effect to the measure will be issued? Local authorities will need that information in order to make preparations to implement the Bill, which could be overtaken by events. We debated charging policies in earlier clauses; in July, the Government will state their views about charging, and it is possible that the two matters will overlap. Timing is of the essence.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> The hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam will not be surprised that I do not know the commencement date of the proposal. He asked me whether it was our intention to implement it as soon as possible; the answer to that question is yes, of course. I reassure him that the Bill will not be overtaken by events in the summer; far from it. Those events will complement and enhance the measure. We are serious about improving the range and quality of services to disabled people and their carers. That will become clear later in the year.

<P>
The commencement issue is complicated by the fact that the Secretary of State for Health will decide the commencement of the provisions in England, but I understand that that responsibility in Wales will be exercised by the National Assembly for Wales. That is a consequence of devolution; the hon. Member for Meriden does not like it, but that is decentralisation for you!

<P>
I assure my hon. Friend the Member for Stalybridge and Hyde and other members of the Committee that we want the Bill to go live as soon as possible—the sooner the better—because it will benefit carers and disabled children especially.

<P>
<B>Mr. Pendry:</B> As this is the last clause, I hope that you will allow me to thank you for presiding over the Committee so well Mr. Stevenson. Every member of the Committee who spoke contributed to the speed with which the Committee proceeded; those who remained silent, of course, also contributed in that respect.

<P>
I thank the hon. Member for Meriden, who took on her role at the last minute. Her contributions were very constructive; she served her party well. I hope that we responded equally well to her comments.

<P>
The clause sets out the short title of the Bill, makes provision for its coming into force and states that, when enacted, it will apply only to England and Wales. I hope that the Committee agrees that the clause should stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mrs Spelman:</B> I am not sure whether I should thank you now, Mr. Stevenson, for your chairmanship. I do not want to miss the opportunity to do so.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> There will be a further question.

<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<P>
Clause 11 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<P>
Question proposed, That the Chairman do report the Bill to the House.

<P>
<B>Mrs Spelman:</B> I shall now thank you for your chairmanship of the Committee, Mr. Stevenson, and the forbearance that you have shown to a relatively inexperienced Front-Bench spokesman. I hope that you have enjoyed the constructive atmosphere in which the Bill has been discussed. We want to give carers in our society real assistance and we have sought to amend the Bill so that it will be even better for them.

<P>
I have much appreciated the spirit in which the hon. Member for Stalybridge and Hyde has conducted his role in Committee and the assistance that I have received from my hon. Friends. I hope that we have set a good precedent in the way in which, even in a constructive and consensual atmosphere, we have achieved agreement from the Government.

<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<P>
Bill to be reported, without amendment.
