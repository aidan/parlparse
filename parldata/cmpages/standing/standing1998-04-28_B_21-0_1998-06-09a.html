<P>
Government amendment No. 423.
<P>
<B>Mr. Humfrey Malins (Woking):</B> Before the luncheon break, I ran through the names of those of my hon. Friends who had tabled the new clause. I should add that my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey Heath(Mr. Hawkins), who has made some valuable contributions to our debates, also supports the clause. He is especially worried, on behalf of his constituents, about the matters that we are discussing and takes a real interest in our debates.
<P>
New clause 10, which was tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown), deserves the closest possible consideration. To whom does the clause refer? Hunt saboteurs come to mind, but the provisions are not limited only to them. The clause would apply to violent demonstrators, perhaps violent animal rights activists, indeed anyone who disguises him or herself to hamper the proper investigation of a potential criminal offence.
<P>
The police need the wide powers proposed in the clause. It is important to be able to identify miscreants or potential criminals. Those who disguise themselves are behaving in a cowardly fashion and that problem must be addressed.
<P>
The police sometimes feel frustrated in their attempts to deal with hunt saboteurs. My hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold, whose interest in that subject is well known throughout the House, has told me of his helpful discussions with Mr. Turnbull and Mr. Todd, who were, I believe, successive deputy chief constables of Gloucestershire. They told my hon. Friend that the powers set out in the clause would be useful to the police in their attempts to redress the balance by ensuring that those who disguise themselves to commit offences can be properly identified. Such people would be required to remove the article of clothing that disguised them.
<P>
I am glad that the Government have recognised the problems of disguise by introducing new clause 21. However, our new clause is preferable because the constable needs only reasonably to suspect the commission of an offence under
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"sections 1,2, 3 or 4 of the Public Order Act 1986"	.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Committee discussed those sections at some length during an earlier sitting. They cover the type of behaviour that is so much to be deprecated and must be challenged: behaviour such as riot, violent disorder, affray and
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"using...threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour, or distributing or displaying...any writing, sign or other visible representation which is threatening, abusive or insulting"	.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Government's provisions are too narrow because the police cannot require the removal of an article of clothing for identification purposes unless they reasonably believe that there will be incidents involving serious violence. That is a high test for the police to apply and they would be able to do so less frequently under Government new clause 23 than under Opposition new clause 10.
<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Allan (Sheffield, Hallam):</B> Liberal Democrat Members give a general welcome to the new clause, because we are pleased that its powers are being incorporated with the existing powers to stop and search in anticipation of violence. The new clause does not create new wide-ranging powers, but expands on those that already exist.
<P>
We are also pleased by the levels of control that will be in place and by the fact that only certain officerswill be able to order the removal of items of clothing. If such actions are mishandled, they could become a flashpoint. They will create incidents and not quieten down problems.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine (Sir R. Smith) has informed me that such decisions are not always straightforward. For example, the French police have had a heated debate about whether they can order Scottish fans to remove their woad. They have come to the conclusion that it is all right to order them to take off their tartan bonnets and their ginger wigs, but that the woad can stay.  [Hon. Members: "Hear, hear."	] The dress that may conceal one's identity may not be as straightforward as a black balaclava.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Mr. Mike O'Brien):</B> Is the hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine a secret woad wearer?
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> Yes, and a very public Scotland supporter.
<P>
The sort of dress involved may not be a simple black balaclava. Important decisions will therefore have to be made. We are pleased that the provision will be used only in specific circumstances and that there will be accountability to senior police officers, who will help to inform the decision. The provision is therefore likely to prevent further incidents. If it is mishandled, further incidents might arise out of disputes between unsupported constables and members of the community.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Eleanor Laing (Epping Forest):</B> When my hon. Friend the Member for Woking (Mr. Malins) and I tabled new clause 10, it was with the specific intention of giving the police powers to deal with several groups of people who have emerged in recent years of whom the Committee will be well aware.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> Scotland fans.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Laing:</B> I wish I could say that I have every confidence that Scotland fans whether they are in France, England or Scotland will not have to be dealt with by the police. I fear that I cannot express such confidence. However, as the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Allan) knows, I have confidence in the Scotland football team. I will not stray further from the points before us, and all this stuff about the Scottish football team will be over tomorrow. There will be no more of that. [Interruption.] Oh dear! I have provoked further discontent even though I promised not to stray further.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I take the hon. Lady to mean that any doubts about the Scotland football team's prowess will be dispelled tomorrow.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Laing:</B> Thank you, Mr. O'Hara, for rescuing me from a difficult position.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Woking and I were not concerned about football fans when we tabled new clause 10. We were thinking especially of hunt saboteurs and other groups who, in their arrogance, consider that they have a right to take direct action against those of whom they do not approve. They are arrogant because they believe that they are undeniably right and that they have a right to take the law into their own hands. Because they do not accept that what they are doing is wrong does not mean that we accept their view.
<P>
Why would law-abiding members of the public engaged in any activity wish to hide their identity if they are not doing something that is legally, criminally or morally wrong? I see that the hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine is thinking of an example.
<P>
<B>Sir Robert Smith (West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine):</B> Legislation should not deal with cases in which someone's identity is hidden as a side effect of a job. For example, people have to wear protective clothing if they work with dangerous chemicals. Someone on his way to work may be carrying equipment that could be construed as being designed to hide his face, but it could be essential safety equipment.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mrs. Laing:</B> I take the hon Gentleman's point. Some people work as beekeepers, and face coverings are necessary in certain occupations and professions. The Minister mentioned ladies of middle eastern origin who wear a yashmak or similar for religious reasons. New clause 10 was clearly not designed to have any effect on people who are lawfully going about their everyday activities, but why should anyone seek to hide his or her identity if they are not doing anything wrong?
<P>
Someone working as a beekeeper or using a pneumatic drill or carrying out some religious duties requiring the covering of the head and face is not primarily hiding his identity. That is a by-product of their action. New clause 10 goes further than new clauses 21 and 23 which the Government have now proposed. The Minister has given a good explanation about why they should be accepted but they do not have the same effect as we were attempting to achieve in new clause 10. They specifically deal with people who, it can be reasonably supposed might be about to engage in violent activity.
<P>
New clause 10 goes further because it says that they might be about to commit one of the following offences: riot, violent disorder, affray, or using towards another person threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour. That behaviour is less serious than the violent crimes outlined in new clauses 21 and 23. While I agree with what the Minister is attempting to do we ought to go further. New clause 10 also describes the activity of
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"distributing or displaying to another person any writing, sign or other visible representation which is threatening, abusive or insulting"	.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is a much weaker form of behaviour than being about to indulge in serious violent crime, but my hon. Friends and I seriously believe that police officers ought to be given the power to identify by the removal of the disguise anyone who is likely to indulge in the sort of behaviour outlined in the clause.
<P>
I appreciate that the use of
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour"	<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
is not anything like violent crime but that is the very point: the people whom we are hoping to target with the new clause are those who are guilty of civil disobedience, not just violent crime. It could be people who climb trees or occupy other people's roofs. I saw how men wearing balaclavas climbed onto the roof of the private London house of a Government Minister and the law was unable to deal with them. They were protesting about something. They had the right to protest; they had the right to come to Parliament and make their opinions known to the Minister. They had a right to ask their members of parliament to ask questions, and to stand in the Lobby and speak to Members of Parliament. However, they had no right to put on balaclavas, hide their identity, and climb on a Minister's roof
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> They might well have been Labour Back Benchers who were too frightened to admit their identity.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Lady does not need to respond to that.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Laing:</B> Thank you, Mr. O'Hara. As the people were wearing balaclavas, I cannot answer the question.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State For the Home Department (Mr. Mike O'Brien):</B> The hon. Lady described circumstances in which people disguised their identity and climbed a tree near a Minister's house.How would new clause 10 deal with that? Under new clause 10, an individual must be reasonably suspected of having committed, or being about to commit one of the offences that it outlines. Climbing a tree does not constitute such an offence.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Laing: It would constitute aggravated trespass.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Hawkins (Surrey Heath):</B> I think that the Minister failed to notice the words,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"or an offence of aggravated trespass within section 68 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994"	.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It may not be long before Labour Ministers are subject to such a threat to their private property. They may sing a different tune when their wives are harassed by balaclava-wearing protesters.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Laing:</B> I thank my hon. Friend for that helpful intervention.
<P>
Under new clause 10 the offence that a constable reasonably suspects a person of having committed or of being about to commit does not have to be serious or violent. It simply has to be an offence against public order, or involve using abusive or insulting words to another person. It has become fashionable in our country in the past few years for people to engage in such behaviour. They describe it as direct action and allege that it constitutes legitimate protest. However, legitimate protest means walking around Trafalgar square with a banner, or standing outside the House of Commons; it does not include concealing one's identity, climbing trees, making other people's lives difficult, and engaging in abusive and threatening behaviour.
<P>
New clause 10 attempts to give the police powers to identify people who are involved in the activities that I have described. People who are involved in a protest against an infrastructure or road project in one part of the country are often involved in a similar protest in another part of the country. I speak from personal experience;I have witnessed such behaviour. Because those people conceal their identity, they are treated as if they are harmless local protesters who protest peacefully in their own village or little town, yet they are trying to undermine the democratic system of our country. They are anarchists of a type; they believe in direct action. The police should be given powers to identify and deal with them because they are dangerous. New clauses 21 and 23 do not go far enough. New clause 10 does go far enough and I commend it to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Leigh (Gainsborough):</B> I look forward to the Under-Secretary's response to the arguments advanced by my hon. Friends. I am curious about the effects of the various new clauses, both those tabled by the Government and the one tabled by the Opposition. What type of behaviour are they designed to cover?I suspect that all hon. Members want to achieve the same results.
<P>
I was happy to support new clause 10 when my hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold asked me to do so. However, the Under-Secretary seems to suggest that the Opposition new clause is weaker than the Government new clauses. I am not sure how that can be. It is difficult to see how the Government new clauses relate to existing legislation, whereas the Opposition new clause is clear.
<P>
How will the Government and Opposition new clauses relate to particular types of behaviour? There are two types of behaviour that especially worry me. The first has already been alluded to and is that of people who want to stop new roads being built and who disrupt the lawful activity of contractors trying to go about their business.
<P>
The second type of behaviour is that of hunt saboteurs, which is of special interest in rural communities. The majority of the Committee might be opposed to hunting, and many Labour Members might have voted against its continuation. However, I am sure that they would accept that for the time being and, I hope, for a long time to come hunting is a perfectly lawful activity. In recent years, it has often been violently disrupted by people who have used extremely unpleasant tactics and who have often disguised their identity.
<P>
When my hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold drafted the new clause he was not concerned only with hunting, but it is a matter of great concern in rural communities. Whatever one's views about hunting, the whole atmosphere at a meet can be extremely unpleasant when hunt saboteurs are present. Sometimes horses are not easily controlled and if people are wearing balaclavas over their faces, waving sticks and shouting, the situation can become frightening. It is impossible for the police to carry out their responsibility to ensure that, under the current law, people who want to hunt should be allowed to do so, free of intimidation.
<P>
There seems to be nothing wrong with new clause 10. The words "a constable reasonably suspects"	 either"riot, violent disorder, affray,"	 or "threatening, abusive...behaviour"	 are clear. I would have thought that the clause would have met the bill if that is the right way to put it on every occasion. However, the Under-Secretary has suggested that if a person, wearing a balaclava hat, trespasses and sits on the roof of a private property but is not apparently about to engage in a riot, violent disorder or an affray although that is a debatable point that behaviour would not be covered by new clause 10. I find that hard to believe, but I am genuinely anxious to seek elucidation on the point.
<P>
Conservative members are realistic. We know that Labour members of the Committee will not vote for new clause 10, but that, presumably, they will vote for the Government's new clauses. I pay tribute to the Government for the progress that they have made in this matter, which has caused much anxiety to many people. Will the Minister spell out what types of riotous, unreasonable, dangerous, or intimidating behaviour will be covered by the new clauses?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I much agree with the views of my hon. Friends the Members for Woking (Mr. Malins) and for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh). I should like to test further the Minister's suggestion that new clause 21 is an effective way of dealing with the concerns raised by Lord Carnarvon in another place. It is good that the Government have at least taken notice of the important matters raised in another place, but the Minister should think carefully before preferring the Government's new clauses to new clause 10. As my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough pointed out, new clause 10 is wider and stronger; it covers a wider range of offences that people wearing masks might be about to commit.
<P>
I recognise that the Government have tried to deal with some of the worries that have emerged about this issue, but they will be in grave difficulty if they restrict their proposed extension of the stop-and-search powers of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 to circumstances where there is the threat of violence. The Under-Secretary and I sat as Back Benchers on the Standing Committee that considered that Act. The reason the Government will find that they are in difficulties if they restrict themselves to the powers in new clause 21 is that new clause 10 specifies extra offences in the list of those that might be about to be committed, some of which could be of particular interest to the Government. I am thinking especially of about the concern that we frequently hear the Government express about racism. New clause 10(1)(v) covers
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"distributing or displaying to another person any writing, sign or other visible representation which is threatening, abusive or insulting"	.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
One can easily see the use of that in a context of racial intimidation. The police might find it particularly helpful. Any hon. Members who saw, for instance, the racial problems that affected east London, which were shown on television recently, or the disputes from the time when Salman Rushdie was in trouble, will be aware that Labour Members take racism very seriously, as do all hon. Members.
<P>
I have tried to approach this issue from a viewpoint that will persuade Ministers that new clause 10 is preferable for its greater breadth and the useful powers it would give the police. My hon. Friends have rightly referred to the problems in rural communities caused by activities that are clearly beyond the law, when rent-a-mob is involved. Hon. Members on both sides of the House probably remember news reports of two or three months ago when a perfectly lawful peaceful demonstration that took place during a hunt in Sussex, I think was overshadowed by a rent-a-mob who arrived in a van, all wearing masks and armed with baseball bats. They attacked people, property and cars indiscriminately; sometimes they even attacked people who were part of the peaceful demonstration.
<P>
There was grave concern at that time that the chief constable of Sussex felt unable to act. It is fair to say that he is one of the more controversial chief constables, not least because of his views on subjects of this kind. The excuse was that the police did not have the powers to intervene against the people involved. That is precisely why my hon. friends and I want to provide them. Then there will be no excuse for chief constables or other officers to fail to act if law-abiding people are attacked in the way I described. Though the Government's gesture in the direction I advocate is welcome, it is not wide enough and will not give chief constables the powers they want and need to protect law-abiding people in rural, or even urban, situations.
<P>
I remember vividly the poll tax riots in Trafalgar square. Even though Labour Members opposed the community charge, it was never suggested at any stage that the Labour party gave comfort to the extremes of violence in Trafalgar square that we saw on our television screens. People wearing masks used metal poles to attack police officers and those incidents later led to criminal proceedings.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The poll tax riot was a violent incident, but the powers to new clause 10 would have enabled the police to intervene at a much earlier stage, and when they saw people wearing masks. They might have had good cause to believe that there might be aggravated trespass or threatening, abusive or insulting words and behaviour. it is a bit late to act after someone has picked up a metal pole, smashed a police car window, attacked a police officer and inflicted severe head injuries. Under the Government's new clause, an arrest or stop and search can be justified only when a police officer is certain that he can say in court that he anticipated violence.
<P>
The Minister must reflect on the points that Conservative Members have made. We should have the wider powers that are outlined in new clause 10. I support them. The Government's new clause does not go far enough.

<P>

<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> I listened carefully to the points made. I asked the hon. Member for Epping Forest(Mrs. Laing) how new clause 10 would deal with the circumstances that she described. She took an intervention from the hon. Member for Surrey Heath, who said that section 68 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 would deal with them. I doubt that it would. The hon. Gentleman's answer was not especially helpful.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman suggested that the Government new clause would not deal with circumstances in which a rent a mob descent on an event with baseball bats. In fact, the Government new clause will deal with such a case, but it is questionable whether new clause 10 would. We need to consider what the new clauses will do.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I shall give way in a moment. The hon. Gentleman will have plenty of time to make his points if he does not agree with me.
<P>
Opposition new clause 10 would deal with cases in which
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"a constable reasonably suspects that a person has committed, or is about to commit"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
one of a number of offences. It adds that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the constable may require that person to remove the article of clothing"	.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Therefore, a narrow group of people would be covered by the new clause.
<P>
The Government's new clause is much broader. If an inspector suspects that there will be violence in an area or that someone is carrying an offensive weapon, he may exercise a fairly broad power to ensure that certain items of clothing are removed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> If the hon. Gentleman will allow me to develop my argument, it will help the Committee to understand the points.
<P>
Under the existing powers of arrest, the police already have the power to arrest and search a person who is committing, is suspected of being about to commit or has committed any of the offences specified in new clause 10. The other offences are arrestable offences, and a constable can use the power in section 24(7) of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. The provisions that new clause 10 tries to cover are already covered in law. Many of them already exist. Far from opposing the provisions in the new clause, I think that they are unnecessary because we have many of them already.
<P>
The Government's approach is much broader. However, we are also seeking to provide safeguards that we want to be sure are exercised in the proper way by an officer of appropriate rank such as inspector. The Opposition are proposing something that is not too far off but is not precisely on all fours with the current law. We are proposing a power that would be triggered where the authorising officer expects violence and where removing the face covering would help to reduce that or where he thinks that people may be carrying a weapon.
<P>
Our aim is to deal with situations where trouble may be brewing, not just a protest or a situation where persons may be using insulting words. We have to be careful about the circumstances in which we exercise this power. People protesting at a fox hunt might be legitimately exercising their right to protest. If they are doing that it is fine, and I do not think that any member of the Committee would object to a legitimate protest. We have to be careful that we are precise about what we are trying to do. If people are likely to engage in violence or be carrying weapons, should we be able to remove their face coverings? Our provisions seek to address those issues.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I have said that I will give way to the hon. Member for Surrey Heath in a moment so I hope the hon. Member for Gainsborough will bear with me.
<P>
We are seeking to pre-empt the circumstances. Opposition Members seem to be trying to replicate almost what we already have. It is probably quite unnecessary. The Opposition suggest narrower powers but with fewer safeguards. They are narrower in the sense that the individual must be suspected whereas our broader powers refer to any person in the area including persons who are directly suspected. Ours would embrace much of what new clause 10 says but go wider in terms of the people who may be searched and required to remove the protective face masks.
<P>
In terms of safeguards, we would include the requirement that inspectors should exercise quite onerous powers. To some extent, it is a matter of judgment as to how these provisions are exercised. We reached the conclusion that we wanted the sort of powers that can be exercised when someone has not committed any violence or is not even suspected of being about to commit an offence. We are going much further, in many ways, than Opposition Members propose. We will deal with many of their concerns about hunt saboteurs who might be about to become violent. We will certainly deal with the circumstances described by the hon. Member for Surrey Heath where people descend out of the back of a van with a lot of baseball bats.
<P>
The circumstances in which these provisions interrelate show clearly that our judgment on this is right. We need broader powers but we need safeguards. The Opposition proposals do not have any safeguards, and in many ways the powers that they convey are narrower and more pointed and are probably already covered by the law.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for giving way. I understand the case he is putting. He says, perhaps slightly loosely, that new clause 21 would enable the police to intervene whenever they think there is trouble brewing, but that is precisely where it is inadequate. It is restricted to the existing provisions, the powers
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"to stop and search in anticipation of violence"	.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Our new clause goes wider and when the Minister reflects further on this between now and Report and looks at the kind of offences that might be included he has already said that he does not agree with us about needing the power for someone who might be using
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour or, distributing or displaying to another person any writing, sign or other visible representation"	 
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman is making an intervention.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I am grateful, Mr. O'Hara. When the Minister reflects on this this is the point that I made about racism he will realise that our clause is helpfully wider in that regard.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> In seeking to be helpful and extend this, the hon. Gentleman potentially being quite damaging, perhaps with good intentions. Legitimate protests would be prevented in a way that I am sure that he, no more than any other member of the Committee, would not wish to see happen. We all accept that there are people, whether or not we agree with them, who may seek to exercise a proper protest. We do not want people to seek to hide their identity in order to commit violent offences. We want to be sure that the police have sufficient powers to deal with such circumstances. Our provisions will deal effectively with the sort of circumstances where the police wish to have those powers.
<P>
I am looking through some of the points made by various other hon. Members. I think I dealt with most of them when I replied to the hon. Member for Surrey Heath. However, I shall be happy to respond to any further points.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I am not trying to be difficult, or to make a political point, but I do not understand what would happen to hunt saboteurs under the Government new clauses. The Minister said that new clause 10 was otiose because its provisions were covered by current law. However, current law is clearly inadequate; otherwise, we would not be debating new clauses. The Government and the Opposition are trying to amend current law. Why would not new clause 10 tackle some of the problems that we have discussed?
<P>
The Minister mentioned fox hunts. He said that he did not want to prevent peaceful objections, and I agree. No one wants to stop someone standing on the public highway at the beginning of a hunt and holding up a banner that states, "Fox hunting is cruel"	. However, in practice, a well-organised group turns up to trespass on land and disrupt a lawful activity.
<P>
The Minister implied that the Government new clauses could not prevent such a group's activities unless its intention to engage in violence was obvious, or members of the group carried weapons, or dangerous weapons. The Minister shakes his head. It is important to tease out the issue because many people in rural communities will follow the debate closely.
<P>
I know from attending hunt meets that hunt saboteurs do not appear with large truncheons. If their intention was that obvious, current law would be adequate. However, while they may not wave sticks, at some point during the day they engage in behaviour that is dangerous and threatening when a large number of people and horses are milling around. At that stage, they sometimes wear balaclavas. They may be two fields away, and running. Under those circumstances, it is difficult for the police to control matters, especially when the hunt saboteurs conceal their identity.
<P>
The Minister has received briefings from his officials and from police officers. Is he confident that the Government new clause will be able to deal with the well-organised groups whose members both obstruct legitimate activity and conceal their identity?
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien: The provisions address some of the issues that worry the police, and they have been welcomed by them.</B><P>
<P>
I should like to put our discussions into perspective. The new clause does not relate only to hunt saboteurs, although that may be a preoccupation of some hon. Members. The provisions are designed to deal with the serious disturbances that occur in many of our housing estates, in urban and rural areas. We should focus on that. For example, the provisions will deal with youths, with balaclavas covering their faces, who hijack cars and drive them at high speeds around housing estates.
<P>
I agree with the hon. Member for Gainsborough that many of the provisions in new clause 10 are covered by existing legislation, but that legislation is inadequate. That is why the Government are changing it. New clause 10 has a narrow focus; it would allow the police to remove facial coverings only from those who they suspect are about to commit an offence, or who have already done so. The police should be able to say "we believe that X will happen"	 the Government's view is that the criteria should be the anticipation of violence or the carrying of weapons and that any person in that area can be required to remove his or her balaclava on the authority of an inspector, whether or not that person is suspected of being about to commit an offence, or of having already committed one. In that sense, the Government's provisions are broader, but there are safeguards because an inspector, rather than a constable, is obliged to make decisions about the matter.
<P>
We agree with the hon. Member for Gainsborough that the current law does not work effectively. We want to extend the powers in the way that has been sought by the police. The hon. Gentleman seemed to suggest that any person who covers his or her face would be doing so for unlawful purposes. However, there are circumstances in which people making a peaceful protest against hunting might not wish to reveal their identity because to do so might affect their employment: for example, farm workers who sometimes feel quite strongly on that issue.
<P>
None of us would wish to undermine or to prevent a peaceful and legitimate process. However, if there is an anticipation of violence at such a protest, it is in the overall public interest that such farm workers should remove their facial coverings, or leave the scene. They could have that choice. The police inspector would have the power to require people to remove their face coverings. The Government do not wish to prevent legitimate peaceful protest, but if it starts to get out of hand, the police should be in a position to deal with it.
<P>
I shook my head during the intervention of the hon. Member for Gainsborough because he said that it must be obvious that people are likely to be carrying weapons, or are likely to be violent. That is not the requirement in the new clause. The requirement is that the inspector expects violence, or thinks that people are likely to be carrying weapons, in his area. That is a broader definition. The hon. Gentleman seeks to narrow down the considerable powers that will be given to the police. The new clause will extend the law to tackle a real mischief, not only in rural but in urban areas. It will provide important safeguards, but will enable the police to deal with crime. In recent years, the police have had great difficulty in tackling potent issues of disorder because the law order was inadequate.

<P>

<B>Mr. Malins:</B> We have had a good debate; it has been full and interesting. There is a degree of common ground between the Government and the Opposition. We all recognise that there is a problem that must be dealt with. However, the Minister's response was not helpful enough to persuade Opposition Members to withdraw our new clause. I will explain why.
<P>
My hon. Friends the Members for Epping Forest, for Gainsborough and for Surrey Heath made powerful contributions and dealt with the crux of the matter. My hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough described the case of a hunt saboteur who started waving sticks, shouting and beings disruptive, and my hon. Friend the Member for Epping Forest described the case of someone who climbs a tree on someone's property wearing a balaclava.
<P>
I believe that both cases are covered by new clause 10. Climbing up a tree on someone's property wearing a balaclava is almost certain to amount to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"using towards another person threatening...behaviour"	.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If anyone of us did not feel threatened by such behaviour, I would be surprised.
<P>
The same applies to a masked hunt saboteur who starts waving sticks, shouting and being disruptive. That would almost certainly amount to threatening behaviour under the Public Order Act 1986 and it would enable the new Clause to be triggered.
<P>
The new clause is wide and covers the problems faced by rural communities. My hon. Friend the Member for Surrey Heath was right to refer to racial incidents, which would be another important aspect of the new clause. However, the Government's position is that there must be the threat of violence. Some conduct must be dealt with even though it falls short of the threat of serious violence that is covered by the Government's narrow new clause. New clause 10 is wider. It is much more likely to catch the kind of behaviour and cure the mischief that troubles many in rural and urban communities.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Surrey Heath was right when he said that the Government's new clause was narrow and that the Opposition one covered a wider range of offences and activities. Let no one be in any doubt that Conservative Members respect people's right to make legitimate and lawful protests that has always been their right in this country but our new clause is sufficiently wide to deal with the mischief that we want to cure. The Government's new clause is not wide enough to do that.
<P>
We are not satisfied with the Government's response, so we shall push the matter to a vote.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I must advise the Committee that, as new clause 21 has been approved by the Committee, new clause 10 cannot be moved because it is incompatible with it. It had to be either/or. The fact that it was selected for debate does not mean that it could appropriately be called if new clause 21 had by that time been approved by the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> On a point of order, Mr. O'Hara. The Opposition will be very disappointed that that is the situation. Our clear intention, which would remain if we were given the opportunity, was to vote on new clause 10. Having lost the vote, our position on the Government's new clause might have been different. We might have accepted it. I am sure that I express the view of other Opposition Members who are disappointed not to have the opportunity to vote.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> Further to that point of order, Mr. O'Hara. Am I not right in believing that under the provision known as the slip rule, if a misapprehension was held by members on one side of the Committee the matter can be reconsidered? We all made it quite clear in our speeches that we intended to pursue new clause 10. You could see us all trying to work out when we would reach new clause 10 so that we could vote on it. If, in the operation of that slip rule, you felt able to reopen the matter of new clause 21, which would then give us an opportunity to vote on that and on new clause 10, we would certainly wish to do so.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> It is not a matter of order, it is parliamentary procedure. I called the clauses in the order in which they stand on the amendment paper. It was for hon. Members who wished to press a subsequent new clause to do their best to defeat the incompatible clause at the point at which it was called. They did not. Therefore, when it came to the point when they wished to move new clause 10, I had to rule them out of order because new clause 10 is incompatible with the clause that has already been approved.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> Further to that point of order, Mr. O'Hara. The Minister made quite clear his view not one that we accept that new clause 10 was very similar to the present law and differed from new clause 21. He did not say that it was incompatible with it. A clause is incompatible if it deals with exactly the same subject but says the opposite. This is not the case. I should have thought that it would be within your discretion and would be perfectly permissible, Mr. O'Hara, given the clear wish of the Opposition, for you to allow a vote on new clause 10.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> Further to that point of order, Mr. O'Hara. You will realise that the Opposition wanted to vote on new clause 10. It came as a shock to us when we were not permitted to do so. My hon. Friend the Member for Surrey Heath is right about the slip rule, which would enable you to remedy the situation and give us that chance. I add that your chairmanship, apart from being efficient, is benign and kindly in the sense that you readily understood, not least when I said at the end of my remarks that we would wish to vote upon the clause, that we would push that clause to a vote. We were very disappointed and surprised that we did not have that opportunity. If it is within your power, can you help us under the slip rule?I am sure that if it required magnanimity from the whole Committee, Government Members would think it only right that we should have the chance to vote. Could I therefore ask that on this occasion we have the chance to vote?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We have had enough of this.I manifested generosity when I hesitated at the point of the vote. I clearly hesitated in order to give hon. Members who wished to press new clause 10 the opportunity to persuade the other side of the Committee to reject new clause 21 so that they should have the opportunity to vote for new clause 10 when it came. They did not. New clause 21 was then approved by the Committee and, subsequently, new clauses 22 and 23 were approved by the Committee. It is not in my power to reverse the business of the Committee and to put those clauses to the Committee again.
<P>
That is enough on that point of order. It is regrettable that there was a misunderstanding of procedure by certain members of the Committee, but they did misunderstand and the moment has passed. We must move on I call new clause 24.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> On a fresh point of order, Mr. O'Hara.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I shall take one more point of order but it had better be a good one.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> Understanding that, Mr. O'Hara, you just ruled that it is not within your powers to reverse the decision. My clear understanding from serving on Committees in the past few years is that, when a misunderstanding occurs, the slip rule can be applied. That has happened in Committees on which I have served. It is in your power, Mr. O'Hara, to say that, because of a misunderstanding, the decision can be reconsidered.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman: I took each clause in its proper place on the Order Paper. It was not appropriate to press new clause 10 to a vote because new clause 21 had already been approved.</B><P>
<P>
I have, in the case of a clear misunderstanding during a vote, and before completing the voting procedure, gone back and started again. We are far beyond that point. We have discussed three new clauses, which have all be approved by the Committee. There was a misunderstanding on the part of some members of the Committee. I hesitated when I put the Question, in order to give them an opportunity to press the matter, but they did not take it.
<P>
We must move on. I shall take no more points of order on the subject.

<P>

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
The new clause requires chief Crown prosecutors to publish annual reports giving details of the total number of prosecutions, the number stayed under clauses 40 and 41 and the number of fresh proceedings instituted under clause 42. I expect the Government to give the new clause a warm welcome, as they share our concern that the prosecution system should be as efficient and speedy as possible and that not too many prosecutions should be discontinued.
<P>
The provision takes us back to the subject of time limits, and while I do not want to cover again the ground that we covered in debates on clauses 40, 41 and 42, it may help if I remind hon. Members that those clauses set time limits for the different stages of proceedings. In particular, clause 41 sets time limits with respect to young persons under 18, beginning at the time of arrest and covering the rest of the proceedings. Under clause 42, proceedings not completed within the time limit would be stayed. We have already expressed our concern that that would send the prosecution back to square one, as fresh proceedings would have to be instituted. That would take some time.
<P>
We want the time limits to be effective, but we do not want them to create fresh delays in the system. It is desirable to keep an eye on prosecuting authorities' performance in keeping down the number of prosecutions stayed for breach of time limits. That is in everyone's interest, and chief Crown prosecutors should be required to make a report on the matter. We expect the Government to want openness, the divulging of information and a general consciousness of the need for efficiency in prosecutions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> I shall be extremely brief. I support my hon. Friend's remarks. There will soon be 42 areas with chief Crown prosecutors, as opposed to the current 13 or so. The reports that I have read that go once a year from the Crown Prosecution Service to the Attorney-General are only 40 or 50 pages long and they do not contain the fine detail that is needed. There is a compelling argument for an annual report to be produced in future by the chief Crown prosecutor, covering in the greatest possible details what happens in the different cases in his area, so that the public will know the total number of prosecutions, as well as the number stayed. There should be a further breakdown into guilty pleas, not guilty pleas convicted and acquitted and cases dismissed for a variety of reasons. All that information should be in the public domain. If the Minister cannot accept the new clause, he might give the Committee an undertaking that such obligations will be laid on the Crown Prosecution Service.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> There is much to be said for the new clause. I broadly agree with its intentions. The failure of prosecutions because of an inability to comply with time limits would be a serious matter, especially if it were to occur on a large scale. The Government will need to monitor the operation of the new regime of time limits, when it is introduced. It will be important to know in how many cases proceedings are stayed as a result of time limits being broken, and in how many cases proceedings are re-instituted. We shall take action, when necessary, to ensure that such cases are dealt with more effectively.
<P>
We do not want either outcome to become a routine occurrence. In the vast majority of cases, time limits should not be broken. They will be upper limits, and the level at which they will be set will be determined after careful piloting and consultation. However, there might be some cases, if only a few, in which the time limits are broken. The staying of proceedings is the new, more flexible, sanction for breach of a time limit; where appropriate, it will allow for the reinstitution of proceedings with the authority of a senior prosecutor.
<P>
In monitoring the figures, the Government will need to take account, as appropriate, of the type of offence or defendant in the cases in which problems occur. In the light of that, we might need to revise the time limits for those specific cases. Or if the figures show a disproportionately high number of stayed and reinstituted proceedings in one particular geographical area, the reason for that will need to be examined and appropriate action will be taken to redress the balance, to ensure that the system works effectively.
<P>
The question is whether there is a need for a statutory requirement for the publication of such information. If we specify in statute what information should be published, there is a risk that that will call into question the need to publish other, useful information on which the law remains silent.
<P>
Under section 9 of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985, the Director of Public Prosecutions is required to report annually to the Attorney-General upon the discharge of herfunctions as head of the Crown Prosecution Service, and, as has already been pointed out, that report is laid before Parliament. The Attorney-General may specify the type of information to be included in the report, but, in practice, it contains detailed casework statistics, including the total number of prosecutions.
<P>
When we introduce the new regime of statutory time limits, we shall certainly expect similar information to continue to be published annually, and I am sure that the director will wish to consider including information on the extent to which statutory time limits are being met.
<P>
The 1985 Act provides for an annual report because the DPP is accountable to the Attorney-General for the performance of the CPS. There is no requirement for chief crown prosecutors to produce an annual report because they, in turn, are accountable to the director in the management chain.
<P>
In any event, it would be premature to set out by statute, at this stage, the terms in which the casework statistics should be published. We have not yet fully considered the important proposals of the Glidewell report into the CPS. That report recommends that 42 new chief crown prosecutors should be directly responsible to the DPP.
<P>
Furthermore, the Government also wish to await the evaluation of the time-limit pilot schemes that will run for 12 months from autumn 1999, before introducing any requirements that might be affected by them.
<P>
I share with Opposition Members the wish to monitor carefully the operation of the provisions. The Government are determined to ensure that the provisions will make the prosecution of offences more efficient and effective. We want to tackle the delays that occur at present. I am sure that Opposition Members would agree with that. The only disagreement between us is about whether we need to put these matters in statute. I believe that that would be too inflexible at this stage and would like to consider the outcome of the pilot schemes.
<P>
There is not great disagreement between Opposition and Government Members about the need for information about the operation of the system in due course, but it would be premature to set in stone exactly how that should occur. I hope therefore that Opposition Members will agree to withdraw the new clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am pleased that the Minister shares our general objectives. However, Opposition Members would like to see his fine sentiments acted on. We hope that there will be careful monitoring of prosecutions and openness about publishing the relevant information about them. We take this subject very seriously. We shall be watching to see how the matter progresses. We wish to be alive to any potential problems, and in earlier debates we suggested where some problems may lie. However, bearing in mind what the Minister said, and the fact that he shares some of our objectives, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the new clause.
<P>

<P>
<B>Mr Clappison: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.</B><P>
<P>
The new clause seeks to increase the maximum sentence for unlawful sexual intercourse with a girl aged under 16 from two years to seven years. I have always taken this subject seriously. There are two levels of penalty for the offence of unlawful sexual intercourse: that for intercourse with a girl aged under 13 is life imprisonment, which is right. That is a discretionary penalty, and it is treated by the courts as a grave offence. I believe that unlawful sexual intercourse with a girl aged under 16 is also a serious offence and, in some circumstances, a very serious offence. It has always struck me as a little anomalous that upon the girl attaining her 13th birthday the maximum penalty should drop from life imprisonment to one year. There is a case to be made for saying that the penalty for unlawful sexual intercourse with a girl under 16 has been left behind by the maximum penalties having been increased for other offences. Indecent assault used to carry a maximum sentence of two years; in fairly recent legislation that was increased to 10 years. It seems a little strange that although the indecent assault element carries a sentence of 10 years, the act of unlawful sexual intercourse carries a maximum of only two years. Many of those involved in the administration of justice believe that to be strange, especially where indecent assault has been charged as an alternative to unlawful sexual intercourse.
<P>
We must also bear in mind the need to cater for the worst cases of unlawful sexual intercourse, because existing authorities have recognised that it covers a potentially wide spectrum of offences. The leading authority is a case called Taylor, which goes back about 20 years. It makes it clear that the offence covers a spectrum of offending. On the one hand, one might have a youth aged 16 or 17 charged with unlawful sexual intercourse with a girl who is just under the age of 16: what might have started out as a virtuous friendship ended with falling prey to temptation and committing the offence of unlawful sexual intercourse. That is against the law and needs to be dealt with, but the sentence to be passed in those cases need not be as severe as in the more aggravated sexual offences where, for example, the girl has only just turned 13 and the offender is much older, perhaps 30 or 40, and in a position of trust. A maximum sentence of two years is not enough to cater for the worst offences at that end of the spectrum. We need to increase the maximum sentence to cater for every possibility.
<P>
Sometimes girls need to be protected from themselves, but they need particularly to be protected from older men who may try to take advantage of them and who may be in a position of trust. Such girls, whatever their level of experience, must be protected from those men; and men who offend and have unlawful sexual intercourse with young girls deserve a longer prison sentence than is currently available.

<P>

<B>Mr. Malins:</B> There is much sense in the new clause. It is an anomaly that the maximum sentence for unlawful sexual intercourse with a girl aged 13 is two years, while indecent assault carries a sentence of 10 years. The Government will accept that the worst end of the spectrum with regard to unlawful sexual intercourse can merit a very long sentence. Someone in a position of trust for example, a school master, social worker or priest of mature years can deliberately set out to seduce a young girl, and have intercourse with her. For that he will receive a sentence of two years. That does not square with the case of Curry in 1988, which was an indecent assault: a man went up to a woman in a car park at night, seized her breast and tried to pull off her jumper; for that he went to prison for two and half years. There is an anomaly and it comes up in practice in grievous cases of unlawful sexual intercourse, where the Crown does nto know whether to put only that count on the indictment or a count of indecent assault as well. That is confusing, not least to the jury.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> We examined the new clause with some interest, especially the matters to which the hon. Member for Woking referred. It seems that the penalties for other forms of indecent assault and sexual offence have been increased to cope with the fact that the offence of unlawful sexual intercourse is less effective, because it has to cover both consensual relationships and those wher there may be an element of coercion. The offence has to cover both the 15-year-old and 16-year-old who are having a consensual relationship and more sinister relationships. That has devalued the offence, and at the same time tariffs have been ratcheted up to compensate for it. I shall be interested to hear the Minister's view on the extent to which it should be used as opposed to indecent assault. I would also like to hear his view of any knock-on effect of ratcheting up the maximum tariff for other offences, because every time a tariff is increased there is a tendency to compensate by increasing tariffs for offences which are deemed to be more serious.
<P>
Those are the areas on which we want a response from the Minister. I retain an open mind on whether it would be useful to go for an increase in penalty at this stage.
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Home Office (Mr. Alun Michael):</B> The Government intend to take action to protect children and young people, particularly against those who abuse positions of trust. That is at the heart of the comments of hon. members who have spoken. The Utting report highlighted a number of issues with regard to the protection of children, and the ministerial group that is working on that has done an enormous amount of useful work already. We also intend to examine the position of youngsters aged between 16 and 18. Our target is not the victims of sexual activity, but those who abuse positions of trust and who have a duty of care.
<P>
We take seriously our responsibility to ensure that the courts have the power to deal with the offenders who appear before them. I have some sympathy with the points that have been made in this short debate, because I think there are elements of inconsistency and question marks over whether some penalties are adequate to deal with all circumstances, as distinct from just some circumstances. In some cases, alternative charges can be used, and there is sometimes a question over the right charge to use.
<P>
Sexual offences carry severe penalties. A life sentence is the maximum penalty for rape or attempted rape, unlawful sexual intercourse with a girl under 13 and buggery with a child under 16. The Government have also, as recently as 1 October 1997, increased the maximum penalty for gross indecency with a child from two to 10 years' imprisonment. We also implemented, on the same date, automatic life sentences for second-time serious sexual or violent offenders. In the previous month we implemented the Sexual Offenders Act. Our determination to provide an effective sentencing framework for all offences was demonstrated by the issue in February of a consultation paper on reforming offences of violence against the person. That paper has been widely welcomed and focuses on a range of offences that have been dealt with inconsistently for a long time and that need to be reviewed. The consultation period closed recently, and we shall be considering recommendations to deal with the law in that area.
<P>
Given the Government's position on these issues, we shall certainly consider whether there is a case for increasing the maximum penalty for unlawful sexual intercourse with a girl aged under 16. However, it is difficult to look at these questions in isolation. Some hon. Members who have contributed, especially the hon. member for Hallam, highlighted that point. The framework for sexual offences is adequate to deal with the most serious offences, although there are many inconsistencies and anomalies. Any attempts to increase penalties in isolation risk creating further anomalies. That is what gives us cause for thought, and it should lead to our looking comprehensively across the entire spectrum of offences. The time has come to examine the overall framework of sex offences, many of which have been unchanged since the 19th century, in the light of these inconsistencies and anomalies, and subsequent developments in the law. We will therefore undertake a review of sexual offences and we are giving active consideration to how best this can be conducted. We need to ensure that this vital area of the law is, like the law on offences against the person, given the careful consideration that it deserves.
<P>
Unlawful sexual intercourse with a girl under the age of 16 years causes difficulties because at one end of the scale it covers consenting acts between teenagers, while at the other it may involve an adult committing an appalling abuse of a position of trust. A wide range of offences and circumstances can be covered. We also need carefully to consider other comparable offences, such as incest. These are fundamental issues and difficult questions that need to be examined very carefully.
<P>
In the light of what I have said and our undertaking to look at these issues seriously and come back to the House of Commons, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the new clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I listened carefully to the Minister's response, and I appreciate the broad background of sympathy to the new clause. May I, however, sound a note of concern? The Minister said that it is important not to look at these offences in isolation. Our concern, as expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Woking, is that following an increase in the maximum sentence for indecent assault from two years to 10 years, the sentence for unlawful sexual intercourse has been left behind. My hon. Friend made a good point about the use of indecent assault as an alternative. It is confusing for those involved in the administration of justice, and especially juries, where unlawful sexual intercourse as well as indecent assault are charged, and the latter carries a higher maximum sentence.
<P>
We shall be watching carefully in future to make sure that progress is made. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison: I beg to move, that the clause be read a Second time.</B><P>
<P>
We come to another important subject: the cross-examination of rape victims, which has been of great concern to many people in recent times. New clause 5 would remove the defendant's right personally to ask questions of the victim in cases of rape or indecent assault. The defendant would of course have the opportunity to be represented by counsel. If a defendant did not have a legal representative, or ceased to have a legal representative during the proceedings, the court would appoint a legal representative to ask questions of the victim on his behalf. That is the best way of ensuring that the defendant is properly represented when it comes to asking questions of the victim, and we believe that that approach is better than giving the task of asking questions to the judge a course that contains some difficulties.
<P>
The case for the defendant to lose the right personally to ask questions of the victim has been made, especially in the light of several recent cases in which defendants have used the right to cross-examine victims in rape offences to put those victims through a new ordeal in the court room. A defendant should, in general, have the right to conduct his own defence, but in this type of offence there is too great a risk of causing additional distress and suffering to the victim. That is a much-needed change, and we believe that new clause 5 is the right way to go about it. We hope that the Government will support it. If they believe that it needs technical improvement, I hope that they will take it away and come back to the House on Report.
<P>
The Government have been talking about this change, and other changes with regard to the cross-examination of sexual assault victims where the defendant is represented by counsel. However, we do not see a need to link the two changes. If the Minister says that there is a link, and that we cannot proceed with the new clause today, we need to hear the reasons for it. The removal of the defendant's right personally to cross-examine victims can be dealt with on its own, without going into more complicated general issues about the cross-examination of rape victims. In view of recent cases, and the need to avoid such cases arising in the future, this would be one way of dealing with the problem. I commend the new clause to the Committee.

<P>

<B>Mr. Allan:</B> This issue also causes the Liberal Democrats some concern, and we have looked at policy in this area recently. There were some conflicting views on the importance of the right of a defendant to represent himself, and learned colleagues from north of the border informed us that Scottish sheriffs are far more sensible when it comes to preventing the sort of abusive cross-examination that was seen in some regrettable cases recently. Every time we hear of a victim being put into such an appalling position, significant numbers of women who have serious cases to bring forward will be put off doing so. The administration of justice is not well served when people are scared to come forward and use due legal process.
<P>
Even if the Government do not accept the new clause, I hope that their review will have led them to similar conclusions and that they will act quickly, so that we never again have to read newspaper headlines which we know will prevent women from bringing serious matters to the criminal justice system.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> Protecting victims and vulnerable witnesses is high on the Government's agenda . That is why we moved quickly after the general election last year to establish the inquiry to which the hon. Member for Hallam has just referred. The publication of our report on the protection of victims and vulnerable witnesses is imminent. It will be widely welcomed when it appears in the public domain very shortly.
<P>
The Committee will be aware of the way in which the Government have made it clear that we intend to work out the best way to protect victims in cases in which witnesses have been cross-examined in an unacceptable manner. However, we also want to protect the defendant's right to test the evidence against him.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hertsmere acknowledged the importance of a defendant's right to conduct his own defence, but we must protect witnesses and victims from the abuse of that right. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will agree that it is not as simple as expressing the wish to do that and putting it into being instantly.
<P>
I welcome the helpful practice direction issued by the Lord Chief Justice recently, which makes clear how judges can protect witnesses in certain cases and strongly encourages them to do so. The Government are committed to measures that protect victims of rape or serious sexual offences from direct cross-examination by thedefendant, especially when there is a danger that such cross-examination will represent an abuse of the defendant's right to conduct his own case. Other elements, however, must also be taken into consideration, such as the possibility of the defendant conducting the rest of the case apart from cross-examination of the victim.
<P>
It is not a straightforward issue with which to deal. It needs to be dealt with in a way that is consistent with the interests of justice. However, it is clear that change is needed, and we are actively considering what additional assistance we can give judges to deal with such difficult cases by strengthening the law.
<P>
I share the views of Opposition Members. There have been terrible cases of rapists cross-examining their victims for several days and subjecting them to intimidation and distress. That is a form of victimisation that one witness likened to the trauma of rape itself. We are determined that vulnerable witnesses should not have to go through such experiences.
<P>
The Government remain committed to measures that, consistent with the interests of justice, protect victimsof rape or serious sexual offences from direct cross-examination by the defendant. We are actively considering what additional assistance we can provide.
<P>
As I said, last year we set up a wide-ranging inter-departmental review of the way in which vulnerable or intimidated witnesses are treated in the criminal justice system, including ways to prohibit unrepresented defendants from personally cross-examining victims in rape and serious sexual offence trials. The review group has recently completed its report. It needs to be considered properly, not least by Members of the House, before we rush to introduce legislation. An announcement will be made shortly on how we intend to take that forward.
<P>
The new clause would introduce a blanket prohibition on defendants in rape and serious sexual offence trials personally cross-examining the victims and would make provision for a legal representative to be appointed by the court. That is a valiant attempt to address some of the problems and omissions that were apparent when a similar clause was debated in another place. However, a number of serious questions, such as the identity of the legal representative who is required to conduct the case on behalf of the defendant and the implications for the case if the defendant declines to instruct the appointed legal representative, remain to be answered. Barristers have a professional duty to put the whole case on behalf of a client.
<P>
We also need to consider the implications for the procedures governing legal aid and we must ensure that any measures introduced do not lead to any unnecessary delay in the trial. Such delays may cause distress to the victim who is waiting to give evidence.
<P>
It is a complicated matter on which it is important to get the law right. We have pledged to give greater protection to victims in rape and other serious sexual offence cases and I have repeated that point now. I have underlined the fact that we need to ensure that all the practical implications for the conduct of the trial have been fully considered so that we achieve satisfactory and effective legislation that will stand the test of time. We are determined that any changes that we make will stand that test and will be consistent with our obligations under the European convention on human rights. We will seek to take action as quickly as possible.
<P>
Attractive though the new clause may seem in the interests of making early progress on a matter that concerns us all, for the reasons I have given I hope that the matter will not be pressed and that the hon. Gentleman will accept my assurances about the way we intend to deal with this important issue.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I listened carefully to the Minister.I am grateful for his kind comments about the new clause. He is right to accept, as the Committee as a whole will accept, that this is a matter of great pubic interest. I could have told the Committee details of several recent cases where the victims were put through the most terrible protracted ordeal in the witness box as a result of defendants personally cross examining them and apparently going to considerable lengths to intimidate them. These defendants are men of considerable deviousness and resourcefulness. I shall want to read carefully what the Minister has said about this. We have to be careful and we must not rush into anything. However, if one comes to the conclusion, as I have done, that in such cases the right to cross-examine is a right which, notwithstanding the general right of defendants to conduct their own defences, must be taken away from the defendant because of the risks for the victim, one must set about finding a way to achieve that.
<P>
The problems to which the Minister adverted the identity of the counsel to represent the defendants if the clause is implemented, or the defendant's decision, for example, not to give instructions to such a counsel would have to be overcome. My initial reaction on that last point we will want to consider these things carefully is that if the defendant took that course, it would be on his own head. The counsel would no doubt do his best to fulfil his duty to the court and his client.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would acknowledge that the general point of principle that he makes is reasonable. Hon. Members would generally go along with that line, but if one is to go down that route,it makes it all important that the safeguards that are put in place should be strong, such as making sure that any individual who is about to be affected by such a ruling by a judge has the situation explained and is able fully to understand it. Those sorts of practice would be important in order to go in the direction that the hon. Gentleman urges upon us.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> That is fair enough. I said that that was my initial reaction; I suspect that it will be my reaction when I have given it some consideration, but I want to give it some consideration. We will have to confront these issues if we are to give victims the protection they need. The best form of protection is simply that the defendant will not have the right to ask these questions of a victim in the witness box.
<P>
I shall consider carefully what the Minister said because these are matters of significant public interest. Although this has been only a short debate, it has been an important one. I shall reflect carefully on what the Minister has said in the light of the seriousness of the subject, its complicated nature although we think it can be dealt with on its own and the substantial public interest at stake. We may want to return to this when I have studied the Minister's words and given the matter more consideration. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.
<P>
Motion and clause, by leave, withdrawn.
<H4><center>New clause 6</center></H4>
<H4><center>Increase in maximum sentence for offences under Offences Against the Person Act (wounding, causing grievous bodily harm) and for offences of assault occasioning actual bodily harm<w4></center></H4>
<P>
`. ( ) In subsection (1) of section 1 of the Penal Servitude Act 1891 for the words "five years"	 there shall be substituted "ten years"	.'.
<P>
Brought up, and read the First time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
We move into a slightly different terrain but another important subject. The new clause would increase the maximum sentence for offences of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, wounding and causing grievous bodily harm from the present level of five years to a new level of 10 years. These are offences which were created by the Offences against the Person Act 1861. It appears that the present maximum sentence of five years was established by the Penal Servitude Act 1891. Penal servitude was then replaced by imprisonment. It is therefore a maximum sentence of some antiquity, and it needs to be revisited.
<P>
The Committee should at the outset distinguish between the group of offences that I have mentioned and the other very serious offences in which wounding, or the causing of grievous bodily harm, is accompanied by the intention to cause serious injury. Where there is such an intention, a life sentence is available as a maximum, at the court's discretion. Generally, those offences receive longer sentences of imprisonment from the courts.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The cases covered by the new clause are those where such an intention is not present, but they can be very serious, and we wonder whether the maximum sentence of five years is sufficient in the most serious cases.
<P>
I am indebted to "Current Sentencing Practice"	 for details of the 1994 case of Hashi, an appellant who had attacked a man who was accompanying his former girlfriend of whom he was very possessive in a public house. The account of the case states that he stabbed the man
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"in the chest with a knife with a five-inch blade. The victim's life was saved by emergency surgery. The appellant was indicted for wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm"	 <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the type of case to which I just referred. The sentencing notes state that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"it was assumed that he was acquitted of the offence under section 18 on the basis that he had taken so much alcohol that he had failed to form the intention to cause grievous bodily harm. The appellant"	 <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
who was the defendant in the criminal proceedings; his case went on appeal to the Court of Appeal 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"had several previous convictions for violent offences, including ... a knife attack on a boyfriend of his former partner."	<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That person, with a record of serious offences, committed another serious offence that, but for the skill of the surgeons, could have resulted in loss of life. He received a longer than normal sentence under section 2 of the Criminal Justice Act 1991. He was given five years' imprisonment. That was the maximum that the court was constrained to pass. In such a case, involving a violent man, a longer sentence is called for.
<P>
There is a case for changing the maximum sentence. Concern was expressed earlier in Committee about violent offences and, for example, the link between alcohol and violence. It should be noted that while the general level of recorded crime has, happily, been falling in recent years, violent offences have been increasing within those totals. We do not know how much that is due to the reporting of domestic violence, but none the less there is an argument for sending out a signal about offences of violence, by increasing the maximum sentence for wounding, causing grievous bodily harm and assault occasioning actual bodily harm. We need to provide for the worst type of case and we expect a sympathetic Government response.

<P>

<B>Mr. Michael:</B> My starting point is that we need to review the penalties under the 1861 Act and the offences. I should have to study carefully the case to which the hon. Member for Hertsmere alluded. I may not do it justice in saying that I am not sure that it was a conclusive argument in support of his new clause. I appreciate that he gave a summary. An examination of the case in detail may support his argument.
<P>
The new clause would increase the maximum penalties for assault occasioning actual bodily harm and for causing grievous bodily harm to 10 years' imprisonment. The Government are determined to act swiftly to provide new powers to the courts when there is evidence that they are needed. We have little evidence at this time, however, of a need for doubling the maximum penalties for those offences.
<P>
Provisional figures for 1997 show that, of 1,918 offenders sentenced to immediate custody for assault occasioning actual bodily harm, only six offenders 0.3 per cent. of the total received sentences approaching the maximum. Only nine out of 2,030 offenders .4 per cent. of the total convicted for causing grievous bodily harm received sentences approaching the maximum. More serious violent offences can be charged as wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm. That carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman was right to suggest that there is a need to consider the offences and the way that the 1861 Act operates. In February, we issued a public consultation document on reforming the 1861 Act. That proposed redefining the offences that are the subject of the new clause. That aspect of the law has been long neglected and the offences have been criticised by the courts. Under our proposals, which are based on the Law Commission's careful review, assault occasioning actual bodily harm will be replaced by a new offence of intentionally or recklessly causing injury. That will have a maximum penalty of five years. Wounding or inflicting grievous bodily harm will be replaced by a new offence of reckless serious injury and will carry a more severe penalty of seven years' imprisonment.
<P>
It would be premature to change the maximum penalties in advance of decisions about those proposed changes. The consultation period on the proposals ended only on 15 May 1998. We are considering the responses.
<P>
The new clause is in any case technically deficient although that may have been corrected by a later printing. It originally referred to the Penal Servitude Act 1981 rather than the Penal Servitude Act 1891. The 1891 Act changed maximum penalties under earlier enactments, including the Offences against the Person Act 1861. However, amending the 1891 Act would not increase penalties under the 1861 Act. The proper course would be to amend the 1861 Act itself.
<P>
I do not want to pray in aid such technical matters.I hope that the hon. Gentleman will acknowledge that the document that we have published and the careful consideration that we are giving to the range of offences against the person are designed to ensure that penalties are appropriate and apply to offences that are more clearly defined. We hope that they will not give rise to the many appeals that the 1861 Act continues to produce. That is worrying because the Act is not new appeals are not the result of uncertainty caused by the Act having just been introduced.
<P>
The Government's comprehensive approach to the problem should commend itself to Conservative Members. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will respond positively by withdrawing the motion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> II do not want to weary the Committee with technical details at this stage of the evening.I listened to the Minister with interest and I will take guidance from him in future. The new clause referred to the Penal Servitude Act 1891 because that Act abolished penal servitude, which was the sentence required by the Offences against the Person Act 1861. If we sought now to amend the Offences against the Person Act 1861, we might run the risk of reintroducing penal servitude. However, I shall not go into that, because it might give the Government ideas.
<P>
A sentence of five years for such offences is too short. I am sorry that my account of the Hashi case was not sufficiently long, but I will send the Minister details so that he can study it. That was a serious case that could have had even more serious consequences. It involved a dangerous man with a bad record, and the Minister may find that it was even more serious than I suggested.
<P>
It is important to send out a signal about violent offences. We shall watch the matter carefully and we might need to return to it. I am not entirely satisfied with matters as they stand, but, bearing in mind the need to make progress, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.
<P>
Motion and clause, by leave, withdrawn.
<H4><center>New Clause 7</center></H4>
<H4><center>Life imprisonment for indecent assault on a woman</center></H4>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) In paragraph 17 of Schedule 37 to the Sexual Offences Act 1956 (indecent assault on a woman) for the words "ten years"	 there shall be substituted "life imprisonment"	.'. [Mr. Clappison.]<P>

Brought up, and read the First time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, we shall discuss new clause 8 
<H4><center>Life imprisonment for indecent assault on a man </center></H4>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) In paragraph 18 of Schedule 37 to the Sexual Offences Act 1956 (indecent assault on a man) for the words "ten years"	 there shall be substituted "life imprisonment"	.'.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The new clauses relate to subjects that we have already discussed. They provide a solution to some of the problems that were identified in our debates. They would increase the maximum sentences for indecent assault on both women and men from 10 years to life imprisonment As I pointed out earlier, the maximum sentence for indecent assault was recently increased from two to 10 years. That was a long overdue change. The new clauses would go further than that and I support them for two reasons.
<P>
The first reason is that there are some offences of indecent assault for which even the new maximum sentence of 10 years imprisonment might not be sufficient. As hon. Members will know, the offence of rape carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. However, indecent assault covers a range of sexual assaults, which, although they do not include sexual intercourse, might be of great severity. They cause great indignity and have terrible consequences for the victims. I will not go into great detail, as I am sure that hon. members will be aware of the type of cases to which I am referring.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I should like to know what type of indecent assault would justify life imprisonment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> To take the Committee through the matter, such assaults might include, in the case of a man, the removal of his clothes, touching his genitals, manipulating his genitals, including masturbation in the case of a child. In the case of a woman, such assaults might include every type of sexual practice that falls short of sexual intercourse.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough might have experienced cases in the courts in which indecent assault is charged as an alternative to rape when it is not clear whether penetration has taken place. For example, oral sex might be charged as indecent assault. Having listened to those descriptions, I am sure that my hon. Friend would agree that they are serious assaults for the victims. In the worst cases, they would call for long custodial sentences.
<P>
I accept that indecent assaults vary in their seriousness. My hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough might have been thinking of the spectrum that they cover. It is correct that the offence of indecent assault can encompass much less serious circumstances than those that I described. None the less, the offence can include acts of great indecency and violence.
<P>
The second reason for my support for the higher maximum sentences under the new clauses in that they would make available the sentence of life imprisonment for certain sex offenders. Such people need a long period of supervision and they need to be on licence after their release. As Opposition Members pointed out in earlier debates, the Government's proposals for supervision are flawed. Before sex offender orders can be made, a threshold of serious harm is required, either death, or serious physical or psychological injury. That threshold is too high.
<P>
The Government's proposals for supervision after release from sentences under clause 55 are also seriously flawed. They would not allow long enough periods of supervision for offenders convicted of serious offences. As was pointed out in our earlier debates, paedophile often carry out offences of indecent assault and such assaults can encompass a variety of circumstances.
<P>
The flaw in clause 55 is that the more serious the offence, the shorter the potential supervision period. That cannot be right. As the Government admitted earlier, part of the problem is that they want to subject offenders to a licence, so that they can be recalled to prison. In a determinate sentence, the licence period may only be short, especially for a serious offence. The new clauses go a long way towards solving the problem.
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Sex offenders who receive a life sentence will spend a long time in custody and on release, will be subject to licence and recall for the rest of their lives. Under section 37(4) of the Criminal Justice Act 1991,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"A person subject to a licence shall comply with such conditions ... as may for the time being be specified in the licence"	.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The new clauses would achieve the Government's aims better than the Bill would.
<P>
Some of the men that we are considering remain dangerous long after they begin offending. The offences that they are apt to commit are not eligible for life sentences. The new clauses tackle that problem. They will protect the public better than the Bill will, and build on measures that received consensus, such as the Sex Offenders Act 1997, and the implementation of sentences for repeat offences, to which the Minister referred. They build on existing protection, and provide a solution to a serious problem. They offer greater protection than is currently available to the public.

<P>

<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> My hon. Friend has done the Committee a service in bringing some matters to our attention. He made a good point about the importance of controlling especially dangerous offenders through licensing. Is that available only for those serving life imprisonment?
<P>
I add a word of caution to the debate. I believe that life imprisonment should be restricted to proven cases of taking life. In showing society's distaste for crimes such as rape or indecent assault, there is a danger of ever increasing the number of offences that receive life sentences. That may downgrade the initial repugnance that society feels for those who commit murder.
<P>
Parliament should extend the category of offenders who receive life sentences only when it seriously believes that life imprisonment will be given to the offender. If someone commits a murder, society and Parliament generally believe that the offender should receive life imprisonment. I cannot conceive of circumstances in which someone who commits an indecent assault, however horrible and we all abhor such behaviour would serve life imprisonment. Some offenders may suffer from mental incapacity and can be dealt with in other ways.
<P>
The debate has been useful, but we should think twice before increasing the range of offences that receive life imprisonment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> The hon. Member for Gainsborough gave us a useful reminder of the need to take care that we give the appropriate penalty for offences. He warned us not to be tempted to solve one problem by creating others.
<P>
We said recently that we were considering indeterminate sentences for sex offences whose perpetrators may pose long-term threat, even when they have served a sentence and been released. That issue has partly been met by extending periods of supervision and looking at the way in which the sex offenders order, which we debated earlier, could be brought in relation to the danger posed by an individual rather than as an extension of the punishment.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman makes a good point here. There is a danger of widening the scope of the life sentence, which is an indeterminate sentence in one sense of the word, rather than considering what may be more appropriate and perhaps looking at a different type of vehicle to meet the mischief that is perceived.
<P>
I do not want to go over ground that has been covered in earlier debates. One of the points that I made concerned our intention to examine the entire range of sex offences and the penalties that apply to them. Personally, I think that there is a case for increasing the maximum penalty for indecent assault on both men and women to life imprisonment. I certainly agree that there are some examples of this offence which may be particularly serious. However, the question is whether we need to look again at the offences or the penalties.
<P>
We need to take account of the fact that indecent assault covers many relatively minor issues. That range needs to be considered. I stress that it is difficult to view these questions in isolation. Although the framework for sexual offences is currently adequately to deal with the most serious offences there are many inconsistencies and anomalies. Any attempts to increase the penalties in isolation in this area would create further anomalies which we would be wise to avoid. I have said that I believe the most sensible way forward is to conduct a wholesale review of sexual offences and penalties.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hertsmere said that the penalty was recently increased to 10 years. It was increased in 1985, and the recent increase from two to 10 years was for indecency with children. I may have misinterpreted what he said but I just wanted to make sure that we were clear about that.
<P>
So far as indecent assault is concerned, a review would consider whether we should simply increase the maximum penalty as has been proposed, or introduce a new separate offence of serious indecent assault, or perhaps redefine the offence of rape. A further question which may need to be addressed, if the penalty were raised to life imprisonment, is whether this offence should come into the scope of section 2 of the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997. These and a range of other issues could be addressed in a review to resolve the anomalies in this area and to achieve a consistent approach to these serious issues. I hope that with those assurances about the way in which we intend to approach these matters, the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his new clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> This has been an interesting debate.I take the point that my hon. Friend made about life sentences. I should emphasise that I am talking not about a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment which is available for murder but a discretionary sentence of life imprisonment which is available for a number of offences, and has been for some time. Wounding with intent is one, rape is another. Some rapists receive life imprisonment because they are dangerous men and commit serious offences.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Gaisnborough made a valuable point. Indecent assault covers a wide variety of circumstances. The availability of a life sentence does not mean that it will be imposed for the less serious form of indecent assault. But some offenders might have committed offences that require a sentence of life imprisonment. We come to the problem of offenders such as paedophiles who continue to be a danger for many years and who commit serious offences against young people. Under the present framework and including what is contained in the Bill, there simply will not be enough protection for the public from these men in the form of supervision and licence on release.
<P>
The periods will simply not run for long enough to give the public the protection that they need. We know that these are men who can continue being dangerous for many years to come until they have reached quite advanced years. There are many cases of such men offending time and time again. A new clause such as this aims to give the public the best form of protection from them. It avoids having to wait as in the case of a sex offender order until there is evidence to suggest that the public were at risk of serious harm. As we have shown in earlier debates, such an order is badly flawed because it sets too high a threshold. If instead those concerned were on a life sentence subject to licence, they could simply and much more easily be recalled to prison than if the proposed threshold of serious harm had to be established.
<P>
I have listened carefully to what the Minister said. We may need to revisit this subject but in order to make progress for now, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.
<P>
Motion and clause, by leave, withdrawn.
