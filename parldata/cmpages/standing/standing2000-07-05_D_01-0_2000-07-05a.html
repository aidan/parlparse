<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Jonathan Sayeed </B>(Mid-Bedfordshire): I beg to move
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That, during proceedings on the Census (Amendment) Bill [Lords], the Committee do meet on Wednesdays at half-past Ten o'clock and at half-past Four o'clock.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
I am delighted to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Benton. I know that you will take it in exactly the right way if I say that I hope that your duties as Chairman of the Committee are not too time-consuming.

<P>
There are four tests that any piece of legislation must pass. First, it must be necessary or useful. Secondly, it must be proportionate-in other words, it does not use a sledgehammer to crack a nut, and new laws are required for the task in hand. Thirdly, it must be drafted to achieve the purpose for which it is intended. Fourthly, it must be understandable not only by lawyers, but by ordinary mortals, such as most of us.

<P>
The purpose of the Bill is simple and clear. It seeks to change the Census Act 1920 so that a voluntary question on religion may be included in a census of population in England and Wales and, subject to the necessary secondary legislation, so that such a question may be included in the next census in April 2001. In so doing, the Bill will bring census legislation in England and Wales in line with that of Scotland-where similar legislation was passed by the Scottish Parliament in March this year-and Northern Ireland.

<P>
Does the Bill pass the four tests? First, is it necessary and useful? These days, many groups of people prefer to identify themselves primarily in terms of their culture or religion. If we are to deal with discrimination in the provision of health, welfare and community care services, we require better information, including better baseline figures against which racial disadvantage and social exclusion within particular minority groups can be monitored. The 2001 census offers a once-in-a-decade opportunity to collect information from such groups. One need not only accept my view that the Bill is necessary or useful. It was passed without division in the other place, and it was overwhelmingly supported in our own Chamber at Second Reading.

<P>
Secondly, is it proportionate? It cannot be a draconian measure because compliance is voluntary. New legislation is necessary, partly because there are no reliable figures for ethnic sub-groups or religions. Thirdly, is it drafted in such a way that it will achieve its purpose? That is undoubtedly so-it is clearly and simply laid out, and even I, as a non-lawyer, can understand it. Fourthly, is it understandable by normal people? The census rehearsal last year clearly proved that the proposed question is understandable. The Bill thus passes all four tests.

<P>
My hon. Friends the Members for Croydon, South (Mr. Ottaway) and for Chichester (Mr. Tyrie) have tabled amendments and a new clause. Although I believe that the amendments are unnecessary-I will seek to explain why at a later stage-I am grateful that my hon. Friends framed them so as to demonstrate that they accept that the introduction of a question on religion is of value in the census. The only point at issue is how best to reflect the voluntary nature of the question.

<P>
I would like to thank the Minister and the Government for finding the parliamentary time to consider this modest measure. Without that help, the Bill would have hit the buffers of time and been derailed. I commend the sittings motion.

<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind hon. Members that there is a financial resolution for this Bill, copies of which are available. Also, hon. Members should ensure that adequate notice of amendments is given. As a general rule, I will not call starred amendments, including those that may be reached during an afternoon sitting.

<H4><center>Clause 1</center></H4>
<H4><center>Particulars in respect of religion may be required</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss the following: new clause 1-Particulars in respect of religion may be requested-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`.-After section 1 of the Census Act 1920 (power to direct taking of census) there shall be inserted the following new section-<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Power to include question on religion in census1A.-(1) The Secretary of State may by order made by statutory instrument make provision for the inclusion in a census held in England and Wales of a question on religion.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(2) No person shall be required to state particulars requested in a question on religion provided for in an order under this section and a person who refuses or neglects to state such particulars shall not by virtue of that act or omission be guilty of an offence.
<P>
(3) An order under this section shall include provision requiring a statement of the voluntary nature of responses to a question on religion to be included in a prominent position on the form which contains the question.
<P>
(4) An order under this section shall be laid before Parliament in draft and shall not be made unless it has been approved by resolution of both Houses.''.'<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
Amendment No. 3, in Title, line 1, leave out ``required'' and insert ``requested''.

<P>
<B>Mr. Sayeed:</B> Clause 1 would add religion to the specific matters in respect of which particulars may be required to be provided in a census. Subsection (1) provides for religion to be added as a specific matter at paragraph 5A of the schedule to the Census Act 1920.

<P>
It is necessary to amend the Census Act 1920 because the schedule, which specifies the matters in respect of which particulars may be required to be stated in a census return, does not provide for particulars on religion. Most of the traditional census questions are covered by paragraphs 1 to 5 of the schedule. Other questions, which may be asked from time to time, are covered by paragraph 6, which identifies
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>any other matters with respect to which it is desirable to obtain statistical information with a view to ascertaining the social or civil condition of the population.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Legal advice over the years has been that religion is not a matter of civil or social condition, so a change to the Act is necessary.

<P>
Subsection (2) removes the liability to a penalty under section 8(1) of the Census Act 1920 of anyone who refuses or neglects to state in the census return particulars in respect of religion. That would make answering such a question on religion voluntary. Although the statutory requirement under the Census Act 1920 to answer all other census questions remains, the voluntary status of the proposed question on religion reflects the particular sensitivity that surrounds the topic.

<P>
The value of including a question on religion is that when the information is cross-indexed with the information received in response to the ethnic group question, we will be better able to identify areas of racial disadvantage and social exclusion, monitor discrimination, support resource allocation and facilitate the provision of services, particularly those relating to health, education and welfare.

<P>
There are tensions in all multicultural, multi-faith societies. Disadvantage and discrimination fuel such tensions. Nowadays, many more people seek to identify themselves in terms of their religion or culture. That is the case especially among non-Christian minority groups. It is such groups that are vulnerable to disadvantage and discrimination. It is in our enlightened self-interest to lessen the disadvantage and discrimination and diffuse those tensions. Knowing the facts will allow us to do that better.

<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Tyrie </B>(Chichester): Mr. Benton, as we are having the stand part debate and the debate on clause 1 at the same time, can we have a separate vote? Subject to the Minister's response, I may want to press new clause 1 to a Division.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> For clarification, they are alternatives. I can hardly rule that we vote on them separately.

<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> Thank you, Mr. Benton. I am grateful for your clarification.

<P>
I have no wish to delay the Committee or to repeat the points that were made during the early hours in a tetchy debate in the House. I have no burning concerns about the Bill and my interest derives almost entirely from the fact that it was brought to my attention by other people, particularly members of the Jewish community, who are deeply concerned about it. They are also concerned that the Board of Deputies of British Jews decided to support the measure. A former chairman of the board wrote to me recently-I am grateful that he agreed to copy that letter to the Minister-making clear his strong aversion to the inclusion of a question on religion in a national census. He stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>My aversion dates back to the destruction of some 90% of Greek Jews from Salonica-all of whom had their religion stamped onto their identity cards. A far higher percentage of Jews from Athens, who did not have their religion stamped onto their identification, survived<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the war. He continued:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I do accept that-for entirely understandable and acceptable reasons-many believe that we should include a religious question on our UK census. If so, then that question must be clearly optional. In my view, it is not sufficient merely to say that omission of religion will not lead to prosecution.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
That is one of many representations that I have received. They set me thinking. I realised that any census is an intrusion into the privacy of citizens and I was not convinced that we should increase that intrusion without careful scrutiny. I am pleased that religion is now part of people's private space. Anyone with any knowledge of 16th and 17th century English history knows that that was not so then and the issues that led to the collapse of former Yugoslavia show that that is not so in some countries even today. We are better off with religion being part of people's private space and I very much want it to remain so.

<P>
Another concern about the census is that it will cost £254 million. That is a huge sum and I began to wonder whether we could gather the information more effectively with surveys. I should be grateful if the Minister would inquire whether a thorough study of more modern methods of information-gathering has been undertaken by the Treasury and the Government to see whether there might be an alternative route and perhaps a cheaper one to provide more detailed information.

<P>
I shall not expand on whether we need censuses in the current form, but I do not agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Bedfordshire (Mr. Sayeed) that we are all supportive of the principle of the Bill. I want to discuss the main concerns that were expressed in the other place about the question on religion being compulsory. In response to that, the Government accepted an amendment to the Bill to remove the penalty for non-compliance with the demand on the census form. However, in practice that will not take us far, so I decided to table an amendment to clarify the Lords amendment, which, in my view, leaves an unclear situation.

<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
The purpose of the amendment is to establish a statutory basis for the Economic Secretary's description of her own legislation. During a debate in the early hours of the morning, she said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Bill emphasises that answering the question is voluntary. The form will also make it clear that it is a voluntary question.-[Official Report, 20 June 2000; Vol. 352, c. 305.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Although it is true that, in the light of the Lords amendment, the Bill will make it clear that the penalty for non-compliance has been waived, as it stands there is nothing in the Bill to suggest that answering the question is voluntary. The Economic Secretary has assured us that the public will not be required to answer the question, but there is no statutory protection to ensure that they will be made aware of the fact.

<P>

<B>Mr. John Bercow </B>(Buckingham): I note the point that my hon. Friend has made, but can we also be assured that the names of those who decline to answer the question will not be centrally stored and available for potential use for other purposes?

<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> That is a question for the Economic Secretary, and I have no idea what the answer is. It may well be important, so perhaps she will answer it in due course.

<P>
If anyone doubts the Bill's position on this matter, they should read the long title, which makes it clear that this is a Bill to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Amend the Census Act 1920 to enable particulars to be required in respect of religion.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Amendment No. 3, which would replace the word ``required'' with the word ``requested'', would sort out that problem. It cannot be said that there has been a simple oversight. In respect of clause 1(1), the explanatory notes, which are equally clear, state that religion is added
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>to those topics that are specified in the Schedule to the Census Act as being matters in respect of which particulars may be required to be given in the Census.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The explanatory notes also state that subsection (2) will remove the penalty for failing to answer the question, but not the requirement to answer it.

<P>
That leaves us in a curious position. The best construction that one can put on the Lords amendment, which is something of a pig's ear, is that the introduction of a statutory provision and the simultaneous removal of a penalty is a legal oddity. As I have said in the House, I know of no other similar legislation. The worst construction of it is that the concession is meaningless. Unless those who will be required to fill in the form are absolutely clear on the matter, they will treat this question like all the others, and it will not be voluntary at all.

<P>
Subsection (2) of new clause 1, which would deal with the problem by making it clear that the question is voluntary, states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>No person shall be required to state particulars requested in a question on religion  and a person who refuses or neglects to state such particulars shall not by virtue of that act or omission be guilty of an offence.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That seems to provide exactly the protection that, according to the Economic Secretary, the Bill was intended to provide.

<P>
The second problem to which I referred-that people should know about the voluntary nature of a response to the question-is covered by proposed new subsection (3). That would make it clear that the Government had a duty to make a reasonable effort to let people know that responding to the question was voluntary. Proposed new subsection (4) would merely put the new clause into line with the treatment of censuses laid down in the 1920 Act, which states that censuses should be subject to affirmative resolutions of both Houses. Proposed new subsections (2) and (3) are the crucial parts of the new clause.

<P>
I worked carefully with the Public Bill Office to ensure that the new clause conformed exactly to the Minister's-and the Government's-stated intentions that she set out at Second Reading. If any hon. Members have any doubts about that, they should look closely at the words that the Minister used. She said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Bill emphasises that answering the question is voluntary. The form will also make it clear that it is a voluntary question.-[Official Report, 20 June 2000; Vol. 352, c. 305.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Those are clear statements, but we have only her assurance. All that I ask is that those statements be given statutory backing.

<P>
What possible objection could the Government have to incorporating the new clause in the Bill? Why did not they include such a provision from the beginning? I have no idea why they did not amend the Bill in this way in the House of Lords. However, they did not, and I have been wracking my brains to understand why the Government have not already said that they will accept new clause 1, so that we can all get out of the Committee before lunch.

<P>
I have a few tentative suggestions as to the reason why. One is that the Bill would have to go back to the House of Lords. That would be a bit of a hassle, but there is still plenty of time to prepare a census for next spring. If that is not true, why on earth did not the Government ensure that the Bill was introduced earlier? Why on earth do we suddenly find ourselves on some critical path timetable for the preparation of the census? If the Bill had been introduced a month earlier, the Government would have had the chance to table a more intelligent amendment. We should not be prepared to put such blatantly deficient legislation-which does not even achieve the Minister's stated objective-on to the statute book, just because the Government have failed to find a few hours of parliamentary time for the Bill over the past three years.

<P>
A second possible objection that the Government might have to incorporating my proposal-which would enact exactly what the Minister said was their intention-is that it would damage the Government's original purpose in deciding to include the religious question in the Bill. Lord McIntosh, speaking in the House of Lords, said that a purely voluntary question would not be worth having. He said that making a question voluntary would affect the response that would be obtained from the question. In other words, some religious people might answer it, but others who were not religious-or who were feeling less religious-might not bother. Therefore, if a question was voluntary, the answers received would be virtually valueless.

<P>
Lord McIntosh could be right-I do not know. If that is the case, perhaps the issue would be better addressed through the use of surveys. However, he went much further than that in stating his concern about the voluntary question. He said that a voluntary question could damage the rest of the information collected in the census. That could prejudice the census's value. He said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>It has been shown that making a question voluntary seriously affects the response not only to the question itself, where response bias could devalue the information obtained-<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
that is the point that I have just made-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>but also as regards other questions, because people are confused about some questions being voluntary and others being compulsory-[Official Report, House of Lords, 27 January 2000; Vol. 608, c. 1717.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In other words, if the question were truly voluntary and the public knew that it was, it would be devalued to such an extent that it would not be worth asking. Lord McIntosh may be right about that-I do not know.

<P>
My concern is that that thinking may lie behind the Government's apparent reluctance to make clear in the Bill the question's voluntary nature. The Bill should clearly state that people will not have to pay a penalty for non-compliance and that they will not commit an offence by failing to answer the question. The Minister could sort out those problems quickly simply by saying, ``I shall ensure that on Report the assurances that I gave in the House on 20 June will be incorporated in the Bill. I shall either agree to the new clause or introduce a new amendment that would have a similar effect.''

<P>
My main point is that the Bill does not offer appropriate protection-it will remain an offence to fail to answer the question-or make it clear to people who fill in the census the question's quasi-voluntary nature. We have to rely entirely on an assertion to that effect by a Minister; its relevance may come or go. The Minister gave that commitment in Committee and we, as parliamentarians, are aware of it, but the public may be completely ignorant of it.

<P>
I hope that the Minister will respond to the concerns that I raised and that she will agree to the new clause. If she cannot, I hope that she will produce an amendment on Report that will have a similar effect-we should be happy to support it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Ottaway </B>(Croydon, South): I shall be brief because I am keen to hear, and to respond to, the Minister's response.

<P>
On Second Reading, Conservative Members made it clear that we would support the Bill if the question was voluntary, transparently so. The heart of the point that was made by my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester, whose new clause I am happy to support, is the voluntary nature of the question: it is not simply a question of semantics.

<P>
My hon. Friend quoted the Minister's remarks on Second Reading. She said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Bill emphasises that answering the question is voluntary.-[Official Report, 20 June 2000; Vol. 352,<P>
</UL></FONT>
c. 305.]
<P>
She may have good intentions in this context, but did she have the power to make that statement? Consider the analogy of a motorist getting into his car-it is compulsory for him to put on a seat belt. In other words, the law obliges him to do something. If one removes the fine for failing to do so, does that make putting on one's seat belt voluntary? I believe-this is the thrust of my hon. Friend's argument-that it does not. It is compulsory to put on one's seat belt whether or not there is a fine. The Minister has to respond to that test-if there is an obligation to answer questions but no fine for failing to doing so, is answering the question voluntary? The Minister might suggest that I am arguing about whether the glass is half full or half empty. It is more important than that-a principle is involved. The Oxford English Dictionary defines ``voluntary'' as ``not constrained or compulsory.'' The Economic Secretary must persuade me and my hon. Friend that removing the fine removes the compulsion. That is the essential ingredient of the amendment.

<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
The second condition that must be met before we support the Bill is that the voluntary nature of the question should be transparent. Perhaps the Economic Secretary can reassure me on that point. Compulsion is the heart of the matter. Does taking away a penalty make something voluntary?

<P>
<B>Mr. Sayeed:</B> I should like to deal with a few of the points that were made by my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester. He suggested that I had said that there was absolute support for the principle of the Bill. I did not say that; I said that there was overwhelming support, which is rather different. He cited the objections of a constituent of his, which I understand, especially as that constituent is a senior Jew.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I do not know whether I made it clear that he is Lord Janner of Braunstone, an eminent former Member of Parliament.

<P>
<B>Mr. Sayeed:</B> I have been well acquainted with Greville for many years, and I have great respect for him. However, I believe that his fears are misplaced.

<P>
I was surprised that my hon. Friend does not recognise that to disclose information from the census that in any way identifies an individual is a criminal offence. Perhaps the Economic Secretary will confirm that when she speaks.

<P>
There is security within the census, and the idea that any British Government of any political complexion, would want to use if for political or religious discrimination is fatuous. If they wanted to do such a thing, there would be many other ways in which they could do so. However, that has not happened in my lifetime, and I cannot envisage that it ever would.

<P>
The new clause would have three effects. First, it would enable a question on religion to be included in the census. That is already in the Bill. Secondly, it would make it clear that a person would not be required to respond to such a question and would not be guilty of an offence if they failed to do so. Again, that is already in the Bill. Thirdly, it seeks to provide for the inclusion of a statement on the voluntary nature of any religious question in a prominent place on the census form. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester on that point, and shall return to it in a moment.

<P>
I think that the Bill and the census form are being mixed up. People who fill out the census form will read the form, not the Bill. Therefore, the important thing is to ensure-having enshrined in law, through the Bill, that there is no penalty for failing to complete the question-that the census form makes clear the question's voluntary nature. There is no need to include the wording of the form in the Bill. It will, after all, be subject to a separate legislative procedure in this House when the Bill receives Royal Assent.

<P>
The new clause is unnecessary. It is also misplaced, partly because it would require the passage of more legislation through this House than would otherwise be the case.

<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> Will my hon. Friend explain why more legislation would be required in this House?

<P>
<B>Mr. Sayeed:</B> I am happy to assist my hon. Friend. Subsection (1) of new clause 1 would allow for the making of additional secondary legislation-namely another order to be approved by resolution of both Houses-that would make provision solely for a question on religion. In other words, another piece of legislation would be required to deal with a question on which this House has already decided.

<P>
My hon. Friends made one very good point, which gave voice to a concern that has been expressed by others-that is, that the voluntary nature of the question on religion should be clearly understood by people who have to complete the form. I, too, look to the Minister to confirm that the census form will clearly and prominently state that the question on religion is voluntary. Should that confirmation be forthcoming, I hope that my hon. Friends will seek the leave of the Committee to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Miss Melanie Johnson) I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Benton. It would be presumptuous of me to go as far as the hon. Member for Mid-Bedfordshire in wishing that your time there is not lengthy-I could not possibly agree with that.</B><P>

<P>
I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on the clarity of his argument as to why the new clause is unnecessary, and I fully agree with him. I am aware of the concerns that are shared by the hon. Gentleman and others about a matter that they regard as sensitive-as do we all. The Government listened carefully to all that was said about the voluntary nature of the proposed question on religion when the Bill was debated in the House of Lords, and, more recently, on Commons Second Reading. We have not only listened, but taken note. Before I give our response, I shall address one or two of the issues that were raised by Conservative Members.

<P>
On the subject of Lord Janner's letter, I regret to say that neither I nor my officials have received it. I shall read it with interest when it arrives.

<P>
The hon. Member for Chichester mentioned the protection of religious minorities in relation to the confidentiality of census data. When that was debated in the House, I assured hon. Members that all census data is held confidentially for 100 years.

<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I am not challenging that.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> The point is that, as the hon. Member for Mid-Bedfordshire said, no British Government have ever taken the line with such information that the hon. Member for Chichester suggested. It is, of course, important that it should remain confidential.

<P>
The cost of £250-odd million that the hon. Gentleman quoted is, of course, spread across 10 years, because the money is spent only once every 10 years. He asked whether there was an alternative way in which to collect the required information. A review that was undertaken in 1992 concluded that a census is the only way in which to do so. Reference to that review was included in the White Paper in March 1999. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman-as a former Treasury adviser-will accept that the work would have been carried out thoroughly during the 1990s.

<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> Could the Minister say whether the review is in the public domain, and, if not, whether it could be made publicly available?

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I undertake to write to the hon. Gentleman on that matter.

<P>
A further question concerned the way in which the subject had been debated in the House of Lords, and asked whether there were any statistical risks attached to the voluntary basis for the question. There might be statistical risks involved in including the question on a voluntary basis, but our view was that those would not jeopardise to a serious degree the data gained from a religion question. Indeed, there would be greater statistical risks if there were no religious question, in that its absence would be likely to lead to higher levels of non-response to the census in particular ethnic communities. Having a voluntary question on religion is, therefore, far better than having none at all.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I heard the Minister's reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester. Given that the question of whether the review is in the public domain admits of a simple affirmative or negative response, could such a response be provided to the Committee this morning before we conclude our proceedings, rather than to my hon. Friend in writing?

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I can give him that information-it will save me writing. The Office of Population Censuses and Surveys-now known as the Office of National Statistics-published the ``Report on Review of Statistical Information on Population and Housing (1996–2016)'' in 1993. It was OPCS Occasional Paper 40, and its ISBN number is 0904952959. I hope that that will help the hon. Member for Chichester to track down the information that he requires, right down to the last jot and tittle.

<P>
I shall return to the substance of the question, which is the voluntary nature or otherwise of the question on religion. I have given assurances to the House that the question is voluntary. The hon. Member for Croydon, South put forward an argument about seat belts, which may or may not have parallels, but one could also draw other analogies in which one would not reach the same conclusions. However, this is a debate not about seat belts, but about a question on religion.

<P>
I assure both the hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for Chichester that the Government intend to ensure that the arrangements made by the Office for National Statistics will indicate clearly to people filling in their census forms next April that their response to the question on religion will be voluntary. They will make it clear that there will be a note to that effect appended to the wording of the question, and that wording will be subject to the making of the necessary amendment regulations.

<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> Will the Minister clarify whether the word ``voluntary'' will be on the form?

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I shall read the proposed question, which will be formulated through the channels that I have just described. Assuming-although one should never assume-that the Bill receives Royal Assent, the necessary amendment to the census order will immediately be laid before Parliament, providing for particulars with respect to religion to be added to those already approved by Parliament for inclusion in the 2001 census. We have already debated the other aspects of the census orders in relation to this census, in an earlier statutory instrument. Once the necessary Order in Council has been made amending the regulations, we will set out the revised census forms showing the wording of the religion question and its voluntary nature. That describes the process.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked about the nature of the information. The question that we are proposing-which I assure him will be dealt with through the regulations-is ``What is your religion?'' Underneath the question will appear the statement ``This question is voluntary''. That meets any possible objections that Opposition Members could have, and makes it clear, as the hon. Member for Mid-Bedfordshire said, that those who complete the form will know that they do not have to answer the question. On that basis, I hope that the hon. Gentlemen feel able to withdraw the amendment, but if they do not, I shall encourage my hon. Friends and others to vote against it.

<P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I am a bit perplexed-not to say flabbergasted. The amendment would have the precise effect that the Economic Secretary says she wants, but she is not prepared to give it statutory basis. Furthermore, off the top of my head I cannot discover the powers that enable her to make that assertion. What power has she to say that the question will contain the word ``voluntary'', given that an appropriate order has not come before the House? I cannot follow-[
Interruption.]

<P>

<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Does my hon. Friend not understand that, in the absence of any statutory confirmation of the point on which he seeks reassurance, he is apparently expected instead to settle for the observation from a sedentary position by the hon. Member for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen), who said, ``He's won.''

<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I did not hear the sedentary comments of the hon. Member for Nottingham, North, which I always do my best to ignore. He and I participated in the same Committee for about a year, and he made more sedentary comments than virtually all the Labour Back Benchers on their feet made put together.

<P>
I remain completely perplexed by the Economic Secretary's comments, and I should be grateful if she-or her advisers-would explain why and how her assertion is not ultra vires. In the absence of such an explanation, why should we accept her assurances, given that, as she has said, the purpose of the legislation is exactly the same as the purpose of new clause 1? It is incomprehensible why the Economic Secretary cannot accept the new clause. In what way is it unworkable? If it is unworkable, she should say, ``There is a minor deficiency in it, so we will provide our own''.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I will add to my hon. Friend's point by saying that I suspect that the Economic Secretary has been offered a legal opinion that has enabled her to say that, by removing the penalty, the action becomes voluntary. If so, I wonder whether she might meet our concerns by making available that opinion.

<P>
She glossed over the analogy of the seat belt by implying that it was wide of the mark, but in fact it was to the point. I have scratched my head to find an instance where a law obliges one to do a particular thing-most laws oblige people not to do things, such as steal. One is obliged to wear a seatbelt, but if the penalty for failing to do so is taken away, does wearing a seatbelt become voluntary? In my view, it does not, and that is the key point. The Economic Secretary should therefore consider making available any legal advice that she has received.

<P>
<B>Mr. Sayeed:</B> I think sometimes that we are trying to balance many angels on the head of a pin. In effect, we are arguing whether an act that is not mandatory is voluntary, and that is similar to asking whether my cup is half full or half empty.

<P>
Assuming that the Bill receives Royal Assent, the Census Act 1920 will be amended to refer to religion. That amendment, which is contained in the Bill, states that there is no penalty for not answering a specific question. Most form-fillers will never see the Bill, and they will certainly not read the 1920 Act or our debates in this place. They will simply receive a census form in April. The Minister gave assurances about what that form will contain. It is extraordinary that the public assurances of a Minister, of any political party, should not automatically be taken to be what will happen. She gave a public assurance and read out the question that will appear on the census form. She dealt with the worry that hon. Members on both sides of the House, including my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester and I, have expressed, namely, that it should be made clear to those who will fill in the form that the question is voluntary. That has been done, and I am satisfied. I am surprised and somewhat disappointed that my hon. Friend is not.

<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I want to make one more contribution in this context. The long title of the Bill states: ``particulars'' will
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>be required in respect of religion.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We are in a bizarre situation. Penalties will be removed but the offence will remain in the Bill. The Minister said that, de facto, the offence will be removed by the decision to remove the penalty and that the word ``voluntary'' will be used alongside the question on the census form. I am reassured by that fact. However, if she produced a legal opinion stating that the Government are not creating an extraordinary legal anomaly I should be happy to withdraw the new clause. If the form clearly states that the question is voluntary, and the Government are not going beyond the powers that are contained in the 1920 Act in so doing, I should be entirely satisfied. Is she prepared to provide that legal opinion? If necessary, I shall continue to speak for a few more seconds, while she takes advice from officials-

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I agree with the hon. Member for Mid-Bedfordshire that this debate resembles asking how many angels can dance on the head of a pin. The question involves people reading the census form.

<P>
I do not propose to make legal advice available to the hon. Member for Chichester. When he was a special adviser in the Treasury, how many times did he recommend Ministers to make legal advice publicly available? The Bill has been drafted by the Parliamentary Counsel Office, which is in an expert position to draft legislation that matches the Government's intentions. Our intention is to make the question voluntary, and there is no penalty-

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I accept that the Bill is well drafted and I welcome the fact that the relevant words will appear on the form, but has Parliament given her the authority to say that the question is voluntary-

<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> Although the Bill states that it is required?

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Exactly.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I was about to come to that point. I find that a little patience always goes a long way.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked a two-part question. First, he asked whether the assurance of a Minister, given in a public place on the record, could be accepted. I assumed that there was no doubt among hon. Members and in Committees such as this that the assurances of Ministers were worth every bit of paper on which they were written. Such assurances are regularly given. This matter needs a regulation to underpin it, as does the 1920 Act whenever it is activated or any questions are changed-hence the regulations that were considered earlier, without a regulation covering the question on religion. That regulation will be subject to debate, as were previous regulations. It will be for members of the Standing Committee that considers the regulation to decide the outcome, but I assure the hon. Member for Chichester that the form of the question will be, ``What is your religion? This question is voluntary.'' I assure the hon. Gentleman that the Government will support that wording. There is no problem with what I am saying in relation to the Bill because these matters have been checked.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> It is surely desirable that both the census form and the regulations are of a piece with the long title of the Bill. The point that I wanted to raise with the Minister before she sat down and, therefore, prevented me from doing so was whether, for the avoidance of doubt, it would be a good idea to substitute the word ``requested'' for the word ``required'' in the long title. That was at least part of the rationale of my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester. It is an entirely reasonable observation, and if the Minister can provide some reassurance it would be much appreciated. I make that point in passing, but I have received a number of representations from members of religious minorities and it was partly in pursuit of those that I chose to speak this morning.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I do not believe that it is necessary or desirable to do as the hon. Gentleman suggests. I appreciate that the hon. Gentleman may differ in his opinion, but we have made a clear statement that there will be no penalty for not answering the question, that it is voluntary and that the form will state that it is voluntary. People will not be required to read the preamble to the form. When they come to the question, it will be absolutely clear that it is voluntary. I believe that that meets the substance of many hon. Members' arguments and I am not prepared to go round the houses on the matter. I am sorry if my response does not meet the objections of the hon. Members for Chichester and for Buckingham, but it meets the objections of many reasonable people.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I recognise that the Minister does not wish, as she put it, to go round the houses, but such a prospect is entirely untroubling to me. However many times we must go round the houses, it is worth it if we can establish clarity and certainty. What bothers me is the Minister's reluctance to follow through the logic of her verbal assurances to the Committee. It is bizarre that there should be a known and deliberate incompatibility between the question on the form and the regulations accompanying the legislation on one hand, and the long title of the Bill on the other. To have the word ``required'' in the long title and the word ``voluntary'' on the census form is so patently absurd that only an extraordinarily clever person could fail to see the point. If the Treasury thinks that this is joined-up government, heaven help us.

<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I am sorry to keep coming back. I shall be brief.

<P>
The situation is straightforward. I am happy with what the Minister said would end up on the form. I am not clear that she has the powers to ensure it. The 1920 Act sets out a requirement to fill in the form; the Bill, which amends the Act, makes it clear that answering this question is a requirement, not a voluntary matter. The Minister says that she has the power to put the word ``voluntary'' beside a question that the Act requires to be answered. That is bizarre.

<P>
The matter is not one of great party political intensity, although the Minister made a number of party political points-in which there was no value-about my time in the Treasury. I want us to arrive at what the Government said was their desired position when the Bill was presented to the House.

<P>
I should be happy to withdraw the new clause, but I would like the Minister, if she is unprepared to give the legal advice, to provide me with a letter on the matter, setting out in more detail what she said a moment ago. Referring to the proposal that the word ``voluntary'' is to sit alongside the question, even though the relevant enpowering Bill says that it is a requirement, the Minister said that there were no problems on the issue in relation to the Bill. She also said that the matter had been checked. The Minister promised to write to me about another matter: I would much rather receive a letter on this one. I would like some details on how and with whom it has been checked. What is the statutory basis or legal opinion relating to the insertion of the word ``voluntary'' beside a question, although the relevant Act identifies it as a requirement?

<B>The Chairman:</B> Before the Minister replies, I should point out that the question before the Committee is that the clause stand part of the Bill. It will not, therefore, be necessary to withdraw the new clause.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> What I said is on the record. The hon. Member for Chichester heard it and does not need a letter making the same point again. In fact, he is not down for any letters at the moment, because I have already answered the point. I am happy to write to the hon. Gentleman if there is cause to do so and if he wishes it. However, on this occasion, there is no cause to do so. The hon. Gentleman wants a letter that sets out something that I have already said.

<P>
The Bill says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In the Schedule to the Census Act 1920 (matters in respect of which particulars may be required)  there shall be inserted<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the words specified.

<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> Is the Minister saying that the provisions of the Census Act were voluntary? They were not. The word ``may'' refers to what detailed information would be contained in regulations; it does not mean that some of it is voluntary and some compulsory. That is a red herring.

<P>
As we will not be voting on the new clause, we should return to the issue on Report. The Minister has not given us any assurance that she has the powers that she claims to have.

<B>Mr. Sayeed:</B> Subsection (1) sets out the short title of the Bill. Subsection (2) limits the extent of the Bill to England and Wales.

<P>
Census is a devolved matter in Scotland and Northern Ireland. The amendment to the Census Act would align the position in England and Wales with that in Scotland, where the Parliament recently passed similar legislation, and Northern Ireland, where legislation already provides for the collection of particulars on religion on a voluntary basis, similar to that proposed. The Bill would make information on religious identity available UK wide.
