<P>
Amendment proposed [this day]: No. 56, in page 12, line 23, leave out subsection (2).--[Mrs. Spelman.]
<P>
<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that with this we are taking the following amendments: No. 57, in page 12, line 30, leave out subsection (3).
<P>
No. 58, in page 12, line 35, leave out subsection (4).
<P>
No. 59, in page 13, line 1, leave out subsection (5).
<P>
No. 126, in page 13, line 11, leave out from `section' to end of line 14 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`, including the reasons for giving them, shall be published, and the matters to which they relate shall be brought to the attention of persons likely to be affected by them.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 131, in page 13, line 11, leave out from `section' to end of line 14 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`, together with the reasons why such directions are being given, shall be published and the matters to which they relate shall be brought to the attention of persons likely to be affected by them.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 60, in page 13, line 15, leave out subsection (9).
<P>
Mr. Maclean was on his feet at 1 o'clock. Had he been here now, I would have called him, but if the Minister is ready, I shall call her.
<P>
<B>The Minister for Public Health (Ms Tessa Jowell):</B> Perhaps you will confirm, Mr. Hood, that the Opposition said that they did not intend to press amendments Nos. 56 and 57 to 59, and that we were focusing the debate on amendments Nos. 126 and 131.
<P>
It is important to make it clear that we are dealing essentially with powers of last resort and that the only difference between amendments Nos. 126 and 131 is semantic. The principle behind both amendments is that the reasons for the directions should be published. Subsection (8) makes it clear that reasons must be given and it would be difficult to imagine circumstances when directions could be published without explaining why the power of direction had been used. It is important to underline the extent to which this is very much a power of last resort--the nuclear option after every other course of action has failed. We want to be as certain as we can that appropriate legal safeguards are in place, allowing Ministers to issue directions in the event of serious problems with the agency. One example relates especially to the implementation of European Union legislation. About 90 per cent. of food safety legislation emanates from the EU. Were that legislation not acted on, the UK Government would face infraction proceedings, which would involve the agency as well.
<P>
Ministers must have the power to issue directions in the event of serious problems. That is an important element of democratic control and accountability. It is also important for the Committee to remember that the power relates to serious failure in specified circumstances and is, therefore, tightly constrained. It cannot be used by Ministers simply to tell the agency what to do on a routine basis. It would be wrong to dismiss the power as general or draconian. The directing authority would need to ensure that it was exercising the power fully in accordance with the terms in which it is couched, otherwise the authority would be subject to judicial review. It is likely that the wording of any direction will have to say clearly why that step was being taken. It is difficult to conceive of a direction being given without the directing authority offering some explanation, otherwise the direction could appear arbitrary.
<P>
I have some sympathy with the ideas that have been expressed in the amendment and I see no difficulty in writing into the Bill an express requirement on the directing authority to publish the reasons for issuing a direction. That is consistent with our position on other parts of the Bill. In principle, therefore, I am prepared to accept the first part of the amendment, and I shall return with suitable wording on Report.
<P>
The second element of the amendment would strengthen the duty placed on the Minister to ensure that those affected by the direction were told about it. The current drafting is more specific in that the authority has to decide how to get that information to those affected. I suspect that there is not much between us, and I am prepared to consider further whether the amendment would more successfully achieve the intended effect.
<P>
I hope, in the light of that clarification and my willingness to take on board those key points, that the Opposition will agree to withdraw the amendment. Incidentally, the hon. Member for Meriden (Mrs. Spelman) explained this morning that she would be absent this afternoon.
<P>
<B>Mr. James Paice </B>(South-East Cambridgeshire): I apologise that I was not here at the beginning of the debate, Mr. Hood. I thank the Minister for her concluding remarks. I take it that we can expect the Government to table amendments to make those two points.
<P>
<B>Ms Jowell:</B> Yes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> That is a significant step forward. It is in line with the right hon. Lady's earlier pronouncements, and we are grateful. We shall, of course, not press the amendment to a vote.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I have to inform the Committee that, had Mrs. Spelman been able to attend this afternoon's sitting--she apologised for being absent--she would have withdrawn her amendment. However, procedure dictates that I must now put the question.
<P>
Amendment negatived.
<P>
Clause 24 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 25</center></H4>
<H4><center>Power to modify enactments about disclosure</center></H4>
of information
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew George </B>(St. Ives): I beg to move amendment No. 139, in page 13, line 44, leave out subsection (6).
<P>
The amendment would allow the agency, rather than the Secretary of State, to decide whether and how information should be published under clause 25. Surely, clause 19(3) should allow for disclosure of information on the basis of those considerations. We welcome the Government's recognition that, in some circumstances, the agency will need access to information currently prohibited by statute. The agency might need also to publish information made available to it under clause 24. However, once the Secretary of State has decided that the agency can have access to information that is prohibited by statute, he can impose restrictions, under subsection (6), on how it should be published.
<P>
The agency is an independent and responsible body, and it should be able to decide for itself whether to publish that information. It has the ability to balance the public interest with considerations of confidentiality, as I said when speaking about clause 19(3). The public must be able to see that the agency can exercise its own judgment when carrying out its functions, including providing information to the public without Government interference.
<P>
The provision of subsection (6) is contrary to what the Minister told the Committee on 6 July. He said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``it is for the agency to decide what to publish; there will be no constraints from Ministers. The agency will make and defend the case for what it publishes and what it does not; there will be no ministerial diktat or interference whatever.''--[Official Report, Standing Committee B, 6 July 1999; c. 129.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment would reinforce the independence of the agency and protect it from the overweening and overbearing power of the Secretary of State. However, we seek reassurances that the subsection would not be used inappropriately. I await to hear what the Minister says.
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. Jeff Rooker):</B> I understand the reasons behind the amendments, which the hon. Gentleman has made clear. However, removing subsection (6) would make the operation of the clause much more restrictive than it appears on the surface. Subsection (1) refers to the use of the provision for removing or relaxing a prohibition. If subsection (6) were removed, there would be no compromise; it would be all or nothing. Some Departments may take a view that, while they will hand over the information, removing the bar might be next to impossible, and they would refuse to do it. The amendment could therefore cause more serious complications than the hon. Gentleman envisages. He is right that clause 19 shows our intention to give the agency a broad power to release information; the clause extends the scope of clause 19. However, without the flexibility built into subsection (6), to which we are about to move Government amendment No. 129 to clear up a minor problem that we have discovered, it might not be possible to provide for the lifting of a statutory bar. We therefore need flexibility or it will be all or nothing in terms of lifting the bar, and the chances are that it will be nothing. By removing subsection (6), there would be no compromise. The interpretation of ``relaxing'' in subsection (1) would also be much more difficult if subsection (6) were removed.
<P>
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his amendment. We understand the spirit behind it and we do not wish to denigrate it, but removing subsection (6) will make it much more impractical and difficult to lift the statutory bars.
<P>
<B>Mr. George:</B> I, too, would be concerned if deleting subsection (6) had clear practical implications for the operation of the clause. I accept the Minister's advice. However, I ask him to respond once more, to reassure me that the purpose for which we originally sought the deletion of the subsection has been taken account of and that the Secretary of State will use the power in it only on rare, exceptional occasions. With that reassurance, we would be happy to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> It is not so much the drafting of the amendment that is a problem. I understand why the hon. Gentleman proposes the removal of subsection (6), but if it were removed completely, the clause would be unclear on how the provisions of subsection (1) would be put into action. No rules would be laid down and, in those circumstances, the chances are that there would be no removal or relaxing of bars.

<P>

<B>Mr. George:</B> I accept the practicality of the Minister's advice and, given that we will have opportunities to debate the matter later, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 129, in page 14, line 4, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(6A) This section applies in relation to a rule of law as it applies in relation to an enactment, but with the omission of--
<P>
(a) subsection (5)(b) and any reference to the effect mentioned in subsection (5)(b); and
<P>
(b) in subsection (6)(a), the words from `or, as' to the end.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Clause 25 enables Ministers to make an order to lift any statutory restrictions on disclosure of information to the agency. However, under the clause as drafted, a lacuna may exist in relation to common-law restrictions on disclosure, as they are not covered. I do not have any examples to share with the Committee, but the amendment is a preparatory provision to cover the event of a common-law restriction or bar being discovered in future. We want to lift such a bar for the agency, and it would not make sense to return with primary legislation because, as hon. Members know, securing a slot in this place is not easy. We want the agency to have access to all relevant information, and to be able to publish it if necessary. That is the only way to ensure that the agency's advice to Ministers, public and private bodies and the general public will be properly informed.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Clause 25 provides the Secretary of State and other appropriate authorities with the power to make orders to relax or override prohibitions on disclosure. The Bill deals with the problem of statutory bars but does not cover restrictions in common law. Amendment No. 129 is a simple technical amendment to plug that gap to cover any that might be discovered in future. In drafting the Bill, we examined all the statutory bars that we could find. One has only to look in the Division Lobby and at the volumes of legislation that this place has passed in recent years to know that such a search is no mean feat. We think that we have discovered them all, but we cannot be absolutely certain, hence clause 25. However, we had not contemplated the possibility of bars in common law.
<P>
I regret that we do not have an example to give the Committee, but the spirit of what is intended is to provide under the clause even more power to lift bars to information being published. It is therefore an advance on opening up information, not an attempt to close it down. Given that it moves in that direction, and in the spirit of compromise shown in our consideration of the Bill, I hope that the Committee will accept the amendment.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> With this group of amendments, we reach one of the most contentious aspects of the Bill. I am glad that the hon. Member for Rother Valley (Mr. Barron) is present, because he chaired the Special Select Committee, which did invaluable service, to which we have already referred, in scrutinising the Bill. This is perhaps the key area in which the Government did not heed the advice of that Committee, and have continued with their own intent. Our amendments are designed to ensure that the Meat Hygiene Service remains at arm's length from the FSA. The new clause, to which Liberal Democrat Members will no doubt speak, is designed to do the same thing in a different way.
<P>
It is important to understand the significance of separating monitoring from enforcement. I should like to quote a few documents, all of which are in the public domain, about what is proposed. I start with this one not because it will be red rag to a bull for me to quote Dr. Richard North like to the Minister, but simply because it seems to encapsulate the importance of the matter. In his written evidence to the Special Select Committee, Dr. North stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a significant function of the Agency will be enforcement (within the meat industry). From the outset, therefore, the independence of the Agency will be compromised as it will combine the roles of an enforcement agency and a monitor of enforcement standards.
<P>
It offends against the very principle of independence that any organisation should be able to set its own standards and then monitor its own performance in achieving them. That means that another body must set the standards and monitor the performance of the Agency in respect of its MHS operations.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He also referred to the fact that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``authorities subject to agency monitoring may well question the moral authority of the Agency to review their performance when its own activities may be substandard.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That sums up the problem, which the Special Select Committee raised in its report, paragraph 47 of which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``We have a number of reservations on the proposed arrangements for the MHS, as set out in the draft Bill . . . there is the possibility that the public perception of the Agency as an impartial meat hygiene standards regulator will be compromised''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That Committee was dominated by Labour Members. I do not criticise that fact; it shows that hon. Members who are inclined to support the Government found that they could not accept the Government's proposition that the Meat Hygiene Service should be part of the FSA.
<P>
The Government's response to the Special Select Committee report states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Government notes the Committee's recommendations. However, it believes that the MHS, with its primary responsibility being one of food safety and the protection of public health, should report to the Agency, while maintaining its identity as a discrete executive agency. Within this framework, the Government does intend to separate the audit function in relation to the MHS from its day-to-day operation.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The phrase,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``while maintaining its identity as a discrete executive agency'',
<P>
</UL></FONT>raises difficult questions about precisely what is being proposed.<P>
 I hope that the Minister will explain in detail exactly what the relationship will be between the two bodies if the MHS is to be a discrete executive agency. I hope also that he will refer to the audit function. I am not sure whether that phrase refers simply to financial audit or to the monitoring of enforcement.
<P>
The kernel of the issue is that, if the MHS is answerable to the FSA and, therefore, enforces the regulations, but the FSA monitors that enforcement, the two bodies will be in a somewhat incestuous position. Politicians of all hues have recognised that it is not advisable for the organisation that sets or enforces regulations to be the same one that monitors whether they are being enforced properly.
<P>
It has been suggested that, if the FSA were to tell a local authority that it was not enforcing a food regulation properly, the authority might have cause for concern if it was thought that the MHS was not doing its job properly, but that that was being overlooked because it happened to be part of the FSA, not separate from it.
<P>
Bearing in mind the Government's response to the Special Select Committee report that I have quoted, page 36 of the explanatory notes states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``it is envisaged that this power will be used for instance in relation to the Meat Hygiene Service, which will become part of the Food Standards Agency''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There is nothing about a discrete, separate agency; it is wholly different from the phrase used in the response to the Committee.
<P>
There are two questions. First, is the confusion over the relationship that the Government envisage between the Meat Hygiene Service and the Food Standards Agency? The extracts to which I referred clearly suggest different types of relationships. The second question is a matter of which I have made constant mention--separating the roles of enforcement and of monitoring that enforcement. It has been suggested that the absorption of the MHS into the FSA and the provisions of clause 21, which we debated earlier, would risk giving the agency the power to extend the scope of the MHS's charges. I do not want to rehash our arguments about clause 21 because you would rule me out of order, Mr. Hood, but we know that outside bodies are concerned about the implications.
<P>
Finally, we come to the question of the Meat Hygiene Service charges. Although now is not the time to debate that detail, the Minister is fully aware of the widespread concern about those charges and their effect on the viability of many abattoirs. The abattoirs are obviously worried also about the impact of the Government's announcement last week on passport charges. They will have to pay the MHS the cost of inspecting the animals' ear tags and passports--a further raft of charges, amounting to about £2 million. That existing worry about charges is in addition to concern about the powers in clause 21, as we can foresee the agency increasing charges or extending the scope of those charges, thus causing even more damage to the abattoir industry.
<P>
I rest on those points for the moment. I am worried about what is being proposed in terms of that relationship. It seems far too close for the health of either body, and for the public's perception of the agency's role in monitoring the enforcing bodies. I hope that the Minister will address all the issues that I have raised, seek to allay those concerns and explain more fully why, after they had looked into the matter so thoroughly, the Government disagreed with the Select Committee's recommendation.

<P>

<B>Dr. Peter Brand </B>(Isle of Wight): I support the comments and questions asked by the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Paice). I am sorry that the hon. Member for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson) is not here, because I was much persuaded by his argument in the Special Select Committee that the proposals would create an imbalance in the Food Standards Agency. The FSA should predominantly be a strategic body that concentrates on setting standards--after due national and international consultation--doing its own research when appropriate and then auditing the enforcement of those standards by other agencies.
<P>
The Government have sensibly decided to use local authorities to undertake the enforcement, but the local authorities will be accountable to the agency for the outcome. Of course, a big stick is available to the agency, should things go wrong. There is a healthy relationship between the environmental health and trading standards departments of local authorities and the agency, but the agency will set the standards and expect them to be met. How they will be met, however, is a matter for local authorities and, if they do not need them, sanctions are available.
<P>
If the enforcement agencies, such as the Meat Hygiene Service or the Milk Hygiene Service, are run directly by the agency, an enormous imbalance will be created. Will the budget for the Meat Hygiene Service be ring-fenced, or will the FSA have a total budget? If the MHS cannot meet the objectives set by its parent body, will the parent body have to find the money to do so?
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I was going to say that an albatross will be created, but that is not right: albatrosses are large, but can at least fly. There will be an enormous lead weight around the agency's neck if it has to spend a lot of its valuable resources, in the form of part-time commissioners or board members, dealing with the day-to-day, nitty gritty problems of having enough meat and veterinary inspectors available for all the abattoirs. It would be more healthy if the Government reconsidered the subject and kept the MHS separate. It should have accountability to the agency, but should not be run by it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Kevin Barron </B>(Rother Valley): It is appropriate for me to spend a couple of minutes on the issue, as the Special Select Committee took great exception to it. During the proceedings in private on the subject, I was in a minority as the Chairman of the Committee. Perhaps it is worthwhile saying that, at one stage, it was a minority of two. After a great length of time, we put in the word that has got the Government off the hook, but that was not because there was any closure between the Government and ourselves.
<P>
The report that we eventually agreed was my draft report. My personal view is that, if the MHS is outside the FSA, we may as well not bother. The issue arose before the FSA came about, due to BSE and related problems. We were concerned about the food chain, yet had an anomalous situation in which we were to recommend that 80 per cent. of what would constitute the FSA should not be part of it at all.
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> Would the hon. Gentleman use the same argument for the activities of LACOTS, the Local Authorities Co-ordinating Body on Food and Trading Standards? The implications for local authorities are as great, as we saw in the Scottish E. coli O157 case.
<P>
<B>Mr. Barron:</B> I accept that to some extent, but I want to develop my argument about what happened in the Special Select Committee. It is relevant, and if we are to legislate in this different way, we ought to consider it.
<P>
There was no objection to the idea of services going inside the FSA in my draft report, because I did not have one. It seemed that the issue of meat safety brought the whole subject up. With respect to the Minister of State and Dr. North, there was a heavy debate of great length as to whether Dr. North ought to have ever come in front of the Committee. His first comment to me was that he did not think that the FSA should exist.
<P>
In the end, we made the recommendation which in my personal view was absolutely right. Every time the question of whether monitoring and enforcement could effectively be done in the same building was asked by members of the Committee, the Ministers and other witnesses smiled and said, ``That's a good question''. I suspect that it still is. Initially, we recommended that the MHS should stand outside the FSA. I was not totally in favour of that, but if it did not stand outside, it would be up to the Minister to convince Parliament that monitoring and enforcement could take place if there were clear divisions. The hon. Member for North Shropshire, who is not in the Committee this afternoon, was initially against the MHS. He argued especially vehemently about the fact that, if something went wrong with the monitoring and enforcing, it would be the FSA--the very agency that should have credibility--that looked bad in the eyes of the public. To some extent, I agreed with the hon. Member for North Shropshire, but I could not agree with his suggestion that the MHS should stand outside.
<P>
On Second Reading, the Government said that they were aware of the problem, and I suggested that they should consider another recommendation that was made about looking at the issue in two years' time. If the Bill is enacted, the FSA will come into force next April, and I hope that, two years down the road, the Government will check that the MHS's monitoring and enforcement functions are being done properly.
<P>
We have had not so much a dilemma as a clear division in the Committee, which, on occasion, was as much because of a dislike of MHS charges as anything else. The Government did not respond positively to the recommendations that were made. I want to see what happens a few years down the road if the Bill is enacted and the FSA is set up next April.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown </B>(Cotswold): It is a serious matter that the Meat Hygiene Service is being incorporated into the FSA. There are a number of reasons for my concern, but the principle one is, as alluded to by my hon. Friend the Member for South-„East Cambridgeshire, the incestuous nature of the various operations that it will carry out. For example, the FSA will carry out observation and surveillance; it will set its own standards and targets, which it will then audit itself--or will it? Perhaps MAFF will continue to audit it, but, of course, the agency will not set standards and targets that it knows it cannot meet. It will then carry out the enforcement function.
<P>
It seems incestuous that it should carry out all those functions. It would be far better if the agency set targets, standards and auditing, but the enforcement was carried out by another body. There is also an argument about whether a single body throughout the country is the right answer in any case. At the time of a huge food scare, I wonder whether the agency, or, indeed, the MHS, will be considered to be that marvellous. There have been a number of extremely worrying developments in the industry. One of those is the demise of small slaughterhouses, which, in large measure, is in the hands of the MHS because of the disproportionately high sums that they are charged compared with larger slaughterhouses.
<P>
The Government should take that matter seriously. Soon, all the animals from Gloucestershire will have to travel to north Wales--a distance of some 250 miles. What about animal and environmental considerations then? Cattle reared on a small farm in Gloucestershire, which is relatively disease free, will be taken to a huge throughput abattoir in north Wales, mixed in with a lot of other different strains of disease, and then put through the slaughterhouse at a huge rate. What will that do for food safety?
<P>
There is the issue of the post-glycogen content of the meat in those large slaughterhouses. Meat slaughtered under the normal regime should have a pH of 4.5. It is sufficiently acid, through lactic acid, to stop bacteria growing once it is slaughtered. However, in the larger slaughterhouses, I understand that the glycogen levels go down, the meat becomes more alkaline and bacteria start to grow.
<P>
There are a number of issues to address. Why cannot the MHS remain a stand-alone executive agency? If the Veterinary Medicines Directorate and the Pesticides Safety Directorate can remain stand-„alone executive agencies, why not the MHS? If it is incorporated into the FSA, who will audit its various functions? How independent will it be? How will we know its costs and the number of staff that it employs? We already know that the number of staff has doubled in the past three years from 981 to 1,733. I cannot see why the MHS should have had such a huge increase in staff. If the number of abattoirs is falling and standards are rising, it should be possible for the same number of people to cover more ground. It would be instructive if the Minister could tell us why staff numbers in the MHS keep rising.
<P>
The budget, too, has risen in one year from £46.9 million to £51.7 million. That is quite an increase--almost 10 per cent. in one year. If those sorts of increases continue in the MHS and are lumbered on to the industry, which is already at crisis point, agriculture will have a serious problem.
<P>
I have grave reservations about this national organisation being incorporated into the FSA, and I look forward to the Minister's explanation as to why that is a better idea than having it as a stand-alone executive agency with its own enforcement powers outside the FSA.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Maclean </B>(Penrith and The Border): The Government have got themselves into a bit of a muddle. Clause 12, referring to monitoring and enforcement action, states that the agency will, among other things, set
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``standards of performance (whether for enforcement authorities generally or for particular authorities) in relation to the enforcement of any relevant legislation.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Food Standards Agency--the strategic and regulatory body that sets the standards for others to follow--will have, as one of its functions, the ability to say to trading standards officers, especially on issues of labelling and description methods, ``We want you to check to a certain standard x number of times every year.'' If it is not laid down in law, the FSA will use its powers to set minimum requirements that all environmental health officers must inspect all food premises x number of times in y number of years. Of course, it should do the same with the Meat Hygiene Service and tell it about a minimum period of inspection if an obligation is not laid down in Community regulations. Being British, we can always add to that minimum number of inspections, and gold-„plate them with a few knobs and bells as well.
<P>
There is a suspicion that, when this strategic, neutral, powerful, impartial body--the Food Standards Agency--lays down standards of inspection for local government staff, it will somehow be more lenient towards its own pals in the civil service, who are just down the corridor or on the floor below. I suspect that that will not be the case, although it is inevitable that the head of the MHS, whatever rank he is--grade 3 or 4--will have a closer in with the chief executive of the new FSA in the corridors of power. Of course, they are bound to have a reasonable knowledge of each other from turning up at similar drinks parties towards Christmas and they will know each other perfectly legitimately.
<P>
However, there is bound to be a smell from outside. There will be the same criticism that was used unfairly in the past about MAFF--the enforcement body--being in league with the farmers. People asked how MAFF could set standards for food when it also looked after farmers. The Minister will have another unfair millstone draped round his neck. People will say, ``How can the Food Standards Agency be neutral and independent when its own pals in MAFF and the Department of Health are working in the same building, or round the corner? They are all working together in the same agency''. There will, I presume, continue to be a head of the MHS, and the organisations will obviously not operate on the same floor. They will require quite a lot of office space and they might not even be in the same office block. Indeed, they might not operate in the same town or city if one of them is moved out of London. Nevertheless, they are in the same department. One lot of people will be local government officers, who have no right to set strategy but have an enforcement role. They will go round the Chinese shops and the food stores--Marks and Spencer and all the others--inspecting food standards and enforcing the law. The other enforcement lot will go round the abattoirs, but will be part of an organisation that is very much the strategic authority, which sets the standards of enforcement.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Like it or not, there will always be a suspicion that the enforcement officers have a cosier relationship with the FSA than local government inspectors, who may be kept more at arm's length. That will give the FSA a bad reputation. It would take only one small improper incident--one small suggestion that the head, or the financial officer, of the MHS is using the corridors of access to the FSA to influence the budget in any way--to create such a reputation. Of course people will try to influence the budget; the Minister and the chief executive of the FSA will have representatives of the local authorities co-ordinating body on food and trading standards--LACOTS--and EHOs in every other week saying, ``Tell the Deputy Prime Minister that we need more money in next year's local government round so that we can spend more on enforcement'', or ``Tell the Secretary of State for Health that we need more in our local government round''. They will always fight for money; always have done, always will. If they see the MHS getting what they think is an unfair slice of the cake, there will again be the suspicion that that is an example of Government looking after their own pals. God help us; it requires only one minute, one lobbying memo from the head of the MHS to the FSA for the whole thing to blow up in the Minister's face and for accusations to fly that it is the old pals' act again--however unfair that may be.
<P>
I have grave worries on that score. One cannot set up a new organisation and protest as vehemently as the Minister that it will be impartial, independent, stuffed full of integrity and nothing like the old days when MAFF looked after the farmers and the shopkeepers on the one hand and the consumer on the other. That has all gone, all changed. The duty of enforcing the law cannot be at the heart of an organisation if it also sets the regulatory standard. That is not necessary and I cannot see the advantage of giving the FSA both functions. There is no budgetary advantage. It is not as if there were only a dozen people in the MHS and one could bung them in a couple of offices round Smith Square that the FSA has going spare. There will not be any office cost savings because the MHS is in any case dispersed. No doubt there is an argument about headquarters, but I cannot see cost savings in that. If the Minister were to say, ``Ah, for pay and allowances or rations purposes it would make sense if the MHS paid allowances and personnel was administered by the MAFF headquarters in London'', I would accept that, but he should then make special arm's-length arrangements to show that the MHS will be maintained as an independent enforcement arm although, for the purposes of the computer payroll, it will get its money through a subvention from MAFF in a sort of contracted-out arrangement. Its payroll and its personnel service may be contracted out to the private sector or done in-house by MAFF or the Department of Health. Anyone could do it. However, the smell from such contractual relations will be that the head of the MHS will be a rank lower than the chief executive of the FSA and will report to him directly or indirectly, and that the chief executive will take orders from the FSA. As part of the same Government machine, they will have an unfair influence in standards setting and in monitoring action. Of all the draconian powers that the Minister has had voted through in Committee, that is the most draconian. The suspicion will be that the powers will not be used in the same way against an organisation that is inextricably linked to the parent body, the FSA.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Does my right hon. Friend think that, if the Government insist on including the MHS in the FSA, it would be a good idea to leave the MHS alone until the FSA beds down and we know what happens in future?
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> If the Minister were to ask his friends in the Home Office and the Department of Social Security about changing a computer system--whether for immigration, passports or whatever--and the work load at the same time, they would tell him about the wisdom of going cannily, not doing too much at once. I pay tribute to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food--it takes only three days to issue a cattle passport, so if anyone has a problem, he or she has only to dress up as a cow to get a passport. No doubt, it may be easier for some of us to make such representations than for others. The point is that MAFF inevitably had difficulties setting up that big scheme.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> No, it did not.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> If the scheme had been subcontracted to people in Northern Ireland, it could have been running instantly because they had the relevant experience, but every Department must reinvent the wheel.
<P>
The Minister will be setting up a big organisation in the FSA. Admittedly, its basis is the joint food safety and standards group--bits of the Department of Health and MAFF working together--but it will still be a massive task to launch it as a free-standing agency. To accommodate the MHS, which is having its own problems, in one body could be biting off more than we can chew. For the life of me, I can see no budgetary or office cost advantage, or any great personnel or staffing advantage, nor that any great saving will be made by making the MHS an integral part of the FSA. If the Government wanted to save on office costs, the bodies could share the same building but stay independent. The MHS should not be controlled by the FSA.
<P>
Unless the Minister can convince us that there are powerful financial or other reasons why the bodies should be linked, I shall oppose the provisions and the Government will be exposed for proposing a piece of presentational ideology without substance. I can understand the presentation arguments, and I hope that the hon. Member for Rother Valley (Mr. Barron) is wrong. If one considers the whole unfortunate picture, 80 per cent. of the FSA's work will involve the MHS--all the visits made by trading standards officers and environmental health officers and the combined budget.
<P>
<B>Mr. Barron:</B> The enforcement will be done by local authorities by and large, unless problems arise. The right hon. Gentleman is creating a bigger picture than will exist in reality.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> The hon. Gentleman says that, by and large, enforcement will be done by local authorities--precisely. The MHS does not represent 80 per cent. of the enforcement task. I do not know the total budget for local authority food safety enforcement, but I suspect that it is much higher than the MHS's budget. Therefore, there is no great merit in making the MHS part of the FSA. The suggestion seems to be that, unless the agency controls the MHS, it will not control anything important, and that the Government must show the public that they are dealing with meat hygiene and, therefore, it must be part of the FSA. That is nonsense.
<P>
If the Government want to show that they are cracking down on abuses in abattoirs or that they are making meat as pure as possible, it is the task of the FSA to set the regulatory framework and tell the MHS, ``Get off your backsides and go out and enforce these standards''. Clutching that role to the bosom of the FSA will give the service no greater power or credibility; it will undermine its credibility in the short term and in the long run for all the reasons that Opposition Members have given today.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I will do my best to answer those points, including the mythical points about the MHS, which is, of course, not referred to in the clause, although it is in the amendments. We cannot take any action to organise the transfer of responsibility until the Bill has received Royal Assent, as that will be done by secondary legislation, which the House will scrutinise.
<P>
I must lay a few myths to bed. The headquarters of the FSA is in Holborn and is being fitted out at the moment. That is public knowledge. A Department of Health press release on 5 March gave the location and even the names of the supermarkets that will occupy the ground floor, although it is not responsible for those. That is all open and in the public domain, and that press release is pinned on my office wall waiting for some scoop-seeking journalist to say, ``Look what I've discovered.''
<P>
Approximately 500 staff may be employed in that building, but I can say without fear of contradiction that there will not be a single employee of the Meat Hygiene Service based there, despite all the arguments about the nipping around the corner or to the floor below that supposedly takes place in the corridors of power.
<P>
For the same reason, not a single employee of the Meat Hygiene Service is based in Ergon House off Smith Square, where the joint food safety and standards group is presently located. We are dealing with an operational agency. The Meat Hygiene Service does not fix its own policy, but carries out the policy laid down by my Ministry. My right hon. Friend the Minister for Public Health and I lay down the policy. The policy experts for the Meat Hygiene Service are based in Ergon house. They are not its employees or operationally responsible.  No one in my experience has suggested, as hon. Members have today, that there is some inherent cosiness--I was going to say ``corruption'', but that word has not been used and it would be misunderstood--in the bosom of the present relationship.
<P>
The implication of the amendment is that the operational arm, the Meat Hygiene Service, which is a next-steps agency, would be left with the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. Everyone seems happy with that, which is amazing. MAFF gets a lot of stick, but people do not often queue up to give it extra responsibility. Usually, they want to take responsibility away from it. The whole thrust of the Bill is to take food standards and safety away from the Ministry--the farmers' Ministry--that sponsors agriculture and the food industry. No one would argue about whether the Meat Hygiene Service is 100 per cent. food-related. The Milk Hygiene Service is, of course, a separate arm of the Farming and Rural Conservation Agency. That in itself relates to dairy as food.
<P>
One cannot make the same case regarding the Veterinary Medicines Directorate or the Pesticides Safety Directorate, as they are not exclusively related to food. Despite what the media said about Whitehall rows over nutrition, there was more discussion internally about whether to include those directorates in the FSA than there ever was about nutrition, which was a subject that was settled quickly. There were two reasons why we did not include them. We wanted to keep our eye on the ball, which was food standards and safety. The Meat Hygiene Service is exclusively concerned with that subject, but the other agencies are not. To include them would have asked for trouble and overloaded the new agency in its early days.
<P>
I am all in favour of reviewing arrangements. I have no problem whatever in reviewing the arrangements that we propose, whether after three or five years. It is perfectly normal for next steps agencies to have quinquennial reviews in any case. I have no problem with reviewing after, say, five years whether the Pesticides Safety Directorate and the Veterinary Medicines Directorate should become the agency's responsibility. We decided to exclude them because they are not 100 per cent. food related. As I explained, they are very much connected with the agency, which will have a large input and, indeed, a regulatory veto on the approval of products.
<P>
The Meat Hygiene Service is a separate matter. Financial reasons are not involved. It will not be possible for a collection of money held by the Meat Hygiene Service to be filched to fund the FSA. The Meat Hygiene Service must be transparent about its charges, which are discussed and consulted on through the industry forum.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
In addition, what we collect to cover meat inspection charges is governed not only by what we his place, but by EU regulations. The input involved goes outwith this House and the current arrangements of the British Government. Moreover, the EU has an audit function on the Meat Hygiene Service over and above those that I shall discuss in a moment. It is not possible to get much more external. If we involved the World Health Organisation, it would become even more external, but at the moment, the EU has an audit on how the Meat Hygiene Service carries out its functions.
<P>
The hon. Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown) asked why charges have risen. I do not have the yearly figures with me. We discovered when we came into government that the previous Administration followed a policy of deliberately under-enforcing EU regulations on meat hygiene. It was suggested to me that, ``On a scale of one to 10, with anything to do with Europe, do not do more than three. We do not want any arguments on the Floor of the House about Europe''. That was the philosophy in the last few years of the previous Government. A policy of deliberate under-enforcement was followed--no argument; people can get edgy all they like. We, therefore, conducted a review of where we were under-„enforcing, having been caught red-handed under-„enforcing in the past two years by EU inspectors turning up at abattoirs and meat-packing plants, as a result of which there were some prosecutions. We face the problem of trying to raise standards and at the same time getting the beef ban lifted. We cannot say, ``We are not interested in enforcing EU regulations--EU Johnnies, keep out the way'', and at the same time ask, ``By the way, can we have our beef exports back again?''
<P>
The problem must be dealt with in that context. The charges have risen partly to meet greater enforcement, although I reject the suggestion that we have been gold-plating. We have not announced the charges for this year; we have not even started consultation. Every month that passes means a public subsidy from my constituents and those of all other hon. Members of about £300,000 a month to subsidise the abattoirs and, by implication, the farming industry, because we cannot collect the money when the level is finally fixed. We have conducted a second review, and the matter is still being handled internally within the Government.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> If the Minister is considering the stand alone status of the Veterinary Medicines Directorate and the Pesticides Safety Directorate, why not leave the Meat Hygiene Service as a stand alone executive agency until the FSA is established, and observe how it works and beds in? If its being outside presents a problem, he will have the power under the Bill to include it. If that is done at the same time as creating a brand new agency, how will the Meat Hygiene Service be able to police itself as an enforcement agency? It seems nonsensical to do it all in one.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I have tried to explain the difference in approach for those two directorates. They do not stand alone but are an integral part of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. They are not separate legal entities as the FSA will be. They are next steps agencies--executive operational agencies--and part and parcel of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. They are not stand-alone, as the FSA will be, as a non-ministerial dept. That is one of the distinctions that we draw between those bodies. The agencies will not be separate legal entities. There is a food-related matter that we cannot ignore.
<P>
I turn to the use of the phrase,``discrete executive agency''. The MHS is operational only. The chief executive does not create policy; he receives policy instructions from MAFF. Likewise, he will receive them from the FSA staff, who are not employees of the MHS but who will probably be at the same civil service adviser level. The day-to-day work of the MHS is meat hygiene. We do not monitor it day to day. We pay a quality chief executive to operate the service. There is not the link of a cosy relationship. The MHS headquarters is in York; it so happens that that is where MAFF's payroll and statistics are dealt with. However, the MHS operational headquarters will remain in York; they will not move to a London headquarters.
<P>
The hon. Member for Cotswold asked about the distance from Gloucester to north Wales. I am not sure why he asked about north Wales, as the biggest meat cutting plant and abattoir in Europe is now being constructed at Merthyr Tydfil, which shows that someone has confidence in the meat industry. That is not an excuse for closing small abattoirs; that is not our objective.
<P>
The hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire referred to the cost to abattoirs of last week's announcement on animal passports.
<P>
We said a year ago that the passports would cost between £5 and £10. My objective has always been to keep it nearer £5 than £10. I said that £7.49 was top whack, and that it should be no higher than that. There is a job to be done in the abattoirs, but I am not sure whether £1 or £1.50 needs to be collected to do it. While I am on that subject, Mr. Hood, and without stepping out of order, I shall give MAFF a plug: the setting up of the British cattle movement service is one of the most successful IT projects in Whitehall.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mark Todd </B>(South Derbyshire): That is faint praise.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> Yes, it is. It has not occurred by accident. It happened because we said that we wanted to do it and stuck to it. I walked into the Library and took the three National Audit Office reports on IT projects in Westminster in 1997 to MAFF. I told the staff to learn the lessons and avoid the problems listed in the reports. Usually, halfway through an IT project, an expert will say, ``Add this, tweak that and you can put in some extras,'' but that is a recipe for failure. We have produced more than 2.5 billion passports; we have also produced all the figures that I cited last week; it is the most successful operation bar none.
<P>
The FSA operation will be the same. We know the goal, which is why we do not want to add pesticides and veterinary medicine. We shall stick to food safety and food standards, and not try to cover everything. It would not be on to miss out one of the most crucial parts of the food chain. I do not say, as did my hon. Friend the Member for Rother Valley, that that is what gave rise to the agency, because the agency is not exclusively the result of BSE. It is the result of a combination of BSE, E. coli, listeria and so on, but it is also born out of the suspicion that the Ministry should not ride two horses and the paradox of a regulatory Ministry sponsoring the food and the farming industries.
<P>
Hon. Members may make a case for it, but the MHS is not loved. One could argue that its existence is subliminal, and many people would prefer it not to exist. Some would prefer to go back to the old system--the system that presided over BSE, the system that that was in place when the previous Government issued instructions to ensure that checks on feed and on abattoirs were carried out, which were not obeyed. Going back to 300 local authority policy operations checking on the MHS will not bring about the raising of standards that we seek today.
<P>
We do not want every abattoir to be the same, otherwise there would be regulations on size. We have one industry, but two cultures. About 80 per cent. of cattle are slaughtered in 20 per cent. of abattoirs. On average, about 10,000 cattle are slaughtered each day. Those figures show that there are a small number of huge factory abattoirs, killing an animal every 30 seconds. I have taken MAFF's Consumer Panel to see it. Other abattoirs, by definition, are small, killing only once a week--usually on a Monday. That is inefficient for us, but some have started to change, which is to our benefit.
<P>
Having two cultures in one industry results in problems about charges. EU regulations and lawyers' advice tell us the scale of the charges and that they should be collected as headage payments or hourly rates. That will benefit one culture or the other, but not both. I have searched for a mixture. I want a system of charging that meets the needs of those who want to invest in the meat industry; huge capital investments are made and investors should be not be denied a return from the economies of scale and efficiency that will result simply because of the charging system. Likewise, I want to ensure that small abattoirs can survive and make a living--perhaps as part of a butcher's shop or a small chain of family butcher shops--and not be put out of business because we have gone exclusively for an hourly charge. It is a real problem, and we are still grappling with it. We shall announce our decisions as soon as possible.
<P>
The area of most concern is the link between the MHS and the FSA. It comes down to the question of who can sack whom, and who reports on whom. Under EU directives, the MHS is accountable to EU inspectors, who can arrive with no warning. The inspections will be audited by the state veterinary service as well as by the veterinary public health unit of the joint food safety and standards group, which is now run from Ergon house; it moved from Tolworth some time ago.
<P>
We want a management arrangement that deals with the relationship between the chief executives of the MHS and the FSA, but, with respect, that is not a matter for the Bill. However, the chief executive of the MHS could be made accountable to a unit headed by the deputy chairman of the agency, with a membership separate from the main agency board. That break with the main board would result in more arm's-length accountability. We are exploring those management arrangements. We shall obviously discuss that with the FSA's chairman, deputy chairman and chief executive this year, so that we can meet the desire to have open and transparent audit arrangements while having the accountability of keeping finances separate. I hope that I have explained that the MHS can recover only its costs under European Union directives and that none of that money can be used to subsidise the agency's other activities.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> Does the Minister not realise that the tension will not necessarily be between the chief executive of the FSA and that of the MHS, but will be at board level? Members of the board, who will work part time and receive modest recompense for doing so, will have ultimate responsibility for an organisation as large as the MHS. That is where the tension will lie, not between the professionals.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> Yes, that is absolutely right. That is the case in the private sector, where large companies run many divisions and bitter conflict may arise in research and development or in production and marketing, and those at the top want people to keep their competitive edge. Reporting and supervisory arrangements can put a Chinese wall between the sub-groups that report to the main board, so producing genuine accountability, and people who are not part of the main FSA board can join the sub-groups. We are exploring those management arrangements. They are normal and nothing novel. We do not have to invent the wheel to find a way to provide the FSA with effective management reporting and accountability systems, for both financial and operational matters.
<P>
With respect, the public will not understand why the meat industry is not part of the FSA, given that it is 100 per cent. involved in food. I would have more trouble explaining why it is not part of the FSA than I ever have explaining the operational and policy links between the two bodies. There will be a split simply because the MHS will remain an executive agency. It will not take over responsibility for policy. Unlike the main board, it will remain a next steps agency, not a legal entity.
<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> If the argument for including the MHS in the agency is that it is 100 per cent. related to food, surely by extension, the licensing of food premises and the home authority arrangements for inspecting large food factories should be the direct responsibility of the FSA. I do not follow the Minister's logic; his argument is not consistent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I do not accept that for one minute. In some local authorities, those doing the enforcement and the checking are 100 per cent. involved with food, but that is not the case across the country. Some people who deal with the food industry are involved in other work as environmental health officers and trading standards officers. We have said that we want to maintain the tried and tested system.
<P>
We do not want to take away from local authorities their enforcement role, because they do an excellent job of policing food processing and retailing, hour by hour as we speak. There is no earthly reason why that role should be removed from local government. I do not accept that all those people are 100 per cent. involved in food operations. They are patently not all involved with food. I stand to be corrected--I know that I will not be--but the MHS is food related. If anyone can give me an example of something that the service does that is not food related, I shall do my best to explain it.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Todd rose--</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> My hon. Friend obviously has an example.
<P>
<B>Mr. Todd:</B> My hon. Friend the Minister referred to the fact that meat is food, and therefore should be treated on the same basis as any other food. A strong argument has been made about that. Will he clarify whether the terms of the Bill will apply as equally to the operations of the Meat Hygiene Service as to other aspects of the FSA's operations? I refer especially to the references in clause 22 to the general objectives and practices that the FSA intends to adopt, and in clause 23 to the issue of risk analysis and proportionality.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> They will apply equally. One has to understand that the policy instructions to the Meat Hygiene Service will come from the FSA, which will set within its functions all the issues that it will handle under clauses 22 and 23, such as the basic principles and the risk analysis. It can give orders to the MHS consistent with European Union regulations.
<P>
If a policy instruction were issued for the Meat Hygiene Service not to implement some rules and regulations to a full degree, it would be from the FSA, not the Department of Health. Something similar clearly occurred under the previous Government, even if by default. The instruction would come from the FSA, which would be the appropriate body, as it is in charge of policy. The MHS carries out the operational side of the policy, but it does not decide the policy itself.
<P>
I am making a rod for my own back. When we came in in 1997, we wanted to tighten up here and there. Occasionally, a piece of paper that lands on my desk reminds me of something that I decided a year or 18 months ago, the consequences of which I have been moaning about. On such occasions, I am politely reminded that Ministers took the decision and that the loyal civil servants merely carried out our instructions. In this case, the operational policy of the MHS will be set by the FSA.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border (Mr. Maclean) must take his feet off the desk.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> I am sorry.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker rose--</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Todd:</B> Will the Minister give way once again?
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> Yes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Todd:</B> I thank the Minister for giving way, as he is in full flow and I understand how difficult that is when there are disturbances.
<P>
Will the Minister consider a hypothetical example? Would it be entirely reasonable if, in analysing risks and applying policies proportionately, the FSA decided that small slaughterhouses needed to be regulated in a slightly different way from larger ones? The risks of food-borne illnesses are lower in small slaughterhouses, for the reasons given this morning. Could such a position be imposed on the MHS by the FSA?
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> The only restriction on that is exactly the same restriction that is placed on Ministers now, because we are currently in the position of the FSA. Giving policy instruction is one of our obligations under the European Union, as concerns matters such as the ludicrous rules about the definition of ``vétérinaire''. Those are abided by in this country via the closed shop of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons. That will be on the record now, so there will be real trouble. I have to say that I cannot for the life of me understand why anyone would want to train for six or seven years as a veterinary surgeon, only to work with dead carcases in abattoirs. That is why there is a shortage of vets.
<P>
One can train as a vet in Greece and never come near a large animal. People can come into this country because of the European Union, be stamped by the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons and then become vets, never having been near a large animal. I would prefer it if the hon. Member for Cotswold did not quote that, but there are many such people. It is ludicrous that there is a shortage of vets in training in this country, because those being trained are, by and large, being trained for other purposes. We have become locked into a definition of ``ve´te´rinaire'', which we are constantly pressing our legal advisers to check and double check, and to get another opinion on because, frankly, it does not make sense. There should be a way of policing our abattoirs with people who are fully qualified to do the job that the public requires to be done. As a lay person, I cannot accept that one needs to train for five to seven years as a vet to do that job.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice rose--</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I am getting myself into trouble, so I shall have to finish.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> Far be it from me not to help the Minister to dig himself deeper into trouble. What he has said will obviously be welcomed by Opposition Members  and, I am sure, by the industry, but people will also worry and wonder why what he said is not being manifested in Government action. The Minister mentioned lawyers and referred to people trained in Greece, but has he ascertained whether those people who have apparently qualified in Greece without ever going near a large animal are carrying out the inspections in abattoirs, or whether they are using people with different qualifications? The nub of the issue is whether it is necessary to employ fully-qualified vets or experts on meat.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> During the later years of the Conservative Government, the system of accrediting veterinary training in Europe completely broke down and has not been started up again, as far as I am aware. In Europe, there is a system of accreditation for checking veterinary colleges, but it is unsatisfactory because some of the countries will not play ball. The previous Government did nothing about that. We have tried to take action in Brussels, but it is very difficult at the moment--certainly, for the rest of this month--to go to Brussels and say, ``We want a different regime for abattoirs. We want to look at how vets are trained and qualify to work in meat hygiene'', when we are still in the European doghouse because of BSE. I hope that we will soon receive acceptance for what we have done in the past two years, and previously, because we have had to over-compensate--the date-based export scheme is a classic example of over-compensation to meet the requirement following BSE. That has been difficult, but once it is accepted, no one will be able to knock us for what we are doing. We will then have confidence and will be listened to in Europe. Then, we will be able to say, ``Look, there is a more sensible and practical way of doing this.''
<P>
I am afraid that I do not know the answer to the hon. Gentleman's first question because it is difficult to be precise and to find out what is happening. I know that people have carried out investigations into what happens in European abattoirs, but it is difficult enough for us to find out exactly what each country's charging policy is. I have placed documents in the Library after using our best endeavours to find these things out from agricultural attaches and others. I know that those involved in the meat industry have taken the precaution of trying to find out exactly what happens in various European countries, but they can hardly arrive in Europe with a Union Jack blazoned on front of the bus and say, ``We have come to find out what you are doing''.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> I quoted a lighthearted example from the article by Christopher Booker on 21 February 1989, but, on a more serious note, I want to quote a later paragraph, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``It is hard to convey the scale of the disaster that has fallen on Britain's meat industry since Brussels ordered the adoption of the continental system, enforced since 1995 by a new Government agency, the MHS. Already three-quarters of Britain's abattoirs have been driven out of business, and most remaining will now follow.''
<P>
That is the scale of the problem facing the British abattoir industry.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I do not want to bandy statistics, but the idea that everything has gone wrong since 1997 is totally wrong. I am speaking from memory, but we have inherited just over 300 abattoirs. However, 18 years ago, there were 900 abattoirs. Some 600 abattoirs closed under the Conservative Government. I know because I checked the figures and used them in the House. We could not close as many abattoirs as were closed by the previous Government because there is only half the number left. That is the reality. The idea that everything happened in 1997 is absolute nonsense.
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I have probably given a somewhat inadequate explanation of our determination to encompass the entire food chain in the FSA by incorporating the Meat Hygiene Service into the FSA. I shall not repeat my points about separation and confidence measures, which are necessary for the finance audit and operational viability. It would be stupid to claim that the provision is perfect; certainly, the arrangements will have to be reviewed. We shall be discussing matters with FSA board members, because they will be setting the scene from day one. We must ensure that we get things right. In setting up the agency, this is not a time for learning on the job. We are not overloading the FSA, but we would be if we incorporated agencies that are not related wholly and exclusively to food. I am confident that our proposals are manageable and practical, and will provide a good working method with regard to codes of conduct for the FSA and its own next steps agency, the Meat Hygiene Service. Therefore, I ask hon. Members to withdraw their amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> I shall not go down the route of the Minister's bitter and trenchant attacks on the Greek and Spanish Governments and the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons. I shall leave him to defend his remarks when attache´s write seeking clarification. He will probably reply with copious pages of boring notes explaining how good they are in reality. As someone who has occasionally made asides of a similar note, I appreciate that one sometimes gets into trouble. Life as a Minister would be terribly boring if one did not make such points from time to time.
<P>
I loved the Minister's use of the expression, ``Chinese walls''. When Ministers talk about Chinese walls, one knows that they have been well briefed by senior ranks in the civil service, who have yet to figure out a management structure that will look clean in public, so that two bodies that will in fact be working hand in glove can be seen to be working separately. It seems that the best that they can come up with is to say, ``Talk about Chinese walls, Minister. Don't worry, we will be able to answer the most rigorous parliamentary questions, and show that some people work in York and some in Holborn, although they are technically in the same department. Those people actually did work in the same department, until one person was made chief executive of the FSA and another was made chief executive of the MHS. Nevertheless, there are Chinese walls and there is no unfair or undue influence.''
<P>
I was slightly worried when the Minister said that the Department has yet to figure out the management relationship between the two bodies, and whether there will be another ad hoc committee of individuals attached to the board to look after the MHS and ensure its independence. With all due respect, before Report, the Minister and his staff need to do a little more work to illustrate the management structure and how those wonderful Chinese walls will work in practice. Otherwise, there will be a great deal of suspicion out there.
<P>
The Minister was understandably robust in his initial denunciation of some of my remarks. However, in explaining the two agencies' operation and their management relationship, his remarks became weaker and he found himself on slightly shakier ground. Many organisations will suspect that, despite the Chinese walls, the free-standing FSA will have too cosy a relationship with the enforcement authority. I accept that that authority is not in the same office, and that the bodies are 300 miles apart. The head of the MHS will be subservient to the head of the FSA, but there will be much dialogue between officers at various levels. That might create the perception that the standards that the FSA sets for the MHS--not those that are set by European rules--were established after representations had been received from the head of the MHS. Might the FSA be more willing to listen to such in-house representations than to the Local Authority Committee on Trading Standards, to environmental health officers or to trading standards officers? That may not be the case, but I suspect that suspicions will be raised.
<P>
Both agencies, being civil service driven, will go out of their way to show that they are whiter than white, that they are behaving themselves and that they operate properly. However, there will be a suspicion that the two bodies were put together purely for presentational purposes. The Minister admitted as much: he said, ``I cannot explain why the organisations are separate--they deal with food. The Veterinary Medicines Directive and the Pesticides Safety Directive are separate, but in this context we are dealing with food matters, and I cannot explain why the bodies are separate.'' The argument is therefore presentational--the Minister wants to be seen to be setting up the FSA. An important part of food inspection involves the beef sector, and he wants meat to be incorporated into the regime for presentational purposes. He would ruin his presentational advantage if too cosy a relationship were established before the management links and management infrastructure were clear.

<P>

<B>Mr. Paice:</B> My right hon. Friend the Member for Penrith and The Border discussed the Minister's attempt to counter the arguments that my hon. Friends and I advanced in support of the amendments. I am tempted to say that the Minister's vehemence increases as the strength of his argument weakens. When he responded to my right hon. Friend by discussing Chinese walls, he became more vehement but less persuasive.
<P>
I want to comment on one or two matters. Several Committee members referred to my hon. Friend the Member for North Shropshire, who is not with us today. They may be aware that a small event is currently taking place in Eddisbury, which he is attending, much to his, and to my, deep regret--I know that he wanted to participate in this debate. The hon. Member for Isle of Wight (Dr. Brand) discussed the work that my hon. Friend has done.
<P>
I point out to the hon. Member for Rother Valley that I quoted Richard North's written evidence. It matters not to me whether the Committee saw him or not. I chose his words because they encapsulated the argument that I wanted to advance.
<P>
The gist of the Minister's attempt to rebut our arguments was to point out that the two headquarters will be separated by whatever the distance is between London and York. He referred to Chinese walls and to the construction of the management arrangement, on which my hon. Friends poured scorn. He suggested that those factors meant that the MHS would somehow be separate and that the problem of cosiness, to which we alluded, would not occur. The Minister is fooling himself, not for reasons relating to the distance between the two headquarters but because the bulk of the staff will not be based in the headquarters--they will be all over the country. The MHS staff who have to inspect an abattoir in the north, the west or Cornwall will be relatively locally based. None of us knows what structure the organisations will devise for local representation, but staff will not travel from London or York each day to inspect abattoirs or cutting plants throughout the country.
<P>
I am convinced that there will be a close relationship locally between the people who work for the FSA and those who work for the MHS. Chinese walls are fine in theory, but I doubt whether they will be established in practice. An MHS inspector will turn up on site to see what is going on and to enforce the regulations. The FSA inspector will turn up one day to carry out the observation visit, under the provisions of clause 10. He might greet the MHS inspector, with whom he would be on Christian name terms, and they might go off to have a pint together over lunch. That is what will happen, although the theory is that matters will be kept separate.
<P>
If I follow that argument through, I conjure up visions of a John Wayne sheriff character swaggering into town saying, ``I am the law round here, because I make it and I enforce it.'' That is not the way for the agency to gain credibility.
<P>
The Minister referred, as did my right hon. Friend the Member for Penrith and The Border, to the assertion that the absorption of the Meat Hygiene Service is necessary because the service is solely concerned with food and should therefore be within the Food Standards Agency. However, so is much of the work of local authority inspectors, and if one argued that anyone connected with food inspection should be within the Food Standards Agency, we should absorb within the FSA--or set up another next steps agency to absorb--all the inspectors of catering premises or food production factories. They are all equally important in the production of food and in food safety issues. It does not matter whether one is inspecting a pork pie production plant or a pig cutting plant; both are equally related to food, and to argue that one inspector should be within the FSA but the other should not seems illogical. I am not persuaded by the Minister's argument. I do not know whether he wishes to respond before I conclude my remarks.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I will make only two points.
<P>
The local authority enforcement operation is not part of central Government. The purpose of the agency is to move part of the operation of food inspection, food hygiene and food standards away from central Government. The Meat Hygiene Service happens to have been bequeathed to this Government by the previous one, as a centralised system within Government. With respect, the issues are not comparable.
<P>
I would not have mentioned the distance between London and York if it had not been a common theme throughout hon. Members' speeches that everyone involved seemed to be working in the same building, down the same corridor, or on the next floor. Hon. Members gave that impression about the FSA headquarters in London and I want to put to rest the idea that there will be anyone employed in the Meat Hygiene Service there.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his intervention.
<P>
The fact that the MHS would remain a next steps agency of MAFF as a result of these amendments matters a lot less than the fact that it would be separate from those who monitor the enforcement. What is wrong at present is that the whole operation is within MAFF. The proposal is that would not all be within MAFF, and that the monitoring--the work of the FSA, to whose independence the Minister has constantly referred--would be conducted by an outside body. There would therefore be an independent body monitoring whether the MHS was properly enforcing the regulations. That is the central argument, rather than whether the MHS should be part of MAFF, which is a secondary issue.
<P>
I am unconvinced by what the Minister has said. We shall want to return to this huge issue on Report. Therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<H4><center>Consultation on veterinary products</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew George:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 113, in  page 15, line 44, leave out `from time to time' and insert `regularly'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss amendment No. 88, in Schedule 3, page 27, line 14, leave out from `time to time' and insert `regularly'.
<P>
<B>Mr. George:</B> It is important that the agency is regularly consulted to ensure that it is not being sidestepped in its decision making or in matters relating to its remit. The expression, ``from time to time'', is a little too vague. The explanatory notes relating to clause 29 state that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Ministers...will consult the Agency'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In the case of clause 29 and schedule 3, the Government should accept that the agency should be formally integrated in an agreed regular consultation arrangement with Ministers and the Secretary of State. Will Ministers, from time to time, review the policy, and, on each occasion, consult the agency? Alternatively, will they regularly review the policy, and be obliged to consult the agency only from time to time? If it is the former, my concern falls away, and there is no need to pursue the matter further. Other than that, I require an assurance that the agency will be consulted when the policy is reviewed, and not simply when it suits, or, as the Bill states, ``from time to time''.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> Without repeating what has been said on previous clauses, it is clear that there must be frequent contact between the parties concerned. A change to the Pesticide Safety Directorate will, because of the devolved authorities, require involvement of five Ministers. A recent decision required the involvement of five Ministers. Although MAFF takes the lead, regular contact must take place.
<P>
The phrase, ``from time to time'', does not mean infrequent; ``regularly'' could mean less frequent than ``from time to time''. We are having an argument about semantics, although I do not criticise the amendment for that. A working agreement on the frequency of contacts will be necessary, and the regulatory authority and independent advisory committees will have members from the Food Standards Agency. I cannot see how ``regularly'' is more regular than ``from time to time'', which is more flexible. That will be borne out by the process of working together.
<P>
This is an important area of regulation, and the two statutory committees--the Advisory Committee on Pesticides and the Veterinary Products Committee-- are set out in an excellent Library briefing on the Bill. Good working relations in terms of policy operation already exist at the Veterinary Medicines Directorate and the Pesticides Safety Directorate, which are based in Weybridge and York respectively. I have frequent contact, as the Minister responsible, with the policy directors and the chief executives. I am sure that that working relationship will transfer to the agency. Working arrangements to ensure regular contact will be necessary, but the spirit of what the hon. Gentleman is asking will be met by the practice of the working relationship.  On that basis, I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. George:</B> I am grateful to the Minister. I sought an assurance that the agency could not be sidestepped or left out of the process of consultation. The Minister has made it clear that, on every occasion on which there is a need for a significant policy review, that will not happen. On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 130, in page 16, line 10, leave out `1998' and insert `1999'.
<P>
One cannot have an amendment that is more technical than changing 1998 to 1999. It is not a mistake. Other regulations have been updated during our proceedings and we want to update the reference to the Feedingstuffs (Zootechnical Products) Regulations 1998.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew George:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 85, in page 16, line 11, leave out subsection (3) and insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(3) Section 118 of the Medicines Act 1968 (restrictions on disclosure of information) shall not apply in relation to the disclosure of information to the Agency for the purpose of a consultation under this section.
<P>
(4) Where information of a description mentioned in section 118 of that Act is disclosed to the Agency for the purpose of such consultation, the Agency--
<P>
(a) shall take account of any considerations of confidentiality attaching to the information; but
<P>
(b) may disclose the information (or any of it) for the purpose of any of its functions if it appears to the Agency to be in the public interest to do so.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment was suggested to me by the National Consumer Council. Clause 29 does not state explicitly that section 118 of the Medicines Act 1968 shall not apply to the agency in the circumstances described in the amendment, although that was explicit in the draft Bill. The purpose of the amendment is simply to state explicitly in the Bill what was explicit in the draft Bill. It would reinstate a provision on disclosure of information that was in the draft Bill. I am sure that the Minister understands that those who seek to ensure that there is appropriate disclosure of information want to see an explicit reference to that. I seek the Minister's assurance and guidance.

<P>

<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> The hon. Gentleman is under the misapprehension that the provision in the Bill is weaker than that in the draft Bill. I shall say a few words of explanation and then ask him to withdraw his amendment. That may be the superficial impression for those who have followed our proceedings, because we have not issued press releases or held seminars on the matter.
<P>
The original provision in the draft Bill on the disclosure of information on veterinary products was reviewed and strengthened following consultation. The amendment covers only information under section 118 of the Medicines Act 1968, but similar bars exist in secondary legislation implementing EU regulations, which followed the model of section 118 of the 1968 Act. Clause 29(3) now overrides them. Subsection (4) of the amendment is unnecessary because clause 19 already permits the publication of information held or obtained by the agency. Information on veterinary products falls into that category. The presumption of openness is stronger in clause 19 than in the amendment.
<P>
The change to the Bill is a specific and direct result of consultation on a draft Bill. We cannot obtain quality legislation by introducing Bills and simply resisting every good idea that comes up. With a draft Bill, we can be open and can consult. That is why we made the change from the draft Bill to the Bill now before us.
<P>
<B>Mr. George:</B> That clarification is helpful. In view of the Minister's assurance, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Government new clause 8--Financial provisions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I do not want to detain the Committee, not least because we debated much of the issue last night under the Ways and Means resolution on the Floor of the House. Arising from that debate and the Minister's response to it, I want to speak to the lead amendment because I am concerned about the implications of the Minister's remarks. I have Hansard with me, but rather than read it out, I shall paraphrase my understanding, and no doubt the Minister will tell me if I am mistaken.
<P>
The cost of the agency's headquarters in London and the 500-odd people to whom he referred in the earlier debate will be borne by money from central taxation, voted for by the House. Costs in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland concern solely the provision of advice to those authorities and will be paid by moneys from their allocated funds--a sort of top-slicing arrangement. The Minister made the point in a letter that is addressed to me, but which he has sent to all members of the Committee, that the legal authority to the devolved administrations is included in subsection (3) of new clause 8. The letter goes on to say that it does not require those administrations to pay money to the agency, but if they fail to pay an appropriate share, the Treasury can get it anyway, or words to that effect.
<P>
That, too, is worrying because of the consequences of what might happen. The devolved authorities--Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, if that happens--may decide, at some stage in the future, that they should take the matter on board and that there should not be a UK-wide agency. If we anticipate that the whole headquarters, plus the English operation, will be paid for by the House, it means that, if the amount is attributed on a per capita basis, ultimately the English taxpayer will pay far greater sums than the Scottish or welsh taxpayers.
<P>
Last night, the Minister scorned one of my hon. Friends for making what he called a childish point. I hope that he will not use the same criticism of me, because I am trying to make a serious point. The imbalance means that the Scottish Parliament--to concentrate on Scotland by way of example--has, it seems, already discussed and voted to accept a UK-wide agency. It seems to have done so in the absence of knowledge of what the cost to it will be. In last night's debate, the Minister could not give any hard figures on the allocation of the proportion of cost share.
<P>
If the Scottish Parliament were at some stage to be unsure and to consider creating its own FSA or an equivalent in Scotland using its devolved power, it would be faced with more expenditure, because it would have to establish a headquarters for its FSA in Scotland. However, we would be left with the paraphernalia already being set up in London to run the FSA solely for England, or for England and Wales, or whatever was left if the Scots were to make such a decision. That seems an imbalance.
<P>
Amendment No. 71 would require the funding of the agency to be calculated on a per capita basis. It would simply mean a fair distribution of the cost of the agency among the various authorities that will vote money towards that cost. That seems a simple proposal, and I find it difficult to accept that any strong argument can be made against it. Indeed, the reverse might be argued. The Minister said earlier that Scotland has a much higher rate of food poisoning than England. I have no idea why that might be, but if that is the case, it is arguable that the FSA may spend more of its time in Scotland than it will proportionately in England. It might therefore be argued--although I am not doing so--that Scotland should pay more than the per capita rate. Amendment No. 71 merely suggests that funding should be calculated on a per capita basis among the various authorities that will fund the agency.
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Minister will oppose the clause standing part of the Bill and will move new clause 8. He explained the reasons for doing so in the debate last night. It would be impossible to amend the procedure in order to amend new clause 8 in Committee, although obviously we could amend new clause 8 at a later stage. However, I hope that the Minister will answer two fundamental questions. What will be the share of the costs among the various bodies that will vote money to the agency? What is the justification for loading on to this Parliament the entire cost of the headquarters, when inevitably much of the FSA's work will relate to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland? It seems only reasonable to expect that the bodies representing those areas should accept their share of the overheads of the headquarters. That is how any other organisation would divide up the costs of the headquarters.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> As the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire said, we discussed the issue briefly when debating the Ways and Means resolution. I cannot give details of shares down to the last per cent., or, indeed, the last £1 million, among the various constituent parts of the United Kingdom.
<P>
Headquarters' staff will perform a headquarters' role. To return to negotiations with our good friends, our European partners, it seems that every day of the week--it probably does happen every day of the week--someone from the joint food safety and standards group is in Brussels. A constant to-ing and fro-ing takes place in negotiating food-related regulations. The Food Standards Agency will do that on behalf of the UK Government. The staff doing that job will have equal status to the headquarters' staff in London. The James report states that the headquarters must be in or near central London, so that the staff are not marginalised from the Government machine and can fulfil their negotiating function in Brussels.
<P>
It would not be fair to divide the totality of the headquarters costs on a per capita basis. It would not work. As I explained last night, the vote from the Westminster Parliament will cover the cost of the headquarters' staff for the UK and the non-devolved authority functions in England. To split it as suggested is not possible--either now or in the future. What we propose is clear and understandable, but it is not tidy. It is interesting that amendments Nos. 71 and 72 should accept the fact of devolution, whereas amendments to earlier clauses did not. The arrangements must be understandable. The idea that the Welsh and the Scots should pay for their overheads--and the Northern Irish, assuming the success of the negotiations and decisions to be taken later this week--would not be clear and understandable. We shall have to learn to live within a devolved arrangement.
<P>
I freely admit that we are in uncharted waters, but that was not our plan. The Bill would have been dealt with earlier, but it is better, I believe, for having been done later. Devolution, because of the elections and the setting up of the bodies, is an important ingredient. Unlike clause 39, new clause 8 will take proper account of devolution; it will set up UK bodies in devolved areas at the very time when those new Parliaments and Assemblies are getting to work.
<P>
As I said last night, it is ironic that the first key decision of the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly should have been to set up a UK-wide body. I am not being patronising, but that shows the maturity and seriousness with which the Members of those bodies considered what was being proposed. They could see the benefit to the people of Scotland and Wales--and, as Members of the UK Government, the benefit to the people of England--of having a UK-wide agency to deal with food standards and safety.
<P>
We have given global figures. We know the agency's start-up costs because we gave them in the consultation paper on the levy. I recall that it would cost £12 million a year for three years--a total of £36 million. We sought to get that money back. The agency's new function money was estimated to be £29 million. The two sums together come to £41 million, which why we wanted to collect £41 million via the levy. The question has yet to be decided--it will certainly be after Report--of how the contributions will be made to the agency by Scotland and Wales. Northern Ireland's contributions will be complicated because it may be an all-Ireland council. Food standards will be devolved to an all-Ireland authority as part of the Good Friday peace agreement, if it comes into operation.
<P>
There will be more interesting problem solving for those who have to deal with the matter. To do it on a proportionate per capita basis, which may have a degree of seductiveness, would not be good for the cohesiveness of a UK agency. I am not implying that the English are paying more than they should and that the Scots are paying less. The hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire has not argued that, nor did he do so last night. My remarks are directed exclusively to his hon. Friend the Member for North Wiltshire (Mr. Gray), who has a policy of using his servant to do his shopping, as we discovered in our recent debate on supermarkets. He has a different perspective on life from me--or most other hon. Members.
<P>
The agency will be funded not only from moneys voted by this Parliament but from moneys provided by the Scottish Parliament and the Northern Ireland Assembly, when it takes its powers, and it will be grant-aided from the National Assembly for Wales to carry out its functions and operations within the territories--if I can put it like that.
<P>
There will be a diseconomy of scale for a start because most of the work of the agency already takes place. We are pulling out from central Government to the agency, so there will be a board and an infrastructure. Clearly, that will be on top of what happens now, so there will be a diseconomy of scale. At the appropriate time, we will have to pull out the money on the research side. The figure of £25 million was mentioned constantly in the White Paper. I do not know whether it is plus or minus £1 million or £2 million. I cannot say. One cannot be precise, but that is the order of the global sum.
<P>
There is a distortion when we consider the total figure simply because of the operation of the Meat Hygiene Service. It is funded to a large extent by its clients under European directives. When the figures are presented, there will always have to be two separate sets. The MHS clearly gives a false impression of what the agency charges for its work. The FSA will not be charging for its work, but the MHS will because that is an integral part of it. The accounting office arrangement will change. It will always be accounted for separately in the funds.
<P>
No one knows the total cost of the agency and the cost of food standards and safety in this country. We do not know the total sum spent by local government. Obviously much work was done on that, but because of the abolition of the levy, it was not so important to get the figures correct. We proposed that local government take part of the levy for its connection costs. We had to put a global figure in the White Paper. I think that there was about a £30 million span--£150 million to £180 million at local authority level. The central FSA will take Ergon house staff, the joint food safety and standards group and Department of Health staff from Skipton house, which together totals about 350 to 400. I do not know the current figure. The agency will employ extra staff, as I said on Second Reading, many of whom will be from outside the civil service. It will be a way of diluting the culture, which will be good for the future. There will be a cost for that and for the new work.
<P>
I cannot be precise about a global figure for the FSA, but it will be less than £150 million, leaving aside local government. That includes the Meat Hygiene Service cost, part of which will come back in charges. The total will be somewhat less than that, but I cannot put a precise figure on it at present. I cannot split it up into what it will cost in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland, including the residual cost in England, taking account of the staff at headquarters doing the UK part of the job. It is simply not possible to do that at the present time. I am not saying that we will not do that, because we certainly will. I give the Committee my commitment that I hope to be able to produce more considered figures on Report.
<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Before Report, which we hope to timetable before the summer recess, we will publish the best figures available, but I shall still have to ask the House to accept those figures as representing our best endeavours at the time. It might not be possible to give precise figures for the territories until somewhat later in the year. Those figures will have to be produced in due course, because the votes in the Scottish Parliament, in Northern Ireland and here will all be transparent, and everyone will be able to add them up to see where the money is coming from and going to. It will make an interesting flow chart, which shows how money flows through the system for funding the Food Standards Agency. I shall be more interested than most in ensuring that we provide those figures for right hon. and hon. Members.

<P>

<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> In my speech I quoted some figures from the Meat Hygiene Service annual report, which showed that from March 1995 to March 1998, the number of meat hygiene staff increased from 981 to 1,733--almost doubling in three years. I think that the Minister said that, when the agency is set up, it will employ an extra 500 staff. Can the Minister tell the Committee what all those extra staff will do?
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> First, I did not say that the agency would employ extra staff. I have been trying to get across to the Committee that most of the work that will be done by the Food Standards Agency is already being done by staff who are paid for by the taxpayer, and that situation will continue.
<P>
As I have said, I do not have the current figures, but I shall provide them by Thursday. The current numbers of staff in the joint food safety and standards group are 250, or thereabouts, at MAFF, and about 70 at the Department of Health. Staff at headquarters total about 330. The numbers might have increased since then because those figures are 18 months old. The veterinary public health unit was combined with the food safety and standards group, and the meat hygiene policy group--all of those organisations were based at the MAFF offices in Tolworth--now works from Ergon house. That is why the numbers have increased. However, those were transfers within MAFF. The work was already taking place, but the staff were placed under one management structure. The figures would be somewhat higher than that now. To give a figure, I would say that they are probably up to about 400.
<P>
I then said that, once the agency is set up, it will employ about 500 people at headquarters. About 400 of those staff are probably already in post in the joint food safety and standards group. The other extra staff will be involved in new work, namely the education and information programme which we have discussed, and the thorny issue of setting and monitoring standards for local government. That is new work because it is not possible to equate it with the work of the Audit Commission. Finally, new work includes the work that will be necessary for the on-farm surveillance end of food standards, which does not take place at the moment--although that is not to say that loads of people are jumping over fences every day. We estimate that about an extra 100 people will work on that. Of course, there is also the secretariat that will service the board, because there is a diseconomy of scale. Those 14 good and true people are not in post now because they are myself and my right hon. Friend the Minister for Public Health at our lowly level in government. I am reminded that the explanatory notes to the Bill say that there are 400 staff in post now--I remembered that--and that there will be up to an extra 150 in headquarters, but not all of them will be new. The latest MHS figure that is available is 1,650. The agency's new work has to be done by someone, but it cannot be done by the current staff--I assure Committee members that there is no slack in MAFF.
<P>
If the amendments were withdrawn, we could withdraw the clause and replace it in due course. I shall try to get more information, and more robust figures, by Thursday--they should certainly be available on Report. I do not like giving figures that I am not comfortable with. I can give guesstimates and other figures but I am not currently comfortable doing so. I should much rather give figures with which I am comfortable, even if I have to place caveats on them. I hope to be able to do that on Report and, if needs be, I shall make the figures available to hon. Members.
<P>
I shall leave my argument there. I covered many relevant matters in my speech last night, and it would not be sensible to repeat that speech in Committee. When we appreciated the arrangement that was needed to get matters right, our original view was that we should probably not need a Ways and Means resolution. I did not want to say that last night. It was the House authorities who said, ``You need to use a Ways and Means resolution, sonny, because that is what we want.'' The reasons that I gave last night--they were not excuses--stood up to examination.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his usual candour, which he displayed on this occasion in relation to the FSA's financial arrangements. He said this afternoon--he has also said it previously in Committee and last night in the House--that we are in the uncharted waters of devolution. That is fair enough on the face of it, but the devolution legislation was enacted a year ago. The Departments have had much time to think through all of the relevant spin-„offs. The Minister appears to question that, but the legislation was enacted a year ago. The Parliaments and Assembly were established only recently, but the legislation was enacted some time ago.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> With respect, one has to be fair to the staff. The legislation was enacted, but we are dealing with a separate elected Parliament that has its own staff, offices and Executive. Thought was given to the necessary working arrangements, but one has to deal with staff in post and one could begin to do that only after the elections, when the Parliaments were established. Negotiations are taking place and arrangements are falling into place as we speak. That could not have been done between last September and the parliamentary elections. I am giving an honest answer to what is, I must say, a cheap political point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I am sorry that the Minister feels that way. As always, I have tried to make constructively critical comments. The staff have been in place all that time--they were already in the Scottish Office. However, I shall leave the issue at that.
<P>
I want to discuss the Minister's comments on the total cost. If I understood him correctly, he said that it would be in the order of £150 million--
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> Less.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> Or less. The figure includes the cost of the MHS. Last night, I quoted the figure of £300 million, which the Minister did not refute, although he may have missed my remark. I arrived at that sum by using figures that he and the Government produced. I believe that 515,000 premises would have been charged under the levy scheme. About 25,000 of those would have been exempted under the original proposals, and 490,000 would have been liable. The Minister also said that, in the event--I accept that the matter may have been misconstrued--the whole cost had to be repaid with the levy, and the charge would have been £600 per premises.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> No, I did not. I may have got trapped that day, but my hon. Friend the Member for Rother Valley asked a question, and I gave an honest answer. However, it was not made clear at the time that the £600 figure included the transfers and charges to the Meat Hygiene Service. My answer should have been, ``Yes, in a black and white world, but you have to knock out the money that comes back in from MHS charges''. The comparison was not strictly fair.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for clearing that up. I had simply multiplied 490,000 by the £600 figure. I accept that the Meat Hygiene Service charge income--which, as we have discussed, is onerous for the businesses that have to pay it--had not been taken out of the calculation.
<P>
Clearly, it would be absurd to press to a vote an amendment to a clause that is about to be removed from the Bill. I, therefore, accept the Minister's undertaking--
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> When my hon. Friend the Member for Rother Valley asked the question, he also included the totality of the local authority work. That was where the hare was running. As I said a few minutes ago, nobody knows the exact local authority figure, but the White Paper gave a figure of between £150 million and £180 million. Nobody ever contemplated all of that work being done at the centre. The premise of my hon. Friend's question was that, if it were done at the centre, the money would have to be collected. That is another £150 to £180 million knocked off the hon. Gentleman's figure.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paice:</B> I am always wary when people start talking about hares running. All of mine run. Judging by the Minister's responses, the Food Standards Agency will soon be paying for its own existence. Nevertheless, in the light of what the Minister said, and his undertaking to return on Report with substantive figures--which, as he rightly said, will have to appear in votes and estimates at some stage--I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

Clause 39 disagreed to.

Clauses 40 to 42 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
