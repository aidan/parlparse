<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030972000090"></a>The
Chair:</b> Good morning. I have a few housekeeping
announcements. First, hon. Members may remove their jackets if they
wish to do so. Will hon. Members please ensure that mobile phones,
pagers and other electronic devices are switched off?</div>
<a name="10030972000012"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have a
small but significant announcement. I have taken an executive decision
as Chair and decided, exceptionally, to admit a manuscript amendment
this morning, because it is necessary to make a technical amendment to
the long title of the Bill to make it make sense. Given the proximity
of this process to a general election; the fact that there is, I
understand, general consensus; the desirability of getting the Bill on
to the statute book; and the fact that the amendment is not in any way
contentious, it would not be in the public interest to delay the
process by forcing the Bill back on to the Floor of the House on
another Friday. For those reasons alone&#151;this should not be taken
as a precedent&#151;I have decided to accept the manuscript
amendment.</div>

of existing procedure in Sustainable Communities Act
2007</div><a name="10030972000013"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question
proposed</i>, That the clause stand part of the
Bill.</div><a name="10030972000014"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10030972000091"></a><b class="B">Alistair
Burt</b> (North-East Bedfordshire) (Con): Thank you very much
for your comments on the technical aspects of the Bill, Mr.
Gale; they will be enormously helpful to the Bill&#146;s passage, to
all its supporters, and to the work of the Committee this morning. I am
sure that I speak on behalf of all colleagues present when I say that
we are pleased to be under your chairmanship. We thank you for the
speed and typical clarity with which you have made a decision that
enables us to move on.</div>
<a name="10030972000015"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 1 is
not the most substantive part of this short Bill. The substantive
elements are in clause 2, and I will talk about the Bill more widely
when I speak to that. The Bill is a short amendment to the Sustainable
Communities Act 2007. It seeks to open up the work of local communities
to greater transparency, and to enable them to make suggestions,
through a selector body, to central Government to assist the work of
local communities.</div>
<a name="10030972000016"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 1 is
designed to make it easier for Government to deal with the range of
proposals that have come forward under the 2007 Act, and those that we
hope will come forward. The clause seeks to enable the selector
body&#151;in this case the Local Government Association&#151;to put
proposals to Government, on which they will make decisions. It enables
the Government to deal with those proposals in part, rather than simply
as a whole. I invite 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column4" />Column number: 4</div>the Minister, whose presence we all welcome, to say more about how that
will assist the Government to deal with the aims and purposes of the
2007
Act.</div><a name="10030972000017"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030972000092"></a>The
Chair:</b> Just before I call the Minister, one thing I should
have mentioned is that copies of the manuscript amendment&#151;it is
not a dramatically big document&#151;are available on the Table if
Members do not already have it. Given the nature of these proceedings,
I am perfectly happy to accept not a Second Reading debate, but a
slightly broader debate on clause 1, if that will facilitate the later
processes of the Bill.</div>
<a name="10030972000018"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030972000093"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local
Government (Barbara Follett):</b> It is a pleasure to serve
under your chairmanship, Mr. Gale. Like the hon. Member for
North-East Bedfordshire, I am grateful to you for accepting the
manuscript amendment, which will enable us to give the Bill a fairer
wind. I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on getting his Bill to this
stage, and on piloting it through the House with such skill.</div>
<a name="10030972000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">There was a
debate on Second Reading on whether clause 1 would enable the Secretary
of State to delay making a decision to implement a proposal. When the
2007 Act was in Committee and the current process was being debated,
the Government&#151;and I expect some hon. Members here as
well&#151;assumed that one proposal would equal one ask for
Government action. It is clear that that is not the case. As I said on
Second Reading, there were 199 shortlisted proposals, but they totalled
242 requests for Government action.</div>
<a name="10030972000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
enables the Government to address each individual concern. Implementing
a proposal in part means being able to implement one ask of Government
while deciding not to implement the other&#151;having given reasons,
of course&#151;or not to do so immediately. The clause will not delay
decisions, but will enable the Secretary of State to make them relate
to what local authorities actually ask for; it could expedite
decisions. We see this as a common sense clause and welcome its
inclusion in the
Bill.</div><a name="10030972000021"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<a name="10030972000022"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Clause 1

<h4 class="hs_8Clause">Clause
2</h4><a name="10030972000005"></a><div class="hs_7SmCapsHdg">New
procedure for proposals under Sustainable Communities
Act</div><a name="10030972000023"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

Bill.</div>
<a name="10030972000024"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030972000094"></a>Alistair
Burt:</b> Clause 2 contains the meat of this short Bill. With
your permission, Mr. Gale, perhaps I could say something
about the Bill more widely under this clause. It gives me an
opportunity to thank those on whose shoulders I stand, and who put in
place the original foundations on which the Bill has been built. It is
a pleasure to welcome in person to the Committee my hon. Friend the
Member for Ruislip-Northwood, who piloted the Sustainable Communities
Act 2007 through the House. The hon. Member for Stroud, a long-standing
friend and colleague of mine in the House, has a commitment to the
cause. Along with the hon. Member 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column5" />Column number: 5</div>for Falmouth and Camborne, who is not able to be here this morning, he
took a leading part in picking up the proposals originally made by the
Local Works campaign to open up the processes of government.</div>
<a name="10030972000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">Local Works
built a remarkable coalition of organisations, including the Federation
of Small Businesses, the National Federation of SubPostmasters, the
Woodland Trust, the Campaign for Real Ale and others, to create a
series of meetings up and down the country at which local communities
expressed their interest in doing rather more in the processes of
government than they had been able to do. From those meetings, the idea
came forward&#151;picked up by my hon. Friend the Member for
Ruislip-Northwood in his Bill&#151;of a sustainable communities Act
to address what so many people had seen in their communities over the
years: a loss of facilities, the emergence of what was termed
&#147;ghost-town Britain&#148;, and the feeling in some communities
that for reasons unknown to them they had been unable to control the
forces that had changed the face of their area. They wanted to do
something about it, and engaging both local and national Government in
a different way provided the opportunity and the answer.</div>
<a name="10030972000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">Through the
work and effort of people at a local level, such as those involved in
Local Works and the coalition, and through the skilled efforts of a
number of colleagues in Parliament, including those whom I have just
mentioned, the Sustainable Communities Act 2007 came into being. I
suspect that we would all say that none of that would have emerged had
it not been for the consistent and extraordinary efforts of
Mr. Ron Bailey&#151;he may be listening to these
remarks&#151;who did so much to bring together the various interests,
and who worked hard with Government to ensure that the original Bill
came through.</div>
<a name="10030972000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">As is only
fair, I started my comments by recognising that I have been able to
build on that remarkable work and, a short time after the passage of
the Act, am able to make a couple of amendments. That is how we have
reached the position that we are in this morning. The two substantial
amendments made by clause 2 relate to the ability of the process to be
repeated and the wider engagement of parish and town
councils.</div>
<a name="10030972000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, on the
ability of the process to be repeated, I believe that it was always the
intention of Government and the promoter of the Bill that the
provisions of the 2007 Act should not stand alone. They should not be a
one-off opportunity for local communities to come together, with the
support of their local councils, to submit proposals for the
improvement of an area to an entity termed the selector&#151;that
turned out to be the Local Government Association&#151;and for that
selector to put proposals to Government, which would pronounce on them
and engage the processes to bring them into life. It was always
envisaged that there would be subsequent invitations for the process to
continue, but that was not put in the original Bill. Accordingly,
clause 2(2) on subsequent invitations and proposed new section 5B on
the power to make regulations provide the opportunity to set a date
both by which the next round should commence and for regulations to
come forward to ensure that this will be a continuing
process.</div>
<a name="10030972000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
appropriate for me to thank the Minister for her hard work and
commitment to the issue, and her colleagues in the Department for
Communities and Local Government, Paul Phipps and Clare Cooper in
particular, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column6" />Column number: 6</div>for their hard work on the drafting. Perhaps the Minister will explain
how she would intend the Bill to be used by Government to ensure that
the process is continuous.</div>
<a name="10030972000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">The point of
the Bill is that beyond this building the original Act inspired a huge
burst of enthusiasm; if I remember rightly, some 301 proposals
eventually reached the selector, of which 199 were put forward to the
Government. None of us wishes to see that enthusiasm curtailed in any
way; by providing an opportunity for subsequent invitations, we hope to
encourage
it.</div><a name="10030972000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second aim of the clause was to include parish and town councils. The
technical amendment to which you referred, Mr. Gale, arises
because town councils are technically and legally part of the parish
council domain. There is therefore no need to put the term &#147;town
council&#148; in the Bill, and that is what must be changed at the
end of the Bill, in the long title. Some of us live in areas where
parish councils are a vibrant part of the community. I have more than
50 of them in my constituency, together with five town councils.
Including parish and, by implication, town councils in the processes by
ensuring that local councils will involve them matters a great deal to
them.</div>
<a name="10030972000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">I pay tribute
to the work of the parish and town councils in my constituency. They do
a great job and engage a large section of the population. My work would
be made immeasurably more difficult if I did not have the active
engagement of the community, as represented by the local parish
councils, with their views, opinions and helpful advice on a whole
range of issues, from the planning issues that affect their high
streets and village streets, to concerns about community safety and
their ideas on how to look after and promote the interests of young
people in their
area.</div><a name="10030972000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
meat of clause 2 enables subsequent invitations to be brought forward
and engages parish and town councils. I hope that the sentiments behind
it are wholly in line with the original aims of
the promoter of the Sustainable Communities Act 2007. With the
encouragement of the Government, I hope that the measures will ensure
that there is a legislative vehicle to bring forward any good
intentions. I commend the clause to the
Committee.</div><a name="10030972000034"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10030972000095"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Drew</b> (Stroud) (Lab/Co-op): I am delighted to serve
under your chairmanship, Mr. Gale. I declare an interest as
a parish and town councillor; in fact, I was at a town council meeting
last night, but don&#146;t tell the Whips. I fear my town council
more than I fear them, but I should have been in two places at the same
time.</div>
<a name="10030972000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">I concur with
what the hon. Gentleman says. I value the fact that I am still a town
councillor; as my old friend Stephen Wright says, that is the first,
not the lowest, level of government. It does an enormous
amount of good. Parish and town councils should be part of
the process that we are discussing, because they have ways and means of
generating ideas that can go to other levels of government. Most
particularly, however, people want to know that their
communities are being listened
to.</div><a name="10030972000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Bill, for all the reasons given by the hon. Gentleman&#151;my
friend&#151;is about enhancing the excellent Sustainable Communities
Act 2007. The hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood did immense and
valuable work 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column7" />Column number: 7</div>on that Act to get it through Parliament, as did our friends the hon.
Member for Falmouth and Camborne and Ron
Bailey.</div><a name="10030972000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is the start of a process. It is not only about a bit of legislation
that needs to be put on the statute book, but about changing the
building blocks of our democracy. My hon. Friend the Minister has been
immensely helpful in listening to our pleas and will, I hope, ensure
that the legislation is passed without too much of a hitch. More than
anything, however, the issue is to get the Government thinking about
doing things in a different way, as they are doing through Total Place.
We know that our democracy is in some difficulty at the moment. This
Bill and its predecessor Act can start putting things right, which is
why I am delighted to serve on the Committee. I wish it Godspeed and
hope that it will change all our
lives.</div><a name="10030972000070"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.45
am</div><a name="10030972000038"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10030972000096"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Nick Hurd</b> (Ruislip-Northwood) (Con): I congratulate my
hon. Friend the Member for North-East Bedfordshire on his excellent
work in stewarding this important supplementary Bill through this
place. He has been extraordinarily generous in his remarks about
others, but he has done a wonderful job
himself.</div><a name="10030972000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
reinforce my hon. Friend&#146;s important point about the need to
send a signal to communities that the process provided for in the
Sustainable Communities Act 2007 was not a one-off process. It has
aroused considerable interest and a sense of possibility&#151;a sense
that local communities can get together, change things and make a
difference in their area. People want to know more about how the
process works. Those who have not participated&#151;quite a lot of
local authorities have adopted a wait-and-see approach to get a sense
of whether the first wave has actually resulted in anything
substantial&#151;are watching the process carefully. They need to
receive a signal from this place that there is cross-party consensus on
the value of the process put in place in the 2007 Act, that the process
was not a one-off, and that there will be future opportunities to
participate. As my hon. Friend says, clause 2 is the meat of the Bill,
in terms of sending that
signal.</div><a name="10030972000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
also add the rider that it is imperative that the Government do their
job, as regards the selector, by getting some proposals and approvals
through the first wave in good time, preferably before the general
election. The message would then go out that the Act has changed
things, that the process is not a one-off, and that it would be worth
getting involved in future processes. That is why the clause is so
important, and I congratulate my hon. Friend on the way in which he has
presented
it.</div><a name="10030972000041"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10030972000097"></a><b class="B">John
Battle</b> (Leeds, West) (Lab): As someone who has not been an
overactive participant as regards this Bill, and certainly its
predecessor, may I congratulate all those hon. Members who have driven
the Bill through the House? We in this House rightly think that it is a
great achievement to get a Bill on the statute book, but we sometimes
think that that itself is the process. It is important, however, to see
the Bill and all the energy that has gone into it not as an event in
itself, but as driving a dynamic and enduring process in communities.
As the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood says, those 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column8" />Column number: 8</div>councils that are currently sitting on the sidelines waiting to see what
happens need to get engaged and learn from the best practice of other
communities, so that we have a bottom-up process that drives through
new democratic
thinking.</div><a name="10030972000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
completely underline what my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud said. We
sometimes look at the pyramid of politics, rather than looking at
inverting that pyramid. We want to renew faith in politics, and we need
to drive that from the base upwards, so that we engage people and they
can see the point of moving to different dimensions of politics. The
Bill will be a very helpful tool in engaging people in what matters to
their daily lives. In that respect, the fact that the Bill will pass
through the House and be put on the statute book should not be seen as
an achievement in itself; it is a process to be engaged with for ever
to make ours a better and more dynamic society in which people&#146;s
voices actually
matter.</div><a name="10030972000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
thank hon. Members, the Minister, and others who have been mentioned,
who have put so much energy into driving the process forward. I will
treat the day on which we cap off the Bill, and it is enacted, as the
starting gun. There have been some initial stirrings, but let it go
forth from here to really drive forward democracy and
engagement.</div><a name="10030972000044"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10030972000098"></a><b class="B">Tom
Levitt</b> (High Peak) (Lab): It is a pleasure to serve under
your chairmanship, Mr. Gale. It is also a pleasure to
support the Bill, which was introduced by the hon. Member for
North-East Bedfordshire, with whom I have worked on several issues over
the years. I am pleased to see the Bill going forward with such support
today. Like my right hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, West, I have not
been actively involved in its progress, apart from having chaired a
meeting at which the Bill was launched a few weeks ago, in my capacity
as chair of the Community Development Foundation. It is with that hat
on that I say all speed to the Bill. I hope that my hon. Friend the
Member for Stroud will send my good wishes to Stephen Wright. I
remember Stephen from the start of my political career, when I was a
member of Cirencester town
council.</div><a name="10030972000045"></a>

<a name="10030972000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the hon.
Member for North-East Bedfordshire says, we should recognise the great
importance of parishes, and the fact that some parish councils are more
effective than others&#151;the Bill gives some parishes the impetus
to perhaps be a little more active&#151;but it is important not to
forget that there are parts of the country that are not parished. The
two largest conurbations in my constituency, Buxton and Glossop, are
not parished, but they are not excluded from the process.</div>
<a name="10030972000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">As for
engaging with communities in the way envisaged in the Bill and its
predecessor, that is really a question of empowering them to take on
board the Bill&#146;s provisions, and complementary provisions such
as the community call for action, which was in Government legislation.
It is also about recognising that democracy does not just

governors and the governed is valuable and precious, and can deliver
far more than has perhaps been the case hitherto, in terms of giving
ordinary people power over what goes on in their communities. It also
recognises that a community is not a rigidly defined body; it is
organic, and can be defined in different ways for different purposes.
That has been taken on board as well.</div>
<a name="10030972000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">With all that
experience, and having watched the progress of the Bill and its
predecessor from the outside, I am sure that we do not want to delay
the inevitable success of the Bill any longer, and I wish the hon.
Member for North-East Bedfordshire the best of
luck.</div><a name="10030972000050"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030972000101"></a>Barbara
Follett:</b> As the hon. Member for North-East Bedfordshire
and others said, clause 2 is the meat of the Bill, and it will enable
the process&#146;s continued future. We have said in the House that
we believe that all those who have experienced the 2007 Act so far need
to have a say in its future. It would be foolish to change the system
without asking those on the front line what changes they would like. I
am happy to restate the Government&#146;s intention of inviting more
proposals in the future. Clause 2 will enable that future process to
adapt and evolve in a way that is
necessary.</div><a name="10030972000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
my right hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, West, and my hon. Friend the
Member for Stroud emphasised, to make the process dynamic, we have to
make it adaptable and flexible, and we have to base it on the
experience and wishes of local councils and the people whom they
represent. All too often, politics&#151;which every person engages in
every day&#151;is represented as something that happens to people,
not with them. The Government would like a shift in that kind of
thinking.</div><a name="10030972000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
2007 Act gives power to those who want to see changes in their
neighbourhood. I am particularly keen on that, because I have a
constituency that is both rural and urban. I would like to empower the
rural side, where parish councils are particularly important. It is
right that people should have the chance to shape how the Act changes
and develops in the future, and I hope that that is the direction that
politics will take.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030972000102"></a>Alistair
Burt:</b> I will speak on this clause very briefly,
Mr. Gale, because it gives me a chance to thank colleagues
on the Committee. Clause 3 is at the technical end of the Bill, and we
will deal with the technical amendment after discussion on the clause,
which I commend to the
Committee.</div><a name="10030972000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
was no deliberate intent to bring this about when the Committee was put
together, but it does contain rather a large number of old friends who
will 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column10" />Column number: 10</div>not be in the next Parliament: the hon. Member for Calder Valley, the
right hon. Member for Leeds, West, the hon. Member for High Peak, the
hon. Member for Bolton, South-East, and my right hon. Friend the Member
for Skipton and Ripon. I leave it to the Committee to work out with
which of those I spent an evening in a blues bar in New York, in the
sort of circumstances that the media just do not understand. The visits
to institutions abroad that we undertake together create the
relationships that, when we return to this country, make this place
work in the very special way that it does; they can be relationships
with Members across the Floor, which I think people outside find hard
to understand. I did not find it difficult to raise the Committee, and
I am grateful to all Members for taking part.</div>
<a name="10030972000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will
particularly miss my right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and
Ripon, an outstanding Local Government Minister, who understood the
needs of local communities at a very early stage, when my colleagues
were busy centralising everything. My right hon. Friend&#146;s voice
of sanity on many issues will be particularly missed in my party. I am
grateful to all members of the Committee and, of course, to the
Minister, who has been very kind during the Bill&#146;s stages. We
will miss her, and we thank her enormously for her work in the east of
England, and as a Minister. With that, Mr. Gale, I commend
clause 3 and thank colleagues for their involvement in the Bill
today.</div><a name="10030972000059"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030972000103"></a>Barbara
Follett:</b> I would like to add my thanks to those of the
hon. Member for North-East Bedfordshire, and particularly thank all
those who are on the Committee&#151;and those who are not&#151;who
have worked so hard to get the Bill to the stage that it is at today.
We can be proud of the Bill, and I commend it to the
House.</div><a name="10030972000060"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10030972000104"></a>Alistair
Burt:</b> I beg to move a manuscript amendment, in the title,
line 1, leave out from &#145;2007&#146; to end of line
3.</div><a name="10030972000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
purpose of the amendment is to shorten the title. The Committee will
note that the original title refers to making</div>

regarding town and parish councils, local decision-making and

fact, there will be no expenditure imposed by the Bill and, as I
mentioned earlier, town councils are covered legally and statutorily by

accurate, and to satisfy parliamentary counsel, the amendment will
leave out everything from &#147;2007&#148; to the end. I hope that
that technical amendment is convenient to the Committee and the House,
and I thank you, Mr. Gale, for the opportunity to make
it.</div><a name="10030972000065"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Manuscript
