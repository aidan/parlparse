Mark Harper</b> (Forest of Dean) (Con): I will not trouble the
Committee for too long. I just think that now is a useful opportunity
to ask the Solicitor-General to look again at the provision before we
return to it on Report. She will be aware that in February the
Department for Transport published a consultation paper on improving
access to taxis. I think that all the responses are back, but I have
not seen any information from the Department. I think it is in order to
discuss the matter because one option in the consultation document
requires primary legislation. Given that we are transferring measures
from the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 to the Bill, a change is
needed in the provision on which the Government were
consulting.</div><a name="09070260000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will
the hon. and learned Lady touch on where the consultation process has
got to, describe the responses and say what the Department for
Transport is likely to do? If primary legislation is the option
favoured by the Government, the measure will need to be amended. A
specific option is to allow local authorities to enforce section 36 of
the DDA on taxis to ensure that the policy takes place in actuality
rather than just in
name.</div><a name="09070260000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">Without
veering too far from the Bill, it might be helpful to explain the
changes. The Government have been consulting on how to improve access
to licensed taxis and equality of opportunity for disabled people. A 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column622" />Column number: 622</div>number of local authorities have implemented an accessible-taxi policy,
but a lot have not and only about half the licensed taxis in the
country can be described as wheelchair-accessible. I assume from the
words &#147;can be described&#148; as wheelchair-accessible that
that is being
generous.</div><a name="09070260000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
one third of licensing authorities, less than 10 per cent. of taxis are
wheelchair-accessible and 16 authorities have no wheelchair-accessible
taxis. Just copying across the DDA regulations to the Bill means that
that state of affairs will continue, which is not
satisfactory.</div><a name="09070260000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government have been consulting on a policy to improve access to taxi
fleets in line with the objectives under the clause to improve access
to jobs and enable people to have better access to services and other
social networks. That is squarely within the goods and services
measures in the Bill and their attempt to improve accessibility for
people. Recent court cases have highlighted or challenged local
authority policies that require a proportion of taxi fleets to be
wheelchair-accessible. The Government were looking at using
regulation-making powers under the DDA to require local authorities to
have an accessibility standard for a taxi fleet in their area and
ensure compliance. One policy option is primary legislation that would
require changes under the Bill. Another is the introduction of an
accessible-taxi standard by 2025. The third option is the introduction
of a standard in line with the existing enhanced standard by 2025, or
application of an interim standard in urban areas and areas with high
levels of illness by
2020.</div><a name="09070260000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
options clearly have different costs. The first, unsurprisingly, would
be the most expensive, with a value of around &#163;2.7 million,
although the benefits have not been calculated. The benefits would be
significant and, I suspect, would outweigh the costs. It would be
helpful if the Solicitor-General set out where the DFT has got to. If
changes are needed in primary legislation, they are clearly not here
now. If there are to be such legislative changes, perhaps she will say
whether we are likely to have them on Report and when that is likely to
be, because it might be a good opportunity to introduce the
amendments.</div><a name="09070260000037"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09070260000274"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Tim Boswell</b> (Daventry) (Con): As the Committee may
know&#151;my hon. Friend does&#151;I preceded him some time ago in
holding Conservative Front-Bench responsibilities on disability. It is
obviously an area of great importance in terms of services. The
important thing is that there is adequate supply of vehicles to get
people with disabilities to where they wish to go, which should be the
main objective. I am not for a moment suggesting that that objective is
not shared between us&#151;it is. However, there is a long history in
a range of subjects, from the conduct of further education colleges,
for which I had some responsibility at one stage, through accessible
taxis to a variety of other cases on which the House legislates and
local authorities do as little as possible until the last possible
moment and are then forced and dragged into doing better. Intervening
legislation since the DDA was designed to sharpen up their act, and I
supported
that.</div><a name="09070260000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">At
the same time, in the real world no one wants to create a situation in
which we run out of taxis or wheels&#151;putting it more bluntly and
less technically&#151;to get people around. I realise that the
Government have to balance that consideration. Will the
Solicitor-General, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column623" />Column number: 623</div>in responding to my hon. Friend&#146;s specific questions, also say
more about her general take on how that is to be done? In particular,
how does the hackney carriage licence&#151;I confess not to be an
expert on how that is normally expressed&#151;differ from the private
hire licence? To what extent are private hire operators covered by
other provisions in the Bill, and not, as it were, exempt? Will she
explain how it should
operate?</div><a name="09070260000039"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070260000275"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> My hon. Friend has highlighted an interesting
issue about the difference between hackney carriages and taxis, which
is what the regulations apply to, and private hire vehicles. The point
of the clause is to allow for an exemption if the local authority
thinks that, by insisting on some accessible taxis, all the taxis would
flip over to being private hire vehicles. As well as thinking about
what the consultation on improving access to taxis does, the Government
ought to think about whether it makes sense for that regulation to
apply for taxis but to have nothing similar for private hire vehicles.
We could have all the taxis threatening to switch over to being private
hire vehicles and the local authority saying, &#147;Fine, okay
then&#148;, but we could then end up with no accessible taxis at
all.</div><a name="09070260000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
disabled people, the important thing in the difference between taxis
and private hire vehicles is that private hire vehicles have to be
booked in advance. It would not be acceptable if disabled people were
not able to get transport without having to plan ahead, just as
everyone else can. If they could only book ahead, that would be a
diminution of their freedom and ability to move. Will my hon. Friend
comment on
that?</div><a name="09070260000041"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070260000276"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> My hon. Friend has read my mind&#151;that was
to be the second part of my remarks. It is an early hour of a Thursday
morning, so I cannot resist the temptation, because it reflects a great
human spirit, to quote a Labour Foreign Secretary of many years ago and
of great repute, Ernie Bevin, who once defined his wish for free
movement as wanting to be able
to</div><a name="09070260000218"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;go
down to Victoria station... take a ticket and go where the hell I
like&#148;.</div><a name="09070260000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is exactly the point about taxis: people do not want to feel that
because they have a disability they have to tie themselves down to
pre-purchase. They should be able to use
taxis.</div><a name="09070260000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to respond to my hon. Friend&#146;s point so, in parenthesis, my
experience doing the Front-Bench job, when I was bringing a large
number of people with disabilities into the House, was somewhat mixed.
There were occasions&#151;I appreciate that the clause does not refer
to the metropolitan area&#151;when we went to New Palace Yard and
found some difficulty in getting the taxi to
accommodate.</div><a name="09070260000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
first concern is a generic one about the extent to which the duties
bite across the whole of the fleet, which may be available to disabled
people, and how that will be balanced out. Secondly, I appreciate that
we do not want to create another inspectorate at the centre, but I want
from the Government a handle on the extent to which adequate provision
is being
made.</div><a name="09070260000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
third point concerns the criteria under which local authorities may
bring this measure forward. As explained in the explanatory notes, it
appears to be a fairly rigorous test: they would have to apply and make

<div class="Column"><a name="Column624" />Column number: 624</div>a case, which would have to be run past the Disabled Persons Transport
Advisory Committee. I hope that would happen and that it will be a
rigorous
test.</div><a name="09070260000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clearly,
one could refer to islands where it might be more difficult to provide
such a service. However, the normal presumption should be that the
taxis will be accessible and there should be as few exemptions as
possible. If there are to be exemptions, they should be properly
evidenced and explained, not just nodded
through.</div><a name="09070260000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
157 sets up the framework, but it is important that we have an
understanding that it will not be a fiction and used as a whitewash
whereby local authorities walk away from their duties or find ways to
avoid them, and that it will not lead to a diminution of service across
the piece for disabled people, which is a common concern of the
Committee. I think that all that can be achieved, but I would like the
Solicitor-General&#146;s assurance that it will
be.</div><a name="09070260000048"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070260000277"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> We decided last year to take a fresh
look at how we can achieve our objective of enhancing accessible-taxi
provision, and there was a consultation that closed on 24 April. We
asked members of the public, groups and organisations whether the
regulations were the right way to deal with the issue. We are still
analysing all that. Many of the issues raised by hon. Gentlemen have
absolute reality and I accept that completely. The possibility of
people migrating to become private hire only is an issue that we must
countenance. The possibility that there could be an area in which there
were no accessible taxis because of the provision is something we need
to look at.</div>
<a name="09070260000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
protections within the four corners of clause 154, which deals with the
issue properly, whereas clause 157 deals with exemptions. There has to
be a consultation&#151;the hon. Gentleman referred to the Disabled
Persons Transport Advisory Committee. The Secretary of State has to be
satisfied that any exemption is appropriate, and he or she can put
terms upon it. However, I readily accept that there is a need for us to
come back and say to the House what we will do about the
issue.</div>
<a name="09070260000050"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070260000278"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> I appreciate that the Solicitor-General is in
some difficulty because she does not speak for the Department for
Transport, but will she ensure that it at least takes seriously the
continuing monitoring of the situation, as well as setting up the
framework on day one, which I am sure it will do plausibly and
sensibly? However, it is delivery that will
matter.</div>
<a name="09070260000051"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070260000279"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> Yes, I will, and we will have the
responses to the consultation analysed by September. The Bill will be
discussed on Report at the other end of recess, so we will have an
opportunity to discuss this again. On that clear undertaking, for the
time being I invite the hon. Member for Forest of Dean to allow the
clause to stand part of the
Bill.</div><a name="09070260000243"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.15
am</div>
<a name="09070260000052"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070260000280"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> That is helpful, and I am grateful for
confirmation of when the Solicitor-General expects the Bill to be
considered on Report. We will look at the Department for Transport
response to the consultation.  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column625" />Column number: 625</div>I note that private hire vehicle drivers and operators were asked to
respond to it. It will be interesting to see what they say, as well as
what taxi operators
say.</div><a name="09070260000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given
the Solicitor-General&#146;s clear assurance, we will wait for the
consultation and then discuss on Report what should be
done.</div><a name="09070260000054"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070260000281"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> I think that it would bore the Committee to tears
to go into the detail of an interpretation clause. However, I would
like the Solicitor-General&#146;s assurance that the list of
categories of assistance dog is sufficiently comprehensive. It begins
with specific types and goes on to mention prescribed charities. I
think that that will cover all
types.</div><a name="09070260000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have a constituency interest because a marvellous charity called Dogs
for the Disabled, which does excellent work, is located at the edge of
my constituency, near to Banbury in the neighbouring constituency. That
charity provides dogs for people with wider disabilities than the
conventional disabilities of deafness or blindness. Will the
Solicitor-General assure me that she will nudge her colleagues in the
relevant Department to ensure that the definition is sufficiently
comprehensive, as I believe it is, so that any dog that is trained to
help a person will be
admitted?</div><a name="09070260000070"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070260000284"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> This, I hope, will not take too long. Again, it
relates to our friends in the Department for Transport. Given what the
Solicitor-General said about timing, the issue may well fall within
that category as well. In April, the Department for Transport issued a
consultation on rail services for disabled people under the Disability
Discrimination Act 1995. Specifically, the consultation is about
improving the accessibility of light rail vehicles&#151;those used on
metro, underground and tram systems and other prescribed modes of
guided
transport.</div><a name="09070260000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
ask about the matter again to see how it interacts with what is being
proposed in the regulations under the clause. The Government are
carrying out their consultation. There are European standards on heavy
rail vehicles&#151;what we commonly call trains&#151;and the
appropriate stations. To ensure that the new regulations do not impose
a double regulatory burden, the Government are consulting 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column627" />Column number: 627</div>on light rail vehicles and are also considering two draft regulations. I
am sure that the Solicitor-General is not terribly familiar with them,
because they are a bit convoluted. The Rail Vehicle Accessibility
(Non-Interoperable Rail System) Regulations 2009 is not the most catchy
and snappy of
titles.</div><a name="09070260000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
regulations are quite technical. Ministers occasionally bring out rail
vehicle accessibility regulations, both general and specific, and,
anorak that I am, I faithfully get them from the Vote Office and read
them to ensure that they are in order. Although they always have been,
it is worth checking such things.</div>
<a name="09070260000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to
check that the provisions that the Government mention here, which are
to continue to have the right technical specifications in place but to
have a less onerous regulatory system, are to be introduced on or
before 31 December. Will the Solicitor-General update the
Committee on how the consultation is proceeding? Moreover, will she
tell us whether the proposed changes are purely regulatory and whether
the way the DDA has been transferred into the Bill will have any impact
on them? Will anything need to be done on Report or can these
regulations be added to the existing powers and then transferred across
into the Bill?</div>
<a name="09070260000082"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070260000285"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> Briefly, and rather in the spirit of my earlier
intervention, I would like the Solicitor-General to have a word with
her hon. Friends about the implications in practice. This is about rail
accessibility, which will vary depending on whether the train is
travelling or coming to rest at a
station.</div><a name="09070260000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me sketch out a particular dilemma. As we improve the provision for
disabled people on rail, which we should, there is bound to be pressure
on space for fully abled passengers. It requires a sensitive design to
make the spaces as flexible as possible to accommodate the needs of
disabled persons with wheelchairs or for other passengers if that is
appropriate.</div><a name="09070260000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
of the by-products of that is that if capacity is cut in the carriage
by making provision for wheelchair access, another carriage might be
needed in order to carry the same number of passengers or to meet the
same demand. I promise that I will not go into a debate about the
economics of the rail system, because that would take us into very
unsatisfactory territory. Another carriage would be fine, although not
without
cost.</div><a name="09070260000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
concomitant effect at very small stations&#151;I have two in my
constituency&#151;with short platforms is that if the configuration
increases from six cars to seven, some may overshoot the platform. That
may not be a problem for people who are fully abled and agile, but it
would be more of a difficulty for wheelchair users or those who are not
nimble in getting off trains, such as older people, because they may
find themselves in the wrong place on the train. I suspect that many of
us have had that experience on a crowded tube train&#151;one suddenly
finds that the door at the end of the carriage will not open and one
has quickly to shimmy down to the next door, which is not always
easy.</div><a name="09070260000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">All
I am suggesting&#151;I am not proposing that this should be tied down
in law&#151;is that merely saying that carriages should be wheelchair
accessible is not quite the same as saying that wheelchair users should
be able to access the whole length of the train for safe egress and
ingress to the platform. A little conversation, at 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column628" />Column number: 628</div>least, with the Solicitor-General&#146;s sister Department might be
useful, because it is important in the general framework of what I know
is intended to be an enabling and encouraging clause to get it as
practically right as
possible.</div><a name="09070260000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
example, when the accessibility issue is being cleared in relation to
new rolling stock and if there are limited-access stations, which are
better than closed stations&#151;we had the same dilemma about
hackney cab services&#151;it may be sensible if they have to produce
an operational plan to ensure that wheelchair users are notified, put
in a suitable part of the train, escorted, provided with more time or
whatever is appropriate. Those are largely operational matters for the
Solicitor-General&#146;s sister Department, and I leave those
thoughts with
her.</div><a name="09070260000088"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070260000286"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> The hon. Gentleman is right: it is hard
to legislate for the practical problems he foresees. In the example he
sketched out, I suppose that the train would have to move up a little.
We hope that in the longer term the legislation will change attitudes
and make people more aware of the need always to think about the
possibility of disabled people being present. He makes a valid point,
as ever. He is a devoted supporter of disabled people and I praise him,
not for the first time, for that
commitment.</div><a name="09070260000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause deals with the fairly technical rail vehicle accessibility
regulations, and I am not such an anorak as the hon. Member for Forest
of Dean that I check whether they are in order, so I must take that on
trust. We are consulting, as he said, and that consultation closes on
Friday, so if the hon. Member for Daventry or anyone else wants to add
anything, time is short.</div>
<a name="09070260000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
replicates in the Bill the provisions of section 46 of the DDA, and any
new regulations that emerge from the consultation will be enacted under
this provision. We do not believe that anything more will be needed on
Report. Having probed the issue, and with the assurance that a couple
of days remain to contribute to the consultation, I hope that the hon.
Member for Forest of Dean is content to allow the clause to stand part
of the
Bill.</div><a name="09070260000091"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070260000287"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> I have a brief question arising from our previous
debate. If the Secretary of State is asked to make provision for an
exemption order, after consulting the Disabled Persons Transport
Advisory Committee and any other person whom he thinks appropriate, he
has the options of making an exemption order, refusing to do so, or
doing so with specific conditions and restrictions. In the past, would
those conditions have  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column629" />Column number: 629</div>included the sort of communication that the operator had to undertake to
make people aware of particular rail networks or trains that were not
accessible?</div><a name="09070260000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
criticism that is often raised with me by constituents is that they are
not only annoyed when a particular rail network is not accessible; they
are most annoyed when they do not know that it is accessible or they
think, or are led to believe, that it is accessible. In such
circumstances they may be surprised and may end up with a lot of
problems once they are on the train, including finding that they have
to go to another station that they did not expect to go to. If the
Secretary of State is to make exemption orders and rail vehicles are
not accessible, one useful condition could be included relating to what
the operator has to do in terms of proper communication, so that
disabled people using that service are aware not just that it is not
accessible, but what other options are available that they might use to
maximise their
mobility.</div><a name="09070260000096"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070260000288"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> My hon. Friend&#146;s comments on the clause
have helped to satisfy me in relation to my previous point. It is
terribly clear that we should not simply stamp that provision on the
physical spec of the rolling stock; we should look at how the process
will work in practice. We are establishing some understanding about
that and, I hope, encouraging the Minister&#146;s departmental
colleagues.</div><a name="09070260000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
should like to return to a point that was in my mind when we were
talking earlier about Hackney carriages: the basis on which orders can
be made on exemptions or derogations from regulations. I remember, as a
Minister, facing the dilemma of the extent to which a Secretary of
State would specify the grounds for their decision to confirm, modify
or refuse an exemption order. I suspect that disabled people and their
organisations would want to build up a corpus of views about whether
that was done reasonably and not simply as an economic cop-out. It
would be interesting to know whether there will be something beyond the
bald rubric that the Minister has decided on, so that people could
begin to understand the rationale for a growing&#151;one hopes it is
not too fast growing&#151;corpus of decisions for
exemptions.</div><a name="09070260000098"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070260000289"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> My answer to the hon. Gentleman is that
I do not know whether the rationale will be put into communications
following the granting of an exemption or the imposition of a
condition, although it obviously should, for the reason that he
mentioned. I am glad that such important practical points are being
raised. Exemptions to such provisions that have been made under the DDA
are usually time-limited, so it is usually about getting things in
order in due course. I understand that conditions are often set on
those provisions, and that would remain the case for exemptions granted
under the
Bill.</div><a name="09070260000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">Committee
members have made some practical points. Apparently, the extent of the
availability of conditions to the Secretary of State would permit the
kind of communication that the hon. Member for Forest of Dean
mentioned. Such practical matters will be drawn to the attention of the
appropriate Departments so that all the sensible points that have been
mentioned are taken into account when exemptions are granted.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column630" />Column number: 630</div><a name="09070260000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">A limited
range of events would cause exemption. For example, the Glasgow
underground has different dimensions from other underground train
services and it would be difficult for it to meet the precise
regulations in relation to wheelchair accommodation, so it has an
exemption for the time being, but such a provision is made available
and used only in pretty exceptional situations like that, where bigger
tunnels would have to be dug under the whole of
Glasgow.</div><a name="09070260000101"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

to make it clear that all maintained schools, including academy
schools, should be dealt with in this way. The amendments seek to probe
the Government&#146;s understanding of the  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column631" />Column number: 631</div>extent to which sections 58 to 60 of the School Standards and Framework
Act 1998 comply with article 4(2) of the relevant Council framework
directive, are an interpretation of it, or were designed to go further
than it in some way. They seek clarification that article 4(2) is not
the ultimate restriction on the extent of the powers available to
schools, particularly faith schools, under those sections.</div>
<a name="09070260000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
dealing with the potential for conflict between the rights secured
under the directive&#151;which I believe the Government must have
regard to&#151;and either what is available to schools under sections
58 to 60 of the School Standards and Framework Act, or what schools
believe is available to them, which might go beyond what is actually
available. I understand that there has been some
correspondence.</div>
<a name="09070260000117"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070260000295"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I am slightly troubled that the hon.
Gentleman raises in this debate the question of compliance regarding a
provision in the School Standards and Framework Act that has absolutely
no connection with the Bill. Whatever the compliance of that Act with
the directive, it will not be changed by this Bill. Where is the
relevance?</div><a name="09070260000118"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070260000296"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I will go on to explain the relevance, but to
briefly answer that question, in the Bill we are dealing with the
rights of people to not be discriminated against on one of the
protected grounds. Section 60 of the School Standards and Framework Act
arguably gives state schools the right to dismiss someone on the basis
of their belief, their attendance at worship or their conduct. It is
alleged by faith schools that conduct that is not consistent with those
tenets, including private conduct related to sexual orientation, comes
within sections 58 to 60. The Solicitor-General will know that when
hon. Members debated the 2003 employment regulations, which are
reproduced in the Bill, there was a long debate about the paragraph in
those regulations that said that, notwithstanding the regulations,
sections 58 to 60 of the Schools Standards and Framework
Act 1998 will apply. Therefore, this is very much a live
issue; that is what the provisions say. I shall explain what I
mean.</div><a name="09070260000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is important to look at article 4(2) of the Council framework
directive, because everything depends on whether it is legitimate for
the schedule to say that sections 58 to 60 are acceptable and can stand
even though the Bill is supposed to implement the directive. It is
important to see what article 4(2) says, because it is critical to this
debate. It
states:</div><a name="09070260000221"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Member
States may maintain national legislation in force at the date of
adoption of this Directive or provide for future legislation
incorporating national practices existing at the date of adoption of

activities within churches and other public or private organisations
the ethos of which is based on religion or belief, a difference of
treatment based on a person&#146;s religion or belief shall not
constitute discrimination
where&#148;,</div><a name="09070260000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">and

<div class="Column"><a name="Column632" />Column number: 632</div>around at that time that predated it. Therefore, it is the relevant
exemption, and I do not think that there should be any difference
between
us.</div><a name="09070260000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
article 4(2) goes on to explain the basis of the conditions that must
be met in order for sections 58 to 60 to be complied with. It
states:</div><a name="09070260000223"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;where,
by reason of the nature of these activities or of the context in which
they are carried out, a person&#146;s religion or belief constitute a
genuine, legitimate and justified occupational requirement, having
regard to the organisation&#146;s ethos. This difference of treatment
shall be implemented taking account of Member States&#146;
constitutional provisions and
principles&#148;.</div><a name="09070260000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
article then goes on to say, in a second
paragraph:</div><a name="09070260000224"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Provided
that its provisions are otherwise complied with, this Directive shall
thus&#148;&#151;</div><a name="09070260000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
draw attention to the word &#147;thus&#148;, which refers to the
conditions laid down in the previous
paragraph&#151;</div><a name="09070260000225"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;not
prejudice the right of churches and other public or private
organisations, the ethos of which is based on religion or belief,
acting in conformity with national constitutions and laws, to require
individuals working for them to act in good faith and with loyalty to
the organisation&#146;s
ethos.&#148;</div><a name="09070260000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
first question to the Solicitor-General&#151;I would be grateful if
she could answer this&#151;is whether she believes that article 4(2)
contains two separate exemptions: one that relates to a genuine,
legitimate and justified occupational requirement, and a second one in
the second paragraph that does not require that, despite the
&#147;thus&#148; that says that the directive shall not</div>
<a name="09070260000226"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;prejudice the
right of churches and other public or private organisations, the ethos
of which is based on religion or belief, acting in conformity with
national constitutions and laws, to require individuals working for
them to act in good faith and with loyalty to the organisation&#146;s
ethos.&#148;</div><a name="09070260000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
accept that any employer can have that as a term of employment. The
question is, where that would involve discrimination on the grounds of
religion or belief or, indeed, conduct related to sexual orientation,
whether an exemption is provided for such a contract to be lawful when
it otherwise would not be. Is it the Government&#146;s opinion that
those are separate, or is it one? If they accept, as I believe they do,
that it is one, it does not mean that I am right and the Government are
wrong, but it would be helpful in framing our
discussion.</div><a name="09070260000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would also be grateful if the Solicitor-General confirmed that article
4(2) is there only
to</div><a name="09070260000227"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;maintain
national legislation in force at the date of adoption of this Directive
or provide for future legislation incorporating national practices
existing at the date of adoption of this
Directive&#148;.</div><a name="09070260000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
other words, brand new practice cannot rely on the
dispensation.</div><a name="09070260000245"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.45
am</div><a name="09070260000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
third question is whether ethos alone can constitute the genuine,
legitimate and justified occupational requirement. Will the Minister
comment on the
words,</div><a name="09070260000228"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;by
reason of the nature of these activities or of the context in which
they are carried out, a person&#146;s religion or belief constitute a
genuine, legitimate and justified occupational requirement, having
regard to the organisation&#146;s
ethos&#148;?</div><a name="09070260000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
other words, could&#151;if all other requirements are met&#151;an
employer with such an ethos say, &#147;You are not in compliance with
our ethos ab initio, regardless of the work that you do&#148;? I have
asked that question previously in discussions on the Bill.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column633" />Column number: 633</div><a name="09070260000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">The matter is
important because I accept that there will be cases where
someone&#146;s job requires them to do something that they cannot do.
If the organisation has an ethos and meeting those needs is an
occupational requirement, that will fall within the exemption. I accept
that, but I would like the Minister to clarify whether compliance with
an ethos alone is sufficient, or whether some impact on the way in
which the person carries out the job should also be part of the case.
In addition, is it the case that that cannot just be assumed and that
it has to be shown to be part of the
case?</div><a name="09070260000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
fourth question is about what is meant in the School Standards and
Framework Act 1998 by the reference to ethos. I am not an expert on
this&#151;perhaps the hon. Member for Glasgow, East is&#151;but a
religious school&#146;s ethos might be that they want to encourage
children to be brought up and learn in a Christian environment with
regard to Christian standards of conduct. Such an ethos might relate to
the way that a Christian society operates vis- -vis charity to
all and respect for everyone. I believe that that is separate from a
school ethos that is based on the virgin birth, the resurrection and
certain other tenets&#151;in other words, the ethos of a school is
not necessarily the same as the doctrine of the religion.</div>
<a name="09070260000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">If I am
right&#151;and I believe that I am&#151;is it the duty of the
teacher to have regard to the ethos of the school or to have regard to
the tenets of the religion? The tenets of some religions state that
homosexuality is a sin. I do not expect that the ethos of a school
would contain that. If the exemption is to essentially punish people in
employment terms by preference or dismissal on the basis of their
allegiance to the ethos, are we talking about the ethos of the school
or the tenets of the religious
organisation?</div><a name="09070260000135"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09070260000297"></a><b class="B">John
Mason</b> (Glasgow, East) (SNP): I stand to be corrected by
those who understand our dictionaries better than me&#151;perhaps the
Minister can help on this matter&#151;but my understanding of ethos
in, for example, a Catholic school is that it relates to the whole
teaching of the Catholic Church, which would include things such as the
virgin birth and so on. I would have thought that in a Muslim school,
similarly, that would include the whole teaching, including the Prophet
and so
on.</div><a name="09070260000136"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070260000298"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> That is the question I am asking. I am interested
in the hon. Gentleman&#146;s view, and I am even more interested in
the Government&#146;s view. I am not keen to get into the issue of
dictionaries at
all.</div><a name="09070260000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have raised the issue because section 60 of the School Standards and
Framework Act 1998 does not talk about the ethos of the school. I shall
set out section 60(5), because it is important to the point
I am making and to a point that I am going to
make:</div><a name="09070260000229"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;If
the school is a voluntary aided school&#151;</div>
<a name="09070260000230"></a><div class="hs_brev">(a) preference may be
given, in connection with the appointment, remuneration or promotion of
teachers at the school, to persons&#151;</div>
<a name="09070260000231"></a><div class="hs_brev">(i) whose religious
opinions are in accordance with the tenets of the religion or religious
denomination specified in relation to the school under section
69(4)&#148;.</div><a name="09070260000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
question is whether that relates to the ethos of the school or the
tenets of the religion. I think that the hon. Gentleman would have to
say that the tenets of some religions are that homosexuality is
objectively disordered 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column634" />Column number: 634</div>and a sin, and that practising homosexuals will, unless they repent, be
punished in the after-life in some way. That is separate from what we
would expect to see in the ethos of a school. I think even those who
strongly support faith schools do not expect pupils and teachers to
sign up to homophobia in the ethos, even if that is for historical and
doctrinal
reasons.</div><a name="09070260000139"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070260000299"></a>John
Mason:</b> I find that difficult to distinguish. Let us take a
faith&#151;the one that I am familiar with in Glasgow would be
Catholic schools, which are the main type of faith school. The people
would look on it as the whole teaching of their religion. For example,
I am sure that the hon. Gentleman is familiar with something like the
ten commandments, which is a whole package. To start taking one part of
the package and not other parts, and to say that some part is ethos and
some part is something else strikes me as a bit
artificial.</div>
<a name="09070260000140"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070260000300"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I am aware of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s view. I
am raising the question because I believe that there are many people
who run faith schools who believe that the ethos equals all the tenets
of the faith, including ones that I know are held sincerely and are not
designed to create a humiliating or degrading atmosphere. But if
someone&#146;s parents are gay, and they are told in the ethos of the
school that that is sinful, objectively wrong, and that they will be
punished in the after-life, that raises an issue&#151;the hon.
Gentleman must accept that that is the case. I am interested in the
Government&#146;s view. Is the ethos to which teachers must have
regard under section 60 the tenets of the religion, or are the two
different? Are they required to be different in order to avoid some of
the problems that I have identified, such as the ones related to
homosexuality?</div><a name="09070260000141"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070260000301"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> I return to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s specific
example. Fortunately, the Committee will be pleased to know that I am
not going to get into debating the virgin birth and any other biblical
matters.</div>
<a name="09070260000142"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070260000302"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> Or the
resurrection.</div>
<a name="09070260000143"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070260000303"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> As the Minister said, certainly not the
resurrection. Let us take the hon. Gentleman&#146;s specific example
where two parents are gay&#151;presumably they have adopted a child.
If that child went to a school where they were taught that
homosexuality is sinful, it would be difficult for the child. Why on
earth would parents in that position have chosen to send their child to
a faith school where that was the belief of that religion? That would
be completely crackers. Why would parents do that? With his example,
given that the point of legislation is to deal with real harm&#151;I
am thinking back to the evidence that we had from Ben Summerskill from
Stonewall&#151;it cannot be drawn into the matter. I do not think it
is
realistic.</div><a name="09070260000144"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070260000304"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. There is no objection to hon. Members
making comparisons, but the debate has gone a little wide of the
margin, to be quite honest. Please come back to the
amendment.</div><a name="09070260000145"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070260000305"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> Gay people can be Catholic. There may only be one
primary school in their village&#151;there are all sorts of reasons
why the example might occur. Teachers may want to teach in a school
where they live; should they have to go elsewhere? To that extent, I 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column635" />Column number: 635</div>believe that the intervention by the hon. Member for Forest of Dean was
in order, as I think there is a real problem&#151;it has an impact on
the choices made. Why should someone have to choose to do something
they would not otherwise do for fear of something happening like the
example I have
described?</div><a name="09070260000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
think it is perfectly legitimate for a Catholic school to teach
children that Catholics believe that practising homosexuality is
sinful&#151;I have no problem with that. The school should teach that
in those terms&#151;not &#147;it is&#148;, but &#147;Catholics
believe that it is&#148;. That is information and knowledge, but that
is different from having it in the
ethos.</div><a name="09070260000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will return to what I was saying. My question was whether there is a
distinction between a school ethos in practice and tenets of religion.
The second part of the provision, section 60, states that</div>
<a name="09070260000232"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;preference may
be given...to
persons&#148;&#151;</div><a name="09070260000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">in
terms of
teachers&#151;</div><a name="09070260000233"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;who
attend religious worship in accordance with those
tenets&#148;.</div><a name="09070260000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am interested to know whether the Government believe that that simply
means &#147;attendance at&#148;, or whether it means
&#147;participation&#148;. Does attendance imply joining in the
prayers, or does it simply mean a need to turn up and essentially not
be disruptive? If it is merely a question of attendance and does not
require participation, that would be less objectionable. It is
important that we understand on what basis the Government intend to
allow people to be discriminated against. That was my fifth
question.</div><a name="09070260000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
sixth question relates to section 60(5)(a)(iii) of the 1998 Act, which
states that preference can be given to
people</div><a name="09070260000234"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;who
give, or are willing to give, religious education at the school in
accordance with those
tenets&#148;.</div><a name="09070260000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">Does
the Minister think that only practising and believing Catholics can
teach religious education in a Catholic school? Is such religious
education so doctrinal and instructional that it would be difficult for
someone who is not a Catholic to teach it? I accept that it would be
difficult for such people to teach pupils with sincerity that certain
things are wrong, that certain things happened and what they should
believe. People who are not Catholic can be competent. For example,
some professors of theology at Oxford are Catholic and are canons of
Christchurch cathedral. However, they teach Anglican theology at
professorial level in higher education. Is religious education in
voluntary-aided schools so instructional that it cannot be taught
successfully by people who are not sincere believers in the faith, even
though they may know the curriculum and be good
teachers?</div><a name="09070260000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
section 60(5)(b) of the 1998 Act states
that</div><a name="09070260000235"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;regard
may be had, in connection with the termination of the
employment&#148;&#151;</div><a name="09070260000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">sacking&#151;</div><a name="09070260000236"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;of
any teacher at the school, to any conduct on his part which is
incompatible with the precepts, or with the upholding of the tenets, of
the religion or religious denomination so
specified.&#148;</div><a name="09070260000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">First,
is that supposed to mean conduct that is incompatible with the stated
ethos of the school or can it mean conduct that is incompatible with
the tenets of the religion? That is a key question if we are to
understand the scope of that exemption under the 1998 Act and whether
it is compatible with the Bill.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column636" />Column number: 636</div><a name="09070260000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, can
such conduct include private sexual conduct stemming from sexual
orientation? I seek the Minister&#146;s reassurance that she will be
consistent with her earlier support for Justice Richards&#146;s clear
statement in the Amicus judgment, which he stated twice, that it is
impossible to separate discrimination on the grounds of sexual
orientation from discrimination on the grounds of conduct that stems
directly from that sexual orientation under the directive. That
statement stands because the judgment has not been overturned on
appeal. It is therefore not possible for schools to say that they are
not discriminating against somebody on the basis that they are gay, but
because they are in a civil partnership, are living with someone of the
same gender or are felt to be having lawful sexual relations with
someone of the same gender. Justice Richards&#146;s judgment did not
even get into whether such discrimination would be permitted under the
rights of privacy and non-discrimination in the Human Rights Act 1998
because it relied on the
directive.</div><a name="09070260000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">Hon.
Members may correct me if I am wrong, but I believe it is the
assumption of many schools that they will be entitled to consider sex
outside marriage&#151;which is the only kind of sex a gay person can
have in this country&#151;as conduct that
is</div><a name="09070260000237"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;incompatible
with the precepts, or with the upholding of the tenets, of the religion
or religious denomination so
specified.&#148;</div><a name="09070260000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
view is that paragraph 2 of article 4 of the directive requires a
justified and legitimate occupational requirement that relates to the
job, not a free-standing requirement that relates to the beliefs of the
employer. Does the Minister think that a school can sack somebody, or
not prefer them in some way, on the basis of their private conduct
outside the
school?</div><a name="09070260000246"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10
am</div><a name="09070260000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">Schools
ask how someone can deliver religious education according to the tenets
of a religion that talks about sex within faithful marriage when that
person&#146;s private life is not consistent with that. One can see
where schools are coming from, but the Minister has said previously, I
believe, that discrimination based essentially on sexual orientation is
discrimination based on sexual orientation. Even if the
discriminator&#146;s intention is that the discrimination should be
based on religious belief because the person&#146;s conduct is not
consistent with the religious beliefs required, it is still
discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation. My final question,
therefore, is whether she agrees that that is the case.</div>
<a name="09070260000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that I
have been able to explain why it is important, given the number of
teachers who fall subject to sections 60 and 58 of the School Standards
and Framework Act, that we do not require teachers to claim unfair
dismissal in relation to their private lives when that would be a
burden on them. We should not expect teachers to live in fear of being
discovered to be gay by schools or to have difficulties finding
employment in areas where most schools are faith schools. When we pass
such legislation, we therefore need to be clear about its boundaries.
In introducing the amendments, I look to the Minister to give us some
reassurance on the issue. I am grateful for the patience of the
Committee.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070260000306"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> The UK negotiated the inclusion of
article 4(2) of the framework directive with the intention of
preserving the provisions in the School 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column637" />Column number: 637</div>Standards and Framework Act, and we are satisfied that they are
compliant. That provides for future legislation to allow differential
treatment on religious grounds, where that reflects national practices
and where there is a genuine, legitimate and justified occupational
requirement. Nothing in the Act can be used to discriminate against
someone because of their sexual orientation, which would be unlawful in
employment law.</div>
<a name="09070260000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me
add&#151;this is all that I intend to add&#151;that we do not

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070260000307"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> It is extremely disappointing that the Minister
will not engage with eight straightforward questions that are within
the scope of the Bill. If they were out of order, I would have been
called out of order by you, Mr. Benton. What we have is a
Committee in which the Minister simply will not answer questions that
have been legitimately raised. It is the Committee&#146;s job
properly to scrutinise the implications of employment discrimination
legislation, which affect hundreds or thousands of people, but she has
said practically nothing. I look to you for advice on what we can do
raise questions that are in order and to have them
answered.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070260000308"></a>The

hon. Gentleman had been out of order, I would have ruled him out of

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070260000311"></a>Dr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070260000312"></a>The

The Minister has indicated that she has replied. As far as I am

did not&#151;say. It is difficult to know what to do at this point.
Normally, one has a debate, and one&#146;s questions are at least
addressed and preferably answered. That enables one to
determine&#151;<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> I am not asking a

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070260000314"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I am sorry to do this, but my ruling is
quite clear. I advise the hon. Gentleman to press his amendment or
withdraw it. What he is doing now is pursuing what he interprets to be
a lack of response from the Minister. The Minister has indicated 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column638" />Column number: 638</div>clearly that she has responded as far as she is going to. Frankly, this
is becoming a little bit negative in terms of Committee procedure and
the sake of good order. I advise the hon. Gentleman either to press his
amendment or
withdraw.</div><a name="09070260000170"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070260000315"></a>Dr.

Committee members will not know on what terms they are voting. On that
basis alone, in bitter disappointment at the Government&#146;s
failure to respond, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070260000317"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I beg to move amendment 252, in
clause 186, page 133, line 24, leave
out subsections (5) and (6).</div><a name="09070279000012"></a><div class="hs_brev">An
amendment to protect an individual from discrimination from a charity
because of their
atheism.</div><a name="09070260000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is a probing amendment to ask whether it is justified to have an
exemption in respect of the Scout Association, as that is what the
clause relates to. The Scout Association is an excellent organisation
that does brilliant work. It is, in many cases, supported by public
authorities and given accommodation by schools and public authorities.
Many young people want to join if they can because their friends
belong, and it is often the only or the main extracurricular activity
in the community.</div>
<a name="09070260000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">A provision
was written into the Equality Act 2006 saying that although charities
could not discriminate against people on the basis of their religion
unless it was written into their charitable instrument and otherwise
justified, organisations that had had such requirements, now considered
inappropriate, before 18 May 2005 would be allowed to continue to do
so. The impact is that children who cannot sincerely say that they
believe in God cannot join the Scouts and people who wish to help
promote or work within the Scouts as scout leaders&#151;the enormous
bulk of whom are not religious, as the Scouts are not a religious
organisation; they just have a joining oath&#151;are not allowed to
do so. Many scout groups are short of leaders, so what they do when a
qualified person in the community wants to work with young people is to
say, &#147;Well, just cross your fingers when you say the
oath.&#148;</div><a name="09070260000178"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070260000318"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> I rise simply to seek elucidation. Did I hear the
hon. Gentleman aright when he said that he thought the amendment
extended only to the Scouts&#151;in other words, that no other bodies
have pre-existing vested rights, whether they are atheistic and exclude
believers or nominally include believers? I think that he 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column639" />Column number: 639</div>is nodding on that point. Secondly, if he considers that the Scout
Association is indeed the only organisation affected&#151;this is,
perhaps, an indirect question to the Minister&#151;will issues of
hybridity arise?</div>
<a name="09070260000179"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070260000319"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I cannot answer the hon. Gentleman&#146;s last
point, because I have limited knowledge, and people might say that my
knowledge, even in those limited areas, is limited and it does not
extend to issues of hybrid Bills and so
on.</div><a name="09070260000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not know of any organisation that is not otherwise covered by the
exemption that is allowed for charities with a religious object, but
which has a joining oath that is not otherwise pursued, as is so in
respect of scouting activities. It is well known that the Scouts are
anxious not to exclude people, but it is sad that their solution is to
ask people to be insincere when signing up to the oath. I am not saying
that that is the Scouts&#146; official policy and I am not saying
that I approve or disapprove of
that.</div><a name="09070260000181"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09070260000320"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Drew</b> (Stroud) (Lab/Co-op): Can the hon. Gentleman
give me one example of the Scouts actually saying that in writing, as a
definitive
statement?</div><a name="09070260000182"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070260000321"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I can give the hon. Gentleman that. I will send
him examples of people who have written to me, and examples from other
organisations, complaining that they were not allowed to join unless
they took this oath and saying that they were told&#151;I do not see
why they should lie because they want to join the Scouts&#151;that
the solution would be to make the statement insincerely. I can
understand that, because the Scouts do not want to lose people from the
community who happen not to be of the same religion or are not
God-fearing, as it were. So there is an unfortunate situation, although
the Scouts would be none the worse if they dropped the oath, which
discriminates against both children and leaders. Continuing with the
oath deprives people of access to scouting activities and deprives the
Scouts of people who would be good leaders working in that organisation
as
volunteers.</div><a name="09070260000183"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09070260000322"></a><b class="B">Ms

The hon. Gentleman will wish to know that there is an excellent
alternative to the Scouts that was set up precisely because of this
sort of God-fearing and monarchy-fearing nonsense&#151;the Woodcraft
Folk.</div><a name="09070260000184"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070260000323"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I am not here to big-up the Woodcraft Folk or to
big-down the Scouts. People will make their own decisions. However, in
many communities the Scouts is the only game in town and therefore
there is no choice. I do not think that such organisations, which are
not religious, should have religious tests or not-religious tests. I am
grateful for Committee members&#146; advice. Everyone reading these
proceedings will now be encouraged to go down that path. I want to
stress that I am not hostile to the Scouts&#151;they do a great
job&#151;but they would be aided in their work if they were not
allowed
certain&#151;</div><a name="09070260000185"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070260000324"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> I am sympathetic to what the hon. Member for
Stroud said. There is an active scout movement, and a guide movement,
in my constituency. Those youth 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column640" />Column number: 640</div>organisations are popular but they are not the only ones. Young people
can join an extraordinary range of organisations. The problem is
usually not a shortage of young people, but of adults willing to put
the time in to run
them.</div><a name="09070260000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman is in danger of creating non-real examples. In my time
as a Member of Parliament, I have never had a single complaint from
anybody who has been turned away from the Scouts or told that they have
to fib about whether they believe in God. The hon. Gentleman is
creating fictional problems that do not exist in the real world and is
asking us to deal with them. That is unnecessary. Having started with a
paean to how great the Scouts were, he spent the next five minutes
saying what a dreadful organisation it is and what a dreadful way they
go about doing things, including telling people to be hypocrites before
they are able to join. That is not my experience of the Scout
Association as it operates in my constituency and, looking around at
Committee members, it does not seem that they have experienced that
either.</div><a name="09070260000187"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070260000325"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> There is a real world outside the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s constituency surgery and his own experiences, just
as I accept that there is a real world outside my direct experience. I
will send him the examples that I have received, as well as sending
them to the hon. Member for
Stroud.</div><a name="09070260000188"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070260000326"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070260000327"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I will send them to all Committee members, then
the hon. Member for Forest of Dean will see that he is wrong in saying
that the problem does not exist. It is no surprise that people who are
concerned about this matter might not feel willing to come to him if he
is not sympathetic to them. However, that is their choice and his
choice. At no point did I say that the Scout Association was a dreadful
organisation. As the hon. Gentleman reports, some scout groups are
short of leaders and one reason for that is their unnecessary religious
test. In many places, Scouts are the only or main youth activity. Not
every constituency is blessed with the youth organisations that the
hon. Member for Forest of Dean talks about in his constituency. Where
we have non-religious youth organisations, they should be inclusive,
and that is all that I am asking
for.</div><a name="09070260000247"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.15

Howell</b> (Henley) (Con): I wonder whether the hon.
Gentleman, like me and my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry, went to
Thame in my constituency to see all the Oxfordshire scouts gathered
together. An enormous number of scouts spent an entire weekend there.
The message that came across was that they had huge numbers of people
waiting to join. Many parents, who volunteer on a regular basis, were
also there. There was no shortage of volunteers and no overt religion.
All I saw was scouts having an extremely good time in very good weather
and really living up to the expectations that we would have insisted
that young people have these
days.</div><a name="09070260000191"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070260000329"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> I am sure that it was a jolly weekend. I have been
to scout jamborees in my own constituency, and the hon. Gentleman is
right; they are not an overtly 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column641" />Column number: 641</div>religious organisation. So why impose a religious test that prevents
scout groups, on some occasions, from getting the leaders that they
need? It may be very viable in Thame, but there are scout groups of
which I am aware that are struggling because of a lack of leaders. We
know that the Criminal Records Bureau test is one cause of their
recruiting
difficulties.</div><a name="09070260000192"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09070260000330"></a><b class="B">Lynne
Featherstone</b> (Hornsey and Wood Green) (LD): Just to even
this out a bit, my local scout groups are crying out for volunteers to
come and lead them. I do not know whether the inhibition is to do with
the religion test, but there is an issue about getting volunteers. This
is therefore an important debate, and I am shocked that hon. Members
are so dismissive of something that might remove a barrier to
people&#146;s taking
part.</div><a name="09070260000193"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070260000335"></a>Mr.
Harper:</b> Before the hon. Gentleman concludes, there is a
shortage of scout leaders, and a number of things have been adduced to
that. He mentioned the CRB checks, but there is the issue of the busy
lives that people lead now. Employers expect people to be more flexible
and available, and do not always allow them to commit the time. I have
had lots of those discussions with scout groups in my constituency and
with those who are considering making the commitment. I have to say
that people have never not got involved because of the concern that the
hon. Gentleman raises. It is simply not an example that I, or other
hon. Members across the United Kingdom, have come across, apart from
the hon. Gentleman in Oxford, West and
Abingdon.</div>
<a name="09070260000198"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070260000336"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> There are very clear rules about using mobile
communications in Committee, but I notice that my phone has three text
messages. Were I to open them, which I will not, I suspect that they
will say, &#147;Here is an example&#148;, or &#147;I will send
you an example.&#148; The hon. Gentleman represents one 646th of the
country. I hope he will accept that if I send him examples, they exist.

this Bill has to have a wide scope. I see people shaking their heads in
disappointment. As I said, the Bill must be granted a wide scope of
debate and discussion. On this particular point, however, we have gone
as far as we can. I, as Chair of the Committee, will accept the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s experiences in good faith. We all know what our own
individual experiences are, so can we just accept them? Moreover, the
shortage of scout leaders is not relevant to this Committee. Let us get

intervene?</div><a name="09070260000201"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070260000340"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> Good. I have concluded, therefore, that we would
be better off without the exemption&#151;regardless of whether or not
the Scouts feel it is important&#151;because without it, society will
be better for it, young people will be better treated, and the Scouts
will be an even more effective and prosperous
organisation.</div><a name="09070260000203"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070260000341"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> You have only to say God and God will
do. You can be an associate member if you do not say
it.</div><a name="09070260000204"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070260000342"></a>Dr.
Harris:</b> Again, I am not sure whether that was more
expansive or less expansive than the Minister&#146;s reply in the
previous debate. I think that it was more expansive. I think that she
was talking to you, Mr. Benton, so perhaps you are
considering joining the Scouts. I think she said that someone only has
to say &#147;God&#148; to join, and if they do not they can be an
associate member. There are examples in discrimination law of such
situations not being acceptable, for example women being admitted to
private members&#146; clubs on different terms from men. It should be
an either/or.</div>
<a name="09070260000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">The analogy
with discrimination against women is apposite because the Bill seems to
argue that if clubs admit women, they should be admitted on full terms.
I think that the Minister was defending, by implication, admitting
atheists but not on full terms. I do not know whether she is able or
willing to justify differential treatment according to religion, but it
amounts to the same thing. Someone is discriminated against on the
basis of their religion if they are not allowed to join, or if they are
not allowed to lead because they are only an associate member. I shall
first send Members those examples, and then seek them out in the
corridors of this place before the next stage of the Bill to see
whether they are convinced. In the meantime, I beg to ask leave to
withdraw the

persons
generally.&#148;</div><a name="09070260000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
fundamental problem is that I am unable to determine the meaning of
subsection 186(4). I accept that that is my shortcoming, but it might
be shared by others. I thought that the best way to raise the issue was
by asking what subsection 187(2) does, because it is not obvious what
it means, either to me or to others whom I have asked, including
legally minded people. I would be grateful, therefore, for an
explanation.</div><a name="09070260000212"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070260000344"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> Amendment 308 would remove section
187(2), which prevents charities that provide benefits only to people
of particular colour from relying on the exemption in subsections (1)
and (2) of clause 186. The effect of the amendment would be
that such a charity could seek to show that the restriction of benefits

<div class="Column"><a name="Column644" />Column number: 644</div>was proportionate in achieving a legitimate aim. There is never any
justification for discriminating between people who have different
colours, and subsection 186(4) replicates that effect. The law has not
changed since 1976, and it is a pity if it has not been understood
during all that time. When a charitable instrument defines
beneficiaries by reference to colour, the provision takes effect as if
the reference to colour were completely disregarded. Therefore, there
is no problem
here.</div><a name="09070260000213"></a>
