<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101541000308"></a>The
Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Ian Pearson):</b> I beg to
move amendment No. 17, in
clause 11, page 7, line 13, at
end insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;( ) The
Treasury may by order amend the figure in subsection
(1)(a).</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">( ) An order under this
section is subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of either
House of
Parliament.&#146;.</div><a name="08101541000017"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101541000309"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss
amendment No. 28, in
clause 11, page 7, line 13, at
end insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(6) The
Treasury may by order reduce the period of dormancy referred to in
subsection (1)(a).</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">(7) An order
made under subsection (6) may not be made unless a draft of the
statutory instrument containing it has been laid before, and approved
by a resolution of, each House of
Parliament.&#146;.</div><a name="08101541000018"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101541000310"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> It is a real pleasure to serve under your
chairmanship, Dr.
McCrea.</div><a name="08101541000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment will enable a time limit for defining dormancy to be changed
by order if evidence shows it to be inappropriate. We recognise that
there is considerable debate over the most suitable length of that
period for the purposes of a dormant account scheme such as this. It is
our view that 15 years of customer inactivity is the most appropriate
period to determine whether an account is truly dormant, but we
recognise that others hold different views and that has been the
subject of debate.</div>
<a name="08101541000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">The 15-year
figure was arrived at after discussion with industry and through
consultation. It is also the figure that other countries, including
Ireland, have adopted in legislation. Industry estimates that 80 per
cent. of accounts that have had no customer-initiated activity for 15
years are truly dormant. Adopting a lower dormancy period would run the
danger of having a higher reclaim rate with a corresponding increase in
costs. In any case, any accounts that become dormant earlier will still
be dormant when they reach the 15-year mark and come into the scheme
then.</div>
<a name="08101541000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">Nevertheless,
we have listened to the arguments for a shorter period and we accept
that, in the future, the experience of the operation of the scheme and
of industry might suggest that an alternative figure is more
appropriate. Accordingly, the Government amendment will introduce a
reserve power for the Treasury to amend the dormancy
period.</div><a name="08101541000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 28, which stands in the name of the hon. Member for Fareham, has
the same objective. The fundamental difference between us is the level
of parliamentary scrutiny, which we consider appropriate for the use of
this power. Let me be clear: this is not a  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column42" />Column number: 42</div>power that the Treasury will use lightly. Plainly, this is an issue on
which it would be appropriate and necessary to consult before any order
was drafted. That said, we do not believe that this is the type of
power to justify the use of parliamentary time that an affirmative
resolution instrument would
require.</div><a name="08101541000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
believe that this is an instrument in relation to which the negative
resolution procedure is appropriate. Its scope is broadly similar to
that to amend the asset limit for participating in the small and local
aspect of the scheme. The Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform
Committee gave the opinion that a negative resolution procedure is
appropriate and sufficient in that
instance.</div><a name="08101541000024"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08101541000311"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mark Hoban</b> (Fareham) (Con): It is a pleasure to serve
under your chairmanship, Dr. McCrea, for what is probably the first
time.</div><a name="08101541000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister highlights one difference between the two amendments and the
approach that we have adopted&#151;going down the positive route. We
think that, because this is affecting customer assets, and we are all
here to help to safeguard the interests of our constituents, there
should be a debate over this matter. He says that it would be an
inappropriate use of parliamentary time to go down the affirmative
route, but we could pray against the measure and still take up the same
amount of time.</div>
<a name="08101541000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of the
Minister&#146;s predecessors, the hon. Member for Wentworth (John
Healey), was very keen when he was a Treasury Minister on introducing
the affirmative resolution procedure at every opportunity, because he
felt it was so important that parliamentary scrutiny was seen to be
working. That is an example that I encourage the Minister, 11 days into
his new brief, to
follow.</div><a name="08101541000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would like to raise the issue of the period of dormancy, because both
amendments offer the power to vary the period from the 15 years
specified in the Bill. In a way, that is probably the more substantive
issue. The Government amendment will enable the period of dormancy to
be increased, while ours is a one-way bet downwards. It is quite
important to get the period of dormancy right. The approach that the
British Bankers Association has adopted is to achieve reasonable
certainty that an account is dormant where there has been no
customer-initiated activity for 15 years. It believes that after 15
years, 80 per cent. of accounts will genuinely be dormant,
and about 20 per cent. might be subject to a repayment
claim.</div><a name="08101541000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the period of dormancy is reduced, the risk will be that the proportion
of accounts subject to reclaim will increase, which could reduce the
certainty in the reclaim fund&#146;s business plan and affect the
fund&#146;s ability to ensure that it adopts a prudent view on
transfers to the Big Lottery
Fund.</div><a name="08101541000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
BBA has
said:</div><a name="08101541000264"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
would not consider the setting of a shorter maturity period to be
compatible with the objective of releasing genuinely lost
monies.&#148;</div><a name="08101541000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
BBA, the Commission on Unclaimed Assets and Grant Thornton all agree,
as does the Building Societies Association, with the principle of a
15-year maturity period. However, the Treasury Committee&#151;we have
not referred to it so far in the proceedings&#151;suggested in its
report, &#147;Unclaimed assets within the financial system&#148;,
that the period of dormancy could be reduced from 15 to 10
years.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column43" />Column number: 43</div><a name="08101541000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">When one of
the Minister&#146;s predecessors&#151;I think it was the right hon.
Member for Normanton (Ed Balls), not the hon. Member for Burnley (Kitty
Ussher)&#151;gave evidence to the Treasury Committee, he drew a
parallel with the Irish scheme, in which the period of dormancy is 15
years. The Committee took issue with that, as the definition used in
the Irish scheme is much narrower than that used in the UK scheme, and
in Ireland the scheme takes no account of customer activity, whereas in
the UK it
does.</div><a name="08101541000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is clear from the Committee&#146;s evidence that the UK is an outlier
regarding the period of dormancy, compared to other jurisdictions. The
table in the Committee&#146;s report shows that Switzerland has a
10-year period, Australia seven years and New Zealand six. Nevada and
California have periods of just three years. Interestingly, over the
summer, I read reports that some US states are reducing the period to
enable them to reap the proceeds and plug the hole in their coffers by
declaring more accounts dormant. I do not know how desperate the
Treasury feels about plugging holes&#151;it may go down that
route.</div><a name="08101541000033"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08101541000312"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Martyn Jones</b> (Clwyd, South) (Lab): Is the hon. Gentleman
aware that before this legislation was proposed most banks also used a
three-year dormancy
period?</div><a name="08101541000034"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101541000313"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> That is useful information. I had heard&#151;in
the context of building societies, I think&#151;that a five-year
period was being used. The hon. Gentleman is very knowledgeable about
these subjects, but it is not clear to me what difference extending the
period from five to 15 years would make to the banks. While one does
not necessarily want to be driven by practices in other countries, it
is instructive that a wide range of dormancy periods is used elsewhere.
We need to retain an open mind about the period, and our amendment and
the Government&#146;s indicate a willingness to do
that.</div><a name="08101541000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
period will also depend on experience, because we may find that as the
reclaim fund does its work, the proportion of reclaims from accounts is
perhaps only 10 per cent., rather than there being an 80:20 split. If
we believe that the rule should be more or less 80:20, that might
encourage a shorter period of dormancy to be set. I am not sure whether
the Government have expressed a view on the appropriateness of that
split, but we should keep it in
mind.</div><a name="08101541000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">While
I would prefer a downward-only, rather than an upward-only, revision, I
do not think that anyone has suggested that the period be longer. The
Government&#146;s amendment will achieve an objective that we share
on both sides of the Committee, which is that we should be able to
reduce the period in the light of
experience.</div><a name="08101541000037"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08101541000314"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Jeremy Browne</b> (Taunton) (LD): I, too, welcome you to the
Chair, Dr. McCrea. On the substantial point just discussed by the
Conservative spokesman, 15 years is inevitably an arbitrary
figure&#151;one could pick, 14, 16 or 10 years. I have no
strong views. There seems to be a reasonable consensus that 15 years is
a good starting point&#151;as good as any&#151;and that it could be
reviewed at some point. I agree that the consensus seems to be that the
figure is likely be made lower rather than higher following such a
review.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column44" />Column number: 44</div><a name="08101541000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">More
importantly, I support amendment No. 28, which stands in the name of
the hon. Member for Fareham and which I suspect I support with greater
fervour than he does himself. I think that an important distinction is
being made by the Conservative party, as distinct from the Government.
This is
fundamental.</div><a name="08101541000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
know that the Minister gets given all kinds of rubbish to read out and
he has to do his job, but I cannot believe he is telling us that
changing the year is incidental. It is not like putting up prescription
charges by the rate of inflation. As I understand it, he is
saying&#151;he should correct me if I am wrong&#151;that the figure
could be changed from 15 years to, say, one year in a way that
fundamentally alters the legislation and that that would not be deemed
sufficiently important in the context of the Act, if that is what it
becomes, for it automatically to be discussed in the House of Commons.
That seems an extraordinary position for the Minister to
take.</div><a name="08101541000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is not incremental fiddling. I can understand that if the Minister
changed the figure from 15 to 14 years it might feel incremental, but
we are giving the Government the power, without reference to
Parliament, fundamentally to alter the legislation in a way that would
affect millions of people. On that basis, if he chose to reflect on
these matters, he would feel it entirely reasonable to agree to
amendment No. 28, even without a vote of the
Committee.</div><a name="08101541000041"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101541000315"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I have indeed reflected and consulted my
officials, and I remain of the opinion that the negative procedure is
appropriate. However, I stress that there is not much difference
between us. We are all clear that we broadly accept that 15 years is
the figure to go for at the moment. We want to build an evidence base
and see how the scheme works. If the evidence points to the need for
the scheme to have a lesser period, we will commit ourselves to consult
widely on either a reduced or a higher figure. I think it highly likely
that the figure would be lower.</div>
<a name="08101541000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">We would have
a public consultation exercise. If there were serious concerns in
Parliament about the outcome of the public consultation and any real
dispute, I have no doubt that after we had laid a proposal before
Parliament it would be prayed against and we would have a debate.
However, I think it likely that we will build a body of evidence,
review it and reach a consensus that there may be a reduction. That is
why I still think that the negative procedure is the appropriate course
to adopt. We should not say that parliamentary time must be allocated
when it is highly likely that it would be
unnecessary.</div><a name="08101541000043"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment

proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the
Bill.</div>
<a name="08101541000045"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101541000316"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> It is not my normal practice to speak in stand
part debates, because a lot of legislation speaks for itself and is
straightforward. However, following the debate on earlier amendments to
the clause and comments made by the hon. Members for Fareham and for
Cities of London and Westminster, I asked my officials to check the
scope of the clause with legal advisers to ensure that it meets what we
share as its objectives.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column45" />Column number: 45</div><a name="08101541000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would like
to make the following points of clarification, which have been agreed
by Treasury legal advisers and parliamentary counsel. Following the
request that we check whether clause 11 will achieve our shared
objectives, we want to confirm that it will. Clause 11(2) makes it
clear that, for the purpose of calculating the 15-year period of no
customer-initiated activity, the period must be continuous and any time
when an account falls within either of the exclusions in subsections
(2)(a) and (b) cannot be included, thus setting the clock back to
zero.</div><a name="08101541000281"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.45
pm</div><a name="08101541000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection
(2)(a) excludes no-contact accounts, which are more commonly known as
no-mail accounts, so if an instruction of no communication is given
during a period of inactivity, that sets the clock back to zero. A new
period of 15 years only starts to run when that instruction no longer
applies. Subsection (2)(b) excludes accounts that restrict or penalise
withdrawals in all circumstances. That would cover an account that has
a penalty for making any withdrawal, such as a fixed-term account, but
not an account&#151;notice accounts are an example&#151;in which
withdrawal is penalised only in certain circumstances, such as without
giving a period of notice. Again, any period during which an account
has a fixed-term restriction or penalty is not included for the purpose
of calculating dormancy and sets the clock back to zero. The
debated&#151; and now withdrawn&#151;amendment proposed deleting
the words, &#147;during that period&#148;, but that language is
necessary to give effect to the intention outlined above, as it makes
it clear that the restriction is not an absolute
one.</div><a name="08101541000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
summarise, an account that was at one time a no-contact or fixed-term
account is not permanently excluded from the scheme, but the 15 years
of inactivity that qualify the account for dormancy can begin only once
the fixed term or the no-contact restrictions have ended. In the case
of notice accounts, since the restrictions do not apply in all
circumstances, there is nothing to prevent them from qualifying for
dormancy after 15 years of inactivity. I hope that that
clarifies the point made by the hon. Member for Fareham and
others.</div><a name="08101541000049"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101541000317"></a>Mr.
Jones:</b> The Minister will be aware that I have problems
with the definition of dormancy. One possible problem concerns how the
start date of dormancy is interpreted by the banks. He said that the
notion of a dormant bank account was established in 1992, under the
banking code changes. However, I am suspicious that some banks may be
using 1992 as the start date for the dormant bank accounts period, and
that all their consideration of whether an account is dormant or not
starts from 1992. Has the Minister made any inquiries about that? Would
he accept a limited interpretation of that nature? I informed his
predecessor of a bank that claimed that it had &#163;400 million in
dormant bank accounts, but which is now claiming only &#163;50
million. I told his predecessor the name of that bank, in
confidence&#151;have any inquiries been made in that respect? A
further problem with the interpretation of dormancy is that some banks
may consider certain accounts to be dormant only if they contain a
minimum amount. That excludes a great deal of small moneys in accounts,
which could add up to significant sums.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column46" />Column number: 46</div><a name="08101541000050"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101541000318"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Taking the hon. Gentleman back to his comment about
the banking code, is he saying that accounts opened before to 1992
would not count as dormant? Clearly, accounts opened in 1992 and
after&#151;1992 particularly&#151;would now be deemed dormant under
the Bill. Is it the pre-1992 accounts that he believes are being
excluded from the
definition?</div><a name="08101541000051"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101541000319"></a>Mr.
Jones:</b> That is indeed my suspicion. The hon. Gentleman has
hit the nail on the head. I have a great deal of suspicion that the
number of accounts&#151;particularly those mentioned by me and by
other Members on Second Reading&#151;volunteered by the banks has
decreased significantly from the figures that I obtained in 2004.
I suspect that 1992 may be a factor. It may not be, but I
would be interested to know whether the Minister has looked into that.
To get back to the minimum amount definition, does the Minister agree
that there should be no minimum amount standard when banks set their
definition of
dormancy?</div><a name="08101541000052"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101541000320"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> On my hon. Friend&#146;s first point, about
banks using 1992 as their start point, I am happy to say that that is
not the case and that dormancy may begin under the legislation at any
point. It is helpful to make that clear. With regard to banks
participating in the scheme, we have widespread support from the
banking industry&#151;they want to participate and there is no
evidence that they will hold back accounts. As my hon. Friend will be
aware, banks will publish their policies on dormancy as part of the
normal banking code. At the moment, different banks have different
interpretations of dormancy. One of the strengths of the voluntary
approach, and of the flexibility that we are allowing for banks to
determine what is dormant, is that it will lead to an efficient way of
operating the reclaim
fund.</div><a name="08101541000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
we made plain in earlier debates, we want a clear legal definition of
dormancy for banks to have certainty and to enable them to use their
judgment on whether accounts are genuinely dormant, rather than putting
words in the Bill that will detract from the overall clarity that we
are seeking. We have been very clear about the principles on which we
want the scheme to operate. I appreciate my hon. Friend&#146;s
concerns about banks possibly not wanting to transfer all the funds
over. The system will be transparent, so we will know from each

regular basis, because it will be recorded.</div>
<a name="08101541000054"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101541000321"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I want to pick up on a point that the hon. Member
for Clwyd, South made, which arose on several occasions on Second
Reading, about the amounts involved. There were estimates when the
process started, of significant sums of money, and over time those
estimates have reduced. There are two interpretations of that. One is
that the banks are holding back and the other, which I hold, is that
there has been a lot of &#147;finger in the air&#148; estimation.
As banks have focused much more on dormancy and have gone through their
accounts more rigorously, they have been able to produce a more
accurate estimate than hitherto. Does the Minister share his hon.
Friend&#146;s view or my view as to why the estimates have
changed?</div>
<a name="08101541000055"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101541000322"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I do not want to pick sides. Both my hon. Friend
and the hon. Member for Fareham have made valid points. We have no
evidence that banks 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column47" />Column number: 47</div>want to stash away accounts that they think are dormant, and do not want
to put them into the reclaim fund. Recently there has been substantial
activity by banks and building societies wanting to reunite customers
with their accounts through www.mylostaccount.org.uk and other
institutions. There has been a stronger focus on, and assessment of,
the issue of whether accounts are dormant or not. The definition of 15
years for dormancy has affected that. Banks and building societies have
undertaken a pretty rigorous exercise, looking at the savings on their
books and concluding whether those accounts are genuinely dormant or
not. The figure has become more accurate and is the best estimate
available at the
moment.</div><a name="08101541000056"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101541000323"></a>Mr.
Jones:</b><b class="B"> </b>I am grateful to the Minister for giving way
again; he is very patient. The truth is probably somewhere between the
hon. Member for Fareham&#146;s position and mine, but I have still
had hard evidence from one particular high street bank, which told me
that it had &#163;400 million in 2004. We are now talking about a
figure of &#163;450 million for all high street banks. The bank that
I was talking about told me that it now has &#163;50 million, so,
somewhere, somehow, there has been a change in definition. Does my hon.
Friend think that the proposed change to 15 years&#151;the bank in
question was probably using three years&#151;would make much of a
difference? If so, that may be the
reason.</div><a name="08101541000057"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101541000324"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b><b class="B"> </b>I strongly suspect that that is the case.
Before these discussions on the Bill, banks would have had a particular
view of dormancy, and it is unlikely to have been 15 years. I strongly
suspect that the figures vary widely and that that is the explanation
in this case, but I am more than happy to discuss this matter offline
with my hon.
Friend.</div><a name="08101541000058"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

I ask for your guidance, Dr. McCrea? All three proposed amendments to
clause 12 were tabled in my name, but the most substantial is amendment
No. 7. Although amendments Nos. 48 and 49 are important, they are
secondary to amendment No. 7. Will you permit me, Dr. McCrea, to
discuss all three or would you rather I made a cursory nod at amendment
No. 48, then sat down and started again on amendments Nos. 7 and 49 in
a

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101541000326"></a>The

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101541000327"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> In that case, I will touch briefly on that
amendment. Clause 12 requires a report to go before Parliament every
three years, and the amendment requires consultation to be expanded to
include those affected 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column48" />Column number: 48</div>by the dormant account scheme. The particular group that I have in mind
is charities. Perhaps when I speak to amendment No. 7, I will expand on
that
point.</div><a name="08101541000064"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101541000328"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> If I had realised that the hon. Gentleman was going
to be so brief, I might have been sharper on my feet while he was
speaking. I understand the point that he made. Looking at his
amendment, I guessed that that was the group to which he was referring.
Is this amendment not rather broad in its wording? The words,
&#147;who are affected by&#148;, could cover all sorts of groups. I
am all in favour of consultation, but I wonder whether the hon.
Gentleman has drawn his amendment so broadly that we will have a
consultation process that will be quite difficult to complete when
considering the triennial review.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101541000329"></a>Ian

Pearson:</b><b class="B"> </b>I also invite Committee members to oppose
amendment No. 48. Along with amendment No. 49, which we cannot discuss,
it would add to the reports that the Treasury is required to make under
this clause. I will invite hon. Members to oppose clause 12 standing
part of the Bill, but I want to say that we recognise the fundamental
requirement, both for a review and for thorough transparency in the
reporting on the operations and working of the reclaim fund. We do not
believe that the amendment is necessary or, as I will explain later,
that the clause is appropriate.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101541000335"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> What a build-up. I had better be worth listening
to, but I fear that I may
disappoint.</div><a name="08101541000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
important point covered by the amendment has been made by several
representative parties interested in the Bill, especially charities,
which is why the grouping of the amendments is not as I would have
anticipated. Amendment No. 7 is of the greatest import, as it would
create a reserve power for a register of dormant accounts, while
amendment No. 49 would require those affected by knowledge of the
scheme and its operation, such as charities, to be consulted. It would
provide affected charities with greater ability to trace the
accounts.</div><a name="08101541000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
wish to make a slightly more substantial speech about such matters,
because they are of importance to those people who raised them with me.
Legacies are a vital source of income for charities. The BBA and the
Building Societies Association estimate that up to
&#163;500 million is sitting in dormant accounts&#151;a
point that we discussed a moment ago with regard to the previous
clause. The Commission on Unclaimed Assets estimates that that is about
&#163;3 billion to &#163;5 billion. It is a substantial amount, but
legacies are a particularly significant form of income and the ability
to trace that money is most important for the charitable sector. One in
seven people leaves legacy gifts to charity that average 5 per cent. of
their total
estate.</div><a name="08101541000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Institute of Fundraising estimates that legacies account for 36.3 per
cent. of its money, and more than one third of the voluntary income
received by charities in 2007 totalled &#163;1.6 billion. By way of
illustration, last year, 46 per cent. of the British Heart
Foundation&#146;s voluntary income came from legacies, and 33 per
cent. of Cancer Research UK&#146;s voluntary income totalling well
over &#163;100 million came from legacies. I have the honour of
serving as a vice-president of the Parkinson&#146;s Disease Society,
and I take a close interest in that cause. I attended a meeting with
its trustees earlier this week, and I was told that its income from
inherited money, gifts and legacies was about half of its total income
as a charity. Legacies are extremely important to part of the voluntary
sector that everyone in the House wishes to see
assisted.</div><a name="08101541000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">At
present, charities are unable to locate legacies adequately that are
left in dormant accounts. I welcome 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column50" />Column number: 50</div>the setting up of the industry&#146;s main initiative, the website
&#147;mylostaccount.org.uk&#148;, which allows any person or
charity to go online and search using basic information. It is part of
the recent reuniting scheme undertaken by the sector, but it has
several shortcomings. Searches can be conducted only if the charity
knows what bank or building the unclaimed assets are in. The Minister
shakes his head. If he can reassure me on that point, I would be
grateful.</div><a name="08101541000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
suppose that people must have to put in a certain amount of information
and that it would be helpful to have some idea of where to search. A
person might have a better sense of the starting point if he were
looking for his own account than trying to find the unclaimed or
dormant assets of someone who has died. I do not assert what I have to
say with absolute confidence, but raise it as a cause of concern. I do
not believe that I am necessarily in the right and that the Government
are wrong, but there might be some accounts&#151;internet bank
accounts, for example&#151;where searching is harder to achieve. I do
not know how far back records go and the degree to which individual
banks would co-operate to make the system as efficient as
possible.</div><a name="08101541000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 7 deals with an enabling power that could be invoked if the
triennial report found that arrangements for reuniting owners with
their assets were insufficient. An amendment introduced in the other
place with a reserve power to create a register was narrowly defeated
in a Division. The Government claimed that current initiatives were
enough to ensure strong take-up of the scheme by the financial
institutions and that success, although it cannot be guaranteed, should
be sufficient to reunite charities with the funds, but concerns
remain.</div>
<a name="08101541000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am given to
understand that other countries operate practices that allow charities
to locate money more efficiently and effectively. That is the
motivation behind amendment No. 7. Although it is in the distant past
and the Committee has already rejected it, I accept that amendment No.
48 was rather broadly
worded.</div><a name="08101541000080"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08101541000336"></a><b class="B">Tom
Levitt</b> (High Peak) (Lab): Amendment No. 48 was indeed
widely worded, given the nature of the phrase, &#147;who are affected
by&#148;. However, similar wording appears in proposed new subsection
(8) in amendment No. 7. Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that any
potential beneficiary from any charity that might at some time benefit
from funds in dormant accounts should be able to question that issue?
That seems to be a recipe for
disaster.</div><a name="08101541000081"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101541000337"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> I err on the side of caution, but it is sometimes
difficult to define a category for consultation. One could try to list
every single group that one wished to see as the beneficiaries of a
consultative process, but that would be flawed in other
ways.</div><a name="08101541000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
wider point I am trying to make is about the charitable sector&#146;s
concern. When talking about relocating money, the first instance that
tends to come to mind is an individual who has left a certain amount of
money, perhaps a few hundred pounds, in an account that was given to
them as a teenager to help set them up. Twenty years later, they have
completely forgotten about it and think, &#147;Gosh, that&#146;s
nice, I&#146;ve discovered a few hundred pounds that I did not
realise I had.&#148; There is an onus on 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column51" />Column number: 51</div>the banks to reunite such an individual with the money. It is a nice
bonus for them, but in most cases it will be fairly incidental to their
well-being. After all, in most cases, the person has forgotten that
they ever had that money in the first place.</div>
<a name="08101541000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
charitable sector has raised the difficulty of tracking down money that
was intended for a charity. Inevitably, the person concerned has died,
otherwise the money would not be in the form of a legacy. Such funds
are not incidental bonuses, but absolutely crucial income streams for
charitable organisations. Every effort should be made to ensure that
charities have the maximum possible access to the means for searching
for the legacies that are intended for them. The Government must
consult those organisations on how that might best be achieved. That is
all I want to say, but if Members wish to intervene on me, I am happy
for them to do
so.</div><a name="08101541000084"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08101541000338"></a><b class="B">John
Howell</b> (Henley) (Con): I want to press the hon. Gentleman
a little further on why he thinks the website cannot be improved to
undertake those searches. I went on to the website myself, purely to
see how it worked, rather than because I thought I had a large number
of unclaimed accounts that I had somehow mislaid. There is a lot of
scope to improve the website and take on just this sort of function. I
do not see the need for the provision, as we have not yet explored the
potential of the website to deliver this
function.</div><a name="08101541000085"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101541000339"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b><b class="B"> </b>I will make two brief points in response to
that intervention. First, I urge the Government to consult widely on
how the money may best be accessed by the people for whom it is
intended. They may well come to the conclusion that improving the
website is a good way to do that. I am not coming up with a
prescription, but a means by which the Government may come to a more
satisfactory end
point.</div><a name="08101541000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
and slightly off the beaten track of the point that I was making, we
should be careful lest we assume that everyone person who has a dormant
account feels comfortable using the internet to track down that
information. I accept that a large charity would have access to the
internet, and would feel comfortable using this sort of device. There
may be a number of people who have forgotten about an account who do
not routinely use the internet. I do not wish to stereotype those
individuals, but that could be particularly true of older people. If
the Government asked for my opinion as part of their three-year review,
I would say that such an internet site would be a useful device, but
insufficient on its own, even if it were
improved.</div><a name="08101541000087"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101541000340"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> The hon. Gentleman has clearly thought about this
carefully. He and I have received the same representations, and I will
touch on that shortly. We are talking about information that belongs to
the bank. We had a debate yesterday about the confidentiality of data,
who owned the data and what data should be transferred between the bank
and the reclaim fund. Has he given any thought to the issue of data
confidentiality, how that would be dealt with in setting up a central
asset of unclaimed bank accounts and how the scheme would provide
protection against identity theft and
fraud?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column52" />Column number: 52</div><a name="08101541000088"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101541000341"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes an extremely good point,
and it is difficult to reconcile those two objectives. If one is trying
to track down information, it is helpful if as few barriers as possible
are put in one&#146;s way. Confidentiality is inevitably a barrier.
The Government and the Committee may think that additional safeguards
need to be put in place. I gave the example of the Parkinson&#146;s
Disease Society. About 120,000 people in the United Kingdom suffer from
that disease. The society has about 30,000 members, only about half of
whom have the disease, thus only about one in 10 people who suffer from
the disease belong to the society, and even that figure is not
necessarily a good starting point to try to make an educated guess
about the type of people who leave money in a legacy to a charity or a
similar organisation.</div>
<a name="08101541000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is quite
hard for the charitable sector, given that it is heavily reliant on
those donations, to make informed or semi-educated guesses about the
people who choose to leave money to them. There may be people who are
sympathetic to their cause, but who have previously shown no direct
interest in the work of that charity, but choose to leave it a
substantial amount in a legacy. I appreciate that there are concerns
about confidentiality and practicalities, but I want to put in place a
system, so that instead of a series of shots in the dark, those
charitable organisations can have the information gathered together in
a way that makes it easier for them to locate the money that was
intended for them and which they need to carry out their
duties.</div><a name="08101541000090"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101541000342"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I have some sympathy with the arguments advanced by
the various charity groups that are concerned about this issue, and the
Unclaimed Assets Charity Coalition and the National Council for
Voluntary Organisations have made representations about it. Committee
members have received representations over the past week advocating
this reserve power, and it was debated on Third Reading in the House of
Lords. We all start from the position of wanting to see as many of
these accounts as possible united with their owners. That has been the
spirit of the debate in Committee and on Second Reading. We want the
banks to co-operate as fully as possible with the rightful owners of
these accounts so that they are reunited.</div>
<a name="08101541000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have spoken
to the BBA myself about this issue, and I suspect that the Minister and
his officials have done so, too. We want to encourage it to be as
flexible as possible in the way in which it deals with this, subject to
its duties to its customers. I understand that the BBA has written to
the Unclaimed Assets Charity Coalition to try to explain how it can
benefit from the method of searching that is currently available and
also to work with it to establish whether there are substantial legacy
moneys sitting in unclaimed bank accounts, particularly in those
instances where it is the executor to the will.</div>
<a name="08101541000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">Part of the
challenge in considering whether the solution suggested by the hon.
Member for Taunton is proportionate concerns the amount of money
involved, and we touched on that topic in a previous clause. How much
money are we talking about?</div>
<a name="08101541000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">We touched on
that topic in a previous clause. How much money are we talking about?
The cost of setting up a central register would be borne, I suppose ,
by those accounts identified as dormant. The reclaim fund allows the
expense of running the fund to be offset or 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column53" />Column number: 53</div>defrayed by that money, and that expense would ultimately reduce the
amount of money available for the good causes identified in the
Bill.</div>
<a name="08101541000283"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.15
pm</div><a name="08101541000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
I have some sympathy with the case argued by the hon. Gentleman and
with the various charities involved, we need to see how the scheme
operates. Setting up a compulsory register would go against the grain
of the voluntary scheme for which we are legislating. I am not sure
that the Bill contains sufficient safeguards to make that transition
from a voluntary to a compulsory scheme, and if the Government are to
accept the measure, I suspect that it will need significant amendment
on Report.</div>
<a name="08101541000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">We must keep
the area under review, and that is why clause 12(2)(a), which sets out
the triennial report to Parliament, states that the report shall
include</div><a name="08101541000265"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
effectiveness of arrangements that exist to enable those with rights,
including those whose rights are established by way of a will...to
trace those accounts and to be paid money held in those
accounts&#148;.</div><a name="08101541000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is a good way of maintaining pressure on the banks and ensuring that
they do all that they can with the charities. That is my fall-back
position&#151;it puts the banks under a spotlight and requires them
to continue working carefully, not only during the passage of the Bill
through the other place and the Commons, but also over the triennial
review period. That is an important safeguard in the interests of those
organisations, but there are some practical issues about the reserve
power that have not yet been fully explored or discussed, and therefore
it is not appropriate to support the
measure.</div><a name="08101541000097"></a><div class="hs_Para"></div><a name="08101541000098"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101541000343"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I share in the thrust of the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s analysis, and I invite the hon. Member for Taunton
to withdraw his amendment. I, too, have a great deal of sympathy with
charities for the situation that they face, and the potential problems
that they have, such as tracing lost accounts that might benefit their
work.</div>
<a name="08101541000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Taunton caught me shaking my head, and I want to be clear
why I did that. It is my understanding that multiple institution
searches can currently be conducted on the
&#147;mylostaccount&#148; website. It is supported by a telephone
system for those who have difficulties using the website, and it
permits individuals to nominate a representative to complete the claim
on their behalf. Account holders and their legal heirs are legally
entitled to claim money owed to them in dormant accounts; they can do
that now. The website also allows executors or nominated
representatives to conduct searches for lost accounts, and it provides
guidance for those searching for information in respect of wills and
legacies.</div>
<a name="08101541000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government welcome constructive suggestions about how industry
reuniting arrangements might be further improved. I think that all
parties in the House share a strong desire to do more if possible to
reunite customers with money that is rightfully theirs. The hon. Member
for Henley made a point about improving the functionality of the
website, and I encourage him&#151;and anyone else who has positive
suggestions&#151;to put forward his ideas about how the site could be
improved to those who maintain and operate it.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column54" />Column number: 54</div><a name="08101541000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">We remain of
the view that a central register would be a relatively expensive
exercise and would place a large administrative burden on the scheme.
Mandating a register through legislation is therefore not necessary or
proportionate. More importantly, unlike &#147;mylostaccount&#148;,
it would also involve a significant transfer of personal data from
banks to the register operator. We have debated that issue previously,
but we do not believe that it is necessary or proportionate to
undertake to have a central register.</div>
<a name="08101541000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are aware
that there is a group of historic accounts for which the estates have
been wound up, with lost accounts being identified. To tackle those
accounts we have encouraged a dialogue between financial institutions
and the charity coalition. It is my understanding that the industry has
offered to explore ways in which such accounts can be identified and
Cancer Research has also indicated a willingness to take the matter
forward. I hope that, through increased dialogue between the industry
and the charities, and through the Government using their good offices,
we can try to make it simpler and more straightforward for charities to
increase their legacy income by tracing lost accounts and that such
work can continue. It is inappropriate, however, to include in the Bill
a register scheme that we believe is currently unnecessary, so I invite
the hon. Member for Taunton to withdraw his
amendment.</div>
<a name="08101541000103"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101541000344"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> I know that hon. Members of all parties will agree
that we have a particularly impressive charitable sector in the United
Kingdom. I cited the Parkinson&#146;s Disease Society because I have
a particular affiliation with it. I understand that it is roughly as
big as all the Parkinson&#146;s disease societies in every other EU
country put together, which is indicative of how well established and
impressive the sector is in the United Kingdom.</div>
<a name="08101541000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand
all the points that were raised and I have some sympathy with them.
There are issues of cost, the administrative burden, and the point
raised by the hon. Member for Fareham about confidentiality. More is
being done, and perhaps more could be done, to improve the existing
arrangements. I hope that at least by tabling the amendment I have
given the issues an airing, allowed the Committee to absorb them and
ensured that they will remain at the front of the Government&#146;s
mind as and when the Bill is eventually passed into law. Given that I
accept the points that have been made and that the subject has been
aired, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div>
<a name="08101541000105"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,
by leave, withdrawn.</i></div>

proposed, </i>That the clause stand part of the
Bill.</div>
<a name="08101541000107"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101541000345"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> As I explained earlier, I invite hon. Members to
oppose clause 12, but at the outset I want to say how much I agree with
the principle that underpins it. The transfer of money into the scheme
will be managed by a private sector-run reclaim fund, under private
arrangements that will be put in place by the fund and the banks, in
compliance with the requirements and consumer protections set out in
legislation such as the banking code and regulation by the Financial
Services Authority.</div>
<a name="08101541000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">After the
Bill has received Royal Assent and the scheme has been launched, the
Government should not lose sight of the scheme, and nor do we intend
to. I have 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column55" />Column number: 55</div>listened to the arguments setting out the importance of the triennial
review, which was introduced following the debates in the other place.
I agree that it is right that the Government should return at an
appropriate time to review whether the scheme is effective and
delivering the right outcomes for consumers. I still have difficulty,
however, in committing the Government to hold triennial reviews in
perpetuity for the reclaim fund and the proposed scheme. The Government
will commit to undertaking a post-implementation review when the scheme
is up and running, and I would like to set out how I see that review
being conducted.</div>
<a name="08101541000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">We propose to
review the scheme three years after the Bill takes effect, and of
course the review should be undertaken on the basis of robust data
about customer reclaim and the transfer of money to the Big Lottery
Fund. Precise decisions on the timing will depend on the evidence
available.</div>
<a name="08101541000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think it
premature at this stage to describe all the elements of the review.
Clearly, its terms will depend on how the scheme performs over that
period. However, I understand the desire for some agreement now on the
principles of any review, and I want to be as positive and constructive
as possible. Although I invite members of the Committee to oppose
clause 12 standing part of the Bill, I make it clear that we will have
a review, and that it will cover the effectiveness of the money in the
scheme, including the industry&#146;s arrangements for reuniting
customers with accounts before they become dormant, industry
participation in the scheme and the arrangements for repaying customers
whose assets have been transferred to the scheme. It will be based on
consultation with all relevant
parties.</div><a name="08101541000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
simply do not accept that a triennial review, which would be conducted
in perpetuity, is a sensible way forward. There should be a review, and
we accept that three years after the Bill takes effect is about the
right time for it, but we do not think it necessary to have in the Bill
a requirement for a triennial review. I therefore invite hon. Members
to oppose clause
12.</div><a name="08101541000112"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101541000346"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I confess to being disappointed with the Economic
Secretary&#146;s remarks. I understand the Government&#146;s
objection to the requirement to have a triennial review in perpetuity.
The Chief Secretary made that objection clear on Second Reading, and
she admitted, as indeed did the hon. Gentleman,
that</div><a name="08101541000266"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;we
must ensure that the scheme is working simply and fairly, and we think
it right to review it once it is up and
running&#148;.&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>, 6 October 2008; Vol.
480, c.
45.]</div><a name="08101541000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having
heard those words on Second Reading, I rather assumed that, rather than
debating whether to reject the clause completely, we would be
considering whether to amend it so that there was still a statutory
requirement to undertake a review three years after setting up the
scheme. We could have argued with the Minister whether one triennial
review was enough or whether we should have more than one, but I did
expect the principle of having a triennial review to remain in the
Bill.</div>
<a name="08101541000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is worth
the Committee remembering that when the Bill was first discussed in the
House of Lords, there was no reference whatever to a review, so we have
got the Government to shift their position. The Economic Secretary made
a statement about what the review will entail. Lord Davies of Oldham
had said that he would  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column56" />Column number: 56</div>make a statement to that effect on Third Reading in the Lords, but he
did not do so. At least now we have a little more clarification about
what the review may take into
account.</div><a name="08101541000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Economic Secretary says again for the record that this is a voluntary
scheme run by a private company, but it is being set up under an Act of
Parliament, and given the public interest in the matter it is important
to have continued scrutiny of the scheme. In the debate on clause 11 he
said that the dormancy period in the clause is a minimum and that banks
will be required to publish in the banking code how they are defining
and implementing that. The triennial review set out in the Bill would
have required a careful look at those arrangements in the hope that
shining a spotlight on them would encourage the banks to move to best
practice. That would have been an important outcome of the triennial
review.</div><a name="08101541000284"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.30
pm</div><a name="08101541000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are other important aspects to the clause on which the Minister has
given no assurances. Dormant bank accounts are a very narrow set of
assets, but we know from the Young report on the financial assistance
scheme, from the report of the Select Committee on the Treasury and
from the lobbying of the charitable sector that a huge range of other
unclaimed assets could be subject to the same type of
procedure.</div><a name="08101541000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
12(2)(f) refers to those types of asset and whether a similar scheme
should be established. Experience suggests that National Savings &amp;
Investments is a glaring omission involving significant unclaimed
assets. It is part of the reunification scheme, for which we should be
grateful, but not part of the process of transferring money from
NS&amp;I to good causes. We touched on that, and on the flimsiness of
the Government&#146;s arguments against it, on Second
Reading.</div><a name="08101541000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
statutory requirement strengthens Parliament&#146;s role in
scrutinising the scheme and requires those involved in it to recognise
that, once it is up and running, there will be a statutory review
rather than just an expression of the intention to hold a
review.</div><a name="08101541000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
will happen at the triennial review? The Government are saying that
there will be one review. While I accept that there is a good argument
for not having a review every three years until the end of time, what
will be the mechanism for taking forward any significant issues that
arise during the triennial review? At least our proposals provide for
such a mechanism, because there would be another review in three years.
It would be a rolling
process.</div><a name="08101541000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
best amendment for the Government to introduce would be an order-making
power to enable them to terminate the three-yearly reviews when they
were satisfied that the scheme was working efficiently and in the
interests of consumers and the bodies that are to receive the money.
That would be far more acceptable than deleting clause 12 entirely,
which would mean losing an opportunity to keep the scheme under review
until Parliament was comfortable that it was operating properly and in
the best interests of all the stakeholders. The Minister put us on
notice on Second Reading that we would come back to the matter, but the
way that has been done is unsatisfactory. I would rather that
clause 12 remained.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column57" />Column number: 57</div><a name="08101541000121"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101541000347"></a>Mr.
Jones:</b> I am happy that the Minister intends to review the
Bill&#146;s proposals in three years and that he agrees that the
adequate functioning of the voluntary scheme requires transparency.
Will he therefore explain whether all the information that would be
collated in the triennial report will be available from other sources?
What information requirements will fall on banks and building societies
when they make dormant bank account contributions? How much information
will they be required to give to the public or to the BBA or the
BSA?</div>
<a name="08101541000122"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101541000348"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> I concur with everything that the Conservative
spokesman said, so I shall not repeat it. He laid out the case for the
continuation of clause 12 very well and made a valid criticism of the
Minister when he said that the Government could have been more
imaginative in their approach to the clause rather than ordering their
troops to vote it down without coming up with a more satisfactory
compromise. Both Opposition parties understand that a commitment to
review the legislation every three years for the rest of time, as the
hon. Member for Fareham put it, would be unduly onerous, but some
recognition of the concerns raised in the Lords beyond the commitment
to the initial review would have been more
constructive.</div><a name="08101541000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
must make one further point, which I raised on Second Reading but have
yet to hear a satisfactory answer on. There will inevitably be a hit at
the beginning, when all the money in accounts that have been dormant
for 15 years or more will accrue to the central fund, and there will
need to be some sort of review of how efficiently that is being done.
Some of the money may not shake out of the system as quickly as it
might. However, after that initial hit, in the second year we shall be
talking only about bank accounts that have currently been dormant for
14 years, so there will be far less money in the second
year.</div><a name="08101541000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">With
the initial hit of publicity in the media and elsewhere for the 15
years and more, quite a few people whose accounts have lain dormant for
14 years may wake up to the concept of the dormant account and suddenly
remember a deposit that they put in the bank 14 years ago. The
following year, there will be only those whose accounts have currently
been dormant for 13 years&#151;when that feeds through two years down
the
line.</div><a name="08101541000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are talking about legislation whose effects will evolve, may change
quite substantially&#151;not just in the first three years, but as
they work through the system&#151;and might have an impact on
customer behaviour and awareness. Nine or 10 years down the line, the
people involved will be people whose bank accounts had been dormant for
only five or six years when the legislation was enacted. A case can be
made, which the Government could engage with a bit more constructively,
that there is benefit to having more than an initial review, just to
ensure that the legislation is up, running and functioning&#151;its
effect will change over time. Periodic reviews at different points down
the line might reach different conclusions and find out different
information from just one
review.</div><a name="08101541000126"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101541000349"></a>Tom
Levitt:</b> It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship,
Dr. McCrea. I share the bemusement of the hon. Member for Fareham that
the Government have chosen to delete the clause rather than to amend
it. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column58" />Column number: 58</div>My hon. Friend the Minister gave a speech a moment ago that he would
have given had he been moving amendment No. 18, which has not been
selected but which would have deleted the whole clause. I have some
sympathy with his argument, but not for removing the question of a
review from the legislation
completely.</div><a name="08101541000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
example, in subsection (1), the
words</div><a name="08101541000267"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;and
not more than every three years
thereafter&#148;</div><a name="08101541000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">could
have been deleted. That would have allowed one review three years after
implementation, without a commitment to such a thorough review later
on, thereby meeting one of his major
objections.</div><a name="08101541000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
also accept that clause 12 is incredibly detailed&#151;probably more
than is necessary for carrying out the review&#151;but it is an awful
lot less detailed and convoluted than it would have been had we
accepted amendment No. 7. Therefore, it is not as bad as it might have
been. The clause could be amended to improve it, but the Bill not
providing for a review would be a
mistake.</div><a name="08101541000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope I deduce from the Minister that we shall be able to put things
right, in the sense of being able to make changes to such a scheme,
when we come to new clause 2, which stands in the name of my hon.
Friend the Member for Clwyd,
South.</div><a name="08101541000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
would be the purpose of a review if it was not specified in the Bill?
If banks and building societies joined the scheme only on a voluntary
basis, they could opt out if they did not like what a review came up
with. If the detailed rules of the scheme were those that banks and
building societies had drawn up, what would the review be able to
achieve? If the review was not carried out by those who were
implementing the scheme, the point of the review would not be very
strong.</div><a name="08101541000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
addition, could the banks and building societies taking part in the
scheme not carry out their own reviews and change the scheme rules
without referring back to the Government? All those issues will become
real questions once the need to have a review of some kind is taken out
of the
Bill.</div><a name="08101541000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
take the Minister&#146;s word that a review will happen, but if we
take this approach and if the review cannot make a fundamental decision
three years down the line&#151;that decision might be, &#147;This
voluntary approach is not working and we need a mandatory
approach,&#148; and I feel that a review not specified in the Bill
could not say such a thing&#151;I think we are missing a
trick.</div><a name="08101541000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am happy to take the Minister&#146;s word that such a review will
take place, and I understand why he wants to delete the clause, but we
need something stronger from him at some point on what his review will
be capable of doing, especially if it concludes that the scheme is not
working as well as it
might.</div><a name="08101541000135"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08101541000350"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mark Field</b> (Cities of London and Westminster) (Con): I
hope that the Minister, in justifying his stance on the matter, will be
spouting only his own rubbish rather than anything presented by his
civil servants. I entirely agree with the comments made by my hon.
Friend the Member for Fareham and with many of those made by the hon.
Member for High Peak.</div>
<a name="08101541000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have one
other consideration to offer. Given that the Government are now, in
large proportion, the owner of two of the big four
banks&#151;presumably there will be many dormant accounts in HBOS,
Lloyds TSB and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column59" />Column number: 59</div>RBS&#151;it is incumbent upon them to give stronger justification as
to why a triennial review going some way into the future should be
struck out in this
way.</div><a name="08101541000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
appreciate that the Minister has some concerns with elements of the
clause, but simply to do away with all the safeguards
here&#151;safeguards for Parliament, on behalf of all our
constituents, but also to ensure that the system works correctly in the
years ahead, not least when the Government are such an important bank
owner&#151;would be entirely
undesirable.</div><a name="08101541000138"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101541000351"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I have listened carefully to the debate and a
number of perfectly valid points have been made. When we came to the
clause as a team, we had a closer look at it and felt that it would be
difficult to produce effective amendments that enabled us to have a
review, but not the onerous requirement to review for all time, as the
hon. Member for Fareham says and which I think is accepted on all
sides.</div>
<a name="08101541000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the amount
of information that will be available for the review&#151;a point
raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Clwyd, South&#151;there are
already, elsewhere in the Bill, quite substantial requirements to
produce information. When we debated previous clauses and amendments,
we considered the fact that the private company that operates the
reclaim fund must produce accounts on a timely basis. I am therefore
confident that there is sufficient information there for a review to be
conducted and for it to be an effective
one.</div><a name="08101541000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">Issues
were raised about the scope of the review by my hon. Friend the Member
for High Peak and the hon. Member for Fareham. When conducting the
review, we would want to look at the overall operational effectiveness
of the scheme. The issue of whether it should transfer from voluntary
to mandatory is different. Similarly, the point made by the hon. Member
for Fareham about whether we should consider other assets, such as
insurance assets and so forth, raises a range of issues that are not
legitimately within the scope of this legislation. Both the mandatory
elements and looking to extend the scope of the scheme would require
additional primary legislation. It would not be appropriate in a review
of effectiveness to include areas that were completely outside the
scope of the
Bill.</div><a name="08101541000285"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.45
pm</div><a name="08101541000141"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101541000352"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> The subsection in clause 12 that relates to other
assets does not talk about using this legislation to set up a fresh
scheme. It just ensures that the issue of other categories of assets
does not drop off the radar screen. It says that the report should look
at</div><a name="08101541000268"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
desirability and practicality of establishing similar
schemes&#148;.</div><a name="08101541000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
does not say anything about creating a framework for setting up such
schemes. It just says that we should keep our eye on the ball and make
sure that we do not forget that there are other classes of assets that
people might want to look at
carefully.</div><a name="08101541000143"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101541000353"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I do not want things to drop off the radar screen
either. Of course, as a Government we want to keep legislation under
review, but we have no current plans to extend the scope of the scheme,
and we think it premature to commit to a specific review of other
assets. It might be appropriate in the future.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column60" />Column number: 60</div><a name="08101541000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">I commented on
how we propose to conduct a review of the effectiveness of the scheme
after three years. I do not think that one should doubt the word of
Government when they say they will conduct a review after three years
but, if it is helpful, I am prepared to reflect on that and produce an
amendment on Report which would commit to a review being held after
three
years.</div><a name="08101541000145"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101541000354"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> It may be helpful to the Minister and officials to
look at the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 because that
includes provision for a statutory review of the FSA and the financial
ombudsman service two years after they were set up. The framework for
an amendment might be found there. One of the issues that arose from
those statutory reviews was that once they had taken place there was no
formal mechanism to go back and review either the FSA or the FOS, and
they were just kept under review. That has led in the case of FOS to
quite a lot of discontent among industry members. That legislation is
helpful in so far as it says that there is a mechanism to do this, but
it also suggests that saying once is enough may not be
appropriate.</div><a name="08101541000146"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101541000355"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> As I have said, I am happy to talk to officials
and to commit to introducing on Report an amendment that we will
conduct a review. We need to be clear about the scope of the review
that I am considering. As I said, I do not think that, when we have no
current plans, we should be committing to a review of other specific
assets at a particular time, but I agree that we should scan the
horizon. Nor do I think that we should commit in three years&#146;
time to review whether the scheme should be mandatory because, again,
we have no plans to do so and we have no reason to doubt that the
voluntary scheme will be successful. However, we will continue to
monitor policy developments.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101541000356"></a>Tom
Levitt:</b> I am grateful to my hon. Friend, who has made a
significant announcement. I hope that he will answer the other point
that I raised earlier: the review must be able to achieve something. If
it is dealing with a voluntary code established by a group of
volunteers who are running the scheme, it is difficult to see what
teeth the review might have to change the direction if necessary. I
would not exclude giving the review the power to recommend that the
scheme be made mandatory. I do, however, share his concern that we
would not want to go back to primary legislation to implement whatever
was recommended by the review. I welcome what he has said but it needs
to be a review that can make changes that are necessary. I accept that
a sledgehammer is not an appropriate tool to crack a nut; neither is a
feather.</div><a name="08101541000148"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101541000357"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I agree with my hon. Friend. We should not commit
to reviews and mention them in Bills, when they will be just exercises
that take up administrative time and do not produce anything positive.
I would expect the review to be a thoroughgoing analysis that would
lead to action that produced change, within the confines of the
legislative framework and the powers available to the Government

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101541000359"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> New clause 1 stands in my name. Having further
considered the new clause and the explanatory notes to the Bill, I feel
that the new clause is sadly redundant, although it was very well
drafted. What I do not understand&#151;the Minister may be able to
help me out&#151;is why the provisions referring to building

suggests. We believe that the new clause is unnecessary. The
explanatory note on clause 15 states that the Treasury intends to amend
the regulations&#151;made under the Building Societies Act
1986&#151;that deal with building society accounts and reports, so
that they include the same requirement to report on participation in
the smaller institution scheme. The answer to the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s question is that where a regulation-making power,
under which the relevant provisions can be made, already exists, it is
normal practice for that power to be used, rather than making a new
power with primary legislation. That is why we are explaining what we
are doing using that power, and that is why that detail is in the

amendment tries to establish, in a not very elegant fashion, the
principle that the money from the reclaim fund is in addition to
Government spending. That is important. People whose money will be
transferred from their dormant accounts to the reclaim fund and then to
the Big Lottery Fund will want to know that that is not a substitute
for Government expenditure, that it is increasing the resources
available for youth services or for financial inclusion. There is no
guarantee of that in the Bill. If the choice of the three causes in
England had been different, the concern might not be relevant. The
problem arises because there is Government expenditure on the provision
of youth services, and councils already spend money on it. Financial
inclusion is a significant priority not only for the Minister&#146;s
Department, but for the Department for Children, Schools and Families
and the Department for Work and Pensions. I have looked at Government
output and know that money is spent on this
area.</div><a name="08101541000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not believe that any Member of this House would want to see the
money that taxpayers contribute to financial inclusion drop from
&#163;12 million this year to &#163;10 million next year because
the Government know that &#163;2 million will come in from dormant
accounts. If an additional &#163;2 million comes in, we want to see
&#163;14 million spent on that cause so that there is a
boost in spending. I have not touched on the social investment fund in
the context of additionality because I do not believe that the
Government are currently providing that capital to a social investment
wholesaler.</div><a name="08101541000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that the Minister understands our concerns. Our argument is that,
if this funding comes on stream part way through a comprehensive
spending review period, it will be easier to check the additionality
because the spending plans will be set out in the CSR. Given that the
current CSR will expire at about the time this money comes on stream,
it would be very easy for the Government to set their spending
priorities taking into account the money that will flow from the
scheme. With the amendment, we are looking for confirmation from the
Government of the mechanism that they will use to ensure that the money
is genuinely
additional.</div><a name="08101541000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
problem relates to the Big Lottery Fund, which will be the distributor.
It does not give money only to voluntary organisations. That would be
one way of ensuring that there were additionality. Having said that,
there are even difficulties in that area because on the financial
inclusion front some Government money goes to Citizens Advice, which is
a voluntary
body.</div><a name="08101541000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">At
the start of the CSR period, the Government could decide to reduce the
amount of money that is spent in the affected areas in the knowledge
that the business plan of the reclaim fund suggests that
&#163;10 million or &#163;20 million a year may go to
the three causes, as stipulated in the Bill. There is a concern about
the additionality of this money and it was not satisfactorily addressed
in the other place. Lord Howard tabled an amendment to try to achieve
an end of this sort.</div>

McCarthy</b> (Bristol, East) (Lab): I entirely understand
where the hon. Gentleman is coming from and I appreciate the intention
behind the amendment. I am keen to ensure that there is no such element
of substitution. Local authorities rightly make decisions on whether to
fund new projects or carry on funding existing projects. It would be
difficult to implement the amendment without tying the hands of local
authorities and saying that they must continue to fund existing
projects. If they withdrew the funding for an existing project, they
would not be able to use the new money to replace it. I am concerned by
the
practicalities.</div><a name="08101541000168"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101541000363"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I do not dispute the challenges behind this
proposal. However, I do not want a situation in which a local authority
decides to withdraw funding because it knows that money will come. That
is why new subsection (4A)(c) in the amendment states that the money
must
not</div><a name="08101541000269"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;replace
statutory funding that has been withdrawn or is in danger of being
withdrawn&#148;.</div><a name="08101541000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
would be easy for a local authority to decide not to fund a youth club,
a youth group or a financial inclusion project in its area in the
knowledge that it will be bailed out by the Big Lottery Fund. That is a
challenge. The Big Lottery Fund currently gives money to local
authorities that might in a way be substituted by some of the money
that will come through the scheme. Additionality is critical to the
Bill because people want us to spend more money on these priorities,
not to substitute the money from dormant accounts for Government
money.</div><a name="08101541000286"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4
pm</div><a name="08101541000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
of the original objectives of the national lottery was to try to
increase the money available to community organisations and voluntary
groups. That purpose has been diminished somewhat because money from
the Big Lottery Fund goes to meet some Government priorities. There is
a sense that if this creeps into the allocation of money from the
reclaim fund, there will be no augmentation of the resources available:
the same money will be spent but will be funded from different sources.
We want some assurance from the Minister about how he believes the
scheme will work in practice to ensure that additional money is found
and this is not a
substitute.</div><a name="08101541000171"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101541000364"></a>Mr.
Field:</b> My hon. Friend has got is absolutely right but I
fear that the pass has already been well lost on this matter.
Immediately after my hon. Friend succeeded me as the shadow Financial
Secretary to the Treasury I had the joy of spending a year on the arts
and culture brief, one of the elements of which was the National
Lottery Act 2006. As my hon. Friend rightly points out, at the outset
the national lottery was designed with four heads in mind: arts,
charities, heritage and sports, as well as the millennium fund in the
run-up to and immediately after the turn of the century.</div>
<a name="08101541000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">The 2006 Act
set up the Big Lottery Fund. There are some very good people working
there. I cast no aspersions on their work, but there is little doubt
that the whole issue of additionality and substitution was cast to one
side by the Government at that time. Time and again we warned that
setting up the Big Lottery Fund would move away from the initial heads
for lottery funding. I fear that is precisely what will happen with the
Big Lottery Fund taking over the issue of dormant accounts. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column64" />Column number: 64</div>It will inevitably be assumed that a certain amount of money will come
from these dormant accounts each year and there is a worry that it will
not therefore be additional. There will be an element of substitution,
particularly when Government spending at local or national level is
likely to be tight in the years to
come.</div><a name="08101541000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Big Lottery Fund, which now spends over half of the lottery funds that
are distributed, does so according to one or two of the original
objectives when the lottery was set up nearly a decade and a half ago.
It also spends, as the Minister will be well aware, significant sums in
areas such as health, education and other promotional elements, which
would usually be expected to come from general Exchequer funding. The
worry here is that there will not be that sense of additionality in
some of the funding and some of the proposals that the Big Lottery Fund
will have in mind in its distribution policies. I fear that by passing
it on to the Big Lottery Fund, we will not be in any position to
monitor it
properly.</div><a name="08101541000174"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101541000365"></a>Tom
Levitt:</b> The hon. Gentleman will be aware that the Big
Lottery Fund has always denied the Conservative party&#146;s
allegations of breaches of the additionality rules. However, there is
an acceptance that a lot of Big Lottery Fund funding goes into
partnerships that may involve statutory bodies, but that does not mean
that the funding itself is not additional to that being provided
through statutory measures. I believe that Conservative party policy
would be to reduce that part of Big Lottery Fund funding which does not
go directly into the so-called good causes&#151;the charities. That
would reduce by about 16 per cent. the money that it puts out. It would
damage the partnership funding. I accept that on paper that may be a
grey area, but does the hon. Gentleman not accept the undertakings and
the assurances that the Big Lottery Fund has given that additionality
is maintained in its
actions?</div><a name="08101541000175"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101541000366"></a>Mr.
Field:</b> I do not entirely accept those undertakings. It is
extremely difficult. The hon. Gentleman used the phrase &#147;grey
area&#148;. I would use the phrase &#147;muddying the
waters&#148;. It comes to the same thing. Clearly there is a level of
uncertainty about whether funds will be additional. Given the
difficulties we will face in relation to public expenditure and the
difficulties at local government level with the various partnerships to
which the hon. Gentleman refers, there will clearly be confusion. It is
therefore important that we have this
debate.</div>
<a name="08101541000176"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101541000367"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I shall give my hon. Friend an example of that
confusion. The Big Lottery Fund recently took me on a tour of projects
in my constituency. One project was to provide funding to the borough
council for play opportunities, which is a good example of the
potential for problems. Would the borough council have spent money from
its own resources on play opportunities or was it additional? That is
where the problem comes from; once one starts to fund what could be
seen as a statutory or a Government priority, one starts to lose the
clarity about whether the funds are
additional.</div>
<a name="08101541000177"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101541000368"></a>Mr.
Field:</b> My hon. Friend gets it absolutely right. The
concern is simply that the local authority often has obligations, and
it may start a new programme, part of which supersedes an existing
programme, in partnership 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column65" />Column number: 65</div>with the Big Lottery Fund. For example, I was in my constituency
yesterday visiting a Home-Start UK programme&#151;a part voluntary
project with young mothers in the community. There is little doubt that
an equivalent programme had been in place in the past, but it had been
rebranded as Home-Start and had benefited from Big Lottery Fund
funding. Our concern is that there are grey areas, which is why this
debate is worthwhile.</div>
<a name="08101541000178"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101541000369"></a>Tom
Levitt:</b> I do not know of an equivalent body to Home-Start
UK. It is a magnificent organisation for the families that it helps. I
conceded that there was a grey area, but I think that it is a small one
and it is inevitable in partnerships with statutory funding and
non-statutory funding. Does the hon. Gentleman accept that those
partnerships and joined-up funding can be more effective in delivering
socially advantageous programmes than they could be if the two were
funded completely separately and never the twain should meet?
Conservative party policy, by not funding partnerships, would make the
Big Lottery Fund less effective in the way that it helps our
communities.</div>
<a name="08101541000179"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101541000370"></a>Mr.
Field:</b> I do not accept that, although I do accept what he
said before. Clearly, joint funding is often the most beneficial method
for our constituents. The question is where that public funding should
come from. The initial idea was that the national lottery would be a
ring-fenced fund. I trust that there is a hope that the dormant funds
will not simply be used to substitute funding from cash-strapped local
or national Government, but will provide additional funding in the way
envisaged in the clauses that we will come to shortly. I hope that the
Minister will give some credence to what my hon. Friend has said. It
has been worthwhile to put on the record that we have expressed some
very deep concerns, not least because there is likely to be some
confusion as the waters are a little
muddied.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101541000371"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> It is right and important that we have this
debate on additionality. I recognise the intention of the amendment,
but suggest to the hon. Member for Fareham that it is defective and
would be damaging. I want to be clear about the principles that
underlie the Bill. We are very clear that additionality is fundamental
to the distribution of dormant account assets. I do not take a
Manichean view of the world&#151;life is a lot more complicated. I
shall simply observe that hon. Members and noble Lords rehearsed
arguments about additionality for a great amount of time when debating
the national lottery legislation, and they had enormous technical
difficulties in trying to produce a workable legal definition for
primary legislation. Therefore, they came up with a different approach,
which is why the National Lottery Act now requires lottery distributors
to report annually on reporting practice with regard to additionality.
That reporting is informed by an understanding of additionality agreed
between the distributors and the Department for Culture, Media and
Sport in
that</div><a name="08101541000270"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Lottery
funding is distinct from Government funding and adds value. Although it
does not substitute for Exchequer expenditure, where appropriate it
complements Government and other programmes, policies and
funding.&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column66" />Column number: 66</div><a name="08101541000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">The point about
partnership funding was made by my hon. Friend the Member for High
Peak. The practice is now well established. We are committed to the
principle that lottery money will not be allowed to become a substitute
for funding that would usually fall to mainstream Government spending.
Distributors are well aware of that, and the Government expect them to
abide by that
principle.</div><a name="08101541000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
summary, I wish to restate that spending from dormant account money
must be additional to the Government&#146;s provision. We recognise
that unclaimed assets are, in effect, community resources and it is
right that they are spent for the benefit of communities. They are not,
and must not be, a substitute for Government funding, but they can
rightfully complement and add value to the Government&#146;s funding
streams and strategies, whether at central or local level. The hon.
Member for Fareham gave an example of when that might be the
case.</div><a name="08101541000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">Lottery
funding allows things to happen that would not take place if they
depended on Government funding alone. No one would argue that, just
because the Government already spend money on the arts, our cultural
heritage and sport, the lottery should not do so. The same is true of
health, education and environmental projects, which the hon. Member for
Cities of London and Westminster said were popular causes that were
added back in 1998. By and large, the current system works well. The
practice is pretty well established, and we intend to follow that model
in the
Bill.</div><a name="08101541000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">Prescribing
additionality is not only incredibly difficult to do&#151;I do not
think too much of the attempt made at that by the hon. Member for
Fareham&#151;but it could have the unintended consequence of
restricting the types of projects to which the Big Lottery Fund could
award funds. Organisations and innovative projects that would otherwise
meet the purposes for distribution could be hindered in their
application simply because they might not meet the strict
interpretation and legal definition of what is additional if it were
specified in the Bill. A definition of additionality could stymie the
Big Lottery Fund&#146;s ability to give dormant account money to
worthy causes. It could also significantly increase bureaucracy and it
would open distribution policy up to further legal challenge. For those
further reasons, a definition would be
undesirable.</div><a name="08101541000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have adopted the right approach. We should not have a definition of
additionality because we cannot find one that is agreeable. However, we
have agreed on an understanding of additionality through the National
Lottery Act between the distributors and the DCMS, which we shall
replicate through our approach. That is why paragraph 9(3) of schedule
3 requires the Big Lottery Fund to report annually on
its</div><a name="08101541000271"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;policy
and practice in relation to the principle that dormant account money
should be used to fund projects, or aspects of projects, for which
funds would be unlikely to be made available
by&#148;</div><a name="08101541000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">the
Government. That mirrors the provisions to which I referred earlier in
respect of the DCMS. It is the most appropriate way in which to ensure
that additionality is delivered in a clear and transparent manner, so
we invite members of the Committee to reject the
amendment.</div><a name="08101541000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
it is important to debate additionality because we appreciate the
concerns that have been expressed 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column67" />Column number: 67</div>about such matters. We want to stress the Government&#146;s commitment
to the fact that the money will be genuinely
additional.</div><a name="08101541000287"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.15

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101541000372"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I am grateful for the Minister&#146;s comments on
how he will seek through the Bill and schedule 3 to ensure transparency
in the way that the money is distributed by the Big Lottery Fund. As
the schedule makes it clear, there will be a separate set of accounts
for that. It is an important principle&#151;particularly as we are
talking about a voluntary scheme&#151;that people should know that
this is not a substitute for Government expenditure. If people thought
that it was, it would increase their cynicism. It would be seen as
another way of fleecing people and as a ruse to find a substitute for
tax revenues by raiding dormant accounts. It is important to have
transparency in the way that money is used, and as much effort as
possible must be made to ensure clear blue water between the
Government&#146;s own spending priorities and the uses to which the
money will be put. That would lend credibility to the assertion that
the funding is additional, and it would provide a helpful backdrop
against which we could debate the avenues to which other assets could
be directed. The scheme would be seen to be working for the benefit of
the wider community and not as a substitute.</div>
<a name="08101541000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are many reasons why additionality is an important feature of the
debate and of how the fund will operate in the future. I take on board
the comments that the wording may be defective, but parliamentary
draftsmen are available to the Government and if they were really keen,
I am sure that they could polish it up. It sounds as if the national
lottery debate and the National Lottery Act went through the same
process without much success, but perhaps Treasury draftsmen would be
more efficient and effective. In view of the Minister&#146;s
assurances, and my recognition that he takes the issue very seriously,
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div>

how the grants will be given&#151;and whether that will be entrenched
in the strategic plan. The reason for seeking such a reassurance is
because the experiences that I and my constituents have had on specific
projects funded by the Big Lottery Fund, have not been particularly
happy ones. It has been a bureaucratic and long-winded process. I
appreciate the need to be careful and to undertake the necessary
diligence where public money is involved, but on one occasion the
process got close to breaking the project on grounds that proved
unfounded in the end. The Big Lottery Fund has a reputation for a
bureaucratic approach, and I wonder whether, in the strategic plans for
the process, we can see some step change in the way that it deals with
the people to whom it gives money.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101541000375"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 31, in
clause 18, page 9, line 26, leave

am bemused about why the Bill states that the money will be allocated
between England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland in accordance
with prescribed percentages that must add up to 100 per cent. That
sounds fine, and it is good that the percentages will add up to 100 per
cent.&#151;I am not sure what we would say if they did not&#151;but
why does the Bill not state what the prescribed percentages will be or
how the money will be allocated to the four countries of the United
Kingdom? I do not understand why that is not made clear. The
explanatory notes refer to the Barnett formula, but that is the
Government&#146;s position today and they may change their mind. All
I am looking for is some certainty and
clarity.</div><a name="08101541000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister might argue that the amendment is not particularly well
drafted. I am sure that I could have probably added more bells and
whistles to it, but simply allocating money pro rata in accordance to
the populations of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland would
be the most obvious method. I do not understand why the Bill permits
some uncertainty about what the prescribed percentages might be.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101541000376"></a>The

<a name="08101541000202"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101541000377"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> I promise that it was not my phone&#151;it is
like being a teacher in a classroom. I rise briefly to share the
bewilderment expressed by the hon. Member for Fareham about the fact
that, although the Government have concluded that the total amount
allocated to the four constituent parts of the United Kingdom should
come to 100 per cent., which seems an entirely sensible percentage to
arrive at, no formula is indicated for how that should be divided
between the four component parts.</div>
<a name="08101541000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">One could
come up with many different formulae and make a case for them all. A
formula could be based on population, the number of bank accounts held
in each country or the dormant revenues within the bank accounts in
those countries. The latter would give Scotland 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column69" />Column number: 69</div>a higher proportion than if the allocation were made purely on the basis
of population. One could argue for each of those different formulae,
but it is strange that the Government appear not to specify any of
them.</div><a name="08101541000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have some reservations about the amendment. If I had to pick a formula,
it would be based not on the population of each country, but on the
formula used for the lottery funds, which attempts to make some
assessment of social need that goes beyond a straightforward head
count. I suspect that it would come quite close to being a per capita
formula, but it would perhaps be more satisfactory for assessing which
communities would most benefit from the allocation of funds.</div>
<a name="08101541000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although I
have reservations about the amendment and would not be inclined to
support it in a Division, the motivation behind it seems entirely
reasonable.</div>
<a name="08101541000206"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101541000378"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> This is not complicated, although it could be if
hon. Members want it to be. Any number of allocation formulae could be
used in these circumstances. I appreciate the concern to ensure that
the distribution of unclaimed assets is fair and transparent across the
United Kingdom, and that is the Government&#146;s intention and the
basis on which we consulted. Having designed the scheme in such a way
as to enable spending decisions to be devolved, it follows that we
should use Barnett principles for dividing the available money, as that
is the normal way of proportioning spending between UK Administrations.
It simply is not established practice or policy to put the Barnett
formula into legislation, and I am aware of no other circumstances in
which we have done so.</div>
<a name="08101541000207"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101541000379"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> The Treasury commissioned a factual review of the
Barnett formula that was due to be published in the summer, but the
summer has been and gone and we are still waiting for its publication.
What would happen if the Government changed the Barnett formula, as
that might end up creating a distribution that was different to the
straightforward per capita
basis?</div><a name="08101541000208"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101541000380"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I will not indulge in speculation, but we have
had a consultation exercise on that and are devolving expenditure. It
is right to use the Barnett principles, and it is a convention that we
do not put them into Bills. That is the basis on which we will operate
in the
future.</div><a name="08101541000209"></a>

has been a feature of our consideration of the Bill, we want as much
money as possible to be used in pursuit of the three quarters
identified in the Bill for England and the approaches that will be
taken in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. We want to spend as
little as possible on administration, so that we can maximise the
amount of money spent on good causes, particularly after the year 1
bulge of money from dormant accounts comes through, as that will give a
big amount to be spent. When we reach more normal circumstances, the
amounts being spent on an annual basis through the BLF will be
relatively small by comparison, so we want to ensure that as little as
possible is spent on administrative
costs.</div><a name="08101541000288"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.30
pm</div>
<a name="08101541000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is a
probing amendment, and we will not push it to a vote, as I am trying to
encourage the BLF to minimise its costs with regard to the distribution
of the money. It is worth pointing out that the BLF has had significant
operating expenses in the past. Its expenses rose from &#163;72
million in 2005-06 to &#163;77 million in 2006-07. Historically, its
operating costs seem to be about 10 per cent. of the amount it
distributes by way of funds and grants. We want some reassurance that
the BLF will spend as little as possible on operating costs. The
amendment is also an incentive to the Government.</div>
<a name="08101541000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">One issue
that I have been made aware of when talking about the cost of
distribution is that the more specific the Secretary of State&#146;s
directions to the BLF are, the more expensive the fund will be to
administer. Indeed, the Minister alluded to that in response to my
earlier amendment on additionality. The more detailed the restrictions
and the more cumbersome the conditions to be satisfied, the more
expensive it will be to allocate that money. There is a pressure on the
Government to keep administrative costs down by giving the BLF more
freedom in how it uses the money. Given the priorities that have been
set, that is a good way of keeping the cost of lottery distribution
down. The message from this debate is that it is important to keep
those costs down to a minimum, so that we can maximise the amount of
money that goes to good
causes.</div><a name="08101541000217"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101541000383"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I appreciate the probing nature of the amendment,
which would impose a cap on the costs that the BLF can defray to limit
its administration charges to 5 per cent. of the dormant account
funding transferred to it. Although I appreciate and share the concern
about the effective use of public funds that no doubt motivated the
amendment, I hope that hon. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column71" />Column number: 71</div>Members will recognise why it is important that the scheme&#146;s
ability to operate is not constrained by a rigid and arbitrary
cap.</div>
<a name="08101541000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not
think that the issue is as straightforward as the hon. Member for
Fareham suggests. I want the BLF to be as effective and efficient as
possible at delivering money to the good causes to which it has been
allocated through the dormant account funding mechanism. I do not want
money to be delivered at the lowest possible cost, because in areas
such as working with young people, I want the BLF to talk to young
people and discuss their needs, rather than simply concentrate on
throwing money out the door in as simple a process as possible, with
limited checks. I do not think that anyone really wants that.</div>
<a name="08101541000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">We want to
ensure that the BLF&#146;s costs are properly controlled and that it
is held accountable for them. Its costs have come down across its
activities. As set out in its 2007-08 annual report, it currently
spends about 9.1 per cent. of its income on operating costs.
It operates a portfolio approach to funding, with commitments being
made over three years and payments being made over five years or more.
As a consequence, it requires some flexibility to administer its budget
over a longer-term cycle. That is a practical reason why an annual cap
on its costs would inhibit that activity. I reiterate that I appreciate
the probing nature of the amendment.</div>
<a name="08101541000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">We want the
BLF to approach its distribution of dormant account funds with a
similar thoroughness to the way in which it assesses individual grant
applications and to its work in developing partner relationships with
the projects that it funds and supports. That applies to small-scale
projects as much as to larger ones, which often involve more
administration costs to support them in getting up and running. We
expect the BLF to consult young people, so that they are actively
engaged in shaping bids for community resources. That is a worthwhile
activity, but intensive effort and sensitive handling are required to
manage it appropriately.</div>
<a name="08101541000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">I agree that
it is important that the BLF is able to operate with effective scrutiny
and that its ability to assess and support bids is not constrained. I
am aware that, in the other place, the lords drew comparisons between
the BLF and other organisations. I am sure that the Committee would be
interested in this year&#146;s National Audit Office report,
&#147;Making grants efficiently in the culture, media and sport
sector&#148;, which shows that the BLF&#146;s costs compared
favourably with public sector funders and other funders in the
voluntary sector. Nevertheless, there is no room for complacency, and
we expect it to work effectively and efficiently and to ensure that as
much of its available resources as possible are distributed to
front-line organisations. The hon. Gentleman and I share that
commitment.</div><a name="08101541000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under
the National Lottery etc. Act 1993, the BLF is legally required to
comply with provisions for a statement of financial requirements issued
by the Government. That makes clear its responsibility to ensure its
finances are managed appropriately. However, it is properly the
responsibility of the accounting officer for the relevant
Department&#151;in this case the Department for Children, Schools and
Families&#151;to be sure that the administrative costs incurred were
appropriate, as part of the overall duty to make effective use of
public funds. It is also the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column72" />Column number: 72</div>responsibility of the accounting officers of the devolved
Administrations to do the same in respect of their relevant
functions.</div><a name="08101541000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
assure hon. Members that an accountability framework is in place and
that we are satisfied that the requirements and responsibilities under
that framework will be sufficient to ensure efficient and effective
allocation of resources. If there is any doubt about the BLF&#146;s
future efficiency and effectiveness, I would draw hon. Members
attention to the power in clause 25 that will enable the Government to
add or remove distributors of dormant assets. On that basis, we think
that the Bill already allows for sufficient checks to ensure the
efficiency and effectiveness of distribution. I hope that the hon.
Gentleman agrees and will withdraw his
amendment.</div><a name="08101541000224"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101541000384"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I am grateful for the Minister&#146;s thoughts on
the matter. I suspect that the Secretary of State&#146;s powers under
clause 23(5) to give directions
on</div><a name="08101541000225"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
management and control of money received by the
Fund&#148;</div><a name="08101541000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">might
also be used where the Government do not want to take the nuclear
option of changing the distributor and to give some guidance to the BLF
on how it spends the money allocated to it and how it uses it to pay
its administrative costs.</div>
<a name="08101541000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">The BLF has
always indicated to me that it came out very favourably from the NAO
report on the efficient use of money and that it compares well with
other grant-making bodies. It is important to ensure that the BLF and
the Government recognise the importance of keeping costs to a minimum
to ensure that as much money as possible gets through to the causes;
otherwise we might not see quite as much money as expected coming
through. However, on the basis of the Minister&#146;s comments, I beg

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101541000387"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> This is a sad moment for me, because this is the
last amendment that I have tabled to the Bill, although I shall no
doubt find some remarks to make on other items before business is
concluded. Amendment No. 5 is untypical of my other amendments, because
in an amazing spirit of charity, I am seeking to give the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column73" />Column number: 73</div>Government a little more flexibility by allowing the Secretary of
State&#151;the Government have appointed the Secretary of State for
Children, Schools and Families as the responsible Minister, rather than
a Treasury Minister, which some members of the Committee might find
curious&#151;to amend the three areas in which the dormant accounts
money can be distributed by the BLF. Those three areas relate to young
people, financial management and financial inclusion. I see merit in
having the scope to modify the largesse, if public demand so warrants
and Ministers feel that it is appropriate. That is the purpose of
amendment No. 5, but the Minister might feel that I am being unduly
generous.</div><a name="08101541000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 32, which was tabled by the hon. Member for Fareham, makes a
reasonable point. Unless I have missed something, throughout the
debates on the Bill, the Government have been rather vague about the
amount of money to be allocated to each of the three areas identified
as priorities. We have been led to believe, not only because the lead
Government Minister is the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and
Families but because of the emphasis in the comments made by Treasury
Ministers, that the primary area that will benefit relates to young
people.</div>
<a name="08101541000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of course,
young people may benefit under financial management and financial
inclusion provisions too, but projects specifically aimed at young
people appear to be the main thrust of what is being proposed by
Ministers. However, I understand that nothing in the legislation
specifies that. Of course, that makes quite a big difference; people
who are involved in an organisation that is solely concerned with
advancing the interests of young people might be enthusiastic about the
Bill because they think that 90 per cent. of the money will go to young
people and only 5 per cent. to financial management and 5 per cent. to
financial inclusion. They will celebrate if the Bill is passed. If the
Government then turn round and say, &#147;Actually, we are only
envisaging 1 per cent. going to young people, 1 per cent. to financial
management and 98 per cent. to financial inclusion,&#148; those
people may feel that they were sold something slightly
different to what they thought was the case when
the legislation went through all its stages in both Houses of
Parliament.</div>
<a name="08101541000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore,
although I think that my amendment is a charitable one, I am big enough
to say that the more important and interesting amendment of the two is
amendment No. 32. I do not necessarily follow the argument that the two
amendments should be equally weighted, so I would not necessarily
support amendment No. 32. Nevertheless, I think that the issues that it
raises
are&#151;</div><a name="08101541000236"></a>

<a name="08101541000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would not
necessarily support an equal distribution&#151;one third, one third,
one third&#151;but the onus is on the Minister to try to indicate,
preferably in legislation but at least orally to the Committee, what he
sees the division
being.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column74" />Column number: 74</div><a name="08101541000239"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101541000390"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> May I first address my remarks to amendment No. 5?
There is a very clear logic to that amendment, which was tabled by the
hon. Member for Taunton. Clause 12 was removed from the Bill because
the Government did not want a triennial review in perpetuity, yet we
are casting in stone for perpetuity&#151;until time ends&#151;that
these are the three priorities for that money. A point may arise at
some time in the future when the Government wish to change those three
priorities, but they would then have to introduce primary legislation
to change them, so the hon. Member for Taunton may have done the
Government a service by pointing out this gap in the Bill.</div>
<a name="08101541000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">Regarding
amendment No. 32, I am not sure that I would support it either, if it
went to a vote. I tabled it for the very reason that the hon. Member
for Taunton gave; there is nothing in the Bill that tells us how the
money will be spent, or what priorities will be given to the various
projects. I assume that the order in the Bill reflects the order of
spending and that more will be spent on A than on C. However, what I do
not know is how much more? Is it just a fraction more? I also do not
know how the Government will determine the priorities.</div>
<a name="08101541000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">A very clear
signal has been given by the fact that, in our debates, the lead
Secretary of State has been referred to as the Secretary of State for
Children, Schools and Families, who, in an earlier incarnation, gave
evidence to the Treasury Committee&#146;s inquiry into unclaimed
assets&#151;I will come back to that inquiry in a minute, because I
think that we can see where the order of priorities comes from, judging
by the Secretary of State&#146;s evidence to the Committee. That
suggests that the main area of expenditure will be, as the clause puts
it, on</div>
<a name="08101541000276"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the provision
of services, facilities or opportunities to meet the needs of young
people&#148;.</div><a name="08101541000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
it would be helpful for the Committee and outside bodies to understand
just what weighting will be given to that priority in comparison to the
other two. Some people out there will be interested in knowing that.
They may wonder if they can apply for funding under those streams. The
Minister may reply that we will have to await the strategy produced by
the Big Lottery Fund for England to know what the priorities are, but
it would be helpful to signal the order at an earlier
stage.</div><a name="08101541000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
third priority will be left in quite a difficult position. The Treasury
Committee&#146;s report on unclaimed assets gives a very clear steer
that the social investment wholesaler will need a significant endowment
to function properly. The conclusion to the report
states:</div><a name="08101541000277"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
find the concept of using gearing to multiply the potential impact of
unclaimed assets attractive when compared to more traditional
grant-giving distribution methods. We have been told that the Social
Investment Bank needs minimum funding of &#163;330 million over five
years for it to be viable, but we do not, at present, see any sign of
the Government committing resources to social investment of this scale.
We believe that the Government cannot will the ends if it does not will
the means. We want the Government to allocate sufficient resources to a
Social Investment Bank funded in part through unclaimed

Treasury Committee gave a clear signal. The then Economic Secretary,

touched upon the issue in the debate.</div>

Ronald Cohen, the chairman of the Commission on Unclaimed Assets, said
that it would
be</div><a name="08101541000278"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;very
difficult to get an allocation from Government for a purpose such as
this if the unclaimed assets were not
available&#148;.</div><a name="08101541000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
sense was given that unclaimed assets would be the source of funding
for the establishment of a social investment bank. The suggestion is
that if the priorities are as set out in the Bill, there will not be
enough money available from unclaimed assets to provide a sufficient
endowment.</div><a name="08101541000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am not arguing for the benefits of one cause against those of another.
If we had the time or inclination to do so, we could make cogent
arguments for the proportion being divided in particular ways. We might
be able to put percentages on youth services, financial inclusion and
the social investment
wholesaler.</div><a name="08101541000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">From
the way that the Bill has been drafted and the mood music around it, I
think the problem is that most of the money will go to facilities for
young people and the third priority will get the small change. That may
not be sufficient to produce the benefit that people who support a
social investment bank believe it should have. Lord Davies of Oldham
said of this issue in another
place:</div><a name="08101541000279"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
want to go ahead with the top two priorities but the third concept in
the clause is dependent on resources being
available.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 15
January 2008; Vol. 697, c.
GC493-494.]</div><a name="08101541000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
sends a clear signal about the
priorities.</div><a name="08101541000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is a lot of interest from the third sector not just in the first two
priorities, but also in the third. This debate is an opportunity to air
those issues and for the Minister to give more clarity on what he
believes might be the distribution between the three
causes.</div><a name="08101541000251"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101541000391"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I will be delighted to bring as much clarity as I
can to this issue. There are two very different amendments. Amendment
No. 5 would insert an order-making power to amend English spending
areas by affirmative resolution. In reply to the hon. Member for
Taunton, we believe that the areas we have identified are important and
enduring. We have consulted on the areas and do not feel that there is
a need to change them, even in the long term. One of the reasons why
there is no need to change them is that youth services are an important
area now and for the future. I confirm that we regard youth provision
as a priority. Financial inclusion and financial capability are
rightfully areas in which the Big Lottery Fund could make a significant
difference. We clearly put it on the record in the other place and on
Second Reading that, if resources permit, we would consider funding for
a social investment wholesaler. That remains our
position.</div><a name="08101541000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is still great uncertainty about the quantum of resources available to
the Big Lottery Fund in the first instance and on an ongoing basis. We
have yet to see how it will work out. We have discussed estimates of
the amount of genuine dormant assets, and it will be up to the reclaim
fund through its business plans to decide how much of those assets are
to be transferred to the Big Lottery Fund for distribution. At the
moment, there is a lot of uncertainty about the areas, and putting
rigid percentages in place would not make sense. It is right, too, that
the balance of priorities within the three 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column76" />Column number: 76</div>areas might need to be changed over time. I explained that the process
of making directions on spending decisions will involve a range of
Departments, with overall direction coming from the Department for
Children, Schools and Families, which reflects the priority that we
give to youth service provision. It seems a sensible way in which to
give direction and guidance to enable the Big Lottery Fund to do its
work, yet still retaining some flexibility as circumstances
change.</div><a name="08101541000253"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101541000392"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> I can understand the Minister&#146;s reluctance
to commit himself to rigid percentages and in fact, despite wanting the
amendment to achieve that, both the hon. Member for Fareham and I have
conceded the point. However, by not committing himself to any
percentages or even any indication, the Minister seems to be going
right to the other end of the scale. Were I a representative of a youth
services organisation, my attitude towards the Bill would be different
if I thought that my organisation would be the beneficiary of 10 per
cent. of the funds rather than 90 per cent. of the funds. That makes a
substantial difference to what we want to achieve by the Bill. I accept
that the hon. Gentleman will not say 47 per cent., 33 per cent. and 20
per cent., but he could say that he envisages that youth services would
receive more than half the total money. People would then know roughly
where they stand in relation to the Government&#146;s
ambitions.</div><a name="08101541000254"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101541000393"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> It is premature to specify percentages to
individual areas but, when it comes to spending directions, we will
give guidance to the Big Lottery Fund on such matters. I appreciate
that organisations out there see what we are proposing to do and are
already anxious to bid into the Big Lottery Fund for exciting new
projects, but throughout the Government we must have a detailed look at
our overall priorities within such areas so that we can make sufficient
funds available that will be complementary to the Government&#146;s
current activities and genuinely additional. Discussions have taken
place with a range of organisations on how potential sums might be put
together most effectively, and it is right that those discussions have
been held.</div>
<a name="08101541000255"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101541000394"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Is there in the Minister&#146;s mind a case for
looking at the money that comes through in two different ways? There
will be a big lump at the start, after which amounts will drip through
annually. Clearly, to go back to the social investment wholesaler
argument, it would be easier to meet its needs from the big lump at the
beginning, rather than that coming through on an annual basis, given
its estimate of how much it needs. For youth services it may be easier
to fund a building project from that big lump at the start, rather than
from the annual amounts coming through. If the money is to be used to
help capitalise credit unions, for example, that initial release of
money from dormant accounts might be the best way to do it. Will the
money that is available at the start be looked at strategically and
will it be looked at differently from the money that comes through on
an annual
basis?</div><a name="08101541000256"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101541000395"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> We certainly want to take a properly strategic
approach to decisions on spending directions to the Big Lottery Fund. I
explained earlier that one of the reasons why we wanted some of the
larger building 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column77" />Column number: 77</div>societies to be in the fund was that we wanted it to have sufficient
critical mass so that a genuinely strategic approach could be taken.
The sorts of consideration to which the hon. Gentleman refers are
things that we are thinking about as a Government at the moment.
Clearly, he is right to probe on those matters, but they are not part
of the
Bill.</div><a name="08101541000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
still do not believe that there needs to be the order-making power that
amendment No. 5 would give us because we think that these priorities
will be enduring. We still do not think that amendment No. 32, which
rigidly specifies equal amounts for the three areas, makes sense,
although I appreciate its probing nature. Finally, stocks and flows are
still unknown. An interdepartmental working group is looking at the
issues 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column78" />Column number: 78</div>and trying to work out what a sensible strategic programme would look
like over a period of time. We will obviously want to consult outside
Government too, not necessarily on a formal basis to delay things, but
to ensure that we work closely with the Big Lottery Fund, which already
does lots of work in these
areas.</div><a name="08101541000258"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101541000396"></a>Mr.
Browne:</b> That was a useful conversation. It would have been
nice if it had gone further. We await developments with interest. I beg
