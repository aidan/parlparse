Alexander</b> (Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey)
(LD): I beg to move amendment No. 68, in
clause 6, page 2, line 27, after
&#145;fees&#146;, insert</div>
					<a name="07072484000469"></a><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;to a person who has
failed to pay an amount of child support
maintenance&#146;.</div>
					<a name="07072484000015"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is a pleasure, Mr. Chope, to serve under your chairmanship
for the first time. This is my first contribution to these debates, but
I promise it will not be my last. Having spent the last couple of weeks
learning for myself the obligations of parenthood, I have been afforded
a degree of time to study the evidence given to the Committee and the
debates that have taken place so
far.</div>
					<a name="07072484000016"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 68
and subsequent amendments relate to the subject of fees and the
potential of the new Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission to
charge for its services. They are matters about which there is the
potential for some controversy.</div>
					<a name="07072484000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">I note that at point No. 10 in
his written submission, Professor Nick Wikeley
said:</div>
					<a name="07072484000297"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
question of charging fees will doubtless be
controversial&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07072484000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">He went
on to say:</div>
					<a name="07072484000298"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
obvious point is that charging fees is unlikely to be effective if
customer service remains at current levels.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07072484000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">We will come to that when we discuss a
subsequent amendment.</div>
					<a name="07072484000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">With amendment No. 68, I wish
to probe the Government&#146;s intentions about the circumstances in
which they intend to charge fees. The note in the evidence that was
kindly given to Members in a folder in advance of our deliberations is
pretty opaque on the matter. Things were not made a great deal clearer
when I read the oral evidence taken during the Committee&#146;s first
two sittings.</div>
					<a name="07072484000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
evidence, Lord McKenzie said:</div>
					<a name="07072484000299"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;No decision has been
made on charging
yet.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07072484000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, even from
the evidence, the nature and purpose of the charging regime that the
Government seek to introduce was fairly fuzzy and opaque. On the one
hand, Lord McKenzie said that he did not wish to
</div>
					<a name="07072484000300"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;force
people&#151;particularly low-income families&#151;out of the system
and prevent them from entering into proper and effective maintenance
agreements.&#148;</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column158" />Column number: 158</div>
					<a name="07072484000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">Hilary Reynolds thought that it
was</div>
					<a name="07072484000301"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;highly
unlikely that charging would start before
2010&#148;.&#151;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, Child Maintenance and
Other Payments Public Bill Committee,</i> 17 July 2007; c.
12.]</div>
					<a name="07072484000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, that does not
preclude it starting before that date, although the Government&#146;s
note on the matter is slightly clearer. Will the Minister clarify the
timing on
charging?</div>
					<a name="07072484000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
Lord McKenzie said that he did not wish low-income families to be
penalised by charging, he also said:</div>
					<a name="07072484000302"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Clearly we would wish
people to be incentivised to use private agreements...and
therefore, I suppose, not to use the system unnecessarily if it can be
avoided and if it is not
appropriate.&#148;&#151;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, Child
Maintenance and Other Payments Public Bill Committee,</i> 17 July 2007;
c. 13.]</div>
					<a name="07072484000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the purpose of
charging is at least in part to incentivise people to make private
agreements, the flip-side is that if the charging regime is pervasive
it will serve to disincentivise people from making an application to
CMEC.</div>
					<a name="07072484000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purpose of
the amendment is to try to narrow the range of people to whom fees may
be charged. Specifically&#151;the Minister made this point in oral
evidence&#151;fees may be useful in cases when people such as
non-resident parents fail to discharge their obligations, as the fee
would be more like a penalty. The amendment suggests that fees should
be payable by those who fail to comply with their obligations&#151;in
this case, by failing to pay child support maintenance.</div>
					<a name="07072484000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would help
if the Minister made clear his intentions about the range of people to
whom charges might be applied. Clause 6 leaves it wide open. Fees could
be charged to any and all people who interact with CMEC in any way,
whether parents with care or non-resident parents. They could be
charged in a range of circumstances. It has been explained that the
issue is not principally about cost recovery. None the less, a charging
regime that leaves open the possibility that a level of charges might
be introduced for all applicants, including parents with care, that is
sufficient to incentivise private agreements&#151;in other words, add
a sufficient amount to disincentivise people from choosing CMEC as
their first option&#151;could be a boon to that type of
charging.</div>
					<a name="07072484000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07072484000352"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Tim Boswell</b> (Daventry) (Con): As ever, the hon. Gentleman
is making a measured case. However, does he agree that, even if we do
not want to tie down explicitly to the text of the Bill any
instructions to CMEC, it would be unfortunate if the charging regime
were to be operated penally in any way? It is one thing to give a
measure of incentive, but it would be another to depart from cost
structure or seek to punish individuals who chose to use the
service.</div>
					<a name="07072484000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07072484000353"></a>Danny
Alexander:
						</b> I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
intervention. I agree with it in the sense that a charging regime must
not punish people simply for their choice of interacting with CMEC. The
existence of a child maintenance support system is a public good, so to
charge people willy-nilly to interact with the service seems wrong. The
amendment would make it clear that, in a certain category of cases of
those who fail to pay an amount of child support
maintenance&#151;those who have gone through the CMEC system and have
not complied with their obligations&#151;a charge might be a useful
additional incentive to encourage them to meet their
obligations.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column159" />Column number: 159</div>
					<a name="07072484000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister has rightly made it
clear that the importance of the Bill is that it encourages those who
interact with the child support system to fulfil their
responsibilities. He has said continually that one of the major reasons
for the failure of the current child support system is that many
non-resident parents&#151;mainly men&#151;are not meeting their
financial obligations in quite disgraceful ways. The amendment would
allow fees to be charged in such cases, but it would exclude charging
to be allowed in the generality of cases for all parents with care or
non-resident
parents.</div>
					<a name="07072484000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07072484000354"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Mike Weir</b> (Angus) (SNP): I am following the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s argument with interest. I am mostly in agreement
with him, but I am concerned that the amendment might put pressure on
people to enter a voluntary agreement that may not necessarily be in
their interests if fee charging is allowed and they fail to enter a
voluntary arrangement. I accept his argument when people reach the
stage at which they fail to honour their obligations, but I am worried
that such a proposal might become a problem at an earlier stage by
forcing them into voluntary agreements that are not necessarily in the
interests of one
party.</div>
					<a name="07072484000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07072484000355"></a>Danny
Alexander:
						</b> Perhaps I have not explained myself clearly
enough. In a sense, the hon. Gentleman supports my argument. A charging
regime, as the Bill allows, under which charges can be levied on all
classes of people who interact with CMEC, could serve such a purpose.
It could put pressure on people to enter into voluntary agreements. I
do not know what level of charges the Minister has in mind. If it is to
be set at &#163;100 and there is a &#163;10 disregard, it could
effectively be 10 weeks&#146; maintenance for a benefit case and a
significant
disincentive.</div>
					<a name="07072484000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
purpose of the amendment is to say that charges should not apply
automatically just because a person has applied to CMEC if the
voluntary agreement had fallen through, for example. Charges should
apply only when a person has been through the CMEC system and the
non-resident parent has been asked to pay money. If, in such cases, the
non-resident parent has failed to pay the child support maintenance to
which he is obligated, charges could then apply. In other cases, they
would
not.</div>
					<a name="07072484000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07072484000356"></a>Mr.
Weir:
						</b> I am not necessarily opposed to the amendment, but
is there not a danger that the fees will become an add-on to the
existing arrears? Does it necessarily help the parent with care to get
the money? Will the hon. Gentleman make it clear that the situation in
which the maintenance is paid first and the fees separately
would only come into play after the parent with care has received any
maintenance that is
due?</div>
					<a name="07072484000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07072484000357"></a>Danny
Alexander:
						</b> I am grateful for that
intervention. I intend to go on in the subsequent amendment, which I
know that the hon. Gentleman supports, to make the wider case against
the fees. I cannot imagine that any Committee member would disagree
with the argument that the payment of maintenance should take
precedence over the payment of fees. Will the Minister say whether that
is the Government&#146;s position as
well?</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column160" />Column number: 160</div>
					<a name="07072484000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07072484000358"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Mark Harper</b> (Forest of Dean) (Con): I
want to pick up on one area that the hon. Gentleman referred to. In our
evidence-taking sessions, we asked the Minister, Lord McKenzie of
Luton, what split of cases the Government wanted to see going to the
Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission versus going to private
arrangements. In that discussion, he confirmed that the Government had
no intention of using the fee-charging structure to reach a particular
target or split of cases between CMEC and the voluntary arrangements.
He said:</div>
					<a name="07072484000303"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
want to use
them&#148;&#151;</div>
					<a name="07072484000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">presumably
the fees&#151;</div>
					<a name="07072484000304"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to
encourage people to make choices that leave them in a position that we
and they believe is right.&#148;&#151;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report,
Child Maintenance and Other Payments Public Bill
Committee,</i> 17 July 2007; c.
20.]</div>
					<a name="07072484000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">That indicates that CMEC
has no guide to the purpose of the fees. They are clearly not about
cost recovery. That was ruled out in the evidence given by Hilary
Reynolds. The Government do not appear to have a view about the number
of cases that use CMEC versus a private arrangement. CMEC is not being
given a steer about how to set fees or what the purpose of the fees
is&#151;in fact, it is getting no guidance at all.</div>
					<a name="07072484000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister needs to be clear
about the purpose of the fees. If the purpose is not cost recovery,
there must be some other point. One cannot separate setting the fees
against the incentive or disincentive effect that they are going to
have. By setting the fee, we are implicitly making a judgment about the
extent to which we wish people to use CMEC. I do not think that we can
separate those two issues. There is a fundamental confusion, which the
Minister needs to
address.</div>
					<a name="07072484000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">

							<a name="07072484000359"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions
(Mr. James Plaskitt):
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>Once again, it is
a pleasure to have you chairing our proceedings, Mr. Chope.
I am grateful to those hon. Members who have spoken in the debate and
for the points raised by the hon. Members for Inverness, Nairn,
Badenoch and Strathspey and for Forest of Dean, which I will try to
cover in my response.</div>
					<a name="07072484000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me begin by pointing out
the importance of clause 2(1), which we discussed before. Any decision
about fees that CMEC might make in the future has to be made in the
context of the overall objective, which is clearly set out in clause
2(1). Any test that might be applied to a proposal to have fees will
have to be run against that objective.</div>
					<a name="07072484000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Inverness,
Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey raised the concern that the charges
might become penal or that they might disincentivise people or produce
undesirable outcomes. In that case, the commission will not be meeting
its obligation under clause 2(1). Therefore, it is an important part of
the
test.</div>
					<a name="07072484000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07072484000360"></a>Mr.
Boswell:
						</b> I do not wish to disagree with
the Minister about that because I think that it is clearly what we all
wish. Does he not agree that as a matter of administrative law, the
commission as a public body will always and at all times have to act
reasonably&#151;it will not want to attract attention from judicial
review&#151;if 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column161" />Column number: 161</div>it sets the level of fees at any level which could at least arguably be
seen to be unreasonable as far as the individual is
concerned?</div>

						<b class="B">

					<a name="07072484000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
was clear from the evidence of the Minister&#146;s colleague, Lord
McKenzie, that one of the motivations behind the power to charge is in
relation to incentivising private agreements. However, for every
incentive there is an equal and opposite disincentive. How does the
Minister intend to get the balance right? If private agreements are
genuinely incentivised, how will he prevent the charges
disincentivising people from going to CMEC when they need
to?</div>

Plaskitt:
						</b> I shall come to that after I have dealt with
some of the other
interventions.</div>
					<a name="07072484000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government recognise the importance of ensuring that a charging regime
does not dissuade vulnerable or low-income parents from applying to the
commission in the first place. Indeed, I remind Committee members that
the White Paper said
that</div>
					<a name="07072484000052"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the clear burden of
charging should fall on the non-resident parent and not the parent with
care.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07072484000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">We would expect
any charging regime put forward by the commission to reflect precisely
that. I remind the hon. Gentleman that any charging regime must first
secure the approval of the Secretary of State. That will be followed by
a further check on any proposal, which I shall come to in a
moment.</div>
					<a name="07072484000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">Charges
may be incurred for a variety of reasons. The intention is that the
majority of them, such as penalties for late payment and enforcement
measures, will fall only on non-resident and non-compliant parents.
However, in a few situations, allowing the commission to charge a fee
at an early stage of the process&#151;possibly to both
parents&#151;might provide it with a tool to help it achieve its
objectives, of which I reminded the Committee at the
outset.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07072484000366"></a>Mr.
Boswell:
						</b> I thank the Minister for giving
way again, but members of the Committee must be clear on this matter.
He mentioned charges for late payment. We know from our constituency
casework that one of the defects of the current arrangements is that
money has been collected from the non-resident parent but for some
reason has not found its way through the agency to the parent with
care&#151;for example, either an employer is delinquent or there has
been an administrative glitch. Will the Minister assure us that CMEC
will do its level best to ensure that no arbitrary charge is levied on
those who are not being delinquent but who have merely been caught up
in an administrative problem?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07072484000367"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:
						</b> I am happy to give that reassurance. We are
making the changes precisely to achieve that degree of improvement in
performance and we have been making that stipulation for such
circumstances.</div>
					<a name="07072484000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
referred to circumstances in which fees might be applicable, and it
might be possible to envisage a small application fee coming into the
process, as is the case in a number of other child maintenance systems
in other parts of the world. That might encourage both parents to
consider whether a voluntary arrangement might be more effective for
them.</div>
					<a name="07072484000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">Above
all, we consider it too early to put a restriction in the Bill, as the
amendment would do. I would not want to fetter the commission in any
way at this stage, in terms of proposals that it might make in respect
of charges. It is important to give the commission the option of
putting forward proposals on charges and not to say that charges in
respect of certain things cannot be considered. The details of any
charging proposals that might come forward would be more appropriately
laid out in regulations. That is because the commission should play a
key role in finalising the detail, and also&#151;the hon. Member for
Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey sought reassurance on
this&#151;because fees will not be introduced until 2010 at the
earliest, and then only as clients move into the new
system.</div>
					<a name="07072484000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that I have reassured the Committee that all regulations made
under the clause in respect of fees will be subject to affirmative
resolution; that is the second lock on the process. First, any
proposals must secure the Secretary of State&#146;s approval, then
they must go through the affirmative resolution process, under which
they would be subject to additional parliamentary scrutiny.</div>
					<a name="07072484000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that I
have given hon. Members the reassurance that they sought on fees and
that it is sufficient to encourage the hon. Gentleman&#151;whom,
incidentally, I must congratulate on becoming a parent&#151;to
withdraw the amendment.</div>

					<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(1A) The
Secretary of State may only make regulations under subsection (1) when
he is satisfied that the Commission is capable of providing a
satisfactory service to parents and children in terms of its duties
under this
Act.&#146;.</div>
					<a name="07072484000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
the Minister offered reassurances on the way in which the Government
intend to decide how charges could be applied, a much broader issue
needs to be raised in relation to the charging regime, and the
amendment seeks to do that. It relates to the evidence that the
Committee heard from Professor Wikeley, who said that the obvious point
is that charging fees is unlikely to be effective if customer service
remains at current levels.</div>
					<a name="07072484000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
seeks to establish on the face of the Bill an equation between the
ability to introduce charges and the ability of the new organisation to
deliver its services competently, something that has been sadly 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column163" />Column number: 163</div>lacking from the current Child Support Agency regime. That was debated
in earlier sittings, but I make no apology for returning to
it.</div>
					<a name="07072484000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">I noted the
Minister&#146;s comments about morale among CSA staff in an earlier
debate about improvements under the operational improvement plan. That
is obviously important, and I would be interested if he were willing to
lay before the House&#151;perhaps in the Library&#151;a copy of the
recent staff survey that Lord McKenzie referred to, so that members of
the Committee can see in detail the opinions of staff on the range of
issues that are, no doubt, pertinent to this amendment and
others.</div>
					<a name="07072484000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">Morale among
CSA claimants, rather than staff, would be a better measure of the
degree to which it is performing its functions effectively, although I
do not think that I need to go through the evidence in
detail.</div>
					<a name="07072484000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07072484000370"></a>
							<b class="B">Mrs.
Nadine Dorries</b> (Mid-Bedfordshire) (Con): I totally agree
with the hon. Gentleman&#146;s comment that the morale of the
claimants would be a good measure of effectiveness. As he said, the
morale of staff is also important, but another good measure would be
how often hon. Members have to use the hotline, should the hotline
still be available when the new service is in place. I would like the
Minister to reaffirm whether hon. Members will still have access to the
hotline because, unfortunately, in cases of desperation, we need to use
it
frequently.</div>
					<a name="07072484000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07072484000371"></a>Danny
Alexander:
						</b> I hesitate to speak for the Minister on those
matters, although I note that, in the evidence session, his colleague
in the Lords, Lord McKenzie, made clear that the MP hotline would
continue. Without wishing to speak for the Minister as a matter of
habit, I hope that I have made that point clear. However, the wider
point that the hon. Lady made is absolutely right. The amendment, which
would establish an equation between the competence of the organisation
and the ability to level fees, would allow a much wider range of
measures to be employed. It is not simply a matter of
competence.</div>
					<a name="07072484000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">On Second
Reading, hon. Members on both sides of the House referred to the
hard-working nature of the staff and the fact that many of them are
talented, competent and yet are struggling under the weight of a system
that has been incompetently devised. I am not sure that the new system
will mark a huge improvement on that, but we will, no doubt, come to
that as we work through the Bill. That point is important. The major
reason why we are in Committee debating the Bill is that the current
system has been such a hideous failure for so many of our constituents,
and every hon. Member in the Committee will have had dreadful
experiences with that at a constituency level. The Minister, in his
closing remarks, seemed slightly firmer on the introduction of charges
in 2010 than we had previously allowed&#151;he made it clear that
charges would be introduced in 2010 at the earliest. It would be
interesting to know whether he intends to introduce the regulations in
2010 or whether he does not yet know. I suspect that he may say that
that is a matter for the commission.</div>
					<a name="07072484000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">In any case,
if the level of competence and administrative efficiency in CMEC and
the legacy organisations has not improved, introducing charges would
add insult to injury to users. For people who have suffered for many
years from not having their maintenance obligations effectively dealt
with, levying charges would be hopelessly 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column164" />Column number: 164</div>wrong if the new organisation is unable to meet the higher standards set
by the Minister. Because of that, I want to return to the questions
that were raised about staffing levels in the
organisation.</div>
					<a name="07072484000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">Significant falls in the number
of staff are planned during the 18-month period that concludes next
year. The Minister said that those reductions relate to the operational
improvement plan that is currently being implemented, which he said has
been through its peak phase and is now winding down. I would be
interested to hear about any evidence that suggests that the
operational improvement plan has been successful because it would cut
to the burden of the amendment, which concerns the administrative
efficiency and competence of the organisation.</div>
					<a name="07072484000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">From a
constituency perspective, the Minister has been helpful with a
particular case and I remain grateful for his assistance. In all too
many cases that are less complicated and unique than that one, I cannot
say in all honesty that I have noticed a great deal of improvement in
the past 18 months. Other hon. Members may have had different
experiences. In my experience, it is extremely hard to find out what is
happening in cases that end up in the Bolton special case
unit.</div>

Alexander:
						</b> I notice that the hon. Gentleman agrees. I
remain of the view that, with the significant staff reductions that are
planned, there is a risk that performance in the child support system
could go from bad to worse. The Minister will no doubt disagree with
that, but he ought to agree with the purpose of the amendment. He has
regularly made the point that the creation of the new organisation is a
major shift, not a re-badging or re-branding exercise. The reason why
he presents it as a major shift is that he is trying to change the
culture and operation of the organisation. If that is his objective, I
hope that he will support and welcome the amendment because it would
allow a mechanism for proving his
faith.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07072484000374"></a>John
Penrose:
						</b> The amendment would bring about an
assessment of the overall or average level of competence. The hon.
Gentleman made the point that if CMEC falls below an average level of
competence, it would add insult to injury to levy charges. However,
does he accept that the experience of the Child Support Agency has been
that different classes of case pose different levels of difficulty?
Therefore, measuring an average level of performance does not address
the problems that people are experiencing because some classes of case
are more likely to be swallowed up by the black hole that is Bolton. It
may be necessary to table an amendment so that the assessment of
whether charges are acceptable would assess not only the average level
of performance, but individual levels of performance in specific cases.
If CMEC falls below an acceptable level of performance, it may be
necessary to think about reimbursing charges that might be levied on
those specific
occasions.</div>

							<a name="07072484000375"></a>Danny
Alexander:
						</b> I am grateful for that intervention&#151;the
hon. Gentleman makes an important point. While it is not specifically
within the scope of the amendment, I hope that the Minister will take
it on board. In his 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column165" />Column number: 165</div>earlier response, he made it clear that one option is for charges to be
levied in certain categories of cases, rather than more
generally.</div>

am</div>
					<a name="07072484000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">Concerns have
been expressed about individuals who use the CSA in a vexatious way in
order to apply pressure to the other party, or other cases in which
there is non-compliance. Those are precisely the sort of cases to which
the hon. Gentleman has referred. They are often the more complicated
cases in which things are more likely to go wrong in the administrative
system, without the safeguard that he proposes. I hope that the
Minister will respond to that, and particularly to the point about
cases in which the individual has been let down by the administration
and in which charges should either not be levied or be reimbursed. That
is absolutely
right.</div>
					<a name="07072484000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would be
monstrously wrong for CMEC or the CSA to say, &#147;We are going to
levy charges, even though we have got it horribly wrong in your
case.&#148; Sadly, that is the experience of far too many people
throughout the country. That is why Janet Allbeson of One Parent
Families expressed in her evidence to the Select Committee her concern
about the introduction of charging by
saying:</div>
					<a name="07072484000305"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;let us
put charging on hold; let us see how the system beds down; let us see
who is using the new system and why they are using it and then think
about charging and how that fits into it. It is too early, and can just
antagonise people and create unnecessary tension and
aggravation.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07072484000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is in precisely the sort of cases referred to by the hon. Gentleman
that unnecessary tension and aggravation will be felt particularly
strongly. In making a general assessment about the performance of the
organisation, we must consider not only the amendment, but performance
in specific cases when deciding whether or not charging is appropriate.
I look forward to the Minister&#146;s response to the important
equation that we seek to
establish.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07072484000376"></a>Mr.
Boswell:
						</b> I rise to reflect on the matter, rather than to
reach a substantive conclusion, and I have a number of points in mind.
The first basic point is that we would not be debating the Bill, if the
CSA were doing its job at the moment. We know that radical change is
required, and that change must be towards competence and satisfactory
performance. That is self-evident and is no reflection on the
individuals, who are doing their best, or on many of the people who
pass through its
portals.</div>
					<a name="07072484000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
a kind of mind game&#151;I suppose it is the type of game that one
plays in a glide-path towards the end of a parliamentary
career&#151;I occasionally fantasise about the Minister&#146;s
objections. I will do that on the grounds that I may be more terse than
he is. I do not advise him to accept the amendment as such, but I speak
in spirit rather than in detail. We are delighted to have the hon.
Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey back in Committee,
all the more so as I now realise why he was away.</div>
					<a name="07072484000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">My first objection&#151;I
will be rude to the Minister for a minute&#151;is that many of us are
somewhat cynical about certification by a Secretary of State in any
matter, whether it involves compliance with legislation 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column166" />Column number: 166</div>on human rights or otherwise. The amendment would effectively require
the Secretary of State or, more realistically in an individual case a
junior Minister, to certify that there was a satisfactory
performance.</div>
					<a name="07072484000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
second point, which is more helpful to the hon. Gentleman, is that
however good CMEC is, it is not the only party to the transactions. The
matter depends on the compliance and behaviour of other people and
frankly, one of the problems is that many parents who are absent or
non-resident have no intention of complying, however hard we try. It is
offensive to people, not least to those who are trying to care for
their children, when that situation arises, and I fully understand the
Minister&#146;s wish to pursue such
matters.</div>
					<a name="07072484000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have some
subsidiary concerns. Capability is not necessarily the same as
performance. Even if the commission is capable of performing a
satisfactory service, it does not necessarily do so in every particular
case. Similarly, it might deteriorate having reached certification by
the Secretary of State on the back of its fees. Those are substantive
issues.</div>
					<a name="07072484000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">The nub of the
argument is what is a satisfactory service. We must expect the new
commission to perform in a satisfactory way in the great majority of
cases. Our concern, and the reason for the new measure, is that the
present agency does not perform adequately in the broad mass of cases
and performs execrably in a minority of cases. What is needed is a
normal performance&#151;a default function that works&#151;and for
proper attention to be paid to individual cases which, because of their
category or an administrative glitch, do not work. Only then can the
Minister claim success. The inference of the amendment, with which I
agree, is that at that point, and on that basis, it is reasonable to
start charging.</div>
					<a name="07072484000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
worth spending some time on certain issues: first, we should not be
trapped by a date. As One Parent Families said in evidence, there
should be a perception that everything is working and is in a stable
state, and that the problems are finite and manageable. It may then be
appropriate for a fee to be charged. Those are perfectly sensible
criteria.</div>
					<a name="07072484000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
there must be an understanding at that point that individual
difficulties that arise&#151;God knows, they arise with applications
for passports, driving licences and so on&#151;can be handled
satisfactorily. I would have thought it self-evident that fees should
not be charged, or should be rebated, when there has been a failure of
service, especially when the service is generally satisfactory. The
Minister needs to go a bit further in relation to compensation.
Privately, I have always been a bit uneasy that the existing agency,
faced with evidence of its failure in a particular case, tends to say,
&#147;We were right to check the 50 quid and tell the person it is a
compensation payment,&#148; which is not necessarily always
appropriate. It is not as good as fixing the system.</div>
					<a name="07072484000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister needs to consider
not only the return of fees but compensation, when appropriate. We
touched on, but did not explore, the function of CMEC and its
responsibilities to its customers in respect of its ability to be sued,
for example. If someone had to make a private arrangement and it had
been validated by a lawyer, that lawyer would be liable in respect of
professional negligence and so forth. If CMEC is the broker of these
arrangements, albeit the broker of last resort, it has an obligation to
deliver properly.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column167" />Column number: 167</div>
					<a name="07072484000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">We know exactly what the hon.
Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey is arguing for,
and it is a worthy aim not to rush into things and not to charge fees
where there will clearly be continuing come-back. It is important that
when fees are charged there is a good reason for it, and they should
not be a loss leader. We should not regard fees as an excuse for not
paying the maintenance, which must be the first charge on anyone who is
contributing. There should be stability, and a proper regime for
redress in cases of failure. I am sure that that is what the Minister
wants to achieve, and it is the Committee&#146;s duty to spend a
little time encouraging him to do
so.</div>
					<a name="07072484000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07072484000377"></a>Mr.
Weir:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>I want to make a few brief
points on the amendment. We are here in the first instance because of
the failure of the Child Support Agency and the point made in Sir David
Henshaw&#146;s report that a clean break is needed. However, I fear
that introducing fees will add new complexity to an already difficult
situation. The Bill states that the Secretary of State may make
regulation to introduce fees, when he is satisfied that the commission
is capable of providing a satisfactory service.</div>
					<a name="07072484000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister has already
accepted that the CSA is not fit for purpose, hence the Bill. However,
I draw a parallel with tax credits, when Minister after Minister stood
up in the House and said that there was nothing wrong and everything
was working fine, in the teeth of evidence from hon. Members on both
sides of the House who had problem after problem with tax credits.
Although I have every faith in the Minister, we need an independent
assessment of when the agency is performing
satisfactorily.</div>
					<a name="07072484000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07072484000378"></a>Mr.
Boswell:
						</b> Would the hon. Gentleman like
me to describe my discussions with my local welfare rights office the
other day? We produced a precise contrast between the means-tested
benefits, notably tax credits, which were generating a huge amount of
casework, and the very small number of cases where there was an
entitlement, such as to a pension, and where administrative issues do
not normally seem to
arise.</div>
					<a name="07072484000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07072484000379"></a>Mr.
Weir:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman makes a very good point. My point
concerns the system and how we decide when it is working
satisfactorily. We all agree that the CSA, despite the best efforts of
most of its staff, is not working in a satisfactory manner, and there
are many reasons for that. The hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn,
Badenoch and Strathspey mentioned the number of staff. There are
obviously resources implications, as there have been from the outset,
and there are IT problems. There is a host of problems, which has
undermined public confidence and the confidence of most MPs in the
CSA.</div>
					<a name="07072484000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">We all want
CMEC to be different. We want it to work and to provide a better
system. The priority must therefore be to get CMEC up and running,
working well and enjoying the confidence of both non-resident parents
and parents with care. I was interested in the Minister&#146;s
statement, which gave the impression that CMEC may be considering
introducing charges from a fairly early stage. That would create
unnecessary complexity and would lead to disagreement between
parties.</div>
					<a name="07072484000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">I suspect, if
I may be cynical for a moment, that the reason for charges is to
encourage people into voluntary agreements or a standard form that may
be available on 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column168" />Column number: 168</div>the net. That is fair and well where parents agree, but in many cases
parents cannot agree, and CMEC will become involved. Charges are not
going to help matters in complicated cases where one parent is being
very difficult. Whoever has to pay the charge, it will be another piece
of grit in the oyster in trying to reach agreement between the
parents&#151;it will irritate and lead to
trouble.</div>
					<a name="07072484000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is also
the problem of the level of fees, on which there has been no indication
as yet. I appreciate that that is a matter for CMEC, but unless the
fees are on a staggered basis, they may not mean much to someone who is
earning a reasonable amount of money. For someone on low income or on
benefit, however, they may make a huge difference to the level of child
maintenance.</div>
					<a name="07072484000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">Fees are
a cul de sac that we should not go down at this stage. The better
enforcement that is promised by the Bill is a better way of ensuring
that those who are liable to pay child maintenance will pay it. Fees
should be considered only once we are all satisfied through an
independent appraisal that CMEC is doing its job and that it is making
things better for parents with care and
children.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07072484000380"></a>Mr.
Harper:
						</b> I have three relatively brief
points. What assessment has the Department made of the relative cost of
entering into private agreements? Clearly, if a private agreement is a
relatively straightforward standard agreement that can be downloaded
from the internet and entered into without taking legal advice, it will
be fairly cheap. On the other hand a private agreement that meets the
requirements of both parents as well as those of the children could be
more costly. That needs to be taken into account when setting the level
of fees.</div>
					<a name="07072484000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">If entering
into a private agreement is relatively expensive and the fee is not set
at an equivalent level, people will use CMEC instead of using private
agreements. That will lead to a situation that the Government have said
that they do not want, namely CMEC being the default mechanism. The
other thing that is not really laid out is whether any fee structure
that is set up will involve a flat fee, a fixed monetary amount, a
means-tested amount or a figure linked to the income or amount of
maintenance. What is the Minister&#146;s
view?</div>
					<a name="07072484000320"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.15
am</div>
					<a name="07072484000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have asked
that because, according to the graph in the regulatory impact
assessment showing the number of cases and the level of maintenance,
the majority of cases involve amounts of money that are not very large,
although they are a lot for the parent with care. If the fees are high
enough to have any effect, they will be significant compared with the
amount of maintenance in the vast bulk of cases, but very small in the
smaller number of cases that involve a significant amount of
maintenance. Does the Minister intend to structure the charges so that
they vary according to the income of the
parent?</div>
					<a name="07072484000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">My final
point, which has been touched on by a number of Committee members, is
whether any fee structure will be worth the candle if it is
specifically designed not to be a cost-recovery mechanism. Given the
complexity of the maintenance system in general and the amount of money
that is likely to be collected 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column169" />Column number: 169</div>in fees in this case, will it be sensible to have a fee structure, a
charging mechanism and a method of collecting the money? Has the
Department thought about the amount that will be collected in fees and
the number of people who will have to pay them? If the fee level is low
and the number of parents&#151;with care or without&#151;fairly
small, it will not be worth the trouble of setting up a complex
structure. We might end up with one of those governmental situations in
which the staffing and running costs outweigh the amounts of money
being moved around to the extent that it makes no sense at
all.</div>
					<a name="07072484000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07072484000381"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:
						</b> Hon. Members have raised a wide range of points.
I was going to reassure the hon. Member for Mid-Bedfordshire that there
is, of course, going to be access for MPs pursuing constituents&#146;
cases, but she has
gone.</div>
					<a name="07072484000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey raised a
number of points. First, he asked whether I could place the recent
staff survey before Parliament. Yes, I shall be more than happy to do
that. Then he spoke about staffing. He knows that we have increased
staffing levels in the agency in recent years as part of the
operational improvement plan to deal with a considerable legacy of
issues and problems in the agency. A concerted effort is taking place
during the three years of that plan to resolve those problems before we
move on to the new commission arrangement, but this is only the first
year of the plan. The agency, in common with other parts of the
Department, has a mission to achieve head-count numbers.</div>
					<a name="07072484000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">We envisage that numbers will
reduce gradually as we implement the head-count plan. That should take
the numbers back, broadly, to where they were before the boost to
staffing levels associated with the operational improvement plan. The
hon. Gentleman should remember that if the OIP does what we expect it
to do, a lot of issues will be removed from the agency, and as we move
into the new arrangement there will be different levels of people
coming into the statutory system. It will be for the commission, once
it is set up, to decide the staffing level that is appropriate for it
to run the services that it is deemed to have to run. It is important
to understand that the current trajectory on staffing numbers does not
presume decisions that the commission will make, and the hon. Gentleman
should not do so either. The numbers that are published relate to the
agency and to the head-count plan that applies to the
Department.</div>
					<a name="07072484000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07072484000382"></a>Danny
Alexander:
						</b> The Minister rightly enjoins
us not to make assumptions about CMEC staffing levels. Does that imply
that resources would be made available should the commissioner and his
board at CMEC decide that they need more staff? The Minister makes the
point that one year into the operational improvement plan, staffing is
on a downward trend that is expected to go through to March 2008. The
reduction is significant. Does he have early evidence that he can give
the Committee on whether, in that first year, the operational
improvement plan has succeeded to the extent that a reduction of 2,000
staff by March 2008 can be
justified?</div>
					<a name="07072484000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07072484000383"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:
						</b> Let me see whether I can reassure the hon.
Gentleman on that with some of the results from the first year of the
operational improvement plan. So 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column170" />Column number: 170</div>far, 45,000 more children are in receipt of maintenance; a higher
proportion of non-resident parents are paying or using direct
maintenance, 61 per cent. of whom are on new schemes; the number of
uncleared applications, which was one of the big problems in the
agency, is already down by 31 per cent.; applications are being cleared
far faster with 61 per cent. being cleared in 12 weeks, up from
53 per cent. before the plan; telephony is certainly improving; and the
extra releases in IT are taking place to fix some of the problems
inherent in that system. Those are encouraging results from just the
first year of the operational improvement plan, which has two years to
go.</div>
					<a name="07072484000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">With the
operational improvement plan, we are focusing on the outcomes in terms
of the agency&#146;s performance, which is the important thing to
keep an eye on. As the problems are resolved and as the IT releases go
in, a lot less will have to be done clerically. That will facilitate a
reduction in head count without jeopardising the continuous improvement
in the performance of the agency that we are looking
for.</div>
					<a name="07072484000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member
for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey and others have raised
concern about the situation in Bolton, and I hope that I can reassure
them. Thirty-four thousand of the most complex cases in the agency were
transferred to Bolton for a concerted drive to try to tackle them. That
is a tough job, and I willingly accept that there have been
difficulties in the early phase of the operation. I will not dwell
entirely on those cases, but I will return to them in a moment. The
fact that those 34,000 really tough cases have gone to Bolton means
that agency staff who were dealing with them are free to deal with
other cases, which is helping to improve
performance.</div>
					<a name="07072484000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
want to see results coming out of the Bolton mission, but it is early
days. So far, it is administering &#163;15 million in additional
maintenance payments as a result of focusing on those problems. Again,
part of the solution is getting the IT right, and there are further
releases to come for the Bolton operation this year, which should help
in getting on top of the
situation.</div>
					<a name="07072484000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Daventry asked about the compensation scheme, which
will continue essentially as it is under CMEC. However, it is open for
CMEC to consider, in the light of its operations as it comes into
being, whether it wants to make further changes. At this stage I
envisage it taking on the existing compensation
scheme.</div>
					<a name="07072484000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Angus asked, in connection with the amendment, how we
will know how the commission is doing. He wanted to know whether we can
assess its performance before it comes back to us or to Parliament
asking to implement any fee charging scheme. When discussing clause 9,
we will look at the reporting system and the annual report that the
commission must make. There are amendments that we will debate, but it
sets out the framework of how the Secretary of State and Parliament
will have a regular check on how the commission is doing against the
performance criteria in the Bill. Therefore, there will be a way of
measuring how it is doing against its objectives. However, I agree with
the hon. Gentleman that the critical thing is to get performance,
delivery to clients and enforcement right. That is what we need to keep
our relentless focus on. That is the point of the fundamental change
and the clean break that we are making with this Bill.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column171" />Column number: 171</div>
					<a name="07072484000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Forest of
Dean raised some interesting points about fees. He wondered whether
behavioural impacts will arise from the structure of fees. I am sure
that that will happen, and that is one of the issues that the
Commission will have to think about, if it chooses to come forward with
a proposal for
fees.</div>
					<a name="07072484000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07072484000384"></a>Mrs.

way?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07072484000385"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:
						</b> In a
moment.</div>
					<a name="07072484000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of the
things that we will want to see is its assessment on the potential
behavioural impacts of any fee structure that it proposes. It goes
without saying that we would not be inclined to support a fee structure
that has detrimental or adverse impacts. The hon. Member for Forest of
Dean asked whether the fee structure will be flat, varied or
means-tested. That is entirely an issue for the Commission, so I repeat
to him that any fee proposals that the commission comes forward with
are subject to affirmative debate in Parliament, so they will get
intense scrutiny before they are implemented. That will be the point at
which we can look at the questions that he has raised, should the
situation arise.</div>
					<a name="07072484000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall give way to the hon. Lady, but first I repeat the answer that I
gave to her earlier question, while she was out of the Room. She asked
whether MPs will continue to have access to the systems to pursue
cases. Yes, they
will.</div>
					<a name="07072484000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07072484000386"></a>Mrs.
Dorries:
						</b> I thank the Minister for that answer. I was
trying to make a wider point, because he gave that answer in the
evidence session.</div>
					<a name="07072484000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">With
regard to the fee structure, I have a practical suggestion. Can the new
scheme be given a six month run-in period while we see how it beds down
before the fee-charging scheme is introduced later? I mention that
because of particular cases involving fathers who are very difficult to
track down. When such fathers are tracked down, it is very difficult to
get payments out of them. I am worried that those people will disappear
altogether. Could we not see how the system beds down, and then
introduce the fee-charging
scheme?</div>
					<a name="07072484000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07072484000387"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:
						</b> I am afraid that I cannot
agree with that suggestion, for a very simple reason. It is important
to understand the principle on which we are making these changes. We
are moving to a commissioning basis in the system of child maintenance.
I really do not want to fetter the commission in the decisions that it
is going to make. I understand why the hon. Lady has said that, and I
am sure that a whole host of suggestions about making various changes
will be made. However, the more that we hem in the commission, the less
clean a break it will be. That is how it has to be, and I want those
decisions to rest with the commission.</div>
					<a name="07072484000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I have said, if the
commission comes forward with fee-charging proposals, it will need the
approval of the Secretary of State and an affirmative resolution from
Parliament. It is not as if the subject is being lost from scrutiny and
that there will be no opportunity to raise the points that the hon.
Lady has mentioned&#151;far from it. I want the initiative to rest
with the Commission, which is the point of the
change.</div>

							<a name="07072484000388"></a>Mr.
Boswell:
						</b> Although I fully understand
that the Minister does not want to hamper or fetter the commission in
coming up with any fee-charging scheme, or in the general discharge of
its functions, would he mind if I put down a marker on the question of
costs? The clause, as drafted, has a cost-related fee structure, but
does the Minister agree that it is very important that CMEC at least
gets a grip on its costs in individual cases, in particular categories,
and at the margin in pursuing individual cases? Unless it understands
that structure, even if it does not reflect it in the unit charge, it
will not be able to manage its job or discharge the work efficiently
overall.</div>
					<a name="07072484000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07072484000389"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:
						</b> I understand what the hon. Gentleman is saying,
and I potentially agree with him. I refer him back to clause 3, which
we debated last week. It includes an obligation to the commission
to</div>
					<a name="07072484000306"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;exercise its
functions both effectively and
efficiently&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07072484000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of the
tests whether it is functioning efficiently is the way in which it
spends its money and handles its costs. I agree with him, and the
opportunity for us to assess that is already covered by clause
3.</div>
					<a name="07072484000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall now
return to the core of the amendment, on which the debate hangs. The
amendment poses some difficulties, although I understand why it has
been tabled. It would require a subjective test of the capability of
the commission and of what constitutes a satisfactory service. Any view
that the Secretary of State takes on those matters could be open to
challenge, which would threaten the validity of any regulations then
brought
forward.</div>
					<a name="07072484000295"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent">The
amendment would potentially stop the introduction of fees until the new
scheme is up and running, when a clearer assessment of the
commission&#146;s ability to provide a satisfactory service is
possible. That would prevent the commission establishing fees as an
integral part of the new scheme. That might be what the hon. Member for
Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey wants, but such fettering of
the commission is not appropriate at this
stage.</div>
				
					<a name="07072484000321"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.30
am</div>
					<a name="07072484000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me add, however, that the Child Support Agency charged fees between
1993 and 1995. The regulations allowing them to be charged were
revoked, partly because the service that the agency provided at the
time was simply not good enough to justify charging a fee. The
commission will have that experience in mind when it considers
arrangements for any future charging regime and its timing. That will
be borne in mind not only by the commission, but by Ministers, and
Parliament will bear that precedent in mind if and when charging
regulations are laid and considered under the affirmative procedure.
Given those reassurances and reminders, I hope that the hon. Gentleman
will withdraw his
amendment.</div>

would be improved by the amendment and I therefore seek to test the

end insert&#151;</div>
					<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(3A) The
Secretary of State may by regulations provide that the provisions of
the Child Support Act 1991 (c. 48) with respect
to&#151;</div>
					<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">(a) the collection
of child support
maintenance,</div>
					<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">(b) the
enforcement of any obligation to pay child support
maintenance,</div>
					<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">shall apply
equally (with any necessary modifications) to fees payable by virtue of
regulations under subsection
(1).&#146;.</div>
					<a name="07072484000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment clarifies the intention behind clause 6(2)(f), which enables
regulations to include matters relating to the recovery of fees. The
amendment is modelled on section 47(4) of the Child Support Act 1991.
Fees will not be an effective tool if they cannot be enforced, which is
why the clause originally said that regulations could provide for the
recovery of fees. However, we felt that the intent of the provision
might not be clear enough, which is why we tabled the
amendment.</div>
					<a name="07072484000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am sure that hon. Members
remember that section 47(4) of the 1991 Act specifically states
that enforcement powers shall apply to fees. However, that section will
be repealed with the creation of the new fees provision. Despite the
reference in clause 6(2)(f), it could be argued that in its current
form the new fees clause does not give the commission the ability to
use enforcement powers to collect fees. That is not the intention, so
for the avoidance of doubt I am moving this amendment.</div>
					<a name="07072484000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
makes no substantive change to the Bill. It simply makes it expressly
clear that the enforcement powers available to the commission,
including those set out in part 3, may extend to the collection of
fees. However it is recognised that some enforcement powers are not
proportionate to the collection of fees&#151;I refer to measures that
we will come to later such as the removal of passports, curfew orders,
commitment to prison, and disqualification from driving. These powers
are clearly intended to be used for the collection of unpaid
maintenance payments. I assure the Committee that we do not intend to
use them just for the collection of fees, and restrictions to that
effect will be placed in regulations.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column174" />Column number: 174</div>
					<a name="07072484000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is appropriate to set out the
exact details in secondary legislation, as it will allow any
restrictions placed on enforcement measures to be developed as an
integral part of the charging regime to which they relate. However, I
reiterate the importance we attach to ensuring that the measures are
used appropriately. Members of the Committee will of course have the
opportunity to scrutinise all regulations made under clause 6; again,
they will be subject to affirmative
resolution.</div>

						</b> I wish to make one brief point. The Minister
made it clear that these sensible and proportionate provisions are
necessary to ensure that the Bill operates as the Government intend.
Under paragraph (b) of the amendment,</div>
					<a name="07072484000308"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the enforcement of any obligation
to pay child support maintenance, shall apply equally...to fees
payable by virtue of regulations under subsection
(1).&#148;</div>
					<a name="07072484000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will
the Minister clarify whether using the enforcement powers to collect
fees will apply only when maintenance is also being collected? For
example, if someone has started to pay maintenance but for some reason
refuses to pay the fee, can those enforcement powers, which are to be
used for the collection of child maintenance, be used to collect the
unpaid fee? I suppose that a fee could be levied even in cases where
there is a nil maintenance
assessment.</div>
					<a name="07072484000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07072484000413"></a>Mr.
Boswell:
						</b> As we begin to tease out this
issue&#151;subsection (1) makes it clear that it is about the
agency&#151;I have it in mind that the agency may nevertheless be
required to pick up on private arrangements in which maintenance is not
being paid. The question is whether it can charge fees retrospectively,
as if were, on that portion of unpaid maintenance that was missed
before it became directly
involved?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07072484000414"></a>Danny
Alexander:
						</b> I hope that the Minister will explicitly rule
out the circumstance described by the hon. Gentleman, as I am sure that
it would be against the Government&#146;s intentions as set out by
the Minister. I am trying to understand whether the provision would
allow the enforcement powers to be used to collect fees when no
maintenance was being collected through the enforcement
process.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07072484000415"></a>Mr.
Harper:
						</b> I want to make a brief point about the welcome
intention that the Minister outlined when introducing the amendment.
The amendment refers to the fact that the regulations to be used to
collect fees shall apply equally, with any necessary modification. I
listened carefully to what the Minister said about not 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column175" />Column number: 175</div>using the enforcement mechanisms disproportionately to collect fees, so
the use of the phrase &#147;shall apply equally&#148; seems to me
to state the opposite intention. Given that that will be in the Bill,
and the Minister&#146;s comments will not, I wonder whether a
different wording might be more
satisfactory.</div>
					<a name="07072484000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07072484000416"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:
						</b> I shall reply briefly to the points that have
been made. The hon. Member for Daventry is seeking to extend the
policing powers of the commission into private agreements. That is not
what we intend to do. The answer to his question is that fees will not
be levied in respect of private cases.</div>
					<a name="07072484000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Inverness,
Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey wanted to know whether enforcement
powers could be applied just to fees. No, they could not.</div>
					<a name="07072484000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Forest of
Dean wonders why the phrase &#147;shall apply equally&#148; is
included. It is to ensure that the legal basis for taking action to
pursue maintenance, is also available to pursue fees. Of course, it is
restricted in terms of the powers that will be used in the way that I
have clarified.</div>
					<a name="07072484000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope, with those reassurances, that the Committee will accept the
amendment.</div>

Rowen:
						</b> This clause deals with agency arrangements and the
provision of services. I know from our evidence-taking sessions last
week and our debates that when CMEC comes into operation, greater use
will be made of the voluntary and third sector to provide information
services. I welcome that. The amendments seek to place in the Bill what
we believe is the prime purpose of the agency and to ensure that that
aim is not overlooked when arrangements are made to contract out and
for different services and support to be provided by other
bodies.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column176" />Column number: 176</div>
					<a name="07072484000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">I appreciate
that if money can be saved by delivering a service in a different way,
that is in itself a laudable aim. But that pursuit of greater
administrative efficiency should not be allowed to obscure the
importance of delivering the service for which the agency has been set
up. The Minister already knows of our concerns about the planned cuts.
He has given reassurances about that, which he has repeated this
morning. Nevertheless, as we begin to contract out and to use other
services, we need to make sure that our prime purpose is to ensure
better delivery of service. That is why I quoted the example of making
greater use of the third sector in the provision of information
services. That is an excellent example, which shows that locally
delivered, locally administered voluntary agencies can be much more
successful in providing support to parents who seek to make child care
arrangements than an arm&#146;s length agency that might not have
sufficient staff in the locality to provide information and
support.</div>

					<a name="07072484000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">We also accept,
as the Minister pointed out last week, that the use of private debt
collection agencies has brought results. We are not opposed to the use
of private debt collection agencies. However, we have to be clear about
our purpose in moving to the use of such agencies, and that purpose
must be the provision of child maintenance and the welfare of the
child. The amendment is designed to ensure that that remains the prime
purpose for introducing any such contracting or agency
arrangements.</div>

							<b class="B">Andrew
Selous</b> (South-West Bedfordshire) (Con): I want to return
to something that the hon. Gentleman said a moment ago on the
commission&#146;s objectives in securing effective maintenance. Does
he share my regret that the phrase &#147;and the welfare of the
child&#148; does not appear in clause
2?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07072484000421"></a>Paul
Rowen:
						</b> We had a full debate on that last
week, and I was disappointed that the Minister could not accept a
reasonable amendment that would have set the agency up with that very
clear purpose. This measure is not only about collecting money, but
putting arrangements in place to ensure that children are properly
cared
for.</div>
					<a name="07072484000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
professional and technical services, I want to make a brief comment
about the provision of IT services, which has bedevilled the CSA since
its inception. There are still two different computer systems in
operation. I know that the Secretary of State said in February in
evidence to the Select Committee that the Government intended not to
have a new system. However, he also stated that they were happy with
the arrangements with EDS and that there was a clear programme to
ensure that the problems with the current system would be worked out. I
hope that the Minister can update us on the improvements to IT
services. I am still experiencing problems in my casework that are
caused by the inability of the IT systems to extract the information
that is
needed.</div>
					<a name="07072484000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07072484000422"></a>Mrs.
Dorries:
						</b> It is not only a case of being bedevilled by IT.
Some cases are more complicated than others, as we have said before. In
complicated cases, such as that of Mr. and Mrs.
Jennings who are two grandparents in my constituency who are looking
after children who have an absent mother and father, the IT system
seems  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column177" />Column number: 177</div>to fail completely. Then, going back to an earlier point, we have to
depend on individual caseworkers. Can we have an assurance that the IT
system will not be of the average standard used for average cases, but
that measures will be built in to allow the software to deal with more
complex
cases?</div>
					<a name="07072484000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07072484000423"></a>Paul
Rowen:
						</b> I agree with the hon. Lady. She has quoted an
example in her constituency, and all of us have cases in which the
current IT system is not delivering. The Select Committee insisted that
before CMEC becomes operational, the Department should provide the
House with information on how the computer system will operate. We want
an indication from the Minister about what will happen as CMEC is set
up and what arrangements will be put in place.</div>
					<a name="07072484000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">We do not want to deal only
with yesterday&#146;s computer solutions&#151;this is the point in
the Henshaw report about the CSA having a fresh start and a clean
break&#151;because we want to know what arrangements are being put in
place to ensure that any replacement or enhancement system can deal
with not only the new method of operation, but, more importantly,
existing cases. The Minister knows that in the previous sitting I went
on about ensuring that historic debt is not forgotten. We must
ensure&#151;we need a comment from the Minister&#151;that what he
has got planned will ensure that the new systems will perform and that
what has bedevilled the CSA in the past will be dealt with more
effectively.</div>
					<a name="07072484000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07072484000424"></a>Mr.
Boswell:
						</b> I have quite a lot of sympathy
with the comments that are being made, and, sadly, assurances are
needed in relation to IT systems. I have a different point, which picks
up a dialogue about confidentiality that the hon. Member for Angus and
I engaged in at the oral evidence session. I have no ideological
difficulty whatsoever with either agencies or outsourcing, if that is
the most effective thing to do.</div>
					<a name="07072484000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of the
attractions of the amendments, which bears on clauses 7 and 8, is that
they relate to the agency&#146;s main purpose. However, I have
concerns that information may leak out to other persons. If the
Minister remembers the oral evidence sitting, we developed the argument
that highly confidential information on income, which HMRC does not
normally release, will pass from the Inland Revenue to CMEC in order
for CMEC to do its job. I do not think that anyone in this Committee is
seeking to overturn that.</div>
					<a name="07072484000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
extremely important that that information or any other material, such
as medical submissions that appear on the file, stops at that point.
The collection of such information is justified by the need to sort out
maintenance, but not as part of a fishing expedition that becomes part
of the public currency. Those people are private individuals, and we
are all aware of the sensitivity of the cases. All that I am asking for
is the Minister&#146;s assurance that whatever obligations apply to
officials within the existing agency will continue into the new
commission and its agents or contractors. There will be absolutely no
question of any dilution of standards or safeguards in terms of the
privacy or confidentiality of the information relating to
individuals.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07072484000425"></a>Mr.
Weir:
						</b> I want to follow the point made by the hon. Member
for Daventry, which is the point that I also wish to make. Taking up
what the hon. Member for Rochdale said about IT, we challenged in the
evidence-taking session the flow of information, and I made the point
that CMEC is fundamentally different from the CSA in that it will get
its information from Revenue and Customs. At that point, I raised the
concern about where that information will go after it has reached
CMEC.</div>
					<a name="07072484000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">Hilary
Reynolds, who is the civil servant responsible, said that one of the
schedules includes all the available information gateways and that the
gateways are fairly wide to allow CMEC to take and receive information
from a wide variety of sources. This is a specific clause about the use
of that information and the scheduling of various gateways. That is
quite correct. The schedule in question is schedule 6, which states
that</div>
					<a name="07072484000309"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Information to which
this paragraph applies may be
supplied&#151;</div>
					<a name="07072484000310"></a><div class="hs_brev">(a) to the
Commission, or</div>
					<a name="07072484000311"></a><div class="hs_brev">(b) to a person
providing services to the
Commission</div>
					<a name="07072484000312"></a><div class="hs_brev">for use for the
purposes of functions relating to child
support.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07072484000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">My concern is
that the contracting-out of services, specifically in clause 8, gives
the potential that a lot of information coming from HMRC is going not
to CMEC but to outside agencies. I made that point in the
evidence-taking session in relation to the extent of contracting
out&#151;for example, will the calculation of maintenance be
contracted out to a third party? There are limits on contracting out,
including on when services can be contracted out. However, clause 8
does not set any limits, as far as I can
see.</div>
					<a name="07072484000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07072484000426"></a>Mr.
Boswell:
						</b> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that there are also
issues about jurisdiction? We understand that the agency, at least, is
operating within British law. There is nothing, as far as I know, to
prevent the new CMEC from commissioning services from different
providers in another country where British law does not apply and where
the provisions of the Official Secrets Act or the obligations of the
civil service code, for example, are not binding unless
specified.</div>
					<a name="07072484000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07072484000427"></a>Mr.
Weir:
						</b> That is obviously a concern. I
would be concerned if there were proposals to contract out CMEC
services to overseas agencies&#151;for example, many big accountancy
companies operate multinationally. However, there is concern about the
level of contracting out, and the amendments would set some controls on
that.</div>
					<a name="07072484000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the
Minister say something about the extent to which confidential
information from HMRC may be passed on? We all agree that information
can go to the commission for the purposes of child maintenance, but
where it goes once it reaches the commission is a different matter,
which is a huge concern for many hon.
Members.</div>
					<a name="07072484000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07072484000428"></a>Mr.
Harper:
						</b> On clause 7, which deals
specifically with agency arrangements for other public bodies or other
parts of Government, I want the Minister to indicate what he has in
mind. His colleague, Lord McKenzie of Luton, made it clear that CMEC
was being set up as a non-departmental public body rather than as a
Government agency, because it would be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column179" />Column number: 179</div>better if it were more at arm&#146;s length and further away from
Government. Since the clause deals with a number of the relevant
functions performed by other parts of the Government, I am curious
whether the power was included as a general power in case it was
required, whether at this stage the Department had any specific
thoughts about how it may want to deal with that&#151;what bits of
Government CMEC may want to use&#151;or whether it was included just
in case to allow future
flexibility.</div>
					<a name="07072484000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">We will
be able to discuss the two points about IT contracting when we discuss
new clause 13, which has been tabled by me and my hon. Friend the
Member for South-West
Bedfordshire.</div>
					<a name="07072484000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
information control addressed by amendments Nos. 38 and 39 is
important. As the hon. Member for Angus has said, we touched on that in
the evidence session. The relevant schedule is wide and permits
information to be passed. When we talk about that schedule in due
course, we will want to have some controls on where the information can
go and on the responsibility that CMEC would retain for ensuring that
that it was handled securely under British
law.</div>
					<a name="07072484000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07072484000429"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:
						</b> I feel that the debate on clause 7 has strayed
significantly into clause 8 as well, but provided that you permit me,
Mr. Chope, I will respond to all the points that have been
raised.</div>
					<a name="07072484000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Rochdale asked whether I could provide an update on fixing
the IT. Clause 7 does not relate to the IT situation, but seeing as it
has been mentioned, I will see to what extent I can reassure him. We
are all familiar with the IT problems in the agency, which have
bedevilled it pretty much from the outset. I do not want to go back
over the history of how the IT was acquired, because that would not add
much to our proceedings. However, suffice to say that the problem has
been there from the
beginning.</div>
					<a name="07072484000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">When we
thoroughly assessed the IT situation in the agency to find out what was
wrong, we discovered 506 defects in the system&#151;that is
all&#151;which is a seriously large number. Those had to be graded
into those of real significance, which undermined the efficiency of the
organisation, and relatively minor defects. We decided, sensibly, to
target the fundamental, systemic defects in the system first to try to
get them fixed; 219 of them have been fixed since June, the date of the
last report on IT status. That leaves a significant number of defects
still to be remedied, but those that are left are minor. Those that
were far more detrimental to the operation of the system were the focus
of our priorities and have largely been
resolved.</div>
				
					<a name="07072484000323"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12
noon</div>
					<a name="07072484000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
major upgrade will introduce enhanced functionality throughout the
agency&#146;s IT system by the end of the year and will resolve a
number of problems, as I shall explain. We will implement IT changes to
support the agency&#146;s new operating model that allocates cases to
appropriately skilled case workers and teams to progress those cases,
which will certainly be a result. We will implement a more effective
telephone call routing strategy that is aligned to the new operating
model, which should improve the response to clients on the phones. We
will also implement a number of IT fixes that will prevent cases from
becoming stuck in the agency&#146;s 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column180" />Column number: 180</div>computer system, which has given rise to many problems in all hon.
Members&#146; constituencies, and provide improved system-produced
key customer communications, a matter that was raised in earlier
sittings.</div>
					<a name="07072484000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">Enhancements to the finance
system functionality will be introduced in 2008-09, which will improve
the system&#146;s ability to collect debt and process all financial
transactions. The agency is working closely with EDS, the main
supplier, with the aim of ensuring that all cases will be technically
recovered by the end of March 2008. The agency will ensure that any
operational or remedial actions are taken on cases following technical
recovery by March 2009. In view of these plans, all current cases
should be unstuck by the end of March 2009 at the latest. I hope that I
can reassure the hon. Member for Rochdale that, to coin a phrase, a lot
has been done, but there is a lot still to do in respect of fixing the
IT system.</div>
					<a name="07072484000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Daventry asked about confidentiality and I can assure him
that the confidentiality safeguards will not be diluted. They will
apply to any agency carrying out a function on behalf of another in
exactly the same way as they do to the commission itself. The hon.
Member for Angus strayed on to clause 8, but I will try to reassure him
that any supplier that has access to sensitive information in the
course of carrying out the commission&#146;s functions will be
subject to exactly the same restrictions on the use of that information
as the commission&#146;s employees. Provisions to govern that matter
will be enshrined within the associated
contracts.</div>
					<a name="07072484000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 2
provides the commission with a single overarching objective: to
maximise the number of effective maintenance arrangements in place. I
do not fundamentally disagree with what the hon. Member for Rochdale
sought to achieve by tabling the amendment, but I hope to persuade him
that provisions that will have that effect are already in the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="07072484000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">The functions
that the Bill confers on the commission and the powers that it is given
to carry them out have the common purpose of enabling the commission to
achieve its objective. For any functions that relate to child
maintenance, the commission already has a duty to consider its
objectives. Indeed, that is made absolutely clear in clause 2(3), which
states:</div>
					<a name="07072484000313"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Commission shall aim to pursue, and to have regard to, its objectives
when exercising a function that is relevant to
them.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07072484000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is therefore
clear that the commission must already have regard to its objectives
when considering whether its functions should be carried out by another
provider. It is worth noting that clause 7 also makes it possible for
the commission to carry out functions of other Departments and public
bodies, and for each to provide services for the
other.</div>
					<a name="07072484000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
think that the hon. Member for Forest of Dean was anxious about scope,
and I shall now deal with that point. It might not always make sense
for the commission to enter into arrangements or to perform functions
with a view to its main objectives. The commission&#146;s works sit
within and are closely linked to a number of other areas of government.
As such, there might be situations when the commission is best placed
to carry out a particular task, even if that task does not contribute
directly to its objectives. With the increasing momentum for work to be
joined up across government, I think that hon. Members will agree that
that should be encouraged.</div>

example of Northern Ireland when looking at the context of clause 7.
Although child support in Northern Ireland is a devolved matter, the IT
systems provided by the British CSA are used at present. That makes
economic sense, given the small size of the Northern Ireland CSA
caseload and that its child support system is based on GB&#146;s
child support system. Wider government success and efficiency depend on
such arrangements being possible, even when they do not contribute

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07072484000431"></a>Mr.
Harper:
						</b> I beg to move amendment No. 99, in
clause 8, page 3, line 26, at
end insert</div>
					<a name="07072484000470"></a><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;,
except for functions relating to collection and enforcement exercised
under sections 19 to 28 of this
Act.&#146;.</div>
					<a name="07072484000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment would limit the scope of contracting out under clause 8. At
the moment, clause 8 will enable any function of the commission to be
contracted out, and I think that it would be inappropriate for certain
functions to be contracted out to private organisations. The specific
area that the amendment would prevent from being contracted out is the
collection and enforcement powers that are specifically in clauses 19
to 28. In a moment, I will go through each of those in turn to explain
why I think that contracting out would be inappropriate.</div>
					<a name="07072484000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to say at the beginning
that we very much support tough enforcement and collection powers.
Indeed, it is specifically because the enforcement powers are very
tough and robust that it would be inappropriate for them to be executed
by an organisation to which they had been contracted out. Because they
are tough and powerful, they should be exercised by only CMEC itself.
It is worth saying that some functions should remain properly within
the purview of the public sector and not be contracted out.
</div>
					<a name="07072484000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
first few clauses about which we are concerned&#151;clauses 19 to
22&#151;relate to collection. I do not want to go through the
deduction of earnings orders at the moment because we will have a
chance to discuss them later. Although the broad principle of allowing
CMEC to take money and apply for deductions of earnings is correct, it
is not a power that I would be comfortable having contracted out to a
private company or organisation, as that would allow them to seek
orders to take money directly from someone&#146;s earnings.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column182" />Column number: 182</div>
					<a name="07072484000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">A number of
the first few clauses to which the amendment refers relate to such
collection mechanisms, be they deductions from earnings, or some lump
sum deduction orders. In some senses, however, those are the least
objectionable issues. My main concerns about clauses 19 to 28 relate to
some of the rightly tough enforcement mechanisms. Clause 25, on the
disqualification from holding or obtaining travel authorisation,
specifically gives the commission the power to make an order without
even having to get the permission of a court. It will be allowed to
make an order and to take away a person&#146;s travel documents. That
is a tough power, and it is not appropriate for the commission to
contract it out and allow others to carry it out on its behalf. Given
that the commission has to take into account whether a person needs
travel authorisation to earn a living, it is a judgment that the
commission should properly have to make, not simply contract
out.</div>
					<a name="07072484000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
the Minister was talking about the use of important powers to collect
fines, he recognised that some of the powers would be disproportionate
for that purpose. For the same reason, it would be inappropriate for
the commission to contract them out.</div>
					<a name="07072484000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07072484000432"></a>Mr.
Boswell:
						</b> Has my hon. Friend noticed the concern expressed
by several hon. Members about practices such as wheel clamping in
private car parks, where some of the charges are quite inappropriate or
inordinate? CMEC would issue a pretty full and possibly unduly detailed
contract to preclude such a thing simply under contract law. I suspect
that the Minister will give that type of
assurance.</div>
					<a name="07072484000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07072484000433"></a>Mr.
Harper:
						</b> My hon. Friend makes a good point. In relation to
the specific example that he raised, many of us know from constituency
casework that private companies can have tough powers to take
enforcement measures that can be used disproportionately. The remedies
available to individuals and the Members of Parliament acting for them
are limited&#151;far more so than they would be if they were dealing
even with a non-departmental public body, with recourse at some stage
to a Minister.</div>
					<a name="07072484000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
applications for curfew orders under clause 26 are potentially very
serious. Admittedly, there is a safeguard that the order must be made
by a court, but, again, it is not appropriate for the commission to
contract out to another organisation to seek from a court an order to
limit a person&#146;s liberty, a breach of which could result in
imprisonment.</div>
					<a name="07072484000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">Similarly,
clause 27 gives the commission the power to apply to a magistrates
court for a warrant committing someone to prison if they have failed to
pay the amounts that they owe. We might think that that penalty is
appropriately tough, but given its very toughness, a private sector
organisation should not be allowed to seek to have an individual
imprisoned. That power should properly be exercised by a public body
with the appropriate levels of accountability. The public would not be
happy to see it contracted
out.</div>
					<a name="07072484000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">Tough
enforcement will potentially be one of CMEC&#146;s weapons, whether
or not it has to use it, when trying to change the culture to one of
compliance. Apart from the principled arguments that I have been
making, a danger of contracting out is that the inappropriate use of
enforcement powers might drag all the enforcement mechanisms into
disrepute&#151;it would not need many inappropriate uses; one might
be enough.</div>

Selous:
						</b> An answer to the question about the prison system
raised by the hon. Member for Wirral, West is that no one is sent to
prison without going through the court system, which is part of the
Ministry of Justice. Part of what my hon. Friend the Member for Forest
of Dean is talking about is the removal of passports, which is done
under an administrative procedure, not a judicial one. He is therefore
absolutely right to make that
distinction.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07072484000439"></a>Mr.
Harper:
						</b> My hon. Friend makes a very good point. One issue
that I have not referred to is that without my amendment, the
commission will have the power to contract out the making of
administrative liability orders. Again, the commission can make those
orders without going to a third party&#151;a court&#151;to have
them
granted.</div>

						</b> The hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire has
come to the aid of the hon. Member for Forest of Dean, but anyone who
knows about running a prison knows that within those four walls there
are a lot of exacting administrative judgments in terms of discipline
and other enforcements. Those judgments are delegated within the four
walls of that private prison, so I repeat my question: does the hon.
Gentleman believe that running a private prison is more or less onerous
than running these
measures?</div>

							<a name="07072484000442"></a>Mr.
Harper:
						</b> As I said in my response, we are talking about
this Bill. Part of what I am saying relates to the arrangements. I
suspect that these measures are very onerous. Therefore, were the
commission to contract them out, the complexity involved and the
control that would have to be exercised to ensure that the powers 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column184" />Column number: 184</div>were properly used would frankly make contracting out rather pointless.
If the commission has to put those very tough arrangements in place, it
may as well do the work
itself.</div>
					<a name="07072484000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07072484000443"></a>Mr.
Boswell:
						</b> Will my hon. Friend accept from me, as somebody
who&#146;s constituency contains two privately run penal
establishments, that the proceedings&#151;including the
administrative ones&#151;in such prisons are crawled over at all
times by the Home Office monitor? A similar level of control or
intervention would therefore be appropriate if there are penal or
quasi-penal powers in the case of
CMEC.</div>
					<a name="07072484000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07072484000444"></a>Mr.
Harper:
						</b> I thank my hon. Friend for that
helpful intervention Without wishing to stray outside the confines of
the Bill, there is nothing in the Bill that would set up a similarly
exacting scrutiny function to ensure that these powers will be properly
used by an organisation that they are contracted out to. If the
Minister wants to retain the powers to contract out in the Bill, he
will have to reassure us that there will be some tough enforcement
powers. There would need to be a suitable exacting scrutiny function
conducted not by CMEC, but by somebody outside the organisation to
ensure that those powers were being used appropriately.</div>
					<a name="07072484000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">We can obviously talk about the
specific powers in more detail, when we get to those sections of the
Bill, but a cursory look at them shows that they are not the sort of
powers that we would necessarily want CMEC to be able to contract out.
As the Minister has already mentioned, CMEC would have to assess the
efficiency and effectiveness of contracting out. Given the enforcement
powers that would be needed to secure compliance, the complexity of
contracting them out outweighs any efficiency and benefit that could be
derived. Therefore, when we consider contracting out, it would be
sensible to narrow the
scope.</div>
					<a name="07072484000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">When we
discussed amendment No. 39, other hon. Members wanted to ensure that
contracting out was limited specifically to help the main objective of
the Bill. On this amendment, I am keen that, where appropriate, tough
enforcement powers are used to secure compliance. However, there is an
issue of principle, which is who should use those powers. I fear that
inappropriate use will damage the commission&#146;s ability to
enforce
them.</div>

							<a name="07072484000445"></a>Danny

						</b> I have a few brief comments to add. I share
quite a lot of the objectives of the hon. Member for Forest of Dean,
but I am not convinced that his amendment will fulfil the things that
he said in his remarks. He said, and I think that he was right, that in
relation to the child support and child maintenance system, the
commodity of trust is in short supply. Part of the burden of his
argument, which I agree with, is that it will only take a few mistakes
by an organisation to which the relevant powers have been contracted
out to undermine the precious little trust that there is. The Minister
hopes that trust in CMEC will accumulate as it begins to demonstrate
its competence, but I hae ma doots about
that.</div>

					<a name="07072484000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Forest of Dean is trying to make a distinction, which his
amendment does not, between taking and implementing decisions. I agree
with him 100 per cent. No contracted-out private organisation should be
responsible for deciding whether an individual goes to prison. However,
whether we like it or not, privately run prisons exist, to which people
will be sent to complete their sentence. No private organisation should
have the power to take away someone&#146;s driving licence or to
decide whether to subject someone to a
curfew.</div>

							<a name="07072484000450"></a>Mr.

						<b class="B"> </b>I have some sympathy with the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s view, but there is a difference between sending
someone to prison&#151;I agree with that&#151;and removing
passports and other identity documents, for which there is
administrative action. The implications would be very serious
if&#151;God forbid!&#151;we were to end up with an identity card. I
wonder, therefore, whether there is a problem with not only prison, but
administrative action. The passport is a state document that allows
someone to travel, and surely only the state should have the right to
take it
away.</div>

Boswell:
						</b> In an effort to assist the hon. Gentleman, I
would like to make two points. A passport remains at all times the
property of the state. Conversely, I would invite him to spend a moment
or two over the summer looking at the case of Sir Frederick Crawford,
whose passport was removed by the Wilson Government in the late 1960s.
It is an example of arbitrary action, and even from a long distance, I
remember the matter to this day as an example of the bad practice that
we seek to avoid.</div>

						</b> On the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s first point, I do not wish to stray into a debate
about clause 25 and how that power should work. We will have
plenty of time to do that at the appropriate moment. On the latter
point, I shall seek his advice after the Committee about my summer
reading list, so that I can become acquainted with that case, which
sounds very interesting.</div>
					<a name="07072484000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">I broadly agree with the hon.
Member for Forest of Dean with regard to the powers relating to
passports and driving licences in prisons. One of the clauses relates
to administrative liability orders, and I hope that in due course we
will have a debate about whether they should be an administrative
power. None the less, if the clause is accepted and administrative
liability orders become a feature of the new system, I share that view
of the hon. Member for Forest of Dean that decisions about those orders
should be a matter for CMEC. However, is he then saying that the
enforcement of that liability order should not be contracted
out?</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column186" />Column number: 186</div>
					<a name="07072484000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">I agree with one of the points
that the Minister has made&#151;he has made only a limited number of
points with which I agree. For example, during last Thursday&#146;s
sitting, we noted that private debt collection agencies have been used
by the CSA relatively recently and that they have already pulled in
some &#163;3 million of outstanding debt. The fear of private debt
collection agencies among non-resident parents has proven to be a
powerful tool in encouraging them to come forward, merely on the basis
of that threat. I am concerned that if we leave out the clause relating
to liability orders, it would stop the use of contracted-out
organisations for the enforcement of decisions that should properly be
taken by CMEC.</div>

Harper:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman makes two good points. I drew
up the amendment specifically to refer to collection and enforcement
powers so as not to damage any existing powers. The second reason is
that, as currently drafted, the Bill does not have any restrictions at
all on anything. The Minister may consider that my amendment goes a
little too far, but given the broad level of agreement that he has
achieved on most of the Bill, I would like him to acknowledge that this
provision&#146;s scope is far too wide and needs to be narrowed. If
he does not do that, while my amendment may not be 100 per cent.
perfect, it is an improvement on the Bill.</div>

functions relating to decision taking under the clauses to be

broader point in the hope of staving off a clause stand part

						</b> The hon. Gentleman has drawn a distinction between
decision making and enforcement. However, it will still be up to
whoever is contracted out to decide on what basis or how enforcement
action will be taken. I am not sure that it is possible to make that
distinction. CMEC might wish to enforce something and pass the case to
a collector, but once it is in the collector&#146;s hands, the method
of enforcement becomes a matter for the contracting party. I am not
sure that there is an exact distinction.</div>

						</b> The broader point I wanted to make is relevant
to that intervention. The Under-Secretary of State for Work and
Pensions, the hon. Member for Stirling, and I were members of the
Committee that discussed the Welfare Reform Act 2007, where we had a
debate about contracting out. One of the important assurances that she
offered, and I hope that her ministerial colleague will do likewise,
was to make it clear that provisions in relation to human rights and
the Human Rights Act 1998&#151;the Disability Discrimination Act 2005
is also important in this context&#151;will fully apply to any or all
agencies to which the functions are contracted out.</div>
					<a name="07072484000296"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent">I agree with the point
made by the hon. Member for Angus, but I hope that the methods that
might be used by a contracted-out agency would be restricted by the
contract that it has with CMEC and by the provisions 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column187" />Column number: 187</div>in the two pieces of legislation to which I have referred. Some of the
more unpleasant methods of collection could be seen as being carried
out on behalf of an arm of the state. That could involve a breach of an
individual&#146;s human rights, which would be a very serious
constraint, compared with the way in which some of those organisations
operate in the private sector. I hope that I have provided some
reassurance. None the less, the Minister needs to respond to the burden
of the argument, albeit that Liberal Democrats have doubts about the
framing of the
amendment.</div>

							<a name="07072484000459"></a>Mr.
Boswell:
						</b> I am grateful for that specific
assurance. Given the concern in this place about persons financed by
local authorities in private care homes not being able to access human
rights legislation, however, can the Minister specifically confirm
that, in relation to any contracted-out functions of CMEC, the
provisions of the Human Rights Act 1998 and of equalities
legislation&#151;going rather wider than disability
discrimination&#151;will be
applicable?</div>
					<a name="07072484000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07072484000460"></a>Mr.
Plaskitt:
						</b> Yes, I can. I maintain that we must equip the
commission with the key tools and abilities that it will require to
make child maintenance provision in this country a success, which is
what we all want. We must ensure that it is able to work with the
voluntary and third sector groups and with those with expertise in
managing and collecting owed money. That is why clause 8 enables
functions to be contracted out if the commission considers it
appropriate. However, the commission will retain ultimate
accountability for any functions it chooses to
delegate.</div>
					<a name="07072484000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">Sir David
Henshaw recommended that the new body should be set up essentially as a
commissioning body. We agree that we must enable the commission to
carry out its functions as effectively and efficiently as possible, as
enshrined in the Bill. That will include benefiting from the skills and
experience of external providers. Preventing the commission from
contracting out the collection and enforcement powers contained in the
Bill between clauses 19 and 28 could have a significant impact on the
extent to which it is able to operate effectively and efficiently. If
that were done, we would in effect, as I have said, be tying its hands
before it even gets going.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column188" />Column number: 188</div>
					<a name="07072484000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">I reassure hon. Members that
contracting out functions has no effect on the rights of individuals to
appeal against decisions. Individuals will retain the same right of
appeal against decisions, regardless of whether the commission or
another provider makes the day-to-day decisions. Restrictions on the
use of personal information are the same, regardless of who is doing
the work. In respect of the example that was mentioned&#151;moving to
withdraw a passport, for example, for administrative reasons&#151;the
decision is appealable in a magistrates court, and the rights of the
individual concerned are exactly the same whether that is done by the
commission or a contracted
party.</div>
					<a name="07072484000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
recognise that, in contracting out its functions, the commission will
need to ensure that providers deliver high-quality services and high
standards of decision making, including all those relevant to
enforcement. That can be achieved through careful consideration of the
contract terms and rigorous contract management. It will be for the
board of CMEC to ensure that that happens. Building the capacity and
capability to manage contracts must come before any large-scale
contracting out is undertaken, otherwise the commission would be
failing in its important, enshrined statutory duty to operate
efficiently and
effectively.</div>
					<a name="07072484000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
commission will, under the range of provisions by which it is
accountable to the Secretary of State, have a duty to report on
standards of decision making. It will also be required to publish an
annual report detailing all activities undertaken in that financial
year, including the extent to which it has relied on its power to
contract out. The Bill provides for all enforcement powers to have
intrinsic safeguards, whoever operates them. For example, only a court
can make a curfew order, whoever is carrying out the enforcement
function. I hope that I have given the hon. Gentleman the reassurances
that he seeks and that he will withdraw the
amendment.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07072484000464"></a>Andrew
Selous:
						</b> We have reached clause 9. It is an extremely
important clause, and it is very good as far as it goes. However, we
contend that it does not go nearly far enough, which is why we seek to
amend it fairly extensively. There are six amendments in this
group&#151;four tabled by the Conservatives and two by the Liberal
Democrats&#151;and I find myself in broad agreement with all
six.</div>
					<a name="07072484000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 10 would have the
effect of requiring CMEC&#146;s annual report to the Secretary of
State to report not only on the extent of contracting out by CMEC, but
on the extent of the agency arrangements covered by clause 7, which we
have just debated. We know from that clause that any relevant authority
can be used by CMEC in the course of the discharge of its functions. I
listened carefully to the debate, but I do not think that the matter
came up, so I would be grateful if the Minister gave us an idea of the
range of different relevant authorities with which CMEC might make
agency arrangements. It would also be useful to know what functions and
services are likely to be contracted out or provided by those other
relevant authorities. Does the Minister have in mind any limit on the
extent of the contracting out or agency provision of services, or is he
completely open-minded on that? Are there any areas in which he thinks
that contracting out or the use of agencies by other relevant
authorities would be particularly
appropriate?</div>
					<a name="07072484000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 11 would require CMEC to give details of each authorisation to
contract out a function, and of how successful each contractor had been
in achieving the commission&#146;s objectives. We have no objection
in principle to contracting out, as my hon. Friend the Member for
Forest of Dean said during the earlier debate, but it would be useful
to know which organisations were acting on CMEC&#146;s behalf and how
successful they were in achieving their objectives.</div>
					<a name="07072484000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is, of
course, a danger that CMEC&#146;s reputation could be damaged if its
contractors do not act with high standards. The Minister will want them
to have the highest possible standards, so hopefully that will be
written into the contract terms and there will be ongoing monitoring
and review. It is important that we receive such assurances now given
the huge issues of reputation with which the CSA is dealing. We must
now state how we want the contractors to behave, if CMEC is to avoid
having to deal with damage to its reputation in future.</div>
					<a name="07072484000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">One Parent
Families has said that there is always a risk with contracting out by a
Government organisation of the details of the contractor&#146;s
performance being 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column190" />Column number: 190</div>hidden behind the veil of commercial confidentiality. Of course, there
will always have to be some commercial confidentiality. That is the
harsh reality of the business world, but it is important that the
public interest in knowing whether public money is being spent wisely
is not overlooked. That is why CMEC must be placed under a statutory
obligation in the Bill to disclose the performance of its contractors,
at least once a
year.</div>
					<a name="07072484000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is not as though there is not a lot of history to the issue. Let us
consider the excellent report of the Public Accounts
Committee, &#147;Child Support Agency: Implementation of the Child
Support Reforms&#148;. Somewhat bafflingly, it was published the day
after the Bill&#146;s Second Reading. I, for one, found that
particularly unhelpful. I wish it had been available before that
debate. Page 11 of the report sets out the relevant financial details
of a large number of contractors. Such information has come into the
public domain in a useful way through the good offices of the Public
Accounts Committee, but I would be more reassured if the Bill required
such information to be provided annually so that CMEC has to prepare it
regularly.</div>
					<a name="07072484000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is also
important that the commission justifies its decisions regarding the
contracting out of its functions in terms of its objectives under
clause 2 rather than only on cost grounds. I hope that I have been
helpful to the Committee by explaining the rationale behind amendment
No.
11.</div>
					<a name="07072484000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07072484000465"></a>Mr.
Boswell:
						</b> Will my hon. Friend consider
the position in which there is a partial contracting out of a
particular function by CMEC, with some activity&#151;perhaps
geographically defined&#151;in the private sector, and another part
of the country covered by direct arrangements? Is it not particularly
important that at some stage, subject to the constraints that he has
already expressed, the general public should have a handle on whether
what is being run by the private sector is as efficient or superior to
the delivery and direct provision of the public
sector?</div>
					<a name="07072484000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07072484000466"></a>Andrew
Selous:
						</b> As always, I am grateful for my
hon. Friend&#146;s wise words. He is absolutely right. It is in
everyone&#146;s interest that we have a direct comparison between the
public sector and the private sector and between the arrangements in
place in different parts of the country. We are discussing the spending
of public money for important objectives and we need to have all the
information out in the public domain in as transparent and open a way
as possible. That is the overall objective of all six amendments to the
clause, which is good as far as it goes, but does not go nearly far
enough.</div>
				
					<a name="07072484000326"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.45
pm</div>
					<a name="07072484000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 9 would place a requirement on CMEC to provide detail of the nuts
and bolts of what it does day to day, rather than the current high
level overall strategic direction targets that are listed in subsection
(3)(a) to (d). Specifically, it would require CMEC to report on the
number of children who are living apart from one or both of their
parents and are eligible for child maintenance under the Child Support
Act 1991 and the proportion for whom child maintenance was paid in the
previous year. One could obviously work out the number of children who
have not received child maintenance from that information.</div>
					<a name="07072484000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
would also place a requirement on CMEC to disclose the type of
maintenance arrangements, whether voluntary or under the statutory
scheme, so 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column191" />Column number: 191</div>that we can find out whether the Minister is achieving his objective of
encouraging voluntary maintenance agreements, which is widely shared
and supported in the Committee.</div>
					<a name="07072484000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">When child maintenance has been
paid, the amendment would require CMEC to provide details of the
amount, the frequency of payment, whether it has been paid in full or
in part, and whether it has been paid on time. That requirement refers
to the total figures for the UK as a whole. We need that level of
specific detail as a minimum to be in the public domain once a year,
provided by CMEC.</div>
					<a name="07072484000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">Incidentally,
will the Minister assure the Committee that CMEC will produce quarterly
performance statistics as the CSA does now? I would be extremely
concerned if there were any diminution in the provision of those
statistics. I think that the reason why six amendments have been tabled
on clause 9 is that the CSA does not have a good reputation for its
management of data and reporting systems. Figures are sometimes
revised, put in the public domain, revised, brought back and so on. It
is incredibly important to get those systems right so that we can judge
whether progress has been made and as an aid to the CMEC board. All the
proposed additional requirements in subsection (3) would assist the
board in achieving its objectives. The public discussion and interest
that would arise from the provision of that information to the public
domain would be entirely healthy for achieving the overall
objectives.</div>
					<a name="07072484000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
Parent Families had more to say on the clause. It referred to the fact
that clause 2 shows that the primary objective is to maximise the
number of children who live apart from one or both parents for whom
effective maintenance arrangements are in place. It made the point that
if the objective is to drive the performance of the CMEC board in a
meaningful way, it will need to have regular data at its disposal to
measure how successful its interventions have been at increasing the
number of children for whom child maintenance is being
paid.</div>
					<a name="07072484000280"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is worth
reflecting on the current situation in terms of data that is put into
the public domain. Child maintenance receipt figures come mainly from
large annual surveys, such as the families and children&#146;s study
and the family resources survey, which tend to be at least a year and a
half out of date when they are published. Although they are
informative, such surveys will only identify on a retrospective basis
whether the commission&#146;s activities have worked. CMEC needs the
information on a real-time basis to find out whether a greater
proportion of children living in separated families are receiving child
maintenance as a result of its work. The intention of all the
amendments is to help CMEC to meet its overall objectives.</div>
					<a name="07072484000281"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
69 relates to debt, on which we had an extensive debate in a our
sitting on 19 July, recorded at columns 113-118 of the <i class="I">Official
Report</i>. The amendment is a slightly briefer version of amendment
No. 12. As noted in column 113, you agreed that we could press it to a
Division at the end of the debate on the amendments to clause 9,
Mr. Chope. I restate my wish to do so, because debt is such
an important concern.</div>
					<a name="07072484000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
69 highlights the importance of debt. It is worth reflecting that only
a limited amount of information about the agency&#146;s debts and its
success in recovering them finds its way into the public domain. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column192" />Column number: 192</div>Each year, the Comptroller and Auditor General reports on the
agency&#146;s client account and the total amount of debt owed, which
is broken down into &#147;collectable&#148;, &#147;possibly
collectable&#148; and &#147;probably collectable&#148; sums, as
well as into sums under the old and new schemes, and sums owed as a
result of interim maintenance assessments and full maintenance
assessments. I wonder whether, in future, there will be three columns
in which the Comptroller and Auditor General can record sums relating
to old, new and CMEC schemes. Perhaps the Minister will confirm that in
his response. The information that the Comptroller and Auditor General
puts in the public domain is useful, but is of limited help in
understanding the agency&#146;s performance and the strategy behind
it, which is why I sympathise with amendment No.
69.</div>
					<a name="07072484000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">We know that the
agency has analysed its debt book and knows the proportion of
non-resident parents owing different amounts of debt. Those figures are
broken down into bands, such as those owing less than &#163;1,000 or
those owing more than &#163;50,000. In passing, I must say that it is
pretty shocking that there are some parents with care, mainly mothers,
who are owed more than &#163;50,000 as a result of the failings of
the agency. I know that the Minister entirely shares that
sentiment.</div>
					<a name="07072484000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some
work has been contracted out to private debt collectors. The annual
report that will be made under the clause will be a useful place in
which to report the commission&#146;s strategy for pursuing debtors
in different categories and the usefulness for that purpose of private
debt collectors, compared with the commission&#146;s staff. That
information is not shared currently, but it should be. In the spirit of
transparency, and given that the Minister has talked about a clean
break and a new start, such provisions should be included in the Bill.
I therefore hope that hon. Members will support amendment No.
69 and will not resist amendment No.
12.</div>
					<a name="07072484000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Bill will give CMEC considerably more powers than the agency has to
collect child support debts. That is right, because we know from the
National Audit Office that, in June last year, the CSA&#146;s
enforcement teams were dealing with only around 8 per cent. of cases
with arrears. The Minister properly referred to the operational
improvement plan, and we all wish it the greatest success. It promises
to quadruple the number of staff devoted to debt collection and
enforcement by March 2009, and is pledging to collect an extra
&#163;213.8 million of historic debt. It is appropriate to require
that CMEC reports on the success of those operational improvement plan
measures, as well as on its plans to increase its debt recovery
targets, in light of the greater powers that it will have as a result
of the Bill. Overall, the greatest standards of accountability should
be set by the commission in reporting on the recovery of money owed to
parents with care for children, and in our view the obligations on the
commission should be made crystal
clear.</div>
					<a name="07072484000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
82 would add to clause 9(3) the
words:</div>
					<a name="07072484000314"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;details of any
complaints received and how these complaints were
handled&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07072484000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">That would be a
useful and important amendment&#151;I should have tabled it myself.
Again, I shall refer to the excellent report by the PAC, which is one
of the most powerful and influential Committees in this
House&#151;it  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column193" />Column number: 193</div>normally talks a good deal of sense&#151;and about which we often hear
a great deal in the media. Paragraph 11 on page 6 of that report, which
was published on 5 July 2007,
states:</div>
					<a name="07072484000315"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;55,000
complaints were made to the Agency in
2005-06&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07072484000288"></a><div class="hs_Para" style="text-align: justify;">The
number of complaints received will be a key indicator of public
confidence in the success of CMEC, which is why I believe that the Bill
should require the publication of those
figures.</div>
					<a name="07072484000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
13 is important because it would require the Secretary of State
to</div>
					<a name="07072484000316"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;make a motion in the
House of Commons in relation to
each...report&#148;</div>
					<a name="07072484000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
would ensure that each annual CMEC report to the Secretary of State
would be debated in the Chamber by all Members of Parliament. Given the
importance of the role that CMEC will perform and the impact that its
success or failure will have on the lives of so many children and
families, I do not think that the amendment is too much to ask. Hon.
Members should not have to apply by ballot for Adjournment debates on
CMEC which would be shuffled off to Westminster Hall. An annual debate
in the Chamber, required by statute, on a Thursday afternoon, or
whenever it can be put into the legislative programme, will help to
maintain MPs&#146; interest in, and knowledge of, these very
important child-support 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column194" />Column number: 194</div>matters. I commend amendment No. 13 to the Committee, therefore, and

we all know of the huge concerns about the way in which the CSA
